21535,air lubrication drag reduction has been proven to be a workable drag reduction technology in laboratory and for the full ship scales the bottom air layer shape and coverage are the key factors affecting the drag reduction effect which cannot be controlled well in actual sea conditions this study presents the experimental investigation on the air water mixed flow shape at the lower surface of a flat plate the air layer shapes are captured by an image system under different air flow rates and velocities four distinct air water mixed flow are classified referred to as dispersed bubble flow dbf mixture flow mf air layer flow alf and bifurcation flow bf the alf regime should be considered as the best way for the drag reduction because the air layer flow is relatively stable and the air layer coverage is large and uniform under flat plate in addition the attitude of the plate has a great influence on the air water mixed flow shape on the lower surface of the flat plate the tail trim of the plate would suppress the longitudinal diffusion of the air bubbles and the heel will shift the air water mixed shape keywords air lubrication drag reduction multiphase flow air water mixed flow 1 introduction in order to reduce the operating costs of ships and meet the energy efficiency design index proposed by international maritime organization naval architecture researchers around the world are using advanced shipbuilding and management systems are being harnessed and diverse types of energy saving devices are actively applied to ships the air lubrication system performs well in many energy saving systems mitsubishi air lubrication system mals has been developed by mitsubishi heavy industries the mals has been applied to different types of vessels and claimed that 13 power saving was obtain at a sea trial mizokami et al 2010 2011 tanaka 2011 silverstream company has developed a system to reduce the frictional resistance of a ship by injecting air into the bottom of the ship and carried out a sea test on a 40 k dwt product carrier the results shows that the amount of power saving from the air lubrication is measured to be about 4 silberschmidt et al 2016 bottom ventilated of plate bvp is an effective method that injects a layer of bubbles overlaying the bottom of the ship in liquid flows which is considered to be the mechanism study of air lubrication system bvp can result in 20 80 reduction in skin frictional drag for the area covered by bottom air layer mäkiharju et al 2012 2013 mäkiharju et al 2017 elbing et al 2008 extensive researches on bvp have been conducted in the context of understanding the application prospects of air layer drag reduction in shipping industry e g ceccio 2010 murai 2014 hashim 2015 however up to now the application of bvp in actual ship is still limited by the lack of physical understanding of the presence of different air water mixed flow shapes the connection with air flow rate and velocity conditions matveev et al 2009 mäkiharju et al 2013 the mechanism of the influence of the bottom steps on the bottom air water mixed flow shape has not been reasonably revealed in theoretical research of bvp butuzov 1966 1967 design steps as a wedge attached to the bottom and uses potential flow theory to establish the relationship between the velocity and the pressure in the air cavities upon dimensions of the cavity arranged behind steps matveev 1999 2003 2005 2007 2011 and 2012 investigate the hydrodynamic performance of high speed boat with bottom cavities based on a linearized potential flow theory for surface flows moreover he compared the results with the model tests and found that the general trend agreement well the reason for the local deviation is that the potential flow theory does not consider the influence of viscosity and turbulence in numerical research of bvp kim 2010 performs direct numerical simulations to study the mechanism of air layer drag reduction at different air injection rates in addition he also investigates the stability of air layer theoretically to find the stabilizing parameters and stability conditions for air layer drag reduction from the numerical results it is observed that the air layer with higher air injection rate was stabilized on the entire domain whereas lower air injection rate induces the instability of air layer choi 2005 2007 and 2010 utilized an unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes equation solver to study the viscous effects around the hull with a bottom air cavity the results of parametric studies over a range of hull form parameters are presented and the effects of air plenum parameters on the ship startup stability are investigated the developed numerical method is used to establish trends of the total resistance and its dependence on the froude number zverkhovskyi et al 2014 2015 investigate the wave generated behind a backward facing step under a plate base on the rans equations the computation results give detailed information on the local flow in the bottom cavity of the plate and confirm the presence of high s hear stresses behind the cavity in order to investigate the morphology characteristics of air layer in the bottom cavity of plate a numerical method with the combination of rans equations and vof model is proposed by wu et al 2019 based on the model above the dynamic and developmental process of air water mixed flow in the air cavity is studied the results show that the shape of air water mixed flow shape agrees with the froude similarity law the air water mixed flow shape in bottom cavity is directly related to the drag reduction effect of the plate an assessment of the streamlines and air distribution for a planing air cavity ship is proposed by cucinotta et al 2018a 2018b and an evaluation of the wetted and ventilated areas is conducted in order to understand the relation between the flow rate the speed of the ship and the air distribution the results can be used for modifying the ship hull geometry in order to better accommodate the air layer due to the inherent limitations of multiphase models numerical simulation studies may also produce unrealistic flow structures at the air water interface and enclosed regions matveev et al 2009 it is also difficult to capture the dynamic effects for the specific air water mixed flow such shortcomings present significant challenges for accurately capturing chamber closure behavior at the end of bottom cavity and air leakage at the air water interface a number of experimental studies of bvp have also been conducted in the towing tanks and the circulating water tunnel madavan et al 1984 1985 and merkle et al 1990 used a flat plate with bottom air injection to examine the effect of drag reduction the results show that skin friction of greater than 80 is observed and the skin friction is reduced monotonically for all air flow rate with the speed between 4 and 17 m s kumagai et al 2015 proposed a device for air lubrication drag reduction which can reduce the outlet pressure when air is injected into the bottom surface of the ship similar results have been obtained by air injection with bottom cavity kato et al 1998 produce air bubbles ejected through a single hole in a flat plate was observed in uniform flow of 2 10 m s it was confirmed that the size of the air bubbles was governed by main flow velocity and air flow rate the study by moriguchi et al 2002 shows that the bubble diameter has little influence on frictional resistance reduction ventilated and natural cavity flow over a fence immersed in a boundary layer is experimentally investigated in a cavitation tunnel by barbaca et al 2017 2018 the results show that a similar air water mixed shape was observed for ventilated and natural cavities present under the same flow conditions with the only difference observed in the wake mäkiharju et al 2017 examined the topology of air water mixed flow by injected air beneath a horizontal flat surface into a liquid cross flow jang et al 2014 checked the frictional resistance and air layer shape at various flow rates of injected air the results indicated that air lubrication with air layers might be useful in reducing the frictional resistance at specific conditions of air injection lay et al 2008 2010 conducted a series experiment on a 12 9 m long plate with bottom air injection the experimental results indicated that there is an obvious critical above which the air injected through the slot can be form a continuous air layer the air layer in the bottom cavity was shown to be stable with respect to large air flow rate and slow perturbations in water speed and pressure however the air layer shape in the bottom cavity of the plate is closely related to the parameters of the bottom cavity which is difficult to design previous studies have proved that the drag reduction of air lubrication is very effective and the area covered by air layer has a great influence on the drag reduction effect in the present study we examine air layer shape as they are formed via air injection device with rows of holes the shape of the air water mixed flow on the lower surface of the plate under different flow parameters such as free stream velocity air flow rate and attitude of the plate was observed and analyzed the organization this paper is as follows section 1 show the basic conceptual knowledge of air lubrication drag reduction the experimental model and the experimental setup is introduced in section 2 in section 3 we presents the results of air layer shape under different test parameters and section 4 presents the conclusions and discusses 2 experiment description 2 1 experimental model a flat plate was selected as the test model the dimensions of the test plate and the positions of struts in the test section are shown in fig 1 the total length of the flat plate is 1200 mm the width is 380 mm and the thickness is 10 mm it is made of plexiglas the head is processed into an oval shape and the tail is sharpened the contact angle between water and the plexiglas is about 60 in the test the air injection device is made of stainless steel and the size is 130 mm 70 mm length and width it is located on the lower surface of the flat plate and is 410 mm away from the leading edge of flat plate multiple air holes are used to ventilate the air the air holes is in the center of the air injection device the bottom of the air holes is flush with the lower surface of the plate the diameter of the air holes is 0 2 mm which is processed by laser the air injection plate is composed of 5 rows of air holes and 150 holes are evenly arranged in each row the center distance between adjacent holes is 0 8 mm and the distance between the two rows of air holes is 17 5 mm 2 2 experimental setup the test was carried out in a low turbulence water tunnel in the state key laboratory of turbulence research the rectangular test section of this tunnel has nominal dimensions of 6 0 m 0 4 m 0 4 m length height and width with four walls made of glass for flow visualization the tunnel can operate at a speed range from 0 1 m s to 1 3 m s with turbulence level is under 0 3 the schematic of the experimental setup for the bottom ventilated of plate experiments is presented in fig 2 the flat plate is installed in the center of the working section of the circulating water tunnel the depth of the plate is 0 2 m the high performance camera is used to obtain the air water mixed flow shape at the bottom of the flat plate the camera is mounted directly under the flat plate the light source is directly injected from the bottom of the water tunnel and adjusted according to the experimental conditions for the air water mixed flow images acquired from the test the image processing tool can be used to draw the grid lines and then the boundary of the air and water can be extracted so that we can obtain the distribution area of the air layer 2 3 experimental matrix table 1 show the flow conditions of the experiments in order to reveal the effect of air flow rate and velocity on the air water flow shape the fr and the non dimensional air flow rate coefficient cq is defined as follows 1 f r v g l 2 c q q v b δ where v is the inflow velocity l is the length of the plate q is the air flow rate b is the transverse width of the air injection entrance and δ is the thickness of the boundary layer of the air injection entrance at no air injection which is given by eq 3 3 δ 5 2 r e 0 5 x here re is the reynolds number of the air injection entrance which is given by eq 4 4 r e v x ν where x is the distance between the air injection and the bow of the ship model and ν is the water viscosity coefficient where ν 1 003 10 6 at normal temperature the we is defined using the length of the plate which is given by eq 5 5 w e ρ v 2 l σ where σ the surface tension of water it is equal to 7 275 10 2 in the test 3 results of air layer shape 3 1 observation of air water mixed flow shape the typical air water mixed flow shape formed by the air injection at bottom of the flat plate can be referred to fig 3 the air is vertically ejected from the air injection device and then moves backward in the direction of the incoming flow the air adheres to the lower surface of the flat plate and has lateral diffusion for the existence of buoyancy therefore two regions are formed at the bottom of the plate water region and air water mixed region and the intersection edges of the two regions are symmetric about the center line of the plate in experiments of bottom ventilated of plate four distinct air water shape are observed under different fr and cq values referred to as dispersed bubble flow dbf mixture flow mf air layer flow alf and bifurcation flow bf hereafter the classification of the four different air water shapes and bubble dynamics detailed as follows the dbf occurs at the beginning of the experiment when the bottom of the plate behind the air injection devices is filled with dispersed small bubbles and there are a lot of air bubbles gathering only in the vicinity of the air injection device which can be seen in fig 4 where far from the air injection device the number of bubbles is small and the dispersed bubbles are stretched into an ellipse along the incoming flow for dbf the shape of the trajectory formed by the movement of the outermost bubble is stable and the boundary shape is approximately parabolic when the ventilation rate increases under a constant velocity the air bubbles starts to accumulate in the air injection device consequently an air layer form near the air injection device and bubbles interact after being gathered near the air injection device some bubbles continue to move backwards while other bubbles do not move backwards to interfere with each other begin to spread laterally and destroy the original stable state the bottom air water mixture flow regime transitions from dbf to mf which can be seen in fig 5 the most obvious feature of the mf is the unstable distribution of the air water mixed flow formed at the bottom of the plate and there is significant interference fluctuation at the junction of the air layer and the air bubbles there is a lateral diffusion overflow phenomenon of the bubble increase the velocity of the flow appropriately when the air flow rate is constant the lateral diffusion of the bubbles can be reduced and the bubbles can be aggregated to form a stable alf as can be seen in fig 6 for the alf the air layer formed at the bottom of the plate is stable the contour of the air layer shape is obvious and the boundary shape of air layer is similar to secondary parabola with further increase of ventilation rate and decrease of velocity the air water two phase flow will form a bf as shown in fig 7 air bubbles and air layer are mixed with each other in the bf regime due to the mismatch between velocity and the air flow rate the air layer is formed near the air injection device position but the lateral overflow of the air layer is suppressed and the air layer shape finally forms a cross flow line only part of the air bubbles is separated from the main body of the air layer and overflows laterally besides there is no sharp interface between air bubbles and air layer and the air water mixed flow is unstable 3 2 analysis of air water mixed flow transition the air water flow regime at bottom of the plate is related to air flow rate and velocity the basic change law as follow the air water shape changes from dbf to alf with air flow rate increases when the air flow rate and velocity match not well the air water shape presents two unstable flow states mf and bf the above four different air water mixture flow shapes are investigated by varying the fr and cq fig 8 shows the distribution of different air water shape over a wide range of flow conditions in the form of a regime map as the figure shows the dbf is distributed in the bottom left corner of the map the mf next to the dbf which is filled in the narrow bands between dbf and alf the bf lies in the upper right corner the cq fr curves demarcating neighboring air water mixed regimes e g between fc and tc can be obtained using the least square fit ting of the mean values of the data points located near the border line between the two regimes accordingly as shown in fig 8 the demarcating curve for different regions is determined to be as dbf mf cq 4 853fr 1 608 mf alf cq 5 918fr 2 054 alf bf cq 4 182fr 2 212 based on the above analysis alf regime should be considered as the best way for the drag reduction because the tiny bubbles merged into large bubbles and the large bubbles were connected into a group of bubbles to form air layer so the interfacial force between the air bubble and water is changed khan et al 2020 besides the air layer flow is relatively stable and the air layer coverage is large and uniform under the flat plate that is observed in the experiment the air layer flow is the best way to reduce the resistance which has also been proved by measuring the friction resistance by mäkiharju et al 2012 2013 3 3 influence of trim and heel on air water mixed flow shape generally speaking in the navigation of ship the transverse and trim are also very common in order to evaluate the influence of the inclination of the navigation on the bottom air layer shape the air layer shape at 5 for trim and 7 5 for heel are examined in experiment fig 9 and fig 10 show the effect of pitch angle on air layer shape at the bottom of plate at different air flow rate and velocity it can be seen from figs 9 and 10 that the diffusion along the incoming flow direction is suppressed and lateral diffusion of air bubbles increases when the flat plate has a pitch angle of 5 besides the state of the air water flow at the bottom of plate can also change due to the trim of the plate and the alf changes into bf obviously in fig 10 in order to better compare the boundary profile of the air layer shape the boundaries of the air layer under different trim are extracted from figs 9 and 10 the results can be seen in fig 11 the pitch angle has a great influence on the air layer shape as follows when the plate is horizontal air bubbles can be expanded in the direction of the incoming flow but the longitudinal diffusion of the bubbles decreases with a plate pitch angle under the action of bubbles buoyancy and the lateral diffusion is enhanced so the width of the air layer increases rapidly at 0 3 m downstream from the air injection the width of the air layer increased from the 0 149 m 0 285 m which increase of 1 91 times when fr 0 158 cq 0 755 and what is more the air water flow pattern will also change fig 12 and fig 13 show the effect of heel angle on air layer shape at the bottom of plate at different air flow rate and velocity it can be seen from figs 12 and 13 that the distribution of air bubbles in the air layer becomes uneven when plate has a heel angle of 7 5 the bubbles is deflected to the side of the plate under the action of buoyancy and then some of the bubble overflows at the tail of one side of the plate but the air water flow state does not change significantly fig 14 shows the comparison of air layer profiles under different heel angle of plates it can be seen from figs 12 14 that the air layer appears as mixture flow mf when fr 0 238 cq 0 645 the heel angle has little effect on the width of air layer in this case but the shape of air layer is laterally offset when air flow rate and velocity increases the air layer appears as a bifurcation flow bf when fr 0 357 cq 0 928 the state of the air water mixed flow is not affected by the heel angle of plate but the internal structure and the width of the air water shape have changed 4 conclusion and discussion 4 1 conclusion experiments were conducted on the air water mixed flow shape formed by air injection at the lower surface of a flat plate model in a low turbulence water tunnel it can be confirmed from the experiment that air water mixed flow shape generated by air injection at bottom of the plate varied from the velocity and air flow rate accordingly the following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental analysis four distinct air water mixed flow are classified referred to as dispersed bubble flow dbf mixture flow mf air layer flow alf and bifurcation flow bf the distribution of these air water mixed shapes over cq and fr is summarized in a regime map with dbf alf and bf occupying the majority portion of the map for alf the flow of air layer is relatively stable and the coverage of air layer under plate is large and uniform which can be considered as an effective form of air lubrication drag reduction the attitude of plate has a great influence on the shape of air water mixed flow on the lower surface of plate the trail angel of plate would suppress longitudinal diffusion of air bubbles while increasing the lateral diffusion appropriately the heel of plate would shift the air water shape and even will change the shape of the air water mixed flow the heel of plate would cause the air water shape to shift laterally and change the shape of the air water mixed flow under certain condition of velocity and air flow rate 5 discussion there are some limitations in this research we believe the following points can provide inspiration for the future research the scale of current experiment is limited by equipment therefore the range of reynolds number in this experiment is relatively narrow and the experimental conditions are relatively small it is necessary to carry out large scale models in future research to study the air water mixed shape and mechanisms of the drag reduction the research in this paper only considers the shape of air water mixed flow the thickness of the air water mixed flow and the resistance change of the plate with and without air injection should also be measured for these factors would quantitatively evaluate the effect of air lubrication drag reduction credit authorship contribution statement hao wu

move backwards while other bubbles do not move backwards to interfere with each other begin to spread laterally and destroy the original stable state the bottom air water mixture flow regime transitions from dbf to mf which can be seen in fig 5 the most obvious feature of the mf is the unstable distribution of the air water mixed flow formed at the bottom of the plate and there is significant interference fluctuation at the junction of the air layer and the air bubbles there is a lateral diffusion overflow phenomenon of the bubble increase the velocity of the flow appropriately when the air flow rate is constant the lateral diffusion of the bubbles can be reduced and the bubbles can be aggregated to form a stable alf as can be seen in fig 6 for the alf the air layer formed at the bottom of the plate is stable the contour of the air layer shape is obvious and the boundary shape of air layer is similar to secondary parabola with further increase of ventilation rate and decrease of velocity the air water two phase flow will form a bf as shown in fig 7 air bubbles and air layer are mixed with each other in the bf regime due to the mismatch between velocity and the air flow rate the air layer is formed near the air injection device position but the lateral overflow of the air layer is suppressed and the air layer shape finally forms a cross flow line only part of the air bubbles is separated from the main body of the air layer and overflows laterally besides there is no sharp interface between air bubbles and air layer and the air water mixed flow is unstable 3 2 analysis of air water mixed flow transition the air water flow regime at bottom of the plate is related to air flow rate and velocity the basic change law as follow the air water shape changes from dbf to alf with air flow rate increases when the air flow rate and velocity match not well the air water shape presents two unstable flow states mf and bf the above four different air water mixture flow shapes are investigated by varying the fr and cq fig 8 shows the distribution of different air water shape over a wide range of flow conditions in the form of a regime map as the figure shows the dbf is distributed in the bottom left corner of the map the mf next to the dbf which is filled in the narrow bands between dbf and alf the bf lies in the upper right corner the cq fr curves demarcating neighboring air water mixed regimes e g between fc and tc can be obtained using the least square fit ting of the mean values of the data points located near the border line between the two regimes accordingly as shown in fig 8 the demarcating curve for different regions is determined to be as dbf mf cq 4 853fr 1 608 mf alf cq 5 918fr 2 054 alf bf cq 4 182fr 2 212 based on the above analysis alf regime should be considered as the best way for the drag reduction because the tiny bubbles merged into large bubbles and the large bubbles were connected into a group of bubbles to form air layer so the interfacial force between the air bubble and water is changed khan et al 2020 besides the air layer flow is relatively stable and the air layer coverage is large and uniform under the flat plate that is observed in the experiment the air layer flow is the best way to reduce the resistance which has also been proved by measuring the friction resistance by mäkiharju et al 2012 2013 3 3 influence of trim and heel on air water mixed flow shape generally speaking in the navigation of ship the transverse and trim are also very common in order to evaluate the influence of the inclination of the navigation on the bottom air layer shape the air layer shape at 5 for trim and 7 5 for heel are examined in experiment fig 9 and fig 10 show the effect of pitch angle on air layer shape at the bottom of plate at different air flow rate and velocity it can be seen from figs 9 and 10 that the diffusion along the incoming flow direction is suppressed and lateral diffusion of air bubbles increases when the flat plate has a pitch angle of 5 besides the state of the air water flow at the bottom of plate can also change due to the trim of the plate and the alf changes into bf obviously in fig 10 in order to better compare the boundary profile of the air layer shape the boundaries of the air layer under different trim are extracted from figs 9 and 10 the results can be seen in fig 11 the pitch angle has a great influence on the air layer shape as follows when the plate is horizontal air bubbles can be expanded in the direction of the incoming flow but the longitudinal diffusion of the bubbles decreases with a plate pitch angle under the action of bubbles buoyancy and the lateral diffusion is enhanced so the width of the air layer increases rapidly at 0 3 m downstream from the air injection the width of the air layer increased from the 0 149 m 0 285 m which increase of 1 91 times when fr 0 158 cq 0 755 and what is more the air water flow pattern will also change fig 12 and fig 13 show the effect of heel angle on air layer shape at the bottom of plate at different air flow rate and velocity it can be seen from figs 12 and 13 that the distribution of air bubbles in the air layer becomes uneven when plate has a heel angle of 7 5 the bubbles is deflected to the side of the plate under the action of buoyancy and then some of the bubble overflows at the tail of one side of the plate but the air water flow state does not change significantly fig 14 shows the comparison of air layer profiles under different heel angle of plates it can be seen from figs 12 14 that the air layer appears as mixture flow mf when fr 0 238 cq 0 645 the heel angle has little effect on the width of air layer in this case but the shape of air layer is laterally offset when air flow rate and velocity increases the air layer appears as a bifurcation flow bf when fr 0 357 cq 0 928 the state of the air water mixed flow is not affected by the heel angle of plate but the internal structure and the width of the air water shape have changed 4 conclusion and discussion 4 1 conclusion experiments were conducted on the air water mixed flow shape formed by air injection at the lower surface of a flat plate model in a low turbulence water tunnel it can be confirmed from the experiment that air water mixed flow shape generated by air injection at bottom of the plate varied from the velocity and air flow rate accordingly the following conclusions can be drawn from the experimental analysis four distinct air water mixed flow are classified referred to as dispersed bubble flow dbf mixture flow mf air layer flow alf and bifurcation flow bf the distribution of these air water mixed shapes over cq and fr is summarized in a regime map with dbf alf and bf occupying the majority portion of the map for alf the flow of air layer is relatively stable and the coverage of air layer under plate is large and uniform which can be considered as an effective form of air lubrication drag reduction the attitude of plate has a great influence on the shape of air water mixed flow on the lower surface of plate the trail angel of plate would suppress longitudinal diffusion of air bubbles while increasing the lateral diffusion appropriately the heel of plate would shift the air water shape and even will change the shape of the air water mixed flow the heel of plate would cause the air water shape to shift laterally and change the shape of the air water mixed flow under certain condition of velocity and air flow rate 5 discussion there are some limitations in this research we believe the following points can provide inspiration for the future research the scale of current experiment is limited by equipment therefore the range of reynolds number in this experiment is relatively narrow and the experimental conditions are relatively small it is necessary to carry out large scale models in future research to study the air water mixed shape and mechanisms of the drag reduction the research in this paper only considers the shape of air water mixed flow the thickness of the air water mixed flow and the resistance change of the plate with and without air injection should also be measured for these factors would quantitatively evaluate the effect of air lubrication drag reduction credit authorship contribution statement hao wu

21536,soft marine clay is subjected to long term cyclic loads such as waves or seismic loadings in marine environment numerous cyclic traixial tests have been conducted to investigate the dynamic behaviors of soft marine clay however due to the limitation of laboratory triaxial test such as end restraints caused by friction between the loading caps pedestal and the specimen a perfect cyclic triaxial test is impossible in reality in this study taking two extreme boundary conditions into consideration based on the cyclic mobility cm model an elastoplastic constitutive model and a soil water coupled finite element finite difference fe fd code named as dbleaves a series of numerical simulations on cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay are conducted the influence of those factors such as cyclic stress ratio csr loading frequency and confining pressure are also discussed in detail the results show that the cm model can describe the mechanical behavior of clay under cyclic loading accurately end restrictions have high influence on the cyclic response of clay by creating strain localization areas and extreme pore water pressure zone this paper makes clear the significant influence of boundary conditions on the cyclic triaxial test results keywords soft marine clay cyclic loads numerical simulation boundary condition effective stress path 1 introduction offshore platform and wind turbine have been widely used in marine engineering in recent years as one of the most commonly used foundation concepts a large number of pile foundations have been built on clayey seabed in marine environments in china subjected to long term cyclic loads such as waves in marine environment the mechanical behaviors of clay are associated with excess pore water pressure accumulation and strength degradation it will result in a series of safety problems such as decrease of foundation bearing capacity uneven foundation settlements and superstructure dumping which will cause severe damages to infrastructure many experimental studies were conducted on response of soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loads in the past few years li et al 2011 wang et al 2013 leng et al 2018 conducted a series of undrained dynamic cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay to investigate structure effect on soil response due to cyclic loads guo et al 2018 investigated undrained behavior of intact soft clay under cyclic paths that match vehicle loading conditions by conducting cyclic traixial tests and cyclic hca tests lei et al 2016 conducted a series of cyclic traixial

hca tests to investigate the effects of continuous principal stress rotation induced by wave loads on the cyclic response of saturated soft marine clay in wenzhou china meanwhile numerical simulation on undrained triaxial test of soft marine clay under cyclic loading were also conducted to describe the dynamic behaviors of soil under cyclic loading accurately several constitutive models were conducted nishi et al 1986 elgamal et al 2003 lópez querol and blázquez 2006 f oka a yashima 1992 oka et al 1999 proposed a constitutive model which applied the kinematic hardening rule to solve

vertical flows the weight of the soil during the consolidation process zhong et al 2014 zhong conducted a series of simulations of conventional triaxial compression test isotropic unloading test and isotropic compression test by pfc3d a particle flow code using the similar cam clay model proposed by the author stress induced anisotropy is an important factor affecting the mechanical behavior of soft soil hu et al 2010 found that anisotropy induced by cyclic loading depends on the amplitude of the loading cycles and the initial anisotropy stress induced anisotropy changes with plastic deformation especially in cyclic loading process so it is necessary to consider it as a primary factor to simulate the behavior of soil under cyclic loading zhang et al 2007 2010 2011 proposed a new elasto plastic model based on the cam clay model roscoe et al 1963 which was called cyclic mobility model it made a unified combination by the concepts of subloading hashiguchi et al 2005 superloading asaoka et al 2000 and stress induced anisotropy oda et al 1985 this new elasto plastic model associates the influence of stress induced anisotropy with the influence of soil density and soil structure in order to prove the performance of the model using the fe fd code dbleaves a soil water coupled algorithm ye et al carried out a series of numerical simulations and experimental shaking table tests on saturated sandy ground ye and ye 2016 ye et al 2007 huang et al 2018 investigated the effect of repeated train vibrations on the long term settlement of a metro tunnel in saturated clay jin et al 2010 conducted a series of systematic 2d and 3d numerical analyses to simulate the dynamic behaviors of sand subjected to cyclic loading ye et al 2012 proposed a generalized model with rotation hardening to simulate the changes in anisotropy during liquefaction in cyclic and monotonic undrained triaxial tests numerous numerical simulations of sand have proved the applicability of the cyclic mobility model but the numerical simulation on cyclic triaxial tests based on this model of clay is limited under static loading the differences between clay and sand are the rate of loss in over consolidation and the collapsing rate of the structure for sand the rate of loss in consolidation is very fast while the rate of the collapse of the structure is very slow while it s the opposite for clay asaoka 2002 in this paper numerical simulations on cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay are conducted by adopting the fe fd code dbleaves the reliability of the cyclic mobility model is verified and shows good agreement with experimental results also the effects of boundary conditions loading frequency cyclic stress ratio csr and confining pressure are discussed in detail 2 theory and numerical model 2 1 governing equations of the constitutive model the constitutive model proposed by zhang et al 2007 is based on the concepts of superloading surface subloading surface and anisotropy the description of the yield surfaces is presented in fig 1 there are two state variables to define the relationship between yield surfaces r the similarity ratio of the superloading surface to the normal yield surface and r the similarity ratio of the superloading surface to the subloading surface the definition is given as 1 r p p q q 0 r 1 a n d q p q p 2 r p p q q 0 r 1 a n d q p q p q p where p q p q and p q represent the current stress state the corresponding normally consolidated stress state and the structured stress state in the q p plane respectively the present stress state is always located on the subloading surface which is given by 3 f ln σ m σ m 0 ln m 2 ζ 2 η 2 m 2 ζ 2 ln r ln r ε v p c p 0 with 4 ζ 3 2 β i j β i j η 3 2 η ˆ i j η ˆ i j η ˆ i j η i j β

anisotropic state variable s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor η means the difference between the stress ratio tensor η i j and the anisotropic stress tensor β ij and δ i j is a kronecker function c p is a parameter expressed by the compression index λ the swelling index κ and e 0 is the reference void ratio at a reference stress σ m0 98 0 kpa this constitutive model also adopts the associated flow rule namely 5 d ε i j p λ f σ i j the compatibility equation for the subloading yield surface is then be given by 6 d f 0 f σ i j d σ i j f β i j d β i j 1 r d r 1 r d r 1 c p d ε v p 0 in this model the gradient of critical state line csl is assumed to be invariable meaning that the csl in this kind of yield surface does not change with anisotropy the anisotropic stress tensor is defined by 7 d β i j m c p b r m ζ d ε d p η ˆ i j η ˆ i j 3 2 m c p b r m ζ d ε d p η ˆ i j η where b r is a parameter which controls the developing rate of anisotropy and the plastic deviatoric strain tensor d

9 2 is for clay the changing rate of over consolidation is assumed to be controlled by two factors namely the plastic component of strain and the incremental anisotropy 10 d r u d ε i j p r η m f β i

is added into eq 11 to describe the cyclic mobility behavior of liquefied sand the reference stress σ m 0 is normally set to 98 0 kpa this can keep the u as small as possible when σ m is close to zero liquefaction point so that the large overconsolidation can help the effective stress path diverge from the liquefaction point eq 16 2 is for clay where σ m 0 is set to 1 0 kpa to avoid unnatural compression ye and ye 2016 the loading criteria are given as 17 λ 0 l o a d i n g λ 0 n e u t r a l λ 0 u n l o a d i n g the cyclic mobility mode is a kinematic hardening elastoplastic model employing an associated flow rule it uses eight parameters five parameters m n λ κ and ν which are the same as those of the cam clay model the other three parameters are a m and b r where the parameter a controls the collapse rate of the structure m controls the loss rate of over consolidation and b r controls the development rate of the stress induced anisotropy these eight parameters can be easily determined by undrained triaxial cyclic loading tests and conventional drained triaxial tests the main differences between clayey soils and sandy soils are the rate of loss in over consolidation and the collapsing rate of the structure therefore by changing the values of a and m it is possible to describe the mechanical behaviors of marine clay 2 2 finite element method of complete soil water coupling in the dynamic finite element analysis the complete soil water coupling theory based on u p equation is adopted in which the displacement increment of soild phase u and pore water pressure p are used as unknown variables the validation of the u p equation was investigated by zienkiewicz et al 1984 the governing equations are as follows 1 equilibrium equation 18 ρ u i s σ i j x j ρ b i where ρ and u s represent the density and displacement of the soil respectively u is the second derivative of the displacement u where σ i j is the effective stress tensor and b i is the volume force 2 continuity equation 19 ρ f ε i i s 2 p d x i x i γ w k ε i i s n 1 k f p d 0 where ε i i s is the volume strain of soil skeleton ρ f is the density of fluid p d is the pore water pressure γ w is the gravity of pore fluid k is the permeability coefficient k f and n are the volume compressibility of fluid and pore respectively the spatial discretization of governing equations is treated by the combination of finite element method and finite difference method fe fd the finite element method is used for the spatial discretization of the equilibrium equation while the finite difference method is used for the spatial discretization of the continuity equation namely the displacement is discretized by the finite element method while the excess pore water pressure term is discretized by the finite difference method 2 3 numerical model and boundary conditions to study the mechanical behavior of natural soft clay subjected to cyclic loading under undrained condition numerical simulations are conducted with dbleaves the program dbleaves was developed based on an effective stress based soil water coupling theory which is able to solve dynamic soil water coupling boundary value problems due to the symmetry of experimental loading conditions the finite element model adopts two dimensional model for the simplification of calculation the model is a cylinder with a diameter of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm as same as the size of triaxial specimen the finite element mesh in 2d is built with 4 node isoparametric solid elements which is shown in fig 2 for the boundary conditions to investigate the influence of the loading cap and the pedestal on the triaxial test two extreme cases are considered firstly an ideal element test referred as the free case where there is no friction between the specimen and the loading cap and the pedestal is considered the boundary condition at the bottom is assumed with roller where all nodes at vertical direction are fixed to prevent rotation of the specimen in the other situation referred as the fixed case all the nodes at the top and the bottom are fixed in all directions as for the loading conditions the cyclic loading is simulated by a sine wave applied vertically at the center of the top surface with all the nodes composing it constrained with an equal vertical displacement condition to ensure a uniform distribution the influence of cyclic stress ratios csr r c r c σ d 2 σ s σ d is the double amplitude of cyclic loading and σ s is the confining pressure are considered by varying it from 0 1 to 0 3 with the default confining pressure of 100 kpa the confining pressure are set to 100 kpa 200 kpa and 300 kpa respectively in this study 2 4 validation of numerical model in order to check the accuracy of the cyclic mobility model and determine material parameters of sample a series of laboratory tests are performed on the typical normally consolidated soft marine clay layer 4 shanghai clay material parameters and initial conditions are listed in table 1 the critical state parameter m 1 2 is selected based on triaxial shearing laboratory tests of layer 4 shanghai clay including cu cyclic undrained test and cd cyclic drained test experimental results show that the critical state parameter equals to m 1 15 for cd test and m 1 2 for cu test fig 3 therefore m 1 2 is adopted in this research to verify the applicability of this model undrained cyclic triaxial tests and corresponding simulations were conducted with the same loading conditions fig 4 shows the elemental simulations of an undisturbed sample loaded at f 0 02 hz with a cyclic stress ratio r c 0 2 using the cyclic mobility model fig 5 shows the corresponding experimental results the effective stress path strain development and excess pore water pressure epwp are displayed the comparison of the numerical and experimental results show that this model associated with dbleaves is able to describe the mechanical behavior of the clay the numerical model can simulate the behavior of factors such as stress path accumulation of strain and excess pore water pressure of clay under cyclic loading basically although there are some inconsistencies between these two results it can be seen from fig 4 that the mean effective stress almost reduced uniformly in the stress paths curve as in the result of the experiment instead of having a symmetrical decrease about the horizontal axis it is leaning detailed reasons of the inconsistencies will be discussed in section 3 meanwhile fig 6 displays the comparison between experimental results and numerical results of axial strain after cyclic triaxial test under the same loading condition it is clearly that the failure modes of clay under dynamic loading between the two results are almost the same with two distinct strain shear bands in the upper part of the specimen and a strain localization area formed at the intersection of shear bands the applicability of the constitutive model can be proved 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of end restrictions on test results generally some friction occurs between the loading caps pedestal and the specimen in laboratory triaxial test which causes restraints on lateral directions at the top and bottom of the specimen it is difficult to determine the exact amount of friction and its consequences on the results however it is possible to simulate the two extreme cases by using the present numerical method the free case which simulates an ideal test without any friction and the fixed case with nodes on the top and bottom be constrained in the lateral direction by comparing these two cases the influence of friction can be discussed it can be seen from fig 7 that for the free condition the results are the same among elements at top middle and bottom showing the soil response is uniform throughout the specimen for the fixed condition the restraints at top and bottom alters the soil response in these areas due to symmetric properties the top and bottom elements have similar response the behaviors of the top element are totally different from the center element in stress path and strain stress relationship which shows that the boundary condition has a significant influence of the test specimen the mechanical behaviors of center element under fixed condition are similar with the free specimen in stress paths and excess pore water pressure accumulation even if the strain accumulation is a bit more pronounce than the free one which can be attributed to the boundary restraint condition and the strain at top under the fixed condition shows the minimal accumulation the constraints limit the deformations strongly at the end of sample as for the pore water pressure the trends are comparable but the accumulation is faster near the caps in the fixed condition and with larger amplitude fig 7 e shows the global response of the whole specimen the stress path is plotted using the total stress of the middle layer with the pore water pressure of the bottom layer to simulate the real case of laboratory triaxial experiments during which the pore water pressure is measured at bottom the results are almost similar with the experimental results with the inclination of the stress path fig 8 illustrates the comparison between numerical and experimental results of stress path the cyclic mobility model adopted in this research is capable to predict the dynamic response of soft marine clay under cyclic loading fig 9 displays the relationship between residual pore water pressure and axial strain of experiment and two extreme conditions under same loading conditions the residual pore water pressure represents the central value of pore water pressure in each cycle comparison result shows that the results of fixed condition are closer to those of laboratory experiments it can be explained that the bottom of the sample is in contact with permeable stone with rough surface whose friction coefficient is large and the confining pressure is 100 kpa therefore the effect of end friction between the soil sample and the permeable stone is obvious the experimental results are closer to those under fixed condition fig 10 displays comparison between numerical results under fixed condition and experimental results from leng et al 2018 of residual and oscillatory pore water pressure under the same loading condition it can be seen that agreement between numerical and experimental results is good even if the stain accumulation of numerical results is a bit more pronounce than that of experimental results at the beginning this can be attributed to the limitation of the laboratory tests and there is no hysteresis of soil response in numerical simulation the cyclic mobility model adopted in this research is capable to predict the dynamic response of soft marine clay under cyclic loading fig 11 shows the distributions of epwp after dynamic loading finished in the fixed condition under the fixed condition the distributions of the pore water pressure is not uniform with extreme pore water pressure zone occurring at the upper part and lower part of the sample which means there is a tensile area especially in the upper part of the sample the low pore water pressure band forms a cross x distribution simulation results show that under cyclic loading a shear band appears in the upper part of the clay specimen and the specimen will first reach failure at the strain localization area this failure mode has been proved by the experimental results displayed in fig 6 the end restrictions induce a non uniform response of the soil specimen and create strain localization areas and boundary conditions affect the accumulation of epwp and hence the effective stress so the use of a mid plane probe hight 1982 instead of measurements made in the pedestal is essential to get more accurate results 3 2 influence of cyclic stress ratio csr on test results in this section the influence of cyclic stress ratio csr on the dynamic behaviors of clay is discussed different cyclic stress ratio of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are simulated with f 0 02 hz fig 12 shows the stress path the stress strain development and the excess pore water pressure at the center of the specimen under fixed condition from fig 11 it is clearly that as csr is reduced the mean effective stress of the specimen decreases and more cycles of loading are required for the failure of the sample when the csr is small r c 0 1 the sample does not reach failure even with enough cycles the axial strain is stable at a low level when the r c 0 3 the sample reaches failure at around 10 cycles it can be concluded that the higher the csr is the earlier the epwp reach stability with higher oscillatory pore water pressure the oscillatory pore water pressure means pore water pressure amplitude it reflects the pore water pressure characteristics of soil in a single cycle 3 3 influence of loading frequency on the test results in this part the influence of loading frequency on the test results is discussed the tests are carried in 2d under r c 0 2 and different loading frequencies ranging from 0 1 hz to 10 hz fig 13 shows the stress path the stress strain development and the excess pore water pressure at the center of the specimen under fixed condition for the first three the paths are almost similar till 60 cycles it can be noticed that as the loading rate increases the axial strain accumulates slightly slower moreover at 10 hz the sample doesn t fail even after 600 cycles and the deviatoric stress decreases dramatically after enough cycles instead of keeping a constant amplitude at high loading frequency the pore water pressure is not allowed to equilibrate through the specimen the pore water pressure combined with the inertia force of the soil will offset part of the external force and therefore the deviatoric stress will decrease same phenomenon can be observed for sand under dynamic loading with high frequency 10 hz jin et al 2010 it also can be observed that the epwp exceeds the confining pressure in the end at the loading frequency of 10 hz to better understand the effect of loading rate on the response of clay cyclic strength curves of specimen under fixed condition are shown in fig 14 various csrs are applied for three different frequencies with a failure criterion of 10 double amplitude peak to peak axial strain is chosen for a high loading amplitude the frequency has less impact on the response of clay however as the loading amplitude decreases the effect increases exponentially for a smaller csr a faster loading requires more cycles for sample to reach failure fig 15 shows the distribution of epwp for different loading rates under fixed conditions for r c 0 1 at low frequency of 0 01 hz the distribution is almost uniform through the specimen but when the loading rate increases it becomes more uneven a higher frequency amplifies the uniformity due to the end effects which also proved necessity to use a mid plane probe to get more accurate results in a real triaxial test under high frequency hight 1982 moreover it can be seen from the comparison between figs 11 and 15 that under high csr r c 0 3 the epwp at bottom and top is greater than that in the middle due to the end restriction while the distribution of epwp is totally opposite when r c 0 1 this phenomenon happens as boundary conditions have less influence on the behavior of sample under low csr in comparison to loading frequency in this condition in other words higher csr can amplify the influence of boundary conditions 3 4 influence of confining pressure on the test results in this section the influence of confining pressure on the mechanical behaviors of clay is discussed the simulation is carried out with f 0 02 hz r c 0 3 at different confining pressure of 100 kpa 200 kpa and 300 kpa fig 16 shows the stress path the stress strain development and the excess pore water pressure at the center of the specimen under fixed condition from fig 16 it is clearly that under smaller confining pressure the mean effective stress decreases faster and less cycles are needed for sample to reach failure although the stress paths are similar fig 17 shows the distribution of axial strain of the specimen immediately after the competition of dynamic loading at different confining pressure it can be seen from fig 17 the larger the confining pressure the more uniform the deformation of the specimen will be when the confining pressure is small σ s 100 kpa the distribution of axial strain of the specimen becomes more uneven and shear bands appear 4 conclusions in this paper considering two extreme boundary conditions and based on the cyclic mobility model an elastoplastic constitutive model and a soil water coupled finite element finite difference fe fd code named as dbleaves a series of numerical simulations on cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay are conducted the results proved the capability of this model to describe the dynamic behaviours of clay subjected to cyclic loading the main conclusions can be drawn 1 the effects of end restrictions at top and bottom of the specimen on the cyclic mechanical behaviours of soft marine clay are significant end restrictions create unevenness and induce a non uniform mechanical behavior of clay by creating strain localization areas and extreme pore water pressure zone also the boundary conditions affect the accumulation of epwp along with the effective stress path this could justify the use of the mid plane probe to get more accurate results in a real triaxial test what s more the numerical results under fixed condition are closer to those of laboratory experiments 2 for small csr the decrease in mean effective stress of the specimen is slow also more cycles are required for the sample to reach failure and the axial strain are small similarly for high csr the epwp reaches stability rapidly and the oscillatory pore water pressure are high also the influence of boundary conditions is amplified 3 at high loading frequency the pore water pressure combined with the inertia force of the soil will offset part of the external force due to which deviatoric stress will decrease similarly at high loading amplitude the loading frequency has a marginal influence on the test results however when csr drops the impact of loading frequency increases significantly for a small csr a faster loading needs more cycles to reach failure moreover the loading rate has influence on the non uniform response of clay under the fixed condition for the faster loading rate the distribution of epwp is more uneven 4 for the lower confining pressure there is rapid decrease in the mean effective stress and the sample reach failure faster on the other hand confining pressure also has influence on the non uniform deformation of clay under the end fixed condition with the increase of confining pressure the deformation of the sample becomes more uniform credit authorship contribution statement hao cai writing original draft qi zhang

21536,soft marine clay is subjected to long term cyclic loads such as waves or seismic loadings in marine environment numerous cyclic traixial tests have been conducted to investigate the dynamic behaviors of soft marine clay however due to the limitation of laboratory triaxial test such as end restraints caused by friction between the loading caps pedestal and the specimen a perfect cyclic triaxial test is impossible in reality in this study taking two extreme boundary conditions into consideration based on the cyclic mobility cm model an elastoplastic constitutive model and a soil water coupled finite element finite difference fe fd code named as dbleaves a series of numerical simulations on cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay are conducted the influence of those factors such as cyclic stress ratio csr loading frequency and confining pressure are also discussed in detail the results show that the cm model can describe the mechanical behavior of clay under cyclic loading accurately end restrictions have high influence on the cyclic response of clay by creating strain localization areas and extreme pore water pressure zone this paper makes clear the significant influence of boundary conditions on the cyclic triaxial test results keywords soft marine clay cyclic loads numerical simulation boundary condition effective stress path 1 introduction offshore platform and wind turbine have been widely used in marine engineering in recent years as one of the most commonly used foundation concepts a large number of pile foundations have been built on clayey seabed in marine environments in china subjected to long term cyclic loads such as waves in marine environment the mechanical behaviors of clay are associated with excess pore water pressure accumulation and strength degradation it will result in a series of safety problems such as decrease of foundation bearing capacity uneven foundation settlements and superstructure dumping which will cause severe damages to infrastructure many experimental studies were conducted on response of soft marine clay subjected to cyclic loads in the past few years li et al 2011 wang et al 2013 leng et al 2018 conducted a series of undrained dynamic cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay to investigate structure effect on soil response due to cyclic loads guo et al 2018 investigated undrained behavior of intact soft clay under cyclic paths that match vehicle loading conditions by conducting cyclic traixial tests and cyclic hca tests lei et al 2016 conducted a series of cyclic traixial tests to investigate the effects of frequency and cyclic stress ratio csr on the dynamic deformation and cyclic degradation of ultrasoft soil from tianjin china wang et al 2017 carried out a series of hca tests to investigate the effects of continuous principal stress rotation induced by wave loads on the cyclic response of saturated soft marine clay in wenzhou china meanwhile numerical simulation on undrained triaxial test of soft marine clay under cyclic loading were also conducted to describe the dynamic behaviors of soil under cyclic loading accurately several constitutive models were conducted nishi et al 1986 elgamal et al 2003 lópez querol and blázquez 2006 f oka a yashima 1992 oka et al 1999 proposed a constitutive model which applied the kinematic hardening rule to solve

vertical flows the weight of the soil during the consolidation process zhong et al 2014 zhong conducted a series of simulations of conventional triaxial compression test isotropic unloading test and isotropic compression test by pfc3d a particle flow code using the similar cam clay model proposed by the author stress induced anisotropy is an important factor affecting the mechanical behavior of soft soil hu et al 2010 found that anisotropy induced by cyclic loading depends on the amplitude of the loading cycles and the initial anisotropy stress induced anisotropy changes with plastic deformation especially in cyclic loading process so it is necessary to consider it as a primary factor to simulate the behavior of soil under cyclic loading zhang et al 2007 2010 2011 proposed a new elasto plastic model based on the cam clay model roscoe et al 1963 which was called cyclic mobility model it made a unified combination by the concepts of subloading hashiguchi et al 2005 superloading asaoka et al 2000 and stress induced anisotropy oda et al 1985 this new elasto plastic model associates the influence of stress induced anisotropy with the influence of soil density and soil structure in order to prove the performance of the model using the fe fd code dbleaves a soil water coupled algorithm ye et al carried out a series of numerical simulations and experimental shaking table tests on saturated sandy ground ye and ye 2016 ye et al 2007 huang et al 2018 investigated the effect of repeated train vibrations on the long term settlement of a metro tunnel in saturated clay jin et al 2010 conducted a series of systematic 2d and 3d numerical analyses to simulate the dynamic behaviors of sand subjected to cyclic loading ye et al 2012 proposed a generalized model with rotation hardening to simulate the changes in anisotropy during liquefaction in cyclic and monotonic undrained triaxial tests numerous numerical simulations of sand have proved the applicability of the cyclic mobility model but the numerical simulation on cyclic triaxial tests based on this model of clay is limited under static loading the differences between clay and sand are the rate of loss in over consolidation and the collapsing rate of the structure for sand the rate of loss in consolidation is very fast while the rate of the collapse of the structure is very slow while it s the opposite for clay asaoka 2002 in this paper numerical simulations on cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay are conducted by adopting the fe fd code dbleaves the reliability of the cyclic mobility model is verified and shows good agreement with experimental results also the effects of boundary conditions loading frequency cyclic stress ratio csr and confining pressure are discussed in detail 2 theory and numerical model 2 1 governing equations of the constitutive model the constitutive model proposed by zhang et al 2007 is based on the concepts of superloading surface subloading surface and anisotropy the description of the yield surfaces is presented in fig 1 there are two state variables to define the relationship between yield surfaces r the similarity ratio of the superloading surface to the normal yield surface and r the similarity ratio of the superloading surface to the subloading surface the definition is given as 1 r p p q q 0 r 1 a n d q p q p 2 r p p q q 0 r 1 a n d q p q p q p where p q p q and p q represent the current stress state the corresponding normally consolidated stress state and the structured stress state in the q p plane respectively the present stress state is always located on the subloading surface which is given by 3 f ln σ m σ m 0 ln m 2 ζ 2 η 2 m 2 ζ 2 ln r ln r ε v p c p 0 with 4 ζ 3 2 β i j β i j η 3 2 η ˆ i j η ˆ i j η ˆ i j η i j β

anisotropic state variable s i j is the deviatoric stress tensor η means the difference between the stress ratio tensor η i j and the anisotropic stress tensor β ij and δ i j is a kronecker function c p is a parameter expressed by the compression index λ the swelling index κ and e 0 is the reference void ratio at a reference stress σ m0 98 0 kpa this constitutive model also adopts the associated

model the gradient of critical state line csl is assumed to be invariable meaning that the csl in this kind of yield surface does not change with anisotropy the anisotropic stress tensor is defined by 7 d β i j m c p b r m ζ d ε d p η ˆ i j η ˆ i j 3 2 m c p b r m ζ d ε d p η ˆ i j η where b r is a parameter which controls the developing rate of anisotropy and the plastic deviatoric strain tensor d

9 2 is for clay the changing rate of over consolidation is assumed to be controlled by two factors namely the plastic component of strain and the incremental anisotropy 10 d r u d ε i j p r η m f β i

is added into eq 11 to describe the cyclic mobility behavior of liquefied sand the reference stress σ m 0 is normally set to 98 0 kpa this can keep the u as small as possible when σ m is close to zero liquefaction point so that the large overconsolidation can help the effective stress path diverge from the liquefaction point eq 16 2 is for clay where σ m 0 is set to 1 0 kpa to avoid unnatural compression ye and ye 2016 the loading criteria are given as 17 λ 0 l o a d i n g λ 0 n e u t r a l λ 0 u n l o a d i n g the cyclic mobility mode is a kinematic hardening elastoplastic model employing an associated flow rule it uses eight parameters five parameters m n λ κ and ν which are the same as those of the cam clay model the other three parameters are a m and b r where the parameter a controls the collapse rate of the structure m controls the loss rate of over consolidation and b r controls the development rate of the stress induced anisotropy these eight parameters can be easily determined by undrained triaxial cyclic loading tests and conventional drained triaxial tests the main differences between clayey soils and sandy soils are the rate of loss in over consolidation and the collapsing rate of the structure therefore by changing the values of a and m it is possible to describe the mechanical behaviors of marine clay 2 2 finite element method of complete soil water coupling in the dynamic finite element analysis the complete soil water coupling theory based on u p equation is adopted in which the displacement increment of soild phase u and pore water pressure p are used as unknown variables the validation of the u p equation was investigated by zienkiewicz et al 1984 the governing equations are as follows 1 equilibrium equation 18 ρ u i s σ i j x j ρ b i where ρ and u s represent the density and displacement of the soil respectively u is the second derivative of the displacement u where σ i j is the effective stress tensor and b i is the volume force 2 continuity equation 19 ρ f ε i i s 2 p d x i x i γ w k ε i i s n 1 k f p d 0 where ε i i s is the volume strain of soil skeleton ρ f is the density of fluid p d is the pore water pressure γ w is the gravity of pore fluid k is the permeability coefficient k f and n are the volume compressibility of fluid and pore respectively the spatial discretization of governing equations is treated by the combination of finite element method and finite difference method fe fd the finite element method is used for the spatial discretization of the equilibrium equation while the finite difference method is used for the spatial discretization of the continuity equation namely the displacement is discretized by the finite element method while the excess pore water pressure term is discretized by the finite difference method 2 3 numerical model and boundary conditions to study the mechanical behavior of natural soft clay subjected to cyclic loading under undrained condition numerical simulations are conducted with dbleaves the program dbleaves was developed based on an effective stress based soil water coupling theory which is able to solve dynamic soil water coupling boundary value problems due to the symmetry of experimental loading conditions the finite element model adopts two dimensional model for the simplification of calculation the model is a cylinder with a diameter of 5 cm and a height of 10 cm as same as the size of triaxial specimen the finite element mesh in 2d is built with 4 node isoparametric solid elements which is shown in fig 2 for the boundary conditions to investigate the influence of the loading cap and the pedestal on the triaxial test two extreme cases are considered firstly an ideal element test referred as the free case where there is no friction between the specimen and the loading cap and the pedestal is considered the boundary condition at the bottom is assumed with roller where all nodes at vertical direction are fixed to prevent rotation of the specimen in the other situation referred as the fixed case all the nodes at the top and the bottom are fixed in all directions as for the loading conditions the cyclic loading is simulated by a sine wave applied vertically at the center of the top surface with all the nodes composing it constrained with an equal vertical displacement condition to ensure a uniform distribution the influence of cyclic stress ratios csr r c r c σ d 2 σ s σ d is the double amplitude of cyclic loading and σ s is the confining pressure are considered by varying it from 0 1 to 0 3 with the default confining pressure of 100 kpa the confining pressure are set to 100 kpa 200 kpa and 300 kpa respectively in this study 2 4 validation of numerical model in order to check the accuracy of the cyclic mobility model and determine material parameters of sample a series of laboratory tests are performed on the typical normally consolidated soft marine clay layer 4 shanghai clay material parameters and initial conditions are listed in table 1 the critical state parameter m 1 2 is selected based on triaxial shearing laboratory tests of layer 4 shanghai clay including cu cyclic undrained test and cd cyclic drained test experimental results show that the critical state parameter equals to m 1 15 for cd test and m 1 2 for cu test fig 3 therefore m 1 2 is adopted in this research to verify the applicability of this model undrained cyclic triaxial tests and corresponding simulations were conducted with the same loading conditions fig 4 shows the elemental simulations of an undisturbed sample loaded at f 0 02 hz with a cyclic stress ratio r c 0 2 using the cyclic mobility model fig 5 shows the corresponding experimental results the effective stress path strain development and excess pore water pressure epwp are displayed the comparison of the numerical and experimental results show that this model associated with dbleaves is able to describe the mechanical behavior of the clay the numerical model can simulate the behavior of factors such as stress path accumulation of strain and excess pore water pressure of clay under cyclic loading basically although there are some inconsistencies between these two results it can be seen from fig 4 that the mean effective stress almost reduced uniformly in the stress paths curve as in the result of the experiment instead of having a symmetrical decrease about the horizontal axis it is leaning detailed reasons of the inconsistencies will be discussed in section 3 meanwhile fig 6 displays the comparison between experimental results and numerical results of axial strain after cyclic triaxial test under the same loading condition it is clearly that the failure modes of clay under dynamic loading between the two results are almost the same with two distinct strain shear bands in the upper part of the specimen and a strain localization area formed at the intersection of shear bands the applicability of the constitutive model can be proved 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of end restrictions on test results generally some friction occurs between the loading caps pedestal and the specimen in laboratory triaxial test which causes restraints on lateral directions at the top and bottom of the specimen it is difficult to determine the exact amount of friction and its consequences on the results however it is possible to simulate the two extreme cases by using the present numerical method the free case which simulates an ideal test without any friction and the fixed case with nodes on the top and bottom be constrained in the lateral direction by comparing these two cases the influence of friction can be discussed it can be seen from fig 7 that for the free condition the results are the same among elements at top middle and bottom showing the soil response is uniform throughout the specimen for the fixed condition the restraints at top and bottom alters the soil response in these areas due to symmetric properties the top and bottom elements have similar response the behaviors of the top element are totally different from the center element in stress path and strain stress relationship which shows that the boundary condition has a significant influence of the test specimen the mechanical behaviors of center element under fixed condition are similar with the free specimen in stress paths and excess pore water pressure accumulation even if the strain accumulation is a bit more pronounce than the free one which can be attributed to the boundary restraint condition and the strain at top under the fixed condition shows the minimal accumulation the constraints limit the deformations strongly at the end of sample as for the pore water pressure the trends are comparable but the accumulation is faster near the caps in the fixed condition and with larger amplitude fig 7 e shows the global response of the whole specimen the stress path is plotted using the total stress of the middle layer with the pore water pressure of the bottom layer to simulate the real case of laboratory triaxial experiments during which the pore water pressure is measured at bottom the results are almost similar with the experimental results with the inclination of the stress path fig 8 illustrates the comparison between numerical and experimental results of stress path the cyclic mobility model adopted in this research is capable to predict the dynamic response of soft marine clay under cyclic loading fig 9 displays the relationship between residual pore water pressure and axial strain of experiment and two extreme conditions under same loading conditions the residual pore water pressure represents the central value of pore water pressure in each cycle comparison result shows that the results of fixed condition are closer to those of laboratory experiments it can be explained that the bottom of the sample is in contact with permeable stone with rough surface whose friction coefficient is large and the confining pressure is 100 kpa therefore the effect of end friction between the soil sample and the permeable stone is obvious the experimental results are closer to those under fixed condition fig 10 displays comparison between numerical results under fixed condition and experimental results from leng et al 2018 of residual and oscillatory pore water pressure under the same loading condition it can be seen that agreement between numerical and experimental results is good even if the stain accumulation of numerical results is a bit more pronounce than that of experimental results at the beginning this can be attributed to the limitation of the laboratory tests and there is no hysteresis of soil response in numerical simulation the cyclic mobility model adopted in this research is capable to predict the dynamic response of soft marine clay under cyclic loading fig 11 shows the distributions of epwp after dynamic loading finished in the fixed condition under the fixed condition the distributions of the pore water pressure is not uniform with extreme pore water pressure zone occurring at the upper part and lower part of the sample which means there is a tensile area especially in the upper part of the sample the low pore water pressure band forms a cross x distribution simulation results show that under cyclic loading a shear band appears in the upper part of the clay specimen and the specimen will first reach failure at the strain localization area this failure mode has been proved by the experimental results displayed in fig 6 the end restrictions induce a non uniform response of the soil specimen and create strain localization areas and boundary conditions affect the accumulation of epwp and hence the effective stress so the use of a mid plane probe hight 1982 instead of measurements made in the pedestal is essential to get more accurate results 3 2 influence of cyclic stress ratio csr on test results in this section the influence of cyclic stress ratio csr on the dynamic behaviors of clay is discussed different cyclic stress ratio of 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 are simulated with f 0 02 hz fig 12 shows the stress path the stress strain development and the excess pore water pressure at the center of the specimen under fixed condition from fig 11 it is clearly that as csr is reduced the mean effective stress of the specimen decreases and more cycles of loading are required for the failure of the sample when the csr is small r c 0 1 the sample does not reach failure even with enough cycles the axial strain is stable at a low level when the r c 0 3 the sample reaches failure at around 10 cycles it can be concluded that the higher the csr is the earlier the epwp reach stability with higher oscillatory pore water pressure the oscillatory pore water pressure means pore water pressure amplitude it reflects the pore water pressure characteristics of soil in a single cycle 3 3 influence of loading frequency on the test results in this part the influence of loading frequency on the test results is discussed the tests are carried in 2d under r c 0 2 and different loading frequencies ranging from 0 1 hz to 10 hz fig 13 shows the stress path the stress strain development and the excess pore water pressure at the center of the specimen under fixed condition for the first three the paths are almost similar till 60 cycles it can be noticed that as the loading rate increases the axial strain accumulates slightly slower moreover at 10 hz the sample doesn t fail even after 600 cycles and the deviatoric stress decreases dramatically after enough cycles instead of keeping a constant amplitude at high loading frequency the pore water pressure is not allowed to equilibrate through the specimen the pore water pressure combined with the inertia force of the soil will offset part of the external force and therefore the deviatoric stress will decrease same phenomenon can be observed for sand under dynamic loading with high frequency 10 hz jin et al 2010 it also can be observed that the epwp exceeds the confining pressure in the end at the loading frequency of 10 hz to better understand the effect of loading rate on the response of clay cyclic strength curves of specimen under fixed condition are shown in fig 14 various csrs are applied for three different frequencies with a failure criterion of 10 double amplitude peak to peak axial strain is chosen for a high loading amplitude the frequency has less impact on the response of clay however as the loading amplitude decreases the effect increases exponentially for a smaller csr a faster loading requires more cycles for sample to reach failure fig 15 shows the distribution of epwp for different loading rates under fixed conditions for r c 0 1 at low frequency of 0 01 hz the distribution is almost uniform through the specimen but when the loading rate increases it becomes more uneven a higher frequency amplifies the uniformity due to the end effects which also proved necessity to use a mid plane probe to get more accurate results in a real triaxial test under high frequency hight 1982 moreover it can be seen from the comparison between figs 11 and 15 that under high csr r c 0 3 the epwp at bottom and top is greater than that in the middle due to the end restriction while the distribution of epwp is totally opposite when r c 0 1 this phenomenon happens as boundary conditions have less influence on the behavior of sample under low csr in comparison to loading frequency in this condition in other words higher csr can amplify the influence of boundary conditions 3 4 influence of confining pressure on the test results in this section the influence of confining pressure on the mechanical behaviors of clay is discussed the simulation is carried out with f 0 02 hz r c 0 3 at different confining pressure of 100 kpa 200 kpa and 300 kpa fig 16 shows the stress path the stress strain development and the excess pore water pressure at the center of the specimen under fixed condition from fig 16 it is clearly that under smaller confining pressure the mean effective stress decreases faster and less cycles are needed for sample to reach failure although the stress paths are similar fig 17 shows the distribution of axial strain of the specimen immediately after the competition of dynamic loading at different confining pressure it can be seen from fig 17 the larger the confining pressure the more uniform the deformation of the specimen will be when the confining pressure is small σ s 100 kpa the distribution of axial strain of the specimen becomes more uneven and shear bands appear 4 conclusions in this paper considering two extreme boundary conditions and based on the cyclic mobility model an elastoplastic constitutive model and a soil water coupled finite element finite difference fe fd code named as dbleaves a series of numerical simulations on cyclic triaxial tests of soft marine clay are conducted the results proved the capability of this model to describe the dynamic behaviours of clay subjected to cyclic loading the main conclusions can be drawn 1 the effects of end restrictions at top and bottom of the specimen on the cyclic mechanical behaviours of soft marine clay are significant end restrictions create unevenness and induce a non uniform mechanical behavior of clay by creating strain localization areas and extreme pore water pressure zone also the boundary conditions affect the accumulation of epwp along with the effective stress path this could justify the use of the mid plane probe to get more accurate results in a real triaxial test what s more the numerical results under fixed condition are closer to those of laboratory experiments 2 for small csr the decrease in mean effective stress of the specimen is slow also more cycles are required for the sample to reach failure and the axial strain are small similarly for high csr the epwp reaches stability rapidly and the oscillatory pore water pressure are high also the influence of boundary conditions is amplified 3 at high loading frequency the pore water pressure combined with the inertia force of the soil will offset part of the external force due to which deviatoric stress will decrease similarly at high loading amplitude the loading frequency has a marginal influence on the test results however when csr drops the impact of loading frequency increases significantly for a small csr a faster loading needs more cycles to reach failure moreover the loading rate has influence on the non uniform response of clay under the fixed condition for the faster loading rate the distribution of epwp is more uneven 4 for the lower confining pressure there is rapid decrease in the mean effective stress and the sample reach failure faster on the other hand confining pressure also has influence on the non uniform deformation of clay under the end fixed condition with the increase of confining pressure the deformation of the sample becomes more uniform credit authorship contribution statement hao cai writing original draft qi zhang

21537,the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of curved and vertical front face pile supported breakwaters are evaluated in this paper two curved profiles viz galveston wall shape gs and circular cum parabola shape cps are adopted as the seaward face for pile supported breakwaters designated as gs psb cps psb respectively a comparison of the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of the said two types with a vertical face type vw psb is carried out experimental investigations on the three models were carried out in a wave flume under the action of regular harmonic waves wave energy transmission past the gs psb and cps psb models were found to be lesser than that past the vw psb the reflection of incident wave energy was found to be the least for cps psb followed by gs psb and vw psb the energy dissipation was observed to be a maximum for cps psb moderate in gs psb whereas the minimum was experienced by the vw psb the dynamic pressures induced by long waves are observed to be more for cps psb and gs psb than those exerted on the vw psb model the run up on the gs psb and cps psb models are compared and a qualitative assessment of overtopping is reported keywords pile

s pile spacing in transverse direction z elevation from still water level 1 introduction rubble mound breakwaters have been widely adopted worldwide for the formation of artificial harbours due to an ever increasing maritime trade there has been a drastic increase in the size of vessels being handled in such a case if conventional breakwaters are adopted it leaves a large foot print over the seafloor hence researchers have been looking for alternatives that have gained momentum pile supported breakwaters are preferred for deeper waters beyond 15 m as they are more rigid than floating units to attenuate the incident wave energy and to provide reasonable tranquillity for berthing of vessels on their lee side earlier studies were confined to pile breakwaters i e closely spaced piles being used as breakwaters the power transmission theory of weigel 1961 was reported to under predict transmission by about 25 hayashi et al 1966 truitt and herbich 1986 carried out experimental investigations on a single row pile breakwater and concluded that the relative pile spacing is the one that affects the wave transmission more than any other parameter weele and herbich 1972 through their experimental studies on pile array combinations reported that staggering the piles resulted in a reduction in the wave transmission herbich and douglas 1988 concluded that an additional row of piles reduced wave transmission by 5 15 however spacing the piles closely may not always be possible due to practical site constraints whereas in the case of pile supported breakwaters different structural forms are supported on piles to dissipate the incident wave energy and piles are mainly to support the super structure hence its application in the ocean waters is more relevant in deeper waters wherein the wave energy is mostly concentrated nearer to the free surface partially immersed vertical barriers such as twin vertical barriers have been investigated by neelamani and vedagiri 2002 and t type breakwaters studied by neelamani and rajendran 2002 were found suitable for deep water application laju et al 2011 carried out numerical and experimental studies on a double row skirt breakwater and found that the depth of submergence played a major role in the dissipation of incident wave energy rageh and koraim 2010 through experiments reported that the wave transmission could be reduced by providing horizontal slots below the partially immersed vertical barriers rageh et al 2009 carried out experimental studies on partially immersed caisson type pile supported breakwater and the transmission co efficient kt was brought less than 0 25 for a relative draft greater than 0 1 the barrier should be designed to facilitate maximum extent of incident wave energy dissipation the process of dissipation is governed by the relative draft relative width and the shape of the seaward surface the front face should facilitate minimum reflection and thus reducing the forces on the structure researchers in the past have reported on the hydrodynamic characteristics of curved seaward profiles sundar and subbarao 2002 for a quadrant front face pile supported breakwater concluded the wave reflection kr in the range of 0 25 0 85 wang et al 2016 found that arc plates mounted on piles resulted in lesser wave transmission and reflection than horizontal plates mounted on piles anand et al 2011 compared the hydrodynamic characteristics of seawall profiles and found the reflection to be least for circular cum parabola shape cps followed by galveston wall shape gs the circular cum parabola shape cps mentioned in the patent of weber 1934 consists of a smooth parabola to gently guide the incoming waves to the quadrant circle at the top that redirects the waves back to the seaside the galveston wall shape gs consisting of two radii of curvature has been earlier adopted as a seawall at galveston texas usa these curved seawall profiles are adopted as the front face for a super structure of a pile supported breakwater in the present study a comparison of these profiles with a conventional vertical wall type caisson supported on piles is the basis for the present study 2 model details a rigid steel pile supported frame was fabricated on which the topsides consisting of different front shapes were fixed two such identical frames were made to enable simultaneous testing of the models in the wave flume the topside curved profiles viz gs cps were made of rigid acrylic sheets whereas the vw is made of steel since piles were used mainly to support the different forms of the super structure considered herein they were spaced at a relative spacing s d 7 hence the attenuation of incident wave energy due to the piles was marginal a model scale of 1 25 was adopted for the study the cross sectional view of the pile supported breakwater psb models is projected in fig 1 the details of the pile supported frame and topside profiles are shown in fig 2 3 experimental investigation 3 1 test setup experiments were carried out in a wave flume of size 72 5 m 2 m x 2 7 m at iit madras chennai india the 2 m wide flume was divided longitudinally into two using stiffened galvanized iron sheets as partition wall further the sheets were supported from the flume wall using 21 mm ø x 2 mm thick steel tubular sections spaced at regular intervals at top and bottom without obstructing the wave motion the gs psb and cps psb models were tested simultaneously in the flume the vw psb model was tested subsequently a view of the three models in the wave flume is shown in fig 3 a wave probe positioned at a distance of 5 m from the wave maker registered the incident wave time history two wave probes positioned in front of each model based on the spacing criteria mentioned by goda and suzuki 1976 registered the composite wave elevations comprising of both incident and reflected waves the composite wave elevation was later decomposed to obtain the reflected wave component the wave transmission past the breakwater models was recorded by wave probes at 3 m on the leeside of the model submersible diaphragm type pressure sensors of 0 2 bar and 0 5 bar range were fixed on the front face the models to record the wave induced pressures five pressure sensors were rigidly fixed on the seaward face of the topside of the each of the three models the spacing between the pressure sensors was 80 mm measured centre to centre in vertical direction for all the models as shown in fig 4 one pressure sensor was located at z d 0 i e at still water level swl pressure sensors were located below the s w l at z d 0 08 and 0 17 two pressure sensors positioned above the swl at z d 0 08 and 0 17 measured the intermittent pressures due to wave run up the wave induced run up for the curved profiles alone was measured in the experiments for comparison and a qualitative assessment of overtopping was made for applicable cases the probes for which consisted of two parallel stainless steel wires of 1 mm diameter spaced at 10 mm and fixed on the front face of the curved profiles gs psb and cps psb the test set up is shown in fig 5 the calibration of the wave probes pressure sensors and run up meters were carried out and also checked for repeatability the calibration for the run up probes on the curved profiles was non linear for which the polynomial equations were used to convert the voltages to run up physical units the data from all the sensors were recorded simultaneously with a frequency of 50 hz and for duration of 110 s considering the large time taken for the shorter waves to reach the test section the experiments were done in water depths d of 0 87 m and 0 95 m as the trend in the variation of results for both the depths were found similar only that pertaining to the larger depth of 0 95 m corresponding to h d of 0 26 alone are presented herein however to obtain the regression equations for the dimensionless coefficients kt kr and ru hi results of both the water depths are considered the models were subjected to regular waves of period from 1s to 2 6 s in steps of 0 2 s two wave heights of about 0 1 m and 0 15 m were employed for each of the wave period the said variation resulted in a d l range of 0 13 0 6 3 2 dimensional analysis a dimensional analysis was performed and the parameters affecting the hydrodynamic performance of the pile supported breakwater were obtained such as d l b l and h d pressures and run up are indicated in non dimensional form as psh γhi and ru hi respectively to account for the scale effects 4 results and discussion 4 1 typical time histories typical measured time series of wave elevations run up and dynamic pressures for the cps psb model are shown in fig 6 4 2 wave transmission the variations of the transmission coefficient kt i e ht hi with the relative water depth d l and relative breakwater width b l for the gs psb psb psb and vw psb models are presented in fig 7 a b and 7c respectively the range of kt for cps psb gs psb and vw psb is found to be 0 04 to 0 53 0 05 to 0 62 for and 0 03 to 0 72 respectively the kt is found to decrease with an increase in d l which is obvious as the longer waves propagate past the structure without much attenuation the reduction in the kt for gs psb and cps psb is found to be quite drastic for d l 0 20 beyond which the reduction is found to be gradual for the vw psb model the above stated variation in kt is found to be gradual the results clearly indicate that the cps psb model exhibits least kt and differ from that of gs psb model marginally the kt experienced by the vw psb model is found to be the highest with its deviation found to increase as d l decreases for long waves kt for cps psb is lower than gs psb which in turn is lower than vw psb model a closer examination of the results on superposition reveals that kt is less than 0 2 when d l 0 21 and b l 0 22 for gs psb and cps psb models kt is found to be less than 0 1 under deepwater conditions for all the models if kt 0 3 is desired the range of period of waves that could be attenuated effectively in water depths of 15 m 20 m and 25 m is about 9 s 10 s and 11s respectively similarly if kt 0 2 is desired the range of period of waves that could be attenuated effectively is 7 s 8 s and 9 s for water depths 15 m 20 m and 25 m respectively these results are applicable for the b l range between 0 18 and 0 22 4 3 wave reflection the variations of reflection coefficient kr i e hr hi for gs psb cps psb and vw psb models is presented in fig 8 a b and 8c respectively the range of kr for cps psb gs psb and vw psb is from 0 17 to 0 72 0 40 to 0 98 and 0 44 to 0 92 respectively the kr is found to increase with d l and b l it is found to be the least for the cps psb model for a wide range of d l which is attributed to the flatter slope on the seaside face that facilitates gradual dissipation of wave energy the kr for gs psb is closer to that for vw psb indicating that the gs psb performs like a vertical wall in reflecting the waves 4 4 energy dissipation the variations of the energy dissipation expressed as the loss co efficient kl 1 kr 2 kt 2 with d l and b l for the gs psb cps psb and vw psb models are presented in fig 9 a b and 9c respectively the kl for cps psb gs psb and vw psb varies from 0 7 to 0 95 0 2 to 0 9 and 0 3 to 0 75 respectively it is seen that kl is a maximum for cps psb model for most of the test cases followed by gs psb and vw psb indicating clearly that the performance of cps psb is better than the other two models in terms of wave energy dissipation the kl is moderate for gs psb model except for d l between 0 3 and 0 4 where it is minimum due to higher reflection however the kl is the least for vw psb for the entire range of d l tested the forgoing discussion on the results on the variations of kt kr and kl for the three models considered herein reveal that the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of cps psb stands high with its least reflection and transmission with high dissipation of incident wave energy 4 5 wave induced dynamic pressures the mean of three to five consecutive shoreward peak pressures psh is used to represent the dimensionless peak pressure parameter psh γhi for each wave run the variation of psh γhi with z d for gs psb cps psb and vw psb models for the different d l is shown in fig 10 a b and 10c respectively it can be observed that the pressures exerted on the cps psb are maximum followed by gs psb and vw psb models it can also be seen that psh γhi is more for smaller d l as more pressures are exerted by longer waves the trend in its variation is similar to that reported by anand et al 2011 for curved seawalls and sundar and subbarao 2002 for a quadrant front face pile supported breakwater for gs psb and cps psb models the pressures are maximum at swl i e z d 0 lesser at z d 0 08 0 17 and least in the run up zone i e z d 0 08 and 0 17 whereas for vw psb model under longer waves pressures at swl and below that are almost similar for longer waves the pressures closer to swl are more than that due to the wave run up above swl for most of the test conditions the variation of pressures below swl are much less for the vw psb compared to gs psb and cps psb since pressures at swl and below are critical a quantitative comparison of the pressures for all the models at these locations become necessary pressures exerted on the gs psb and cps psb models at swl and below are compared with the pressures exerted on the vw psb model for different d l ratio the pressure difference is expressed as a percentage p as below 1 p p s h g s p s b c p s p s b p s h v w p s b p s h v w p s b 100 at z d 0 the pressures are maximum for cps psb followed by gs psb fig 11 a at z d 0 p varies from 35 to 93 for cps psb and 25 68 for gs psb at z d 0 08 for d l 0 26 fig 11b the pressures are higher by 3 57 in cps psb and 9 40 in gs psb however as d l increases a reverse trend is observed for the pressures on vw psb at z d 0 17 for a limited range of d l 0 18 fig 11c the pressures are higher by 23 46 in cps psb and 23 34 in gs psb compared to that exerted over the vw psb model as d l increases a reverse trend is observed with pressures in vw psb higher than gs psb and cps psb for short waves pressures are observed to be the least for cps psb model due to the flatness at z d 0 17 these discussions pertaining to pressures are for the tested lower wave height for the larger wave height the intermittent pressures above swl due to the wave run up increased however the trend in the pressure distribution remained the same with maximum pressures at swl observed for cps psb followed by gs psb and vw psb from the foregoing discussion it can be seen that the gs psb and cps psb models perform better than the vw psb model in terms of dissipation of the incident wave energy higher pressures are experienced by gs psb and cps psb models compared to vw psb when exposed to long waves the maximum pressures are observed to be exerted over the cps psb model the cps psb and gs psb are found to perform better in terms of hydrodynamic performance characteristics which is an important requirement of a breakwater however the higher pressures need to be accommodated in the design of these types of breakwaters 4 6 run up and overtopping the run up height is measured in the vertical direction above swl from the time series of run up probe comprising of run up and run down values mean of five positive peak values were used to get the run up height as the time series of the run up measured on the surface of vw psb was corrupted the variations of relative wave run up ru hi with d l and b l superposed only for the models gs psb and cps psb are presented in fig 12 the run up in cps psb is observed to be higher for most of the test conditions than that for gs psb by about 6 25 the higher run up in cps psb can be attributed to the flatter slope over it however no overtopping was observed in cps psb for any of the tests as the re curve directed the waves back towards seaside whereas in the case of gs psb mild overtopping was observed in particular for d l 0 60 no overtopping was observed in vw psb as well these results pertain to the lower wave heights used in the experimental investigation the range of d l for occurrence of overtopping depends on wave height the overtopping observed in gs psb model can possibly be reduced by mounting additional energy dissipating mechanisms such as wave screens in the space available on the seaside of this model experimental studies done earlier using wave screens have shown that the wave screens perform well in wave energy dissipation and reduced reflections balaji and sundar 2004 carried out experimental and numerical studies on wave screens of different cross sections and concluded that the circular pipes exhibited lesser reflection characteristics such an exercise could be carried out through a comprehensive experimental program to ascertain the capability of wave screens in further reducing the reflection and run up observed in gs psb model from the present experiments it can be said that the cps psb model is better than the other models without use of any wave screens 4 7 regression analysis the dimensionless coefficients obtained from measurements were subjected to multiple regression analysis based on the least squares method equations for kt and kr as a function of dimensionless parameters b l and h d are derived the dimensionless psh γhi is expressed as a function of d l and z d wheras the dimensionless run up ru hi is expressed as a function of d l and h d these equations are given for the models gs psb and cps psb that have a better hydrodynamic performance than vw psb as discussed earlier the regression equations obtained for the different parameters derived from the present tests are for transmission 2 g

and for pressures only h d of 0 26 is considered the comparisons between computed coefficients and those obtained through measurements are shown in fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 respectively a reasonable agreement is observed with the correlation coefficient r varying between 0 72 and 0 94 for gs psb and 0 61 to 0 98 for cps psb models 5 conclusions hydrodynamic characteristics of curved front face pile supported breakwaters designated as cps psb and gs psb have been compared with a conventional caisson type pile supported breakwater viz vw psb under regular waves through an experimental investigation the salient conclusions drawn from the study for a relative depth of submergence h d 0 26 are 1 wave transmission for gs psb and cps psb models is lesser than vw psb kt less than 0 2 can be achieved for cps psb and gs psb models when d l 0 21 and b l 0 22 kt is less than 0 1 for all the models under deepwater conditions 2 wave reflection kr is found to be the least in cps psb model due to flatter slope in this model with maximum kr value being 0 72 3 energy dissipation expressed as loss co efficient kl is maximum in cps psb followed by gs psb and minimum in vw psb kl is in the range of 0 7 0 95 for the cps psb model 4 wave pressures at s w l are highest in cps psb followed by gs psb and vw psb models 5 wave pressures below s w l are more in cps psb and gs psb models than vw psb for longer waves for shorter waves pressures in vw psb are more than the other two models 6 no overtopping is observed in cps psb and vw psb models for any of the test cases while overtopping is observed in gs psb model out of the three models compared the cps psb is ideal for intermediate water depth and close to deep water conditions as it is more energy dissipative the high pressures in this model is something that need to be factored in the design the drawbacks in gs psb model such as high reflections and moderate overtopping can possibly be overcome by using wave screens in the space available on the seaside of the model an area requiring further research moreover these experiments have been performed on models of 1 25 scale and hence the results presented and

21537,the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of curved and vertical front face pile supported breakwaters are evaluated in this paper two curved profiles viz galveston wall shape gs and circular cum parabola shape cps are adopted as the seaward face for pile supported breakwaters designated as gs psb cps psb respectively a comparison of the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of the said two types with a vertical face type vw psb is carried out experimental investigations on the three models were carried out in a wave flume under the action of regular harmonic waves wave energy transmission past the gs psb and cps psb models were found to be lesser than that past the vw psb the reflection of incident wave energy was found to be the least for cps psb followed by gs psb and vw psb the energy dissipation was observed to be a maximum for cps psb moderate in gs psb whereas the minimum was experienced by the vw psb the dynamic pressures induced by long waves are observed to be more for cps psb and gs psb than those exerted on the vw psb model the run up on the gs psb and cps psb models are compared and a qualitative assessment of overtopping is reported keywords pile

s pile spacing in transverse direction z elevation from still water level 1 introduction rubble mound breakwaters have been widely adopted worldwide for the formation of artificial harbours due to an ever increasing maritime trade there has been a drastic increase in the size of vessels being handled in such a case if conventional breakwaters are adopted it leaves a large foot print over the seafloor hence researchers have been looking for alternatives that have gained momentum pile supported breakwaters are preferred for deeper waters beyond 15 m as they are more rigid than floating units to attenuate the incident wave energy and to provide reasonable tranquillity for berthing of vessels on their lee side earlier studies were confined to pile breakwaters i e closely spaced piles being used as breakwaters the power transmission theory of weigel 1961 was reported to under predict transmission by about 25 hayashi et al 1966 truitt and herbich 1986 carried out experimental investigations on a single row pile breakwater and concluded that the relative pile spacing is the one that affects the wave transmission more than any other parameter weele and herbich 1972 through their experimental studies on pile array combinations reported that staggering the piles resulted in a reduction in the wave transmission herbich and douglas 1988 concluded that an additional row of piles reduced wave transmission by 5 15 however spacing the piles closely may not always be possible due to practical site constraints whereas in the case of pile supported breakwaters different structural forms are supported on piles to dissipate the incident wave energy and piles are mainly to support the super structure hence its application in the ocean waters is more relevant in deeper waters wherein the wave energy is mostly concentrated nearer to the free surface partially immersed vertical barriers such as twin vertical barriers have been investigated by neelamani and vedagiri 2002 and t type breakwaters studied by neelamani and rajendran 2002 were found suitable for deep water application laju et al 2011 carried out numerical and experimental studies on a double row skirt breakwater and found that the depth of submergence played a major role in the dissipation of incident wave energy rageh and koraim 2010 through experiments reported that the wave transmission could be reduced by providing horizontal slots below the partially immersed vertical barriers rageh et al 2009 carried out experimental studies on partially immersed caisson type pile supported breakwater and the transmission co efficient kt was brought less than 0 25 for a relative draft greater than 0 1 the barrier should be designed to facilitate maximum extent of incident wave energy dissipation the process of dissipation is governed by the relative draft relative width and the shape of the seaward surface the front face should facilitate minimum reflection and thus reducing the forces on the structure researchers in the past have reported on the hydrodynamic characteristics of curved seaward profiles sundar and subbarao 2002 for a quadrant front face pile supported breakwater concluded the wave reflection kr in the range of 0 25 0 85 wang et al 2016 found that arc plates mounted on piles resulted in lesser wave transmission and reflection than horizontal plates mounted on piles anand et al 2011 compared the hydrodynamic characteristics of seawall profiles and found the reflection to be least for circular cum parabola shape cps followed by galveston wall shape gs the circular cum parabola shape cps mentioned in the patent of weber 1934 consists of a smooth parabola to gently guide the incoming waves to the quadrant circle at the top that redirects the waves back to the seaside the galveston wall shape gs consisting of two radii of curvature has been earlier adopted as a seawall at galveston texas usa these curved seawall profiles are adopted as the front face for a

swl pressure sensors were located below the s w l at z d 0 08 and 0 17 two pressure sensors positioned above the swl at z d 0 08 and 0 17 measured the intermittent pressures due to wave run up the

consisted of two parallel stainless steel wires of 1 mm diameter spaced at 10 mm and fixed on the front face of the curved profiles gs psb and cps psb the test set up is shown in fig 5 the calibration of the wave probes pressure sensors and run up meters were carried out and also checked for repeatability the calibration for the run up probes on the curved profiles was non linear for which the

0 15 m were employed for each of the wave period the said variation resulted in a d l range of 0 13 0 6 3 2 dimensional analysis a dimensional analysis was performed and the parameters affecting the hydrodynamic performance of the pile supported breakwater were obtained such as d l b l and h d pressures and run up are indicated in non dimensional form as psh γhi and ru hi respectively to account for the scale effects 4 results and discussion 4 1 typical time histories typical measured time series of wave elevations run up and dynamic pressures for the cps psb model are shown in fig 6 4 2 wave transmission the variations of the transmission coefficient kt i e ht hi with the relative water depth d l and relative breakwater width b l for the gs psb psb psb and vw psb models are presented in fig 7 a b and 7c respectively the range of kt for cps psb gs psb and vw psb is found to be 0 04 to 0 53 0 05 to 0 62 for and 0 03 to 0 72 respectively the kt is found to decrease with an increase in d l which is obvious as the longer waves propagate past the structure without much attenuation the reduction in the kt for gs psb and cps psb is found to be quite drastic for d l 0 20 beyond which the reduction is found to be gradual for the vw psb model the above stated variation in kt is found to be gradual the results clearly indicate that the cps psb model exhibits least kt and differ from that of gs psb model marginally the kt experienced by the vw psb model is found to be the highest with its deviation found to increase as d l decreases for long waves kt for cps psb is lower than gs psb which in turn is lower than vw psb model a closer examination of the results on superposition reveals that kt is less than 0 2 when d l 0 21 and b l 0 22 for gs psb and cps psb models kt is found to be less than 0 1 under deepwater conditions for all the models if kt 0 3 is desired the range of period of waves that could be attenuated effectively in water depths of 15 m 20 m and 25 m is about 9 s 10 s and 11s respectively similarly if kt 0 2 is desired the range of period of waves that could be attenuated effectively is 7 s 8 s and 9 s for water depths 15 m 20 m and 25 m respectively these results are applicable for the b l range between 0 18 and 0 22 4 3 wave reflection the variations of reflection coefficient kr i e hr hi for gs psb cps psb and vw psb models is presented in fig 8 a b and 8c respectively the range of kr for cps psb gs psb and vw psb is from 0 17 to 0 72 0 40 to 0 98 and 0 44 to 0 92 respectively the kr is found to increase with d l and b l it is found to be the least for the cps psb model for a wide range of d l which is attributed to the flatter slope on the seaside face that facilitates gradual dissipation of wave energy the kr for gs psb is closer to that for vw psb indicating that the gs psb performs like a vertical wall in reflecting the waves 4 4 energy dissipation the variations of the energy dissipation expressed as the loss co efficient kl 1 kr 2 kt 2 with d l and b l for the gs psb cps psb and vw psb models are presented in fig 9 a b and 9c respectively the kl for cps psb gs psb and vw psb varies from 0 7 to 0 95 0 2 to 0 9 and 0 3 to 0 75 respectively it is seen that kl is a maximum for cps psb model for most of the test cases followed by gs psb and vw psb indicating clearly that the performance of cps psb is better than the other two models in terms of wave energy dissipation the kl is moderate for gs psb model except for d l between 0 3 and 0 4 where it is minimum due to higher reflection however the kl is the least for vw psb for the entire range of d l tested the forgoing discussion on the results on the variations of kt kr and kl for the three models considered herein reveal that the hydrodynamic performance characteristics of cps psb stands high with its least reflection and transmission with high dissipation of incident wave energy 4 5 wave induced dynamic pressures the mean of three to five consecutive shoreward peak pressures psh is used to represent the dimensionless peak pressure parameter psh γhi for each wave run the variation of psh γhi with z d for gs psb cps psb and vw psb models for the different d l is shown in fig 10 a b and 10c respectively it can be observed that the pressures exerted on the cps psb are maximum followed by gs psb and vw psb models it can also be seen that psh γhi is more for smaller d l as more pressures are exerted by longer waves the trend in its variation is similar to that reported by anand et al 2011 for curved seawalls and sundar and subbarao 2002 for a quadrant front face pile supported breakwater for gs psb and cps psb models the pressures are maximum at swl i e z d 0 lesser at z d 0 08 0 17 and least in the run up zone i e z d 0 08 and 0 17 whereas for vw psb model under longer waves pressures at swl and below that are almost similar for longer waves the pressures closer to swl are more than that due to the wave run up above swl for most of the test conditions the variation of pressures below swl are much less for the vw psb compared to gs psb and cps psb since pressures at swl and below are critical a quantitative comparison of the pressures for all the models at these locations become necessary pressures exerted on the gs psb and cps psb models at swl and below are compared with the pressures exerted on the vw psb model for different d l ratio the pressure difference is expressed as a percentage p as below 1 p p s h g s p s b c p s p s b p s h v w p s b p s h v w p s b 100 at z d 0 the pressures are maximum for cps psb followed by gs psb fig 11 a at z d 0 p varies from 35 to 93 for cps psb and 25 68 for gs psb at z d 0 08 for d l 0 26 fig 11b the pressures are higher by 3 57 in cps psb and 9 40 in gs psb however as d l increases a reverse trend is observed for the pressures on vw psb at z d 0 17 for a limited range of d l 0 18 fig 11c the pressures are higher by 23 46 in cps psb and 23 34 in gs psb compared to that exerted over the vw psb model as d l increases a reverse trend is observed with pressures in vw psb higher than gs psb and cps psb for short waves pressures are observed to be the least for cps psb model due to the flatness at z d 0 17 these discussions pertaining to pressures are for the tested lower wave height for the larger wave height the intermittent pressures above swl due to the wave run up increased however the trend in the pressure distribution remained the same with maximum pressures at swl observed for cps psb followed by gs psb and vw psb from the foregoing discussion it can be seen that the gs psb and cps psb models perform better than the vw psb model in terms of dissipation of the incident wave energy higher pressures are experienced by gs psb and cps psb models compared to vw psb when exposed to long waves the maximum pressures are observed to be exerted over the cps psb model the cps psb and gs psb are found to perform better in terms of hydrodynamic performance characteristics which is an important requirement of a breakwater however the higher pressures need to be accommodated in the design of these types of breakwaters 4 6 run up and overtopping the run up height is measured in the vertical direction above swl from the time series of run up probe comprising of run up and run down values mean of five positive peak values were used to get the run up height as the time series of the run up measured on the surface of vw psb was corrupted the variations of relative wave run up ru hi with d l and b l superposed only for the models gs psb and cps psb are presented in fig 12 the run up in cps psb is observed to be higher for most of the test conditions than that for gs psb by about 6 25 the higher run up in cps psb can be attributed to the flatter slope over it however no overtopping was observed in cps psb for any of the tests as the re curve directed the waves back towards seaside whereas in the case of gs psb mild overtopping was observed in particular for d l 0 60 no overtopping was observed in vw psb as well these results pertain to the lower wave heights used in the experimental investigation the range of d l for occurrence of overtopping depends on wave height the overtopping observed in gs psb model can possibly be reduced by mounting additional energy dissipating mechanisms such as wave screens in the space available on the seaside of this model experimental studies done earlier using wave screens have shown that the wave screens perform well in wave energy dissipation and reduced reflections balaji and sundar 2004 carried out experimental and numerical studies on wave screens of different cross sections and concluded that the circular pipes exhibited lesser reflection characteristics such an exercise could be carried out through a comprehensive experimental program to ascertain the capability of wave screens in further reducing the reflection and run up observed in gs psb model from the present experiments it can be said that the cps psb model is better than the other models without use of any wave screens 4 7 regression analysis the dimensionless coefficients obtained from measurements were subjected to multiple regression analysis based on the least squares method equations for kt and kr as a function of dimensionless parameters b l and h d are derived the dimensionless psh γhi is expressed as a function of d l and z d wheras the dimensionless run up ru hi is expressed as a function of d l and h d these equations are given for the models gs psb and cps psb that have a better hydrodynamic performance than vw psb as discussed earlier the regression equations obtained for the different parameters derived from the present tests are for transmission 2 g

and for pressures only h d of 0 26 is considered the comparisons between computed coefficients and those obtained through measurements are shown in fig 13 fig 14 fig 15 and fig 16 respectively a reasonable agreement is observed with the correlation coefficient r varying between 0 72 and 0 94 for gs psb and 0 61 to 0 98 for cps psb models 5 conclusions hydrodynamic characteristics of curved front face pile supported breakwaters designated as cps psb and gs psb have been compared with a conventional caisson type pile supported breakwater viz vw psb under regular waves through an experimental investigation the salient conclusions drawn from the study for a relative depth of submergence h d 0 26 are 1 wave transmission for gs psb and cps psb models is lesser than vw psb kt less than 0 2 can be achieved for cps psb and gs psb models when d l 0 21 and b l 0 22 kt is less than 0 1 for all the models under deepwater conditions 2 wave reflection kr is found to be the least in cps psb model due to flatter slope in this model with maximum kr value being 0 72 3 energy dissipation expressed as loss co efficient kl is maximum in cps psb followed by gs psb and minimum in vw psb kl is in the range of 0 7 0 95 for the cps psb model 4 wave pressures at s w l are highest in cps psb followed by gs psb and vw psb models 5 wave pressures below s w l are more in cps psb and gs psb models than vw psb for longer waves for shorter waves pressures in vw psb are more than the other two models 6 no overtopping is observed in cps psb and vw psb models for any of the test cases while overtopping is observed in gs psb model out of the three models compared the cps psb is ideal for intermediate water depth and close to deep water conditions as it is more energy dissipative the high pressures in this model is something that need to be factored in the design the drawbacks in gs psb model such as high reflections and moderate overtopping can possibly be overcome by using wave screens in the space available on the seaside of the model an area requiring further research moreover these experiments have been performed on models of 1 25 scale and hence the results presented and

21538,this study investigates the interaction between solitary wave and submerged breakwater based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics the goring wave making method is applied the interactions between a solitary wave and a submerged breakwater with rectangular and semi circular section are investigated to verify the ability of the presented numerical model a composite submerged breakwater is proposed by combining a quarter circle and a square the different arrangements of submerged breakwater are defined as profile type i pt i and profile type ii pt ii the forces of the semi circular of these two submerged breakwaters are calculated and compared in order to evaluate the wave dissipation effect of these two types of breakwaters we propose an empirical formula of incident wave energy and a novel concept of an energy transmission coefficient it is shown that potential energy is transmitted more easily through a submerged breakwater than kinetic energy the results reveal that the different arrangements of pt i and pt ii have no obvious effect on wave dissipation whereas the depth of the submerged breakwater has a significant influence keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics solitary wave submerged breakwater energy transmission coefficient energy formula 1 introduction waves are an important driving factor for coastal erosion especially on open coasts in recent years with the enhanced awareness of environmental protection coastal engineering efforts are required not only to strengthen the security and reliability but also to pay attention to the ecology around the coast and natural landscape therefore submerged structures are increasingly used to protect wave eroded coasts the main function of a submerged breakwater is to force waves to break in advance owing to a sudden decrease in water depth such that the wave energy is attenuated over recent decades various studies have been carried out on the interaction between waves and submerged structures in theoretical analyses laboratory and field experiments and numerical simulations dattari et al 1978 mizutani et al 1998 beji and battjes 1993 presented the mechanism of high frequency wave energy acting on a submerged breakwater by experiments of waves propagating over a bar ting and kirby 1994 studied that waves propagating to a surf zone can produce undertow and turbulence in the form of spilling breakers and plunging breakers which show fundamental differences in turbulent intensity cho et al 2004 reported an experiment studying the strong reflection of regular water waves over submerged breakwaters in tandem jeng et al 2005 experimentally studied ocean waves propagating over a submerged breakwater in front of a vertical seawall carevic et al 2013 experimentally investigated water parameter of wave crossing a smooth submerged breakwater with the development of computational techniques and more accurate numerical schemes numerical studies of wave transformations over submerged breakwaters have become increasingly feasible and popular they play a significant role in providing tests and examinations for theories and reveal the mechanisms of complex physics the theories underpinning numerical models are mainly divided into three categories 1 potential flow theory this is based on the assumption that the flow is non viscous and irrotational and academics have done much work to apply it successfully to realistic scenarios cooker et al 1990 chian and ertekin 1992 beji and battjes 1994 ohyama and nadaoka 1994 chen et al 2017 although the potential flow theory succeeds in analyzing wave submerged interactions it neglects the flow characteristics near the structures such as flow separation vortex generation and wave breaking 2 viscous flow theory this is based on the navier stokes n s equation because the viscous and diffusion terms are considered in the n s equation it can simulate vertical flow characteristics and vortex development ji et al 2017 hence the application of numerical models based on the n s equation to study the wave structure interaction with improved accuracy is becoming popular jiang et al 2018 li and zhang 2019 the methods of solving the n s equation are mainly divided into mesh methods and mesh free methods because capturing the surface of a mesh free method is based on particle motion and does not need any other algorithm it is more appropriate for simulating a violent free surface such as a breaking wave 3 boussinesq equation the classical boussinesq equation exhibits weak dispersion and weak nonlinearity nwogu 1993 madsen and schaffer 1998 and gobbi et al 2000 made significant progress in enhancing the dispersion and nonlinearity there is no viscous term in boussinesq equation so it cannot simulate the attenuation process during wave propagation therefore many scholars overcome this shortcoming by adding damped term christov 2001 polat and ertaş 2009 wang and su 2015 the methods to describe fluid flow are divided into lagrangian methods that track the fluid particle movement and eulerian methods that track physical quantities at a fixed point in space when solving the above mathematical model the methods used are mainly divided into lagrangian and eulerian methods traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques such as the finite difference method fdm jose et al 2017 finite element method fem long et al 2016 and finite volume method fvm liu and quek 2003 can solve the n s equation well from the numerical aspect much work has also been done to deal with capturing the flow surface based on the n s equation such as the volume of fluid method vof hirt and nichols 1981 level set method ls osher and fedkiw 2001 and constrained interpolation profile method cip hu and kashiwagi 2004 however eulerian grid numerical methods require expensive mesh generation and the results are significantly dependent on the grid quality and quantity such numerical schemes also have severe technical challenges associated with implementing conservative forces therefore the emergence of meshless schemes has provided a much needed alternative and several mesh free methods have been developed such as monte carlo methods binder 1988 and the particle fem oñate et al 2004 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a fully lagrangian method which does not require any mesh grid it was originally invented to simulate astrodynamics in the 1970s lucy 1977 since then with development of the sph method the use of sph has expanded into many areas of solid and fluid dynamics such as large deformation collision blasting free surface flows and multiphase flows in engineering this method employs particles moving according to governing dynamics when simulating free surface flows the lagrangian nature of sph allows the domain to be multiply connected with no need for a special treatment of the surface this property makes the technique ideal for studying violent free surface flows barreiro et al 2013 regarding ocean and coastal engineering field sph can simulate wave propagation over a beach wave breaking impacting on structures and dam breaks monaghan 1994 presented the first attempt to study free surface flows based on sph then monaghan studied the behavior of gravity currents monaghan 1996 solitary waves and the dynamics of a solitary wave breaking on a beach monaghan and kos 1999 later the model was applied to study wave structure interactions colagrossi and landrini 2003 gomez gesteria and dalrymple 2004 used sph to study the dam break problem in three dimensions within the field of coastal engineering gotoh et al 2004 and shao 2005 used sph to study wave breakwater interactions and khayyer and gotoh 2009 used it to predict wave impact pressure due to sloshing waves altomare et al 2017 and altomare et al 2018 proposed an improved algorithm in sph for wave generation and absorption including passive and active wave absorption systems canelas and brito 2018 coupled sph and a multi body solver to reproduce complex flows roselli et al 2019 studied reproduced wave transformations and breaking in the surf zone the models simulating free surface flows based on sph are divided into weakly compressible sph wcsph and incompressible sph isph the main difference between them is that wcsph considers that the density of particle is weakly compressible and assumes the mass of each particle is constant but the density is variable therefore the pressure of each particle is obtained by solving the equation of state without the pressure poisson equation which improves the computational efficiency of solving the n s equation monaghan 1994 the state equation describes a very stiff density field and together with the natural disordering of the lagrangian particles high frequency low amplitude oscillations are found to populate the density scalar field molteni and colagrossi 2009 although the sph method is widely used in free surface flow simulation its computational cost is high in recent years graphics processing unit gpu acceleration provides an alternative for viable cheap and highly portable computing of sph and has been increasingly applied within the field of ocean engineering kawamura et al 2016 chen and wan 2019 wei et al 2019 compared to tradition central processing unit cpu gpu have huge number of computational cores in a graphic card which give more computational power than traditional cpu chow et al 2018 zhan et al 2019 used gpufactor and cpufactor the total computing time particle number the computational steps to evaluate the calculation efficiency of gpu and cpu and found that the computing speed of gtx 1080 is about 200 times that of a modern 12 cores cpu hérault et al 2010 used the computing unified device architecture cuda developed by nvidia to implement the sph method on a gpu the calculation speed is greatly improved domínguez et al 2013a and domínguez et al 2013b proposed optimization strategies for both cpu and gpu in dualsphysics and developed multi gpu implementation on heterogeneous clusters ji et al 2016 presented wcsph framework utilizing the parallel architecture of single and multi gpu platforms mokos et al 2015 simulated the multiphase flow by wcsph on s single gpu chow et al 2018 and chow et al 2019 used a gpu to accelerate isph method and make it possible to simulate millions of particles in three dimensional therefore the technique of gpu acceleration is provided in dualsphysics and the numerical simulations in this study were performed using a gpu card installed on a personal computer the objective of this study is to extend the sph method to solitary wave transformation over submerged breakwaters and analyze the relevant energy transmission characteristics four shapes of submerged structures rectangles semi cylinders and two composite profile types are chosen to investigate the phenomena this remainder of this article is organised as follows in section 2 details are provided on the numerical implementation of sph for the governing equations in section 3 the interaction of solitary waves with rectangular and semi cylindrical submerged dikes are calculated and discussed including comparisons to experimental data in section 4 the interaction of solitary waves and two types of composite submerged breakwaters are calculated and the wave elimination effects are energetically evaluated finally a summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 governing equations and numerical schemes 2 1 governing equation and its discretization based on sph sph is a fully lagrangian method in which no mesh is required and the fluid is discretised into a set of particles the n s equation for fluid can be written in the lagrangian form as follows 1 d ρ d t ρ v d v d t g 1 ρ p μ ρ 2 v equation system 1 includes the continuity and momentum equations ρ t v g and p represent the density time velocity gravitational acceleration and pressure respectively the conservation laws of fluid dynamics are transformed from their partial differential form to a form suitable for particle based simulations using integral equations based on an interpolation function typically the interpolation function is referred to as the kernel function w which is designed to represent a function f r defined in r by an integral approximation 2 f r f r w r r h d r kernel functions can take different forms with the most common being cubic or quantic the form affects not only the calculation time but also the stability of the calculation kernel functions must have several properties monaghan 1992 when the second derivative of a kernel function is discontinuous it becomes quite sensitive to particle disorder or the randomness of particle positions one kernel option is the quantic kernel described by wendland 1995 for which the weighting function vanishes for inter particle distances greater than 2 h it is defined as follows 3 w r h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 where q r h and α d 7 14 π h 2 are the normalization constants in two dimensions the function f in eq 2 can be expressed in a discrete form based on particles the information of particle a is determined by particles in the support domain thus the approximation of the function is interpolated at particle a and the summation is performed over all particles within the region of the compact support of the kernel 4 f r a b f r b m b ρ b w r a r b h 5 f r a b f r b m b ρ b a w a b where the value of particle a associated with neighbouring particle b is m b ρ b and m and ρ are mass and density respectively according to eq 4 and eq 5 sph provides a numerical discretization approach to represent partial differential equations by operating on the kernel function using eq 4 and eq 5 the system of n s equation 1 can be transformed to an sph form as follows 6 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b 7 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ a ρ b π a b a w a b g where g 0 9 81 m s 2 and w ab is the kernel function that depends on the distance between particles a and b the viscosity term π a b depending on the artificial viscosity is given by monaghan 1992 8 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b v a b r a b 0 0 v a b r a b 0 where r a b r a r b and v a b v a v b are particle position and velocity respectively μ a b h v a b r a b r a b 2 η 2 c a b 0 5 c a c b η 2 0 01 h 2 and α is a coefficient that must be tuned to introduce the proper dissipation the value α 0 01 was used in this work because it is the minimum value that prevents instability and spurious oscillations in the numerical scheme barreiro et al 2013 presented preliminary results simulating hydraulic loading and previous validations against experimental data were also described in that work to demonstrate the accuracy of the model in reproducing both wave propagation and wave impact on structures using the value α 0 01 according to monaghan 1994 a fluid can be treated as being weakly compressible the system is closed with the equation of state batchelor 1973 that the pressure calculated according to the density 9 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 and b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ with ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 and c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 in order to ensure the fluid is weakly compressible the sound speed is restricted to be at least ten times the maximum fluid value which keeps density variations to within less than 1 however the value of c0 is not the real speed of sound and thus the stability region of the time step is defined as 11 δ t c f l min min a h f a min a h c 0 max b h v a b r a b r a b 2 η 2 where f a is the force per unit mass owing to the use of the state equation the explicit time integration scheme of the time step is defined by the courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl the first term considers the force magnitudes and the second term takes the restriction arising from the viscous diffusion term into consideration 2 2 boundary conditions in this study the boundary conditions are expressed by a separate set of particles from the fluid particles this method is called dynamic boundary conditions dbc these boundary conditions are presented and validated by crespo et al 2007 in this method boundary particles have the same properties as fluid particles that satisfy the governing equation but they do not move or move with motion described when the distance between a fluid particle and a boundary particle less than twice the smoothing length h the density and pressure of the boundary particle increase according the pressure term of the momentum equation a repulsive force is generated in the boundary and fluid particles the validation of dbc shows good agreement with wave structure interaction altomare et al 2014 and wave generation altomare et al 2017 3 interaction of solitary wave with submerged breakwater wave generation is achieved using a moving boundary that mimics the displacement of a wave maker in a physical wave flume the numerical pistoncan move with pre imposed displacement both for regular and random waves and with the real motion that occurred in the experiments any physical models can be numerically reproduced including the pistongeometry and displacement piston type flap type wedge type etc 3 1 model application for solitary wave generation since russell discovered and proposed the solitary wave in 1834 and korteweg and de vries 1895 derived the kdv equation and obtained the analytical solution of a solitary wave solitary waves have received gradually increasing recognition as nonlinear and dispersive waves solitary waves have been widely utilised to study wave structure interactions the key issue to generate solitary waves is to reduce the wake as much as possible so that the wave surface remains stable during the propagation process the generation of solitary waves can be divided into three methods 1 dropping or sliding a heavy object 2 the lift at a flume bottom 3 piston wave maker the present work adopts the third method katell and eric 2002 compared the goring boussinesq shallow water first order kdv shallow water second order and rayleigh wave making methods the resulting solitary waves for dimensionless amplitudes ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 of rayleigh s as pour as goring s the goring piston motion equation is adopted to make a solitary wave the motion of the paddle is described as follows 13 x t s g tanh 7 6 t τ 0 5 14 s g 4 a h 0 3 15 τ 4 β c tanh 1 0 999 a h 0 where β 3 a h 0 3 c g h 0 a h 0 is the water depth and a is the amplitude a passive wave absorber is required to damp wave energy and reduce reflection exerted by the boundary of the model domain a damping zone is implemented in dualsphysics as a passive absorption system the damping system implementation consists of gradually reducing the velocity of the particles at each time step according to their location using quadratic rather than exponential decay thus the velocity is modified as follows 16 v v 0 f x δ t where v 0 is the initial velocity of particle i in the damping zone v is the final velocity and f x δ t is the reduction function defined as follows 17 f x δ t 1 δ t β x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 when simulating the solitary wave making and propagation it was found that this passive wave absorber is effective for controlling fluid velocity but it cannot control the surface height at which the velocity is equal to zero in the right boundary the surface height is not a stationary surface owing to the wave propagation in order to solve this problem another damping zone must be established behind the first damping zone with a spatial interval between them 3 2 interaction between solitary wave and rectangular submerged breakwater when a solitary wave propagates over a submerged breakwater the flow fields around the weather and lee side of the structure are unsteady owing to the flow separation and vortex generation this has been studied by many researchers through experiments zhuang and lee 1996 chang et al 2001 and numerical models zhuang and lee 1996 solved this problem using potential theory and a viscous rotational model respectively chang et al 2001 studied the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged rectangular breakwater though the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans k ε model ji et al 2017 performed simulations using the cip method and obtained great agreement with the experiment therefore this problem also serves as a good verification case for numerical models to calculate the velocity field of a solitary wave around a submerged breakwater wang et al 2018 studied the effect of the rectangle size on the wave transmission coefficient for this purpose numerical calculations were performed by the sph model and the obtained numerical results were compared with experimental data and other models results the experiment was carried out by zhuang and lee 1996 according to the schematic shown in fig 1 the wave conditions of the experiment were as follows height of the solitary wave is h 0 069 m and the water depth is d 0 228 m a rectangular submerged breakwater was installed in the tank with a height of d 0 114 m and length of l 0 381 m zhuang and lee 1996 measured the horizontal and vertical velocities at two fixed points after the breakwater point 1 and point 2 by laser doppler velocimetry ldv as shown in fig 1 the two points were in the same vertical plane 0 034 m downstream from the lee side of the submerged breakwater point 1 and point 2 were located 4 and 5 72 cm above the bed respectively 3 2 1 solitary wave making test before simulating the interaction between the solitary wave and submerged breakwater the reliability and accuracy of wave making must be tested the motion of the wave paddle is controlled by the goring method the length of the numerical flume is 10 m the water depth d 0 228 m and the wave height h 0 069 m the wave paddle is located at x 0 m the velocity damping zone is set between 7 and 10 m and β 10 as fig 2 four wave gauges are placed at 1 3 4 and 5 m to monitor the changes in the free surface the convergence behavior of sph model was investigated by three resolutions of dp 0 005 m 0 0025 m and 0 001 m corresponding to 88 896 350 815 2 194 921 particles respectively the time histories of surface elevation at st1 st4 are shown in fig 3 the horizontal and vertical axis is time and surface elevations respectively from this figure we could find that the free surface elevations of different resolutions are almost coincident at each specific measuring position and the amplitude of the wake wave is less than 5 of the solitary wave height which means a convergent result is obtained 3 2 2 solitary wave passing over the submerged rectangular breakwater the numerical simulation of a solitary wave passing through a submerged breakwater is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the process of solitary waves crossing a rectangle can be divided into three stages in the first stage when the solitary wave just passes through the submerged breakwater the velocity rises rapidly at the intersection of the top and weather side and the velocity above this area increases markedly at the same time a vortex is generated above this point and gradually increases in the second stage when the solitary wave is above the top of the rectangle the velocity field above the top reaches its maximum but the velocity at the weather side and lee side is close to 0 at this stage the vorticity at the intersection of the top and weather side continues to increase as the solitary wave propagates to the lee side the vortex has been generated and gradually increased at the intersection of the top and lee sides in the third stage the solitary wave passes through the submerged breakwater and leaves the lee side at this stage the velocity of weather side and lee side is reduced gradually the vortex at the weather side also begins to decay the vortex generated on the lee side is clockwise and it develops towards the lee side the diameter of the vortex gradually increases but its intensity gradually weakens for the interaction between solitary waves and a submerged breakwater various scholars use such experiments to test the accuracy of proposed numerical models fig 5 shows the results of the horizontal and vertical velocity values at point 1 and point 2 in the above experiments by the model proposed by the above scholars and the comparison between the experimental values and the model the x axis represents the dimensionless time t g d and the y axis represents the dimensionless velocity u g d w g d it can be seen from fig 5 that the model based on potential flow theory is inconsistent with the experimental results because potential flow theory is based on a fluid with inviscid and irrotational assumptions which cannot simulate vortex generation and wave breaking near the submerged breakwater on the contrary the numerical results of the other four models based on viscous flow theory can reproduce the velocity tendencies and show relatively good agreement with the experimental results in order to analyze the resolution independence of the simulation the different resolutions of dp 0 005 m and 0 001 m are adopted it can be seen that the results of dp 0 005 m and 0 001 m are similar and basically consistent with the experimental result the results of dp 0 001 m is better in horizontal velocity and the results of dp 0 005 m is better in vertical velocity when t g d 19 to study the effects of different turbulence models on the simulation results the mass and momentum conservation equations are treated with different models eq 6 and delta sph formula molteni and colagrossi 2009 are adopted for treating mass conservation equation respectively artificial viscosity monaghan 1992 and sub particle scale sps stress gotoh et al 2004 are adopted for treating momentum conservation equation respectively the resolution of particle size is 0 005 m and calculation results are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the simulation results of all models are similar and have good agreement with experimental data when t g d 15 when t g d 15 the results of sps sph oscillate numerical results are overestimated in horizontal velocity when t g d 19 and underestimated in vertical velocity when t g d 12 in general the numerical results are basically consistent with experimental results the results of π sph model agree best with experiment and π sph model is used for following simulations 3 3 interaction between solitary wave and semi circular cylinder as a new type breakwater the submerged semi circular breakwater has been widely used owing to its good stability and many researchers have extensively investigated it cooker et al 1990 studied the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged semi circular breakwater based on a fully nonlinear two dimensional irrotational numerical method xie 1999 introduced a new method to calculate the wave forces acting on a submerged semi circular breakwater yuan and tao 2003 studied the wave forces acting on a semi circular breakwater based on a boundary element method bem fdm coupled technique peng et al 2012 simulated the deformation of a free surface based on the immersed boundary method ibm and vof liu and li 2013 studied oblique wave interactions with a submerged perforated semi circular breakwater based on the linear potential theory jiang et al 2017 studied the wave load on submerged quarter circular and semi circular breakwaters under irregular waves by experiments and rans vof model there are three cases in the experiments reported by cooker et al 1990 to examine the effects of three water depths and solitary wave amplitudes a submerged semi circular cylinder was cemented to the concrete bed of a wave tank with the fixed radius value of r 20 4 cm three wave gauges were placed at nine positions in different cases to obtain the wave surface heights as shown in fig 7 the wave tank was 70 m long with a piston type wave maker at left end and a wave absorbing zone to damp out passive waves table 1 lists the experimental parameters and the measurement positions in each case in order to decrease the simulation time the numerical wave tank was reduced to 12 m and with a wave damping zone the centre of the semi circular breakwater was at x 5 m two particle sizes d p 0 005 m and d p 0 001 m were calculated the velocity field vorticity field and surface results of the three cases are shown in figs 8 10 3 3 1 solitary wave propagation in case 1 when the solitary wave begins to contact the submerged levee the velocity of the semi cylinder surface increases significantly owing to the large velocity gradient an eddy appears on the cylinder surface as shown in fig 8 t 3 5 s 3 8 s as the solitary wave propagates forward the velocity reaches its maximum when the solitary wave propagates to the top a second crest grows on the lee side of the semi cylinder and it continues to propagate forward due to the submerged levee the incident wave crest is obstructed and reverses its direction propagating backward as a reflected wave t 4 3 s 4 5 s in this process because the velocity of the lee side increases and its direction is upward along the surface of the cylinder the vortex on the cylinder surface is lifted and developed on the backside of the cylinder a small drop appears when the reflected wave propagates forward t 5 3 s 3 3 2 solitary wave propagation in case 2 in this case because of the higher h d when the solitary wave is in contact with the submerged breakwater the velocity field above the semi cylinder increases rapidly and the wave surface becomes steep as shown in fig 9 t 2 8 s 2 9 s a second crest was generated in the backward direction owing to the instability of the crest during the propagation process the second wave collapses and breaks during the period t 3 3 s 3 5 s this plays an important role in wave elimination simultaneously the free surface of the backward propagating wave becomes significantly steep and reverse breaking occurs during t 3 5 s 4 1 s these phenomena are called a forward breaker f b and backward breaker b b by cooker et al 1990 the vortex generation and development are similar to those of case 1 and the eddy generated by wave breaking in the surface is absorbed by the bigger vortex on the backside 3 3 3 solitary wave propagation in case 3 fig 10 shows the velocity field vorticity field and free surface near the submerged breakwater during the interaction between the solitary wave and the semi circular structure under case 3 in the process of solitary wave propagation the crest crest exchange occurs the tail of the solitary wave becomes steep and breaks behind the semi cylinder because the cylinder is close to the free surface the eddy generated by the wave breaking is more easily absorbed by the large vortex in this numerical model when the particle size is large there is a gap between the interaction of the fluid and the boundary the gap is a result of a pressure overestimation across density discontinuities but the gap will be smaller when the particle size decreases two sizes dp 0 001 m and dp 0 005 m are adopted to solve this problem and a comparison of the experimental and numerical results for these two sizes are shown in fig 11 it is indicated that the numerical results agree with the experimental results and the result for dp 0 001 m fits better with the experimental results than that for dp 0 005 m the main reason for this is their different resolution such that the former describes the free surface more accurately than the latter especially with respect to wave breaking but dp 0 005 m is still consistent with the experimental results 4 interaction between solitary wave and composite submerged breakwater from the interaction of a solitary wave with a rectangular and semi circular submerged breakwater the sph numerical method can simulate wave breaking and solve the problem of the interaction between the submerged breakwater and solitary wave effectively and accurately owing to the different structures of the submerged levees they exhibit different wave elimination performance based on the above rectangular and semi circular submerged breakwater a new form of a submerged structure is proposed fig 12 the numerical wave flume based on sph is used to study the hydrodynamic characteristics and wave elimination effects of a solitary wave and the composite submerged levee two ways of placing the new submerged levee are studied and their wave elimination effects are compared profile type i pt i refers to placing the quarter circle on the left side and profile type ii pt ii refers to placing the rectangular straight wall on the left side the radii of pt i and pt ii are the same as that of the above semi circular structure r 20 4 cm and their lengths are 2 r the same three working conditions as for the semi circular structure are also set simulating the process of a solitary waving passing through the submerged levee and the wave transmittance effects pt i and pt ii are compared figs 13 18 shows the changes in the velocity field vorticity field and free surface near the submerged breakwater during the interaction between a solitary wave and pt i and pt ii under three cases the main differences between pt i and pt ii in the process are as follows 1 in the velocity field it can be seen that the weather side of pt ii is rectangular with an abrupt change in its section a sharp increase in velocity and a large velocity gradient are generated however the weather side of pt i is an arc and the fluid transitions along the arc to the top gradually the velocity field of pt i does not change as much as that of pt ii the lee side of pt i is rectangular owing to the abrupt change in cross section as the wave propagates to the back the velocity of the back increases forming a large velocity gradient for pt ii the lee side is an arc surface and the velocity gradually transitions however it can be seen from the velocity field of fig 14 t 3 8 s and t 3 9 s that when a solitary wave propagates to the lee side a small belt with low velocity is formed on the lee side 2 in the vorticity field a vortex generally appears at an abrupt change in cross section the weather side of pt i is an arc surface and there is no large vortex is generated on the arc surface the lee side of pt i is rectangular and a large vortex is generated behind the submerged structure and it continues to exist for a long time the weather side of pt ii is rectangular which creates a vortex at the top of the embankment the vortex gradually develops downward along the arc of the lee side at the same time a phenomenon is observed in the vorticity field of fig 14 t 3 8 s and t 3 9 s velocity gradient is the main reason for the vortex generation on the lee side 3 in terms of wave breaking none is observed for pt i in case 1 and a small wave breaking is produced in the back of the submerged structure in case 2 breaking is produced in pt i and pt ii at the lee side the breaking position of pt i is farther away from the submerged breakwater than that of pt ii the breaking strength of pt i is smaller than that of pt ii finally in case 3 the breaking position of pt i is farther away from the submerged breakwater than that of pt ii 4 the forces of the semi circular pt i and pt ii submerged breakwaters under three cases are calculated and the results are shown in fig 19 axis of x and z are along the length and depth of flume respectively f x and f z are the horizontal and vertical force of submerged breakwater the time history curves of f x and f z also exhibit a form of a solitary wave with a wake after it that is mainly due to the reverse wave breaking produced on the lee side it can be seen that f z is higher than f x in each case under three cases the peaks of pt i and pt ii are same and larger than that of the semicircle the maximum of f z of pt ii is the smallest in magnitude pt i is second and the semicircle the largest from the values of f x f z and the total force the main force exerted by a solitary wave on the submerged breakwater is the increased gravitational force caused by the rise in the water level 4 1 wave eliminating effects of the new submerged breakwater under solitary wave in describing the wave eliminating effect of submerged breakwaters previous studies used the transmission and reflection coefficients as indicators to evaluate the breakwater ability in this study an energy method is proposed to evaluate the wave eliminating effect of a submerged levee by analysing the energy of the incident wave and transmitted wave the ratio of the energy of the transmitted wave and incident wave can be used as an indicator called the energy transmission coefficient cet to investigate the wave eliminating effect of the submerged breakwater a small value of cet indicates that a large amount of energy is consumed by the interaction with the submerged breakwater and that it has a strong elimination effect on the contrary a large value of cet indicates that the transmitted wave is large and that the wave eliminating effect of the submerged breakwater is poor the wave making is simulated at water depths of d 0 34 0 2914 and 0 255 m as in the three cases with the semi cylinder h d ranges from 0 06 to 0 85 in the numerical wave tank the kinetic energy potential energy and total energy of the solitary wave are calculated because the fluid is represented by particles the accumulation of the particle energy in the integration is the energy of the fluid in this region in addition because the amount of energy added is of more concern the energy increment is calculated in a specific region the number of particles does not remain constant therefore the mass energy density is introduced to represent the energy the formulas for the mass energy densities of the kinetic energy potential energy and total energy are as follows 18 e d k i 1 n 1 2 m i u i 2 u i 0 2 π r p 2 ρ i 19 e d p i 1 n m i g h i π r p 2 ρ i 20 e d t e d k e d p where u i 0 0 r p is particle radius and z axis is water depth direction if the z position of particle i z i is greater than the depth then h i z i otherwise h i 0 according to eq 18 20 the energy of a solitary wave is calculated fig 20 shows the changes in ed k ed p and ed t with different values of h d i e d 0 34 0 2914 and 0 255 m respectively the proportions of kinetic energy and potential energy are shown in the upper left corner of each graph from fig 20 a c we can see the following 1 with increasing depth ed k ed p and ed t increase significantly under the same h d 2 at the same water depth with the increase of h d the growth rate of kinetic energy increases the growth rate of potential energy decreases and the total energy essentially shows linear growth 3 the proportion of potential energy is larger than that of kinetic energy as h d increases the proportion of potential energy decreases gradually and that of kinetic energy increases gradually but the potential energy is always greater than the kinetic energy in order to observe the influence of water depth on the proportions of kinetic and potential energy we compare the ratios of kinetic and potential energy for d 0 34 0 2914 and 0 255 m the results are shown in fig 20 d it is evident that the kinetic and potential energy ratio curves of the three different water depths are essentially coincident this illustrates why the proportions of kinetic and potential energy are only related to h d because of the symmetry about proportion 0 5 one curve is described and the other curve can be known the potential energy curve is fitted to an exponential function using the least squares method the results are shown in fig 21 and the fitting formulas are shown in eq 21 and eq 22 21 e p o t e

simulation of the interaction between a solitary wave and submerged breakwater at different h d when r d is 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 the mass energy density behind the dike is obtained when the solitary wave passes over a flow vortex is formed after the submerged breakwater when the initial wave height is large the wave will be lifted up leading to the instability and eventual breaking of the solitary wave flow vortex formation and wave breaking are the main forms of dissipation in order to express the energy of the solitary wave after it crosses the submerged breakwater and at the same time to remove the energy of the vortex and wave breaking behind the submerged dike the energy calculation is performed in the range of x 6 5 m to 11 5 m and the submerged breakwater is located at x 5 m fig 22 and fig 23 shows the energy of the submerged dike under different h d with r d 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 for pt i and pt ii the x axis represents h d the y axis shows the position of the wave crest x wc and the z axis indicates the energy density figs 22 and 23 shows the following 1 for the same type of submerged breakwater the kinetic energy potential energy and total energy increase with increasing h d moreover at the same h d with the depth and wave height increase the energy of the transmitted wave is higher 2 when the solitary wave enters the integral region completely the energy remains essentially unchanged when the wave exits the integral region ed k ed p and ed t is decrease the potential energy is significantly higher than the kinetic energy 3 with the increase in h d the growth of ed k in the integral region is concave and the growths of ed p and ed t are convex 4 as the solitary wave passes through the submerged breakwater the proportions of ed k and ed p in the integral region are as shown in fig 24 as h d increases the proportions of ed k and ed p gradually increase and decrease respectively analysing the energy of the transmitted wave in the integral region under different cases reveals that the trends of the transmitted wave energy in pt i and pt ii are essentially the same to study and compare their wave eliminating effects the following work was done because the energy of the solitary wave changes after passing over the submerged breakwater the energy transmission coefficient is proposed as an indicator to evaluate the effect of wave dissipation the initial energy of the solitary wave is calculated in section 4 1 the energy of the transmitted wave is integrated in the range of x 6 5 11 5 m after the submerged breakwater in order to ensure the transmitted wave enters the integral domain the energy is calculated when the wave crest is located at x 9 m fig 25 is the comparison of transmitted wave energy of pt i and pt ii when wave crest position at x 9 m it can be seen that the transmitted wave energy of pt i and pt ii are basically the same at the same water depth the dissipation of e k e p and e t increases with increasing h d the proportion of energy dissipation increases with the decrease of water depth according to eq 23 25 the transmission coefficients of the kinetic energy c tk potential energy c tp and total energy c tt can be obtained 23 c t k e d t k e d i k 24 c t p e d t p e d i p 25 c t t e d t t e d i t the wave dissipation effects of pt i and pt ii are evaluated by energy transmission coefficients to determine the effects of wave dissipation of different arrangements of this composite submerged breakwater fig 26 shows the energy transmission coefficients of pt i and pt ii under different water depths the wave dissipating ability of pt i is slightly better than that of pt ii with the decrease in water depth the energy transmission coefficient decreases this reveals that the shallower the water depth the stronger the wave dissipating effect of the submerged breakwater because the proportion of potential energy is higher than that of kinetic energy the curve of c tt is close to that of c tp in all cases c tk is less than c tp in the process of wave propagation the potential energy passes more easily through the submerged breakwater however the kinetic energy is dissipated by a greater proportion at different depths the trend of energy transmission with h d is different when r d 0 6 the transmission coefficients of the potential energy and total energy generally show a downward trend whereas when r d 0 7 and 0 8 the transmission coefficients of the potential energy and total energy first increase and then decrease with increasing h d under the three water depths the curves of c tt and c tp of pt i and pt ii are substantially coincident in r d 0 6 and 0 7 the curves of c tk of pt i and pt ii are also essentially the same when wave amplitude is small at r d 0 6 the coefficient of pt i and pt ii fluctuates significantly for r d 0 8 the c tk curve of pt ii is higher than that of pt i it can be concluded that the different arrangements of the submerged breakwater consisting of a composite structure of a quarter circle and a square have no significant influence on the wave dissipation effect the energy transmission coefficients decrease with increasing r d indicating that r d has a significant impact on the wave dissipation effect of the submerged breakwater 5 conclusions in this study the sph model is adopted to simulate the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged breakwater two composite submerged breakwaters denoted as pt i and pt ii are introduced and their wave dissipation effects are assessed by energy calculations 1 a comprehensive validation of the sph model is performed by comparing the experimental and numerical results of velocity monitors and free surface gauges which reveal that the model is effective and accurate in solving such problems 2 according to simulations of the interaction between a solitary wave and composite submerged breakwater pt i and pt ii based on the sph model the hydrodynamic similarities and differences are analyzed the forces of the semi circle pt i and pt ii under the three cases of cooker et al 1990 are calculated and compared it is found that the maximum vertical forces of pt i and pt ii are smaller than that of the semi circle the vertical force of pt ii is the smallest 3 in order to analyze the wave dissipating effects of pt i and pt ii an energy method is proposed to evaluate the effects by calculating the energy of the incident and transmitted waves by analysing the propagation of the kinetic energy and potential energy of the incident solitary wave with different h d an empirical formula for the energy in terms of h d is proposed 4 the transmitted energy of pt i and pt ii is calculated which is compared with the incident wave energy to assess the wave dissipation effect c tp is higher than c tk which indicates that potential energy passes more easily through the submerged breakwater and that the blocking effect on kinetic energy is more obvious according to the comparison the different arrangements of the submerged breakwater formed by a combination of a quarter circular and a square structure have no significant influence on the wave dissipation effect whereas the depth has an obvious impact on the wave dissipation effect credit authorship contribution statement xinyu han conceptualization methodology software validation

21538,this study investigates the interaction between solitary wave and submerged breakwater based on smoothed particle hydrodynamics the goring wave making method is applied the interactions between a solitary wave and a submerged breakwater with rectangular and semi circular section are investigated to verify the ability of the presented numerical model a composite submerged breakwater is proposed by combining a quarter circle and a square the different arrangements of submerged breakwater are defined as profile type i pt i and profile type ii pt ii the forces of the semi circular of these two submerged breakwaters are calculated and compared in order to evaluate the wave dissipation effect of these two types of breakwaters we propose an empirical formula of incident wave energy and a novel concept of an energy transmission coefficient it is shown that potential energy is transmitted more easily through a submerged breakwater than kinetic energy the results reveal that the different arrangements of pt i and pt ii have no obvious effect on wave dissipation whereas the depth of the submerged breakwater has a significant influence keywords smoothed particle hydrodynamics solitary wave submerged breakwater energy transmission coefficient energy formula 1 introduction waves are an important driving factor for coastal erosion especially on open coasts in recent years with the enhanced awareness of environmental protection coastal engineering efforts are required not only to strengthen the security and reliability but also to pay attention to the ecology around the coast and natural landscape therefore submerged structures are increasingly used to protect wave eroded coasts the main function of a submerged breakwater is to force waves to break in advance owing to a sudden decrease in water depth such that the wave energy is attenuated over recent decades various studies have been carried out on the interaction between waves and submerged structures in theoretical analyses laboratory and field experiments and numerical simulations dattari et al 1978 mizutani et al 1998 beji and battjes 1993 presented the mechanism of high frequency wave energy acting on a submerged breakwater by experiments of waves propagating over a bar ting and kirby 1994 studied that waves propagating to a surf zone can produce undertow and turbulence in the form of spilling breakers and plunging breakers which show fundamental differences in turbulent intensity cho et al 2004 reported an experiment studying the strong reflection of regular water waves over submerged breakwaters in tandem jeng et al 2005 experimentally studied ocean waves propagating over a submerged breakwater in front of a vertical seawall carevic et al 2013 experimentally investigated water parameter of wave crossing a smooth submerged breakwater with the development of computational techniques and more accurate numerical schemes numerical studies of wave transformations over submerged breakwaters have become increasingly feasible and popular they play a significant role in providing tests and examinations for theories and reveal the mechanisms of complex physics the theories underpinning numerical models are mainly divided into three categories 1 potential flow theory this is based on the assumption that the flow is non viscous and irrotational and academics have done much work to apply it successfully to realistic scenarios cooker et al 1990 chian and ertekin 1992 beji and battjes 1994 ohyama and nadaoka 1994 chen et al 2017 although the potential flow theory succeeds in analyzing wave submerged interactions it neglects the flow characteristics near the structures such as flow separation vortex generation and wave breaking 2 viscous flow theory this is based on the navier stokes n s equation because the viscous and diffusion terms are considered in the n s equation it can simulate vertical flow characteristics and vortex development ji et al 2017 hence the application of numerical models based on the n s equation to study the wave structure interaction with improved accuracy is becoming popular jiang et al 2018 li and zhang 2019 the methods of solving the n s equation are mainly divided into mesh methods and mesh free methods because capturing the surface of a mesh free method is based on particle motion and does not need any other algorithm it is more appropriate for simulating a violent free surface such as a breaking wave 3 boussinesq equation the classical boussinesq equation exhibits weak dispersion and weak nonlinearity nwogu 1993 madsen and schaffer 1998 and gobbi et al 2000 made significant progress in enhancing the dispersion and nonlinearity there is no viscous term in boussinesq equation so it cannot simulate the attenuation process during wave propagation therefore many scholars overcome this shortcoming by adding damped term christov 2001 polat and ertaş 2009 wang and su 2015 the methods to describe fluid flow are divided into lagrangian methods that track the fluid particle movement and eulerian methods that track physical quantities at a fixed point in space when solving the above mathematical model the methods used are mainly divided into lagrangian and eulerian methods traditional computational fluid dynamics cfd techniques such as the finite difference method fdm jose et al 2017 finite element method fem long et al 2016 and finite volume method fvm liu and quek 2003 can solve the n s equation well from the numerical aspect much work has also been done to deal with capturing the flow surface based on the n s equation such as the volume of fluid method vof hirt and nichols 1981 level set method ls osher and fedkiw 2001 and constrained interpolation profile method cip hu and kashiwagi 2004 however eulerian grid numerical methods require expensive mesh generation and the results are significantly dependent on the grid quality and quantity such numerical schemes also have severe technical challenges associated with implementing conservative forces therefore the emergence of meshless schemes has provided a much needed alternative and several mesh free methods have been developed such as monte carlo methods binder 1988 and the particle fem oñate et al 2004 smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a fully lagrangian method which does not require any mesh grid it was originally invented to simulate astrodynamics in the 1970s lucy 1977 since then with development of the sph method the use of sph has expanded into many areas of solid and fluid dynamics such as large deformation collision blasting free surface flows and multiphase flows in engineering this method employs particles moving according to governing dynamics when simulating free surface flows the lagrangian nature of sph allows the domain to be multiply connected with no need for a special treatment of the surface this property makes the technique ideal for studying violent free surface flows barreiro et al 2013 regarding ocean and coastal engineering field sph can simulate wave propagation over a beach wave breaking impacting on structures and dam breaks monaghan 1994 presented the first attempt to study free surface flows based on sph then monaghan studied the behavior of gravity currents monaghan 1996 solitary waves and the dynamics of a solitary wave breaking on a beach monaghan and kos 1999 later the model was applied to study wave structure interactions colagrossi and landrini 2003 gomez gesteria and dalrymple 2004 used sph to study the dam break problem in three dimensions within the field of coastal engineering gotoh et al 2004 and shao 2005 used sph to study wave breakwater interactions and khayyer and gotoh 2009 used it to predict wave impact pressure due to sloshing waves altomare et al 2017 and altomare et al 2018 proposed an improved algorithm in sph for wave generation and absorption including passive and active wave absorption systems canelas and brito 2018 coupled sph and a multi body solver to reproduce complex flows roselli et al 2019 studied reproduced wave transformations and breaking in the surf zone the models simulating free surface flows based on sph are divided into weakly compressible sph wcsph and incompressible sph isph the main difference between them is that wcsph considers that the density of particle is weakly compressible and assumes the mass of each particle is constant but the density is variable therefore the pressure of each particle is obtained by solving the equation of state without the pressure poisson equation which improves the computational efficiency of solving the n s equation monaghan 1994 the state equation describes a very stiff density field and together with the natural disordering of the lagrangian particles high frequency low amplitude oscillations are found to populate the density scalar field molteni and colagrossi 2009 although the sph method is widely used in free surface flow simulation its computational cost is high in recent years graphics processing unit gpu acceleration provides an alternative for viable cheap and highly portable computing of sph and has been increasingly applied within the field of ocean engineering kawamura et al 2016 chen and wan 2019 wei et al 2019 compared to tradition central processing unit cpu gpu have huge number of computational cores in a graphic card which give more computational power than traditional cpu chow et al 2018 zhan et al 2019 used gpufactor and cpufactor the total computing time particle number the computational steps to evaluate the calculation efficiency of gpu and cpu and found that the computing speed of gtx 1080 is about 200 times that of a modern 12 cores cpu hérault et al 2010 used the computing unified device architecture cuda developed by nvidia to implement the sph method on a gpu the calculation speed is greatly improved domínguez et al 2013a and domínguez et al 2013b proposed optimization strategies for both cpu and gpu in dualsphysics and developed multi gpu implementation on heterogeneous clusters ji et al 2016 presented wcsph framework utilizing the parallel architecture of single and multi gpu platforms mokos et al 2015 simulated the multiphase flow by wcsph on s single gpu chow et al 2018 and chow et al 2019 used a gpu to accelerate isph method and make it possible to simulate millions of particles in three dimensional therefore the technique of gpu acceleration is provided in dualsphysics and the numerical simulations in this study were performed using a gpu card installed on a personal computer the objective of this study is to extend the sph method to solitary wave transformation over submerged breakwaters and analyze the relevant energy transmission characteristics four shapes of submerged structures rectangles semi cylinders and two composite profile types are chosen to investigate the phenomena this remainder of this article is organised as follows in section 2 details are provided on the numerical implementation of sph for the governing equations in section 3 the interaction of solitary waves with rectangular and semi cylindrical submerged dikes are calculated and discussed including comparisons to experimental data in section 4 the interaction of solitary waves and two types of composite submerged breakwaters are calculated and the wave elimination effects are energetically evaluated finally a summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 governing equations and numerical schemes 2 1 governing equation and its discretization based on sph sph is a fully lagrangian method in which no mesh is required and the fluid is discretised into a set of particles the n s equation for fluid can be written in the lagrangian form as follows 1 d ρ d t ρ v d v d t g 1 ρ p μ ρ 2 v equation system 1 includes the continuity and momentum equations ρ t v g and p represent the density time velocity gravitational acceleration and pressure respectively the conservation laws of fluid dynamics are transformed from their partial differential form to a form suitable for particle based simulations using integral equations based on an interpolation function typically the interpolation function is referred to as the kernel function w which is designed to represent a function f r defined in r by an integral approximation 2 f r f r w r r h d r kernel functions can take different forms with the most common being cubic or quantic the form affects not only the calculation time but also the stability of the calculation kernel functions must have several properties monaghan 1992 when the second derivative of a kernel function is discontinuous it becomes quite sensitive to particle disorder or the randomness of particle positions one kernel option is the quantic kernel described by wendland 1995 for which the weighting function vanishes for inter particle distances greater than 2 h it is defined as follows 3 w r h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 where q r h and α d 7 14 π h 2 are the normalization constants in two dimensions the function f in eq 2 can be expressed in a discrete form based on particles the information of particle a is determined by particles in the support domain thus the approximation of the function is interpolated at particle a and the summation is performed over all particles within the region of the compact support of the kernel 4 f r a b f r b m b ρ b w r a r b h 5 f r a b f r b m b ρ b a w a b where the value of particle a associated with neighbouring particle b is m b ρ b and m and ρ are mass and density respectively according to eq 4 and eq 5 sph provides a numerical discretization approach to represent partial differential equations by operating on the kernel function using eq 4 and eq 5 the system of n s equation 1 can be transformed to an sph form as follows 6 d ρ a d t b m b v a b a w a b 7 d v a d t b m b p b p a ρ a ρ b π a b a w a b g where g 0 9 81 m s 2 and w ab is the kernel function that depends on the distance between particles a and b the viscosity term π a b depending on the artificial viscosity is given by monaghan 1992 8 π a b α c a b μ a b ρ a b v a b r a b 0 0 v a b r a b 0 where r a b r a r b and v a b v a v b are particle position and velocity respectively μ a b h v a b r a b r a b 2 η 2 c a b 0 5 c a c b η 2 0 01 h 2 and α is a coefficient that must be tuned to introduce the proper dissipation the value α 0 01 was used in this work because it is the minimum value that prevents instability and spurious oscillations in the numerical scheme barreiro et al 2013 presented preliminary results simulating hydraulic loading and previous validations against experimental data were also described in that work to demonstrate the accuracy of the model in reproducing both wave propagation and wave impact on structures using the value α 0 01 according to monaghan 1994 a fluid can be treated as being weakly compressible the system is closed with the equation of state batchelor 1973 that the pressure calculated according to the density 9 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 and b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ with ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 and c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 in order to ensure the fluid is weakly compressible the sound speed is restricted to be at least ten times the maximum fluid value which keeps density variations to within less than 1 however the value of c0 is not the real speed of sound and thus the stability region of the time step is defined as 11 δ t c f l min min a h f a min a h c 0 max b h v a b r a b r a b 2 η 2 where f a is the force per unit mass owing to the use of the state equation the explicit time integration scheme of the time step is defined by the courant friedrichs lewy condition cfl the first term considers the force magnitudes and the second term takes the restriction arising from the viscous diffusion term into consideration 2 2 boundary conditions in this study the boundary conditions are expressed by a separate set of particles from the fluid particles this method is called dynamic boundary conditions dbc these boundary conditions are presented and validated by crespo et al 2007 in this method boundary particles have the same properties as fluid particles that satisfy the governing equation but they do not move or move with motion described when the distance between a fluid particle and a boundary particle less than twice the smoothing length h the density and pressure of the boundary particle increase according the pressure term of the momentum equation a repulsive force is generated in the boundary and fluid particles the validation of dbc shows good agreement with wave structure interaction altomare et al 2014 and wave generation altomare et al 2017 3 interaction of solitary wave with submerged breakwater wave generation is achieved using a moving boundary that mimics the displacement of a wave maker in a physical wave flume the numerical pistoncan move with pre imposed displacement both for regular and random waves and with the real motion that occurred in the experiments any physical models can be numerically reproduced including the pistongeometry and displacement piston type flap type wedge type etc 3 1 model application for solitary wave generation since russell discovered and proposed the solitary wave in 1834 and korteweg and de vries 1895 derived the kdv equation and obtained the analytical solution of a solitary wave solitary waves have received gradually increasing recognition as nonlinear and dispersive waves solitary waves have been widely utilised to study wave structure interactions the key issue to generate solitary waves is to reduce the wake as much as possible so that the wave surface remains stable during the propagation process the generation of solitary waves can be divided into three methods 1 dropping or sliding a heavy object 2 the lift at a flume bottom 3 piston wave maker the present work adopts the third method katell and eric 2002 compared the goring boussinesq shallow water first order kdv shallow water second order and rayleigh wave making methods the resulting solitary waves for dimensionless amplitudes ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 of rayleigh s as pour as goring s the goring piston motion equation is adopted to make a solitary wave the motion of the paddle is described as follows 13 x t s g tanh 7 6 t τ 0 5 14 s g 4 a h 0 3 15 τ 4 β c tanh 1 0 999 a h 0 where β 3 a h 0 3 c g h 0 a h 0 is the water depth and a is the amplitude a passive wave absorber is required to damp wave energy and reduce reflection exerted by the boundary of the model domain a damping zone is implemented in dualsphysics as a passive absorption system the damping system implementation consists of gradually reducing the velocity of the particles at each time step according to their location using quadratic rather than exponential decay thus the velocity is modified as follows 16 v v 0 f x δ t where v 0 is the initial velocity of particle i in the damping zone v is the final velocity and f x δ t is the reduction function defined as follows 17 f x δ t 1 δ t β x x 0 x 1 x 0 2 when simulating the solitary wave making and propagation it was found that this passive wave absorber is effective for controlling fluid velocity but it cannot control the surface height at which the velocity is equal to zero in the right boundary the surface height is not a stationary surface owing to the wave propagation in order to solve this problem another damping zone must be established behind the first damping zone with a spatial interval between them 3 2 interaction between solitary wave and rectangular submerged breakwater when a solitary wave propagates over a submerged breakwater the flow fields around the weather and lee side of the structure are unsteady owing to the flow separation and vortex generation this has been studied by many researchers through experiments zhuang and lee 1996 chang et al 2001 and numerical models zhuang and lee 1996 solved this problem using potential theory and a viscous rotational model respectively chang et al 2001 studied the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged rectangular breakwater though the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans k ε model ji et al 2017 performed simulations using the cip method and obtained great agreement with the experiment therefore this problem also serves as a good verification case for numerical models to calculate the velocity field of a solitary wave around a submerged breakwater wang et al 2018 studied the effect of the rectangle size on the wave transmission coefficient for this purpose numerical calculations were performed by the sph model and the obtained numerical results were compared with experimental data and other models results the experiment was carried out by zhuang and lee 1996 according to the schematic shown in fig 1 the wave conditions of the experiment were as follows height of the solitary wave is h 0 069 m and the water depth is d 0 228 m a rectangular submerged breakwater was installed in the tank with a height of d 0 114 m and length of l 0 381 m zhuang and lee 1996 measured the horizontal and vertical velocities at two fixed points after the breakwater point 1 and point 2 by laser doppler velocimetry ldv as shown in fig 1 the two points were in the same vertical plane 0 034 m downstream from the lee side of the submerged breakwater point 1 and point 2 were located 4 and 5 72 cm above the bed respectively 3 2 1 solitary wave making test before simulating the interaction between the solitary wave and submerged breakwater the reliability and accuracy of wave making must be tested the motion of the wave paddle is controlled by the goring method the length of the numerical flume is 10 m the water depth d 0 228 m and the wave height h 0 069 m the wave paddle is located at x 0 m the velocity damping zone is set between 7 and 10 m and β 10 as fig 2 four wave gauges are placed at 1 3 4 and 5 m to monitor the changes in the free surface the convergence behavior of sph model was investigated by three resolutions of dp 0 005 m 0 0025 m and 0 001 m corresponding to 88 896 350 815 2 194 921 particles respectively the time histories of surface elevation at st1 st4 are shown in fig 3 the horizontal and vertical axis is time and surface elevations respectively from this figure we could find that the free surface elevations of different resolutions are almost coincident at each specific measuring position and the amplitude of the wake wave is less than 5 of the solitary wave height which means a convergent result is obtained 3 2 2 solitary wave passing over the submerged rectangular breakwater the numerical simulation of a solitary wave passing through a submerged breakwater is shown in fig 4 it can be seen that the process of solitary waves crossing a rectangle can be divided into three stages in the first stage when the solitary wave just passes through the submerged breakwater the velocity rises rapidly at the intersection of the top and weather side and the velocity above this area increases markedly at the same time a vortex is generated above this point and gradually increases in the second stage when the solitary wave is above the top of the rectangle the velocity field above the top reaches its maximum but the velocity at the weather side and lee side is close to 0 at this stage the vorticity at the intersection of the top and weather side continues to increase as the solitary wave propagates to the lee side the vortex has been generated and gradually increased at the intersection of the top and lee sides in the third stage the solitary wave passes through the submerged breakwater and leaves the lee side at this stage the velocity of weather side and lee side is reduced gradually the vortex at the weather side also begins to decay the vortex generated on the lee side is clockwise and it develops towards the lee side the diameter of the vortex gradually increases but its intensity gradually weakens for the interaction between solitary waves and a submerged breakwater various scholars use such experiments to test the accuracy of proposed numerical models fig 5 shows the results of the horizontal and vertical velocity values at point 1 and point 2 in the above experiments by the model proposed by the above scholars and the comparison between the experimental values and the model the x axis represents the dimensionless time t g d and the y axis represents the dimensionless velocity u g d w g d it can be seen from fig 5 that the model based on potential flow theory is inconsistent with the experimental results because potential flow theory is based on a fluid with inviscid and irrotational assumptions which cannot simulate vortex generation and wave breaking near the submerged breakwater on the contrary the numerical results of the other four models based on viscous flow theory can reproduce the velocity tendencies and show relatively good agreement with the experimental results in order to analyze the resolution independence of the simulation the different resolutions of dp 0 005 m and 0 001 m are adopted it can be seen that the results of dp 0 005 m and 0 001 m are similar and basically consistent with the experimental result the results of dp 0 001 m is better in horizontal velocity and the results of dp 0 005 m is better in vertical velocity when t g d 19 to study the effects of different turbulence models on the simulation results the mass and momentum conservation equations are treated with different models eq 6 and delta sph formula molteni and colagrossi 2009 are adopted for treating mass conservation equation respectively artificial viscosity monaghan 1992 and sub particle scale sps stress gotoh et al 2004 are adopted for treating momentum conservation equation respectively the resolution of particle size is 0 005 m and calculation results are shown in fig 6 it can be seen that the simulation results of all models are similar and have good agreement with experimental data when t g d 15 when t g d 15 the results of sps sph oscillate numerical results are overestimated in horizontal velocity when t g d 19 and underestimated in vertical velocity when t g d 12 in general the numerical results are basically consistent with experimental results the results of π sph model agree best with experiment and π sph model is used for following simulations 3 3 interaction between solitary wave and semi circular cylinder as a new type breakwater the submerged semi circular breakwater has been widely used owing to its good stability and many researchers have extensively investigated it cooker et al 1990 studied the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged semi circular breakwater based on a fully nonlinear two dimensional irrotational numerical method xie 1999 introduced a new method to calculate the wave forces acting on a submerged semi circular breakwater yuan and tao 2003 studied the wave forces acting on a semi circular breakwater based on a boundary element method bem fdm coupled technique peng et al 2012 simulated the deformation of a free surface based on the immersed boundary method ibm and vof liu and li 2013 studied oblique wave interactions with a submerged perforated semi circular breakwater based on the linear potential theory jiang et al 2017 studied the wave load on submerged quarter circular and semi circular breakwaters under irregular waves by experiments and rans vof model there are three cases in the experiments reported by cooker et al 1990 to examine the effects of three water depths and solitary wave amplitudes a submerged semi circular cylinder was cemented to the concrete bed of a wave tank with the fixed radius value of r 20 4 cm three wave gauges were placed at nine positions in different cases to obtain the wave surface heights as shown in fig 7 the wave tank was 70 m long with a piston type wave maker at left end and a wave absorbing zone to damp out passive waves table 1 lists the experimental parameters and the measurement positions in each case in order to decrease the simulation time the numerical wave tank was reduced to 12 m and with a wave damping zone the centre of the semi circular breakwater was at x 5 m two particle sizes d p 0 005 m and d p 0 001 m were calculated the velocity field vorticity field and surface results of the three cases are shown in figs 8 10 3 3 1 solitary wave propagation in case 1 when the solitary wave begins to contact the submerged levee the velocity of the semi cylinder surface increases significantly owing to the large velocity gradient an eddy appears on the cylinder surface as shown in fig 8 t 3 5 s 3 8 s as the solitary wave propagates forward the velocity reaches its maximum when the solitary wave propagates to the top a second crest grows on the lee side of the semi cylinder and it continues to propagate forward due to the submerged levee the incident wave crest is obstructed and reverses its direction propagating backward as a reflected wave t 4 3 s 4 5 s in this process because the velocity of the lee side increases and its direction is upward along the surface of the cylinder the vortex on the cylinder surface is lifted and developed on the backside of the cylinder a small drop appears when the reflected wave propagates forward t 5 3 s 3 3 2 solitary wave propagation in case 2 in this case because of the higher h d when the solitary wave is in contact with the submerged breakwater the velocity field above the semi cylinder increases rapidly and the wave surface becomes steep as shown in fig 9 t 2 8 s 2 9 s a second crest was generated in the backward direction owing to the instability of the crest during the propagation process the second wave collapses and breaks during the period t 3 3 s 3 5 s this plays an important role in wave elimination simultaneously the free surface of the backward propagating wave becomes significantly steep and reverse breaking occurs during t 3 5 s 4 1 s these phenomena are called a forward breaker f b and backward breaker b b by cooker et al 1990 the vortex generation and development are similar to those of case 1 and the eddy generated by wave breaking in the surface is absorbed by the bigger vortex on the backside 3 3 3 solitary wave propagation in case 3 fig 10 shows the velocity field vorticity field and free surface near the submerged breakwater during the interaction between the solitary wave and the semi circular structure under case 3 in the process of solitary wave propagation the crest crest exchange occurs the tail of the solitary wave becomes steep and breaks behind the semi cylinder because the cylinder is close to the free surface the eddy generated by the wave breaking is more easily absorbed by the large vortex in this numerical model when the particle size is large there is a gap between the interaction of the fluid and the boundary the gap is a result of a pressure overestimation across density discontinuities but the gap will be smaller when the particle size decreases two sizes dp 0 001 m and dp 0 005 m are adopted to solve this problem and a comparison of the experimental and numerical results for these two sizes are shown in fig 11 it is indicated that the numerical results agree with the experimental results and the result for dp 0 001 m fits better with the experimental results than that for dp 0 005 m the main reason for this is their different resolution such that the former describes the free surface more accurately than the latter especially with respect to wave breaking but dp 0 005 m is still consistent with the experimental results 4 interaction between solitary wave and composite submerged breakwater from the interaction of a solitary wave with a rectangular and semi circular submerged breakwater the sph numerical method can simulate wave breaking and solve the problem of the interaction between the submerged breakwater and solitary wave effectively and accurately owing to the different structures of the submerged levees they exhibit different wave elimination performance based on the above rectangular and semi circular submerged breakwater a new form of a submerged structure is proposed fig 12 the numerical wave flume based on sph is used to study the hydrodynamic characteristics and wave elimination effects of a solitary wave and the composite submerged levee two ways of placing the new submerged levee are studied and their wave elimination effects are compared profile type i pt i refers to placing the quarter circle on the left side and profile type ii pt ii refers to placing the rectangular straight wall on the left side the radii of pt i and pt ii are the same as that of the above semi circular structure r 20 4 cm and their lengths are 2 r the same three working conditions as for the semi circular structure are also set simulating the process of a solitary waving passing through the submerged levee and the wave transmittance effects pt i and pt ii are compared figs 13 18 shows the changes in the velocity field vorticity field and free surface near the submerged breakwater during the interaction between a solitary wave and pt i and pt ii under three cases the main differences between pt i and pt ii in the process are as follows 1 in the velocity field it can be seen that the weather side of pt ii is rectangular with an abrupt change in its section a sharp increase in velocity and a large velocity gradient are generated however the weather side of pt i is an arc and the fluid transitions along the arc to the top gradually the velocity field of pt i does not change as much as that of pt ii the lee side of pt i is rectangular owing to the abrupt change in cross section as the wave propagates to the back the velocity of the back increases forming a large velocity gradient for pt ii the lee side is an arc surface and the velocity gradually transitions however it can be seen from the velocity field of fig 14 t 3 8 s and t 3 9 s that when a solitary wave propagates to the lee side a small belt with low velocity is formed on the lee side 2 in the vorticity field a vortex generally appears at an abrupt change in cross section the weather side of pt i is an arc surface and there is no large vortex is generated on the arc surface the lee side of pt i is rectangular and a large vortex is generated behind the submerged structure and it continues to exist for a long time the weather side of pt ii is rectangular which creates a vortex at the top of the embankment the vortex gradually develops downward along the arc of the lee side at the same time a phenomenon is observed in the vorticity field of fig 14 t 3 8 s and t 3 9 s velocity gradient is the main reason for the vortex generation on the lee side 3 in terms of wave breaking none is observed for pt i in case 1 and a small wave breaking is produced in the back of the submerged structure in case 2 breaking is produced in pt i and pt ii at the lee side the breaking position of pt i is farther away from the submerged breakwater than that of pt ii the breaking strength of pt i is smaller than that of pt ii finally in case 3 the breaking position of pt i is farther away from the submerged breakwater than that of pt ii 4 the forces of the semi circular pt i and pt ii submerged breakwaters under three cases are calculated and the results are shown in fig 19 axis of x and z are along the length and depth of flume respectively f x and f z are the horizontal and vertical force of submerged breakwater the time history curves of f x and f z also exhibit a form of a solitary wave with a wake after it that is mainly due to the reverse wave breaking produced on the lee side it can be seen that f z is higher than f x in each case under three cases the peaks of pt i and pt ii are same and larger than that of the semicircle the maximum of f z of pt ii is the smallest in magnitude pt i is second and the semicircle the largest from the values of f x f z and the total force the main force exerted by a solitary wave on the submerged breakwater is the increased gravitational force caused by the rise in the water level 4 1 wave eliminating effects of the new submerged breakwater under solitary wave in describing the wave eliminating effect of submerged breakwaters previous studies used the transmission and reflection coefficients as indicators to evaluate the breakwater ability in this study an energy method is proposed to evaluate the wave eliminating effect of a submerged levee by analysing the energy of the incident wave and transmitted wave the ratio of the energy of the transmitted wave and incident wave can be used as an indicator called the energy transmission coefficient cet to investigate the wave eliminating effect of the submerged breakwater a small value of cet indicates that a large amount of energy is consumed by the interaction with the submerged breakwater and that it has a strong elimination effect on the contrary a large value of cet indicates that the transmitted wave is large and that the wave eliminating effect of the submerged breakwater is poor the wave making is simulated at water depths of d 0 34 0 2914 and 0 255 m as in the three cases with the semi cylinder h d ranges from 0 06 to 0 85 in the numerical wave tank the kinetic energy potential energy and total energy of the solitary wave are calculated because the fluid is represented by particles the accumulation of the particle energy in the integration is the energy of the fluid in this region in addition because the amount of energy added is of more concern the energy increment is calculated in a specific region the number of particles does not remain constant therefore the mass energy density is introduced to represent the energy the formulas for the mass energy densities of the kinetic energy potential energy and total energy are as follows 18 e d k i 1 n 1 2 m i u i 2 u i 0 2 π r p 2 ρ i 19 e d p i 1 n m i g h i π r p 2 ρ i 20 e d t e d k e d p where u i 0 0 r p is particle radius and z axis is water depth direction if the z position of particle i z i is greater than the depth then h i z i otherwise h i 0 according to eq 18 20 the energy of a solitary wave is calculated fig 20 shows the changes in ed k ed p and ed t with different values of h d i e d 0 34 0 2914 and 0 255 m respectively the proportions of kinetic energy and potential energy are shown in the upper left corner of each graph from fig 20 a c we can see the following 1 with increasing depth ed k ed p and ed t increase significantly under the same h d 2 at the same water depth with the increase of h d the growth rate of kinetic energy increases the growth rate of potential energy decreases and the total energy essentially shows linear growth 3 the proportion of potential energy is larger than that of kinetic energy as h d increases the proportion of potential energy decreases gradually and that of kinetic energy increases gradually but the potential energy is always greater than the kinetic energy in order to observe the influence of water depth on the proportions of kinetic and potential energy we compare the ratios of kinetic and potential energy for d 0 34 0 2914 and 0 255 m the results are shown in fig 20 d it is evident that the kinetic and potential energy ratio curves of the three different water depths are essentially coincident this illustrates why the proportions of kinetic and potential energy are only related to h d because of the symmetry about proportion 0 5 one curve is described and the other curve can be known the potential energy curve is fitted to an exponential function using the least squares method the results are shown in fig 21 and the fitting formulas are shown in eq 21 and eq 22 21 e p o t e t o t a l 0 1071 e 1 2585 h d 1 5097 0 5152 22 e k i n e t o t a l 0 4848 0 1071 e 1 2585 h d 1 5097 4 2 transmission energy and wave dissipation assessment of pt i and pt ii through numerical simulation of the interaction between a solitary wave and submerged breakwater at different h d when r d is 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 the mass energy density behind the dike is obtained when the solitary wave passes over a flow vortex is formed after the submerged breakwater when the initial wave height is large the wave will be lifted up leading to the instability and eventual breaking of the solitary wave flow vortex formation and wave breaking are the main forms of dissipation in order to express the energy of the solitary wave after it crosses the submerged breakwater and at the same time to remove the energy of the vortex and wave breaking behind the submerged dike the energy calculation is performed in the range of x 6 5 m to 11 5 m and the submerged breakwater is located at x 5 m fig 22 and fig 23 shows the energy of the submerged dike under different h d with r d 0 6 0 7 and 0 8 for pt i and pt ii the x axis represents h d the y axis shows the position of the wave crest x wc and the z axis indicates the energy density figs 22 and 23 shows the following 1 for the same type of submerged breakwater the kinetic energy potential energy and total energy increase with increasing h d moreover at the same h d with the depth and wave height increase the energy of the transmitted wave is higher 2 when the solitary wave enters the integral region completely the energy remains essentially unchanged when the wave exits the integral region ed k ed p and ed t is decrease the potential energy is significantly higher than the kinetic energy 3 with the increase in h d the growth of ed k in the integral region is concave and the growths of ed p and ed t are convex 4 as the solitary wave passes through the submerged breakwater the proportions of ed k and ed p in the integral region are as shown in fig 24 as h d increases the proportions of ed k and ed p gradually increase and decrease respectively analysing the energy of the transmitted wave in the integral region under different cases reveals that the trends of the transmitted wave energy in pt i and pt ii are essentially the same to study and compare their wave eliminating effects the following work was done because the energy of the solitary wave changes after passing over the submerged breakwater the energy transmission coefficient is proposed as an indicator to evaluate the effect of wave dissipation the initial energy of the solitary wave is calculated in section 4 1 the energy of the transmitted wave is integrated in the range of x 6 5 11 5 m after the submerged breakwater in order to ensure the transmitted wave enters the integral domain the energy is calculated when the wave crest is located at x 9 m fig 25 is the comparison of transmitted wave energy of pt i and pt ii when wave crest position at x 9 m it can be seen that the transmitted wave energy of pt i and pt ii are basically the same at the same water depth the dissipation of e k e p and e t increases with increasing h d the proportion of energy dissipation increases with the decrease of water depth according to eq 23 25 the transmission coefficients of the kinetic energy c tk potential energy c tp and total energy c tt can be obtained 23 c t k e d t k e d i k 24 c t p e d t p e d i p 25 c t t e d t t e d i t the wave dissipation effects of pt i and pt ii are evaluated by energy transmission coefficients to determine the effects of wave dissipation of different arrangements of this composite submerged breakwater fig 26 shows the energy transmission coefficients of pt i and pt ii under different water depths the wave dissipating ability of pt i is slightly better than that of pt ii with the decrease in water depth the energy transmission coefficient decreases this reveals that the shallower the water depth the stronger the wave dissipating effect of the submerged breakwater because the proportion of potential energy is higher than that of kinetic energy the curve of c tt is close to that of c tp in all cases c tk is less than c tp in the process of wave propagation the potential energy passes more easily through the submerged breakwater however the kinetic energy is dissipated by a greater proportion at different depths the trend of energy transmission with h d is different when r d 0 6 the transmission coefficients of the potential energy and total energy generally show a downward trend whereas when r d 0 7 and 0 8 the transmission coefficients of the potential energy and total energy first increase and then decrease with increasing h d under the three water depths the curves of c tt and c tp of pt i and pt ii are substantially coincident in r d 0 6 and 0 7 the curves of c tk of pt i and pt ii are also essentially the same when wave amplitude is small at r d 0 6 the coefficient of pt i and pt ii fluctuates significantly for r d 0 8 the c tk curve of pt ii is higher than that of pt i it can be concluded that the different arrangements of the submerged breakwater consisting of a composite structure of a quarter circle and a square have no significant influence on the wave dissipation effect the energy transmission coefficients decrease with increasing r d indicating that r d has a significant impact on the wave dissipation effect of the submerged breakwater 5 conclusions in this study the sph model is adopted to simulate the interaction between a solitary wave and a submerged breakwater two composite submerged breakwaters denoted as pt i and pt ii are introduced and their wave dissipation effects are assessed by energy calculations 1 a comprehensive validation of the sph model is performed by comparing the experimental and numerical results of velocity monitors and free surface gauges which reveal that the model is effective and accurate in solving such problems 2 according to simulations of the interaction between a solitary wave and composite submerged breakwater pt i and pt ii based on the sph model the hydrodynamic similarities and differences are analyzed the forces of the semi circle pt i and pt ii under the three cases of cooker et al 1990 are calculated and compared it is found that the maximum vertical forces of pt i and pt ii are smaller than that of the semi circle the vertical force of pt ii is the smallest 3 in order to analyze the wave dissipating effects of pt i and pt ii an energy method is proposed to evaluate the effects by calculating the energy of the incident and transmitted waves by analysing the propagation of the kinetic energy and potential energy of the incident solitary wave with different h d an empirical formula for the energy in terms of h d is proposed 4 the transmitted energy of pt i and pt ii is calculated which is compared with the incident wave energy to assess the wave dissipation effect c tp is higher than c tk which indicates that potential energy passes more easily through the submerged breakwater and that the blocking effect on kinetic energy is more obvious according to the comparison the different arrangements of the submerged breakwater formed by a combination of a quarter circular and a square structure have no significant influence on the wave dissipation effect whereas the depth has an obvious impact on the wave dissipation effect credit authorship contribution statement xinyu han conceptualization methodology software validation

21539,a comparative study on the flow structures behind square and wavy square were performed to understand the wake characteristics under spanwise periodic perturbation the high speed piv measurements were carried out at reynolds number of 4075 the time averaged flow field suggested that wavy leading edge triggered the alternative secondary vortices along the span the instantaneous flow field indicated that the regular asymmetric vortex shedding mode was changed to symmetric mode by wavy leading edge it was found that periodical large scale flows were suppressed while the motions of small scale vortical structures were enhanced by the wavy leading edge based on the continuous wavelet transform the modal energy distribution of the dynamic mode decomposition suggested that the wavy leading edge weakened the dominance of large scale vortical structure and promoted the transition from large scale to small scale vortical structure the spatial patterns of representative dynamic modes dm1 and dm2 in streamwise plane indicated that the wavy leading edge changed the wake flow by the distortion of karman vortex and its corresponding secondary vortical structure which made the vortical structures more unstable and dissipates more quickly furthermore the phase averaging process based on temporal coefficients of dm1 and dm2 revealed that the separated shear layer of wavy square cylinder extended to further downstream and the separated vortex was broken into several relatively small vortices during the shedding process keywords piv vortex square cylinder wake wavy square cylinder wavelet transform dynamic mode decomposition 1 introduction turbulent flows around bluff bodies are very common flow phenomenon encountered in numerous engineering applications such as offshore platforms heat exchangers chimneys high rise buildings and bridge decks despite their geometric variety the dominant feature of wake flows behind slender bluff bodies is the occurrence of vortex shedding which can give rise to drag force lift fluctuation structural vibration and acoustic noise to eliminate these adverse effects the control of vortex shedding is very desirable the main objective of wake control is to reduce the drag force and to minimize the effects of vortex induced vibration acting on bluff body among previous studies on flow control passive control technique is preferred due to its simplicity and it does not require external energy to manipulate the flow field in the past decades flow control methods referred to as 2d and 3d forcing choi et al 2008 have been successfully applied to suppress the vortex shedding of various bluff bodies typical applications for 2d forcing can be achieved by means of placing splitter plate rathakrishnan 2012 liu et al 2016 or control rod chen et al 2013 chauhan et al 2019 in the downstream or upstream of bluff body with the development of knowledge on secondary wake instabilities williamson 1988 robichaux et al 1999 naghib lahouti et al 2014 luo et al 2007 dobre et al 2004 it has been well understood that two dimensional bluff body wake flows are dominated by primary instability which leads to the large scale vortex formation and secondary instabilities which play important roles in the transition of wake flow into turbulence these instabilities make the wake flows of bluff bodies very attractive and serve as basis for flow control for 3d forcing control strategies spanwise periodic geometric modifications or suction and blowing are commonly applied to affect the vortex shedding process by excitation of secondary instabilities up to now the 3d forcing method has been successfully applied to circular cylinder blunt tailing edge profiled body and square cylinder kim et al 2005 lam et al 2009 2010 2012 zhang et al 2005 new et al 2015 naghib lahouti et al 2012 antiohos et al 2015bib lam et al 2012 among the above mentioned 3d forcing flow control approaches it is worthy to note that these approaches are most effective when the perturbation parameter is equal to the wavelength of the dominant secondary instability for square cylinder darekar and sherwin 2001 numerically studied the square cylinders with spanwise sinusoidal perturbations in the range of low reynolds numbers 10 re 150 their work demonstrated that maximum base drag reduction was achieved at the perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d d represents the leading edge height of square cylinder which is close to the mode a instability wavelength of a square cylinder proposed by robichaux et al 1999 and luo et al 2007 at low reynolds numbers at a reynolds number of 23 500 dobre et al 2006 experimentally investigated the wake flow characteristics of a square cylinder with wavy leading edge up to 78 reduction of turbulence intensity was obtained at the perturbation wavelength of 2 4 d this wavelength is equal to the spanwise spacing of secondary instability reported in their previous study dobre et al 2004 similar results of wavy square cylinder can be found in the work by berman and owen 1998 at a high reynolds number of 40 000 however the maximum drag reduction was achieved at the perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d which corresponds to the mode a instability wavelength at low reynolds numbers from the above literatures it is found that the sinusoidal perturbation method is effective in both laminar and turbulent case however the wavelength of secondary instability is not universal for the flow control of square cylinder at different reynolds numbers until recently most studies on 3d forcing method the fall within the range of low reynolds number re 3000 and relatively high reynolds number re 10 000 therefore it would be of interest to investigate the spanwise perturbation s effect at an intermediate reynolds number as is known the wake formed behind bluff body is random in temporal and spatial domain exhibiting unsteady structures with a wide range of scales in the past decades many techniques such as continuous wavelet transform cwt wavelet multi resolution analysis and dynamic mode decomposition dmd have been employed in a wide range of applications due to their capacity of determining flow structures sorted with frequency content li 1998 developed a continuous wavelet based correlation method on fluctuation velocity by which coherent and incoherent structures were clearly identifiable in the time frequency plane rinoshika and zhou 2005 applied wavelet multi resolution technique to analyze the velocity data simultaneously obtained in two orthogonal planes in the turbulent near wake of a circular cylinder the velocity fields were decomposed into different scales based on their central frequency within a certain frequency band as the other popular technique the dynamic mode decomposition is an efficient technique to obtain a mode containing only a single centralized frequency component at a specific scale schmid et al 2011 to give further understanding of flow dynamics over square cylinder under spanwise perturbation the detailed information on time frequency characteristics as well as multi scale turbulent structure of the wake flow should be acquired this is of fundamental significance and has not been previously investigated thus motivating the present work to study the effect of spanwise periodic perturbation on the wake characteristics at an intermediate reynolds number wavy geometry is introduced to the leading edge of a square cylinder with a perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d which corresponds to the wavelength of mode a instability at low reynolds numbers the flow structures behind wavy square cylinder are experimentally investigated using piv measurement comparative investigations are performed with a square cylinder firstly the first and second order statistics are performed to evaluate the time averaged flow fields secondly continuous wavelet transform was used to reveal the time frequency characteristics then the dynamic mode decomposition is employed to further investigate the measured flow fields at a specific scale finally based on the temporal coefficients of dynamic modes the data ensembles are phase sorted and analyzed in phase averaged flow patterns 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental models as shown in fig 1 two dimensional square and wavy square cylinder models were adopted in the present study to investigate the effect of wavy geometry the square cylinder model having an edge of d 20 mm and a width of l 400 mm was adopted as the base case for the wavy cylinder the cross section with maximum transverse edge of d 20 mm is referred to as node plane and the cross section with minimum transverse edge is referred to as saddle plane the aspect ratio of the two tested models is l d 20 with respect to the width l the wavelength λ between two nodes is 5 6 d and the sinusoidal amplitude w is 0 45 d which corresponds to the wave steepness factor of w λ 0 08 based on the geometrical parameters of λ d and w λ the wavy square cylinder falls within the range of flow regime i summarized by dobre et al 2006 in which the flow is considered to be highly controlled 2 2 high speed piv measurement the measurements were conducted using the circulating water channel of rinoshika s laboratory at the yamagata university which has 400 mm width 300 mm height 1000 mm length test section the two side walls were equipped with transparent glass plate for laser illumination and flow field visualization to ensure the flow homogeneity a settling chamber a honeycomb three turbulence damping screens and a contraction were placed before the test section the freestream velocity was uniform and the turbulent intensity was less than 0 5 in an empty test section the piv measurements were carried out at a constant free stream velocity of u 0 21 m s which corresponds to reynolds number re 4075 based on the leading edge height of experimental model the schematic view of the experimental configuration is shown in fig 2 the experimental model spanned the entire width of the test section and was placed in the water channel at the middle depth the velocity fields behind the experimental models were measured by provision piv a continuous laser and a high speed camera were used to implement the piv system the compact laser generated by a 4 w continuous laser source was fitted with a cylindrical lens to produce a 1 5 mm light sheet along the measurement planes of experimental models the high speed camera photron fastcam sa3 used in this study has a maximum spatial resolution of 1024 1024 pixels with a full frame rate of 1000 fps frame per second polystyrene particles with diameter of 10 25 μm were used as the piv tracers in the flow loop as shown in fig 2a and b the measurements were performed on spanwise plane x y and streamwise plane x z respectively to evaluate the effect of wavy geometry measurements were carried out on the node middle and saddle planes fig 1b along streamwise direction in the x y and x z plane a frame rate of 250 fps was set and the digital images were captured with a resolution of 1024 1024 pixels and 1024 768 pixels respectively the instantaneous velocity vector fields were generated using fft based cross correlation technique between two successive particle images and the erroneous vectors no more than 4 of the total velocity vectors were replaced by interpolated vectors using gaussian interpolation scheme integrated in provision piv software two representative images of x y and x z plane having the domain of 240 mm 240 mm 12d 12d and 200 mm 160 mm 10 d 8 d are presented in fig 2c and d respectively and the typical size of particle image was about 4 pixels the interrogation window size was 32 32 pixels with 50 overlap for each experimental condition providing 120 120 and 100 80 velocity vectors over x y and x z plane respectively hence the pixel size is about 0 2mm pixel and the spatial resolution of velocity vectors is about 2 0 mm the bios error of the experimental system was no more than 0 5 the streamwise and vertical velocity errors associated with the experimental uncertainty was less than 0 91 and 2 1 respectively the statistical uncertainty of the measured velocity field was estimated to be no more than 3 1 with a 95 confidence level to determine the time averaged mean flow structure 3000 instantaneous velocity fields were measured in the present study 3 dynamic mode decomposition on flow field the dynamic mode decomposition dmd is an efficient technique to obtain a mode decomposition of a given ensemble of dataset at a single specific frequency this approach was developed based on koopman analysis of nonlinear system rowley et al 2009 which represents an approximation of a time resolved sequence from a nonlinear process by a linear mapping among the numerically generated or experimentally measured samples the detailed implementation of dmd and its application on fluid dynamic analysis have been given by schmid et al 2010 and schmid et al 2011 in the present study the dmd approach was employed to extract flow structures measured by piv experiment and the implementation of it will be briefly described as follows before the decomposition the mean velocity field was removed to obtain the fluctuating velocities over the measurement domain the sequential realizations of fluctuating velocity field was given by v x i y j n v x i y j n v x i y j i 1 n x j 1 n y n 1 n t here the v denotes streamwise or vertical velocity component the x i and y j represent the local spatial positions and the n is the time sequence of snapshot to perform dynamic mode decomposition the calculated fluctuating velocity fields v x i y j n were organized into a single matrix v 1 n with the size of 2n x n y n t 1 v 1 n v 1 v 2 v n u 1 1 u 1 2 u 1 n u 2 1 u 2 1 u 2 n u n x n y 1 u n x n y 1 u n x n y n v 1 1 v 1 2 v 1 n v 2 1 v 2 2 v 1 n v n x n y 1 v n x n y 1 v n x n y n in the resulting matrix v 1 n the symbol denotes that the instantaneous fluctuating velocities over the measurement domain were spatially discretized and rearranged into a column vector v j for each snapshot here the first n x n y elements of each column correspond to the instantaneous streamwise fluctuating velocity field and the last n x n y elements are the corresponding vertical fluctuating velocity field as for the row vector of matrix v 1 n the elements correspond to time series of fluctuating streamwise or vertical velocity components sampled at a constant time interval δt since the number of snapshots is large enough the flow field can be expressed by a linear mapping from one snapshot to the next the linear mapping operator a can be written as v j 1 a v j applying the mapping operator a over entire time sequences we obtain 2 a v 1 n 1 v 2 n v 1 n 1 s r e n 1 t v 1 n 1 s here the operator a acts as a role of shifting the flow field along temporal direction with an interval of δt thus the eigenvalues of a provide temporal dynamic characteristics of the flow field the matrix s is a companion matrix approximating the last nth sample by a linear combination of the previous n 1 samples the companion matrix s can be computed from eq 3 in a least squares sense by which the residual r is minimized the least squares problem for matrix s can be solved by qr decomposition based on the two data sets v 1 n 1 and v 2 n and it is given by 3 s r 1 q h v 2 n with q r v 1 n 1 the final step of mode decomposition contains computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix s and it can be expressed by 4 d m i v 1 n 1 v i where the v i is ith eigenvector of s it is known that the eigenvalues λ i s v i λ i v i of s are approximations to some of the eigenvalues of the mapping matrix a which describes the inter snapshot dynamics and provides information on dynamical process in the flow field a dynamic mode d m i can be obtained by the projection of instantaneous flow field onto its corresponding eigenvector providing spatial information on the physical structures contained in the mode for a specific dynamic mode d m i its growth decay rate and frequency can be determined by the real and imaginary parts of ω via the transform ω log λ i δ t ω r ω i moreover the dmd analysis provides a measure to evaluate the energy contained in each mode by the modulus of dynamic mode d m i in general the dmd would help us to evaluate the dominance of dynamic mode and its associated spatial distributions and to extract the relevant flow structure from the unsteady flow field 4 results and discussion 4 1 wake flow structures 4 1 1 time averaged flow structures in the present study the spatial distributions of time averaged streamlines streamwise velocity vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy tke were calculated by the measured 3000 instantaneous velocity fields and the first and second order turbulent statistics were normalized by u and u 2 respectively fig 3 a shows the time averaged streamline pattern and streamwise velocity contour of square cylinder in the xy plane a reversed flow region approximately parallel to the square cylinder is clearly discerned by the time averaged streamline pattern characterized by negative streamwise velocity distribution within it the streamwise velocity approaches to zero approximately at the distance of 1 15d from the rear of square cylinder indicating the formation length of reversed flow region at the downstream of x d 1 15 the streamwise velocity gradually increases to u u 0 8 different with the distribution shown in fig 3a the time averaged streamlines and streamwise velocity of wavy square cylinder exhibit strong periodicity along spanwise direction the region with negative streamwise velocity displays oval like shape and is shifted further downstream compared with that of square cylinder the maximum and minimum length 1 8 d and 3 6 d of reversed flow region appears alternatively from the saddle to the node location of wavy square cylinder indicating the elongation of reversed flow region these observations suggest that the introducing of wavy geometry modifies the near wake structure significantly and results in longer vortex formation length than that of square cylinder fig 4 shows the time averaged vorticity contours of square and wavy square cylinder in xy plane although previous study wu et al 1996 of instantaneous flow fields suggest the existence of secondary vortices behind various straight bluff bodies it is difficult to capture such vortical structures in a time averaged sense as they are varying in both time and spatial domain for the square cylinder fig 4a no well organized vortical structures can be observed and the vorticity tends to be distributed randomly in the measurement domain similar results are also observed in the horizontal plane behind a circular cylinder by zhang et al 2005 this can be attributed to the unsteadiness of secondary vortices and the cancellation of relatively small scale turbulent fluctuations in the time averaging process for the wavy square cylinder as presented in fig 4b well organized vortices corresponding to geometrical variation are observed to be locked into fixed position with positive and negative peaks distributed alternately along spanwise direction the appearance of vorticity peaks can be attributed to the entrainment of high shear adjacent flow around the geometric nodes saddles the vorticity distribution of wavy square cylinder suggests the three dimensional nature resulting from the wavy leading edge besides it is worthy to note that the wavy square cylinder possesses higher vorticity concentration than that of square cylinder indicating that the wavy geometry enhances the strength of secondary vortical structures the normalized tke turbulent kinetic energy distributions of square and wavy square cylinders are shown in fig 5 for the wavy square cylinder fig 5b the tke varies along spanwise direction and reaches its local maxima in the regions approximately behind the saddle locations which may be due to the entrainment between the wake and main flow and the additional fluctuating energy induced by the secondary vortical structures compared with the square cylinder fig 5a the region with negligible tke is much larger behind the wavy square cylinder which is in accordance with the elongation of reversed flow region presented in fig 3b besides at the further downstream x d 5 of wavy square cylinder the tke is observed to be smaller than that of square cylinder this may imply the suppression of turbulent fluctuations by the wavy leading edge fig 6 displays the time averaged streamline pattern and corresponding time averaged streamwise velocity contours of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise direction for square cylinder the measurement plane was set at the central position along the span for wavy square cylinder as indicated in fig 1 the measurement planes were set at node middle and saddle planes respectively for all four cases two large scale vortical structures within the region of negative time averaged streamwise velocity are almost symmetrically located with respect to the centerline of the wake y d 4 two foci points and a saddle point are well identified by time averaged streamlines in comparison with square cylinder case the foci and saddle points of wavy square cylinder are observed to be shifted further downstream which can be a good evidence for reducing drag acting on square cylinder as for wavy square cylinder the recirculation region increases in both length and width form node to saddle plane which can be attribute to the enhancement of secondary vortical structures induced by wavy leading edge besides the variation of vortex formation length from node to saddle plane is in good agreement with the streamline pattern shown in fig 3a which further indicating the three dimensionality in the wake of wavy square cylinder fig 7 displays the time averaged vorticity contours of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise direction the time averaged vorticity contours show that the two shear layers with opposite sign are almost parallel with respect to the centerline of the wake y d 4 and their strengths are weakened in the wake further downstream for all cases for square cylinder as shown in fig 7a the two shear layers are short and deflected into wake indicating the large scale vortical structures formed immediately in the rear of square cylinder for wavy square cylinder the elongation of shear layers is apparent and the deflected locations are observed to move further downstream suggesting longer distance for the vortex formation besides it is worthy to note that the wavy square cylinder possesses lower vorticity concentration than that of square cylinder indicating that the wavy geometry gives rise to the suppression of vortex shedding process in the near wake the normalized tke turbulent kinetic energy distributions of square and wavy square cylinders in the streamwise direction are presented in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8a the tke distribution of square cylinder exhibits a high concentrated region locates along the wake centerline due to high intensity of velocity fluctuations caused by large scale vortex shedding similar trend is observed in the node plane of wavy square cylinder fig 8b however the maximum value of tke is decreased from 0 4 to 0 22 and the location of high concentrated region is delayed from x d 3 to x d 4 in the middle and saddle plane the maximum of tke is further reduced to 0 14 showing a 62 5 reduction as compared with square cylinder these features are consistent with the elongation of vortex formation length presented in fig 6 concerning the tke distributions in the middle and saddle plane the high concentrated region is not distinguishable and the region with negligible tke is much larger than that of square cylinder implying the suppression of large scale vortex motion across the wake the tke distribution in the saddle plane displays two peaks attenuating along the streamwise direction this may imply that the generation of small scale vortices is triggered by wavy leading edge and causes velocity fluctuations along the two shear layers 4 1 2 instantaneous flow structures in streamwise plane to capture the spatial characteristics of the vortices formed in the wake region the swirling strength λci which is defined as the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of local velocity gradient tensor is adopted for vortex detection when λci 0 adrian et al 2000 zhou et al 1999 fig 9 shows the instantaneous swirling strength distributions and velocity vectors of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise planes in the present study the sign of localized vorticity is used to indicate the senses of vortical rotation in the case of square cylinder fig 9a the developed lower shear layer deflects upwards from lower side of square cylinder while the developing upper shear layer moves in the reverse direction resulting in alternatively distributed karman vortex pair with opposite sense of rotation this observation suggests an asymmetric shedding mode in the wake region which is in agreement with the classical karman vortex shedding process for wavy square cylinder fig 9b d symmetrically distributed vortex pairs are observed with the delay of the interaction of separated shear layers this is helpful in the increment of base pressure and the reduction of drag coefficient compared with the square cylinder the regular asymmetric shedding mode tends to be replaced by the symmetric shedding mode this can be attributed to the three dimensionality of the flow field induced by the wavy leading edge 4 2 time frequency analysis the continuous wavelet transform cwt has been widely applied to time series of signal as it is capable of providing local features of the transformed dataset in both physical temporal space and spectral scale space in order to reveal the time frequency scale characteristics of flow fields behind the square and wavy square cylinder the continuous wavelet transform using mexican hat mother wavelet was adopted in the present study the result of cwt was displayed in a time frequency plane where the contour of wavelet coefficients was mapped versus time and frequency fig 10 shows the time frequency distributions at specific points of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise planes x d 0 8 z d 4 3 square cylinder x d 1 1 z d 4 4 node plane x d 2 0 z d 4 5 middle plane x d 2 5 z d 4 7 saddle plane which are approximately on the vortex path and their corresponding time histories of vertical fluctuation velocities are plotted below the contour maps for square cylinder as shown in fig 10a appreciable successions of positive and negative streaks corresponding to the variation of vertical fluctuation velocity are observed around the dominating frequency of 1 34 hz with a strouhal number st fd u of 0 128 which is in accordance with previous experimental studies ozgoren 2006 okajima 1982 chen et al 1999 at reynolds numbers ranging from 550 to 3400 this suggests periodical large scale flow oscillation behind the square cylinder in the range of relatively high frequency 2 5 8 hz some streaks are also observed which may imply the appearance of the relatively small scale vortices for the cases of wavy square cylinder fig 10b d the periodicity of large scale flow oscillation is less evident characterized by relatively unstable variation of alternative positive and negative streaks presented in the contour maps implying that the large scale flow oscillation was weakened in the vortex shedding process in the range of relatively high frequency the number of streaks of wavy square cylinder is more than that of square cylinder in a more unstable state indicating that the relatively small scale vortex motions are enhanced by the wavy leading edge the activation of small scale vortices is considered to be associated with the suppression of vortex shedding process fig 11 shows the time frequency distributions and the corresponding time histories of streamwise fluctuation velocities at specific points in the spanwise planes x d 1 0 y d 6 square cylinder x d 1 5 y d 2 1 node location x d 2 0 y d 3 5 middle location x d 2 3 y d 4 9 saddle location for all cases two series of streaks with different peak frequency are observed one locates in the range of low frequency and the other locates in the range of relatively high frequency suggesting the coexistence of multi scale vortical structures the low frequency components can be associated with a slowly varying shift mode noack et al 2015 within the dead region and the high frequency components may imply the motion of the relatively small scale vortices concerning the time frequency distributions of wavy square cylinder fig 11b d the number of high frequency streaks is more than that of square cylinder which further confirms the activation of the relatively small scale vortices by wavy leading edge in the middle location of wavy square cylinder fig 11b a relatively strong periodicity is observed at the peak frequency of 2 5 hz this observation also provides an evidence for the existence of quasi periodical large scale vortical structures in the wake of wavy square cylinder 4 3 dmd analysis on flow fields 4 3 1 modal energy distribution in the present study 3000 successive fluctuating velocity fields were decomposed into 2999 dynamic modes by the above stated method and the resulting resolution of frequency is 0 083 hz fig 12 shows the modal energy distribution of each mode on the streamwise planes of square and wavy square cylinders the mode energy d m of each mode was plotted versus its corresponding frequency calculated via the transform f im log λ i 2 π δ t since the imaginary part of eigenvalues λ i appears in complex conjugate pairs only the cases with f 0 was displayed as shown in fig 12 the mode energy concentrated in the range of low frequency 0 1 3 75 hz suggesting the dominance of low frequency components in the measured flow field two distinct peaks dm1 and dm2 are observed at the frequency of 1 34 hz and 2 5 hz respectively it is not surprising to find that the frequency of dm1 equals to the vortex shedding frequency revealed by fig 10 compared with square cylinder prominent reductions for the amplitudes of dm1 and dm2 are observed for wavy square cylinder implying that the wavy leading edge weakens the dominance of large scale vortical structure and thus reducing the strength of secondary resonance accompanied with large scale flow oscillation for wavy square cylinder the dominances of dm1 and dm2 are observed to be weakened from node to saddle plane these observations indicate that the variation of vortex formation length can be attributed to the wavy leading edge that significantly changes the vortex shedding process fig 13 shows the modal energy distributions of each mode on the spanwise planes of square and wavy square cylinders as can be seen the mode energy distributes evenly without pronounced peak in the range of low frequency however the dominance of dynamic modes tends to be enhanced around the frequency of 2 5 hz for wavy square cylinder which also provides an evidence that the secondary vortical structures are strengthened by wavy leading edge when the frequency exceeds 10 hz it is worthy to note that mode energy of wavy square cylinder is larger than that of square cylinder in both streamwise and spanwise planes this suggests that the wavy leading edge promotes the transition from large scale vortical structure to small scale vortical structure hence reduces the strength of vortex shedding process 4 3 2 spatial patterns of dynamic modes fig 14 presents the spatial patterns of dynamic mode dm1 on the streamwise planes for square and wavy square cylinders here the streamline pattern and the vorticity contour are expressed based on the velocity components of dynamic mode for square cylinder as shown in fig 14a it is evident that the flow pattern captures the dynamics of large scale karman vortex which introduces periodical variation to the wake flow the streamwise wavelength corresponding to the extreme value of positive and negative vorticity is about 2 5d indicating the convection of large scale vortical structure for wavy square cylinder as presented in fig 14b d the flow patterns are observed to be distorted and deformed in shape suggesting that the wavy leading edge distorts the dominant large scale structure and thus reduces the strength of vortex shedding process fig 15 shows the spatial patterns of dynamic mode dm2 on the streamwise planes for square and wavy square cylinders for square cylinder it is evident that dm2 exhibits periodically convective vortices with opposite sign of vorticity along the streamwise direction and the wavelength of dm2 which reflects the spatial scale decreases form 2 5d to 1 5d although the dynamic mode dm2 is extracted at a specific frequency the flow pattern of wavy square cylinder is less organized compared with that of square cylinder and the spatial scale is smaller from above it can be found that the wavy leading edge changes the wake flow by the distortion of karman vortex and its corresponding secondary vortical structure which makes the vortical structures more unstable and dissipate more quickly this may be inferred as a reason for longer vortex formation length of wavy square cylinder 4 4 phase averaging on flow fields the phase average technique is widely used to extract turbulent structures of periodic disturbance from instantaneous time sequence of velocity fields in a phase averaged sense to this end the identification of the phase information and the extraction of vortical structures buried in the main flow is very desirable and the abovementioned dynamic mode decomposition provides us with an effective tool for performing phase averaging process on flow structure on the basis of dynamic modes the initial flow field can be reconstructed by v 1 n 1 x y t i 1 n 1 a i t d m i x y where the mode coefficient a i t is associated with a specific time scale fig 16 a presents the temporal coefficients of dm1 and dm2 here the left column corresponds to dm1 and right column represents dm2 as can be seen the a 1 t and a 2 t exhibit periodical variation with almost fixed amplitude suggesting the ability of dynamic mode decomposition to extract relevant flow structure at a specific scale to perform phase averaging the temporal coefficients of dm1 and dm2 are used as reference signal and the continuous wavelet based method proposed in our previous study zheng et al 2018 is adopted for phase identification the instantaneous phase angles of dm1 and dm2 along the time axis are shown in fig 16b as can be seen the phase angles are clearly identified and the cycles of flow oscillations are observed at 15 and 30 times for dm1 and dm2 respectively these observations are in accordance with the representative frequency revealed in fig 10 after identifying the phase of each realization the data ensembles are phase sorted to give phase averaged representations of flow field as the dm1 is associated with the dominant vortex shedding frequency the measured flow fields are phase averaged based on the phase information obtained from dm1 fig 17 displays the phase averaged vorticity contours of square cylinder and middle plane of wavy square cylinder calculated from specific phases of measured flow field the phase averaged patterns are displayed at π 4 interval for square cylinder the phased average result based on the measured flow fields exhibits an asymmetric shedding mode in the wake region which is in agreement with the classical karman vortex shedding process for wavy square cylinder as shown in the right column of fig 16 the vortex pairs are observed with the delay of the interaction of separated shear layers and they tend to be symmetric about wake center line in the near wake region to investigate the convection feature of large scale flow structure dash lines connected by the vortex cores are presented in fig 17 as can be seen the strength of separated vortices gradually reduce as the vortices travels downstream for both square and wavy square cylinders and the convection process is accompanied with the distortion of vortical structures in comparison with square cylinder the vortices tend to be less organized and the distortion of them are more evident especially at the further downstream of x d 5 these observations suggest that wavy leading edge distorts the dominant large scale flow structure which weakens the vortex shedding process fig 18 displays the phase averaged vorticity contours of square cylinder and middle plane of wavy square cylinder calculated from specific phases of the flow field reconstructed by dm2 for square cylinder as shown in the left column of fig 18 pairs of vortices with opposite sign of rotation distributes symmetrically with respect to the wake center line and they tend to convey downstream in a relatively stable state indicating the periodicity of convecting vortices behind the square cylinder as for wavy square cylinder as presented in the right column of fig 18 the symmetry of vortex distribution is not evident and the vortex pair along the wake center line exhibits same sign of rotation furthermore it is observed that the vorticity distribution varies in both shape and size with the increasing phase accompanied with the breakdown and merging of vortices this implies the unsteadiness of secondary vortical structure by wavy leading edge even though such structures are extracted at a specific scale 5 conclusions to study the effect of spanwise periodic perturbation on the wake characteristics the flow structures behind a wavy square cylinder are experimentally investigated using piv measurement comparative investigations are performed with a square cylinder in terms of time averaged flow field time frequency analysis dynamic mode decomposition as well as phase averaged flow pattern the experimental results suggest that the perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d changes the wake flow structure significantly and it can be served as a fundamental parameter for the spanwise periodic perturbation at an intermediate reynolds number of 4075 the detailed results are summarized as follows 1 in the spanwise plane the well organized vortices corresponding to geometrical variation are locked into fixed positions with positive and negative peaks distributed alternately along spanwise direction suggesting that the wavy geometry enhances the strength of secondary vortical structures 2 in the streamwise plane the wavy square cylinder possesses lower spanwise vorticity than that of square cylinder indicating that the wavy leading edgy give rise to the suppression of vortex shedding process in the near wake compared with the square cylinder the regular asymmetric shedding mode tends to be replaced by the symmetric shedding mode this can be attributed to the three dimensionality of the flow field induced by the wavy leading edge 3 the time frequency analyses suggest that periodical large scale flows are suppressed while the motions of relatively small scale vortical structures are enhanced by the wavy leading edge 4 compared with the square cylinder the modal energies of dynamic modes dm1 and dm2 are prominently reduced in the streamwise planes of wavy square cylinder implying that the wavy leading edge weakens the dominance of large scale vortical structure and thus reduces the strength of secondary vortex movement the modal energy distribution in spanwise plane indicates that the wavy leading edge promotes the transition from large scale vortical structure to small scale vortical structure hence reduces the strength of vortex shedding 5 the spatial patterns of dynamic modes indicate that the wavy leading edge changes the wake flow by the distortion of karman vortex and its corresponding secondary vortical structure which makes the vortical structures more unstable and dissipates more quickly this may be inferred as a reason for longer vortex formation length of wavy square cylinder 6 in comparison with the square cylinder the phase averaged results of measured flow fields tend to be less organized and the distortion of large scale vortices are more evident especially at the further downstream despite extracted at a specific scale for wavy square cylinder the vorticity distribution based on the flow field reconstructed by dm2 varies in both shape and size with the increasing phase accompanying with the breakdown and merging of vortices credit authorship contribution statement yan zheng investigation visualization writing original draft funding acquisition hiroka rinoshika

21539,a comparative study on the flow structures behind square and wavy square were performed to understand the wake characteristics under spanwise periodic perturbation the high speed piv measurements were carried out at reynolds number of 4075 the time averaged flow field suggested that wavy leading edge triggered the alternative secondary vortices along the span the instantaneous flow field indicated that the regular asymmetric vortex shedding mode was changed to symmetric mode by wavy leading edge it was found that periodical large scale flows were suppressed while the motions of small scale vortical structures were enhanced by the wavy leading edge based on the continuous wavelet transform the modal energy distribution of the dynamic mode decomposition suggested that the wavy leading edge weakened the dominance of large scale vortical structure and promoted the transition from large scale to small scale vortical structure the spatial patterns of representative dynamic modes dm1 and dm2 in streamwise plane indicated that the wavy leading edge changed the wake flow by the distortion of karman vortex and its corresponding secondary vortical structure which made the vortical structures more unstable and dissipates more quickly furthermore the phase averaging process based on temporal coefficients of dm1 and dm2 revealed that the separated shear layer of wavy square cylinder extended to further downstream and the separated vortex was broken into several relatively small vortices during the shedding process keywords piv vortex square cylinder wake wavy square cylinder wavelet transform dynamic mode decomposition 1 introduction turbulent flows around bluff bodies are very common flow phenomenon encountered in numerous engineering applications such as offshore platforms heat exchangers chimneys high rise buildings and bridge decks despite their geometric variety the dominant feature of wake flows behind slender bluff bodies is the occurrence of vortex shedding which can give rise to drag force lift fluctuation structural vibration and acoustic noise to eliminate these adverse effects the control of vortex shedding is very desirable the main objective of wake control is to reduce the drag force and to minimize the effects of vortex induced vibration acting on bluff body among previous studies on flow control passive control technique is preferred due to its simplicity and it does not require external energy to manipulate the flow field in the past decades flow control methods referred to as 2d and 3d forcing choi et al 2008 have been successfully applied to suppress the vortex shedding of various bluff bodies typical applications for 2d forcing can be achieved by means of placing splitter plate rathakrishnan 2012 liu et al 2016 or control rod chen et al 2013 chauhan et al 2019 in the downstream or upstream of bluff body with the development of knowledge on secondary wake instabilities williamson 1988 robichaux et al 1999 naghib lahouti et al 2014 luo et al 2007 dobre et al 2004 it has been well understood that two dimensional bluff body wake flows are dominated by primary instability which leads to the large scale vortex formation and secondary instabilities which play important roles in the transition of wake flow into turbulence these instabilities make the wake flows of bluff bodies very attractive and serve as basis for flow control for 3d forcing control strategies spanwise periodic geometric modifications or suction and blowing are commonly applied to affect the vortex shedding process by excitation of secondary instabilities up to now the 3d forcing method has been successfully applied to circular cylinder blunt tailing edge profiled body and square cylinder kim et al 2005 lam et al 2009 2010 2012 zhang et al 2005 new et al 2015 naghib lahouti et al 2012 antiohos et al 2015bib lam et al 2012 among the above mentioned 3d forcing flow control approaches it is worthy to note that these approaches are most effective when the perturbation parameter is equal to the wavelength of the dominant secondary instability for square cylinder darekar and sherwin 2001 numerically studied the square cylinders with spanwise sinusoidal perturbations in the range of low reynolds numbers 10 re 150 their work demonstrated that maximum base drag reduction was achieved at the perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d d represents the leading edge height of square cylinder which is close to the mode a instability wavelength of a square cylinder proposed by robichaux et al 1999 and luo et al 2007 at low reynolds numbers at a reynolds number of 23 500 dobre et al 2006 experimentally investigated the wake flow characteristics of a square cylinder with wavy leading edge up to 78 reduction of turbulence intensity was obtained at the perturbation wavelength of 2 4 d this wavelength is equal to the spanwise spacing of secondary instability reported in their previous study dobre et al 2004 similar results of wavy square cylinder can be found in the work by berman and owen 1998 at a high reynolds number of 40 000 however the maximum drag reduction was achieved at the perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d which corresponds to the mode a instability wavelength at low reynolds numbers from the above literatures it is found that the sinusoidal perturbation method is effective in both laminar and turbulent case however the wavelength of secondary instability is not universal for the flow control of square cylinder at different reynolds numbers until recently most studies on 3d forcing method the fall within the range of low reynolds number re 3000 and relatively high reynolds number re 10 000 therefore it would be of interest to investigate the spanwise perturbation s effect at an intermediate reynolds number as is known the wake formed behind bluff body is random in temporal and spatial domain exhibiting unsteady structures with a wide range of scales in the past decades many techniques such as continuous wavelet transform cwt wavelet multi resolution analysis and dynamic mode decomposition dmd have been employed in a wide range of applications due to their capacity of determining flow structures sorted with frequency content li 1998 developed a continuous wavelet based correlation method on fluctuation velocity by which coherent and incoherent structures were clearly identifiable in the time frequency plane rinoshika and zhou 2005 applied wavelet multi resolution technique to analyze the velocity data simultaneously obtained in two orthogonal planes in the turbulent near wake of a circular cylinder the velocity fields were decomposed into different scales based on their central frequency within a certain frequency band as the other popular technique the dynamic mode decomposition is an efficient technique to obtain a mode containing only a single centralized frequency component at a specific scale schmid et al 2011 to give further understanding of flow dynamics over square cylinder under spanwise perturbation the detailed information on time frequency characteristics as well as multi scale turbulent structure of the wake flow should be acquired this is of fundamental significance and has not been previously investigated thus motivating the present work to study the effect of spanwise periodic perturbation on the wake characteristics at an intermediate reynolds number wavy geometry is introduced to the leading edge of a square cylinder with a perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d which corresponds to the wavelength of mode a instability at low reynolds numbers the flow structures behind wavy square cylinder are experimentally investigated using piv measurement comparative investigations are performed with a square cylinder firstly the first and second order statistics are performed to evaluate the time averaged flow fields secondly continuous wavelet transform was used to reveal the time frequency characteristics then the dynamic mode decomposition is employed to further investigate the measured flow fields at a specific scale finally based on the temporal coefficients of dynamic modes the data ensembles are phase sorted and analyzed in phase averaged flow patterns 2 experimental setup 2 1 experimental models as shown in fig 1 two dimensional square and wavy square cylinder models were adopted in the present study to investigate the effect of wavy geometry the square cylinder model having an edge of d 20 mm and a width of l 400 mm was adopted as the base case for the wavy cylinder the cross section with maximum transverse edge of d 20 mm is referred to as node plane and the cross section with minimum transverse edge is referred to as saddle plane the aspect ratio of the two tested models is l d 20 with respect to the width l the wavelength λ between two nodes is 5 6 d and the sinusoidal amplitude w is 0 45 d which corresponds to the wave steepness factor of w λ 0 08 based on the geometrical parameters of λ d and w λ the wavy square cylinder falls within the range of flow regime i summarized by dobre et al 2006 in which the flow is considered to be highly controlled 2 2 high speed piv measurement the measurements were conducted using the circulating water channel of rinoshika s laboratory at the yamagata university which has 400 mm width 300 mm height 1000 mm length test section the two side walls were equipped with transparent glass plate for laser illumination and flow field visualization to ensure the flow homogeneity a settling chamber a honeycomb three turbulence damping screens and a contraction were placed before the test section the freestream velocity was uniform and the turbulent intensity was less than 0 5 in an empty test section the piv measurements were carried out at a constant free stream velocity of u 0 21 m s which corresponds to reynolds number re 4075 based on the leading edge height of experimental model the schematic view of the experimental configuration is shown in fig 2 the experimental model spanned the entire width of the test section and was placed in the water channel at the middle depth the velocity fields behind the experimental models were measured by provision piv a continuous laser and a high speed camera were used to implement the piv system the compact laser generated by a 4 w continuous laser source was fitted with a cylindrical lens to produce a 1 5 mm light sheet along the measurement planes of experimental models the high speed camera photron fastcam sa3 used in this study has a maximum spatial resolution of 1024 1024 pixels with a full frame rate of 1000 fps frame per second polystyrene particles with diameter of 10 25 μm were used as the piv tracers in the flow loop as shown in fig 2a and b the measurements were performed on spanwise plane x y and streamwise plane x z respectively to evaluate the effect of wavy geometry measurements were carried out on the node middle and saddle planes fig 1b along streamwise direction in the x y and x z plane a frame rate of 250 fps was set and the digital images were captured with a resolution of 1024 1024 pixels and 1024 768 pixels respectively the instantaneous velocity vector fields were generated using fft based cross correlation technique between two successive particle images and the erroneous vectors no more than 4 of the total velocity vectors were replaced by interpolated vectors using gaussian interpolation scheme integrated in provision piv software two representative images of x y and x z plane having the domain of 240 mm 240 mm 12d 12d and 200 mm 160 mm 10 d 8 d are presented in fig 2c and d respectively and the typical size of particle image was about 4 pixels the interrogation window size was 32 32 pixels with 50 overlap for each experimental condition providing 120 120 and 100 80 velocity vectors over x y and x z plane respectively hence the pixel size is about 0 2mm pixel and the spatial resolution of velocity vectors is about 2 0 mm the bios error of the experimental system was no more than 0 5 the streamwise and vertical velocity errors associated with the experimental uncertainty was less than 0 91 and 2 1 respectively the statistical uncertainty of the measured velocity field was estimated to be no more than 3 1 with a 95 confidence level to determine the time averaged mean flow structure 3000 instantaneous velocity fields were measured in the present study 3 dynamic mode decomposition on flow field the dynamic mode decomposition dmd is an efficient technique to obtain a mode decomposition of a given ensemble of dataset at a single specific frequency this approach was developed based on koopman analysis of nonlinear system rowley et al 2009 which represents an approximation of a time resolved sequence from a nonlinear process by a linear mapping among the numerically generated or experimentally measured samples the detailed implementation of dmd and its application on fluid dynamic analysis have been given by schmid et al 2010 and schmid et al 2011 in the present study the dmd approach was employed to extract flow structures measured by piv experiment and the implementation of it will be briefly described as follows before the decomposition the mean velocity field was removed to obtain the fluctuating velocities over the measurement domain the sequential realizations of fluctuating velocity field was given by v x i y j n v x i y j n v x i y j i 1 n x j 1 n y n 1 n t here the v denotes streamwise or vertical velocity component the x i and y j represent the local spatial positions and the n is the time sequence of snapshot to perform dynamic mode decomposition the calculated fluctuating velocity fields v x i y j n were organized into a single matrix v 1 n with the size of 2n x n y n t 1 v 1 n v 1 v 2 v n u 1 1 u 1 2 u 1 n u 2 1 u 2 1 u 2 n u n x n y 1 u n x n y 1 u n x n y n v 1 1 v 1 2 v 1 n v 2 1 v 2 2 v 1 n v n x n y 1 v n x n y 1 v n x n y n in the resulting matrix v 1 n the symbol denotes that the instantaneous fluctuating velocities over the measurement domain were spatially discretized and rearranged into a column vector v j for each snapshot here the first n x n y elements of each column correspond to the instantaneous streamwise fluctuating velocity field and the last n x n y elements are the corresponding vertical fluctuating velocity field as for the row vector of matrix v 1 n the elements correspond to time series of fluctuating streamwise or vertical velocity components sampled at a constant time interval δt since the number of snapshots is large enough the flow field can be expressed by a linear mapping from one snapshot to the next the linear mapping operator a can be written as v j 1 a v j applying the mapping operator a over entire time sequences we obtain 2 a v 1 n 1 v 2 n v 1 n 1 s r e n 1 t v 1 n 1 s here the operator a acts as a role of shifting the flow field along temporal direction with an interval of δt thus the eigenvalues of a provide temporal dynamic characteristics of the flow field the matrix s is a companion matrix approximating the last nth sample by a linear combination of the previous n 1 samples the companion matrix s can be computed from eq 3 in a least squares sense by which the residual r is minimized the least squares problem for matrix s can be solved by qr decomposition based on the two data sets v 1 n 1 and v 2 n and it is given by 3 s r 1 q h v 2 n with q r v 1 n 1 the final step of mode decomposition contains computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the matrix s and it can be expressed by 4 d m i v 1 n 1 v i where the v i is ith eigenvector of s it is known that the eigenvalues λ i s v i λ i v i of s are approximations to some of the eigenvalues of the mapping matrix a which describes the inter snapshot dynamics and provides information on dynamical process in the flow field a dynamic mode d m i can be obtained by the projection of instantaneous flow field onto its corresponding eigenvector providing spatial information on the physical structures contained in the mode for a specific dynamic mode d m i its growth decay rate and frequency can be determined by the real and imaginary parts of ω via the transform ω log λ i δ t ω r ω i moreover the dmd analysis provides a measure to evaluate the energy contained in each mode by the modulus of dynamic mode d m i in general the dmd would help us to evaluate the dominance of dynamic mode and its associated spatial distributions and to extract the relevant flow structure from the unsteady flow field 4 results and discussion 4 1 wake flow structures 4 1 1 time averaged flow structures in the present study the spatial distributions of time averaged streamlines streamwise velocity vorticity and turbulent kinetic energy tke were calculated by the measured 3000 instantaneous velocity fields and the first and second order turbulent statistics were normalized by u and u 2 respectively fig 3 a shows the time averaged streamline pattern and streamwise velocity contour of square cylinder in the xy plane a reversed flow region approximately parallel to the square cylinder is clearly discerned by the time averaged streamline pattern characterized by negative streamwise velocity distribution within it the streamwise velocity approaches to zero approximately at the distance of 1 15d from the rear of square cylinder indicating the formation length of reversed flow region at the downstream of x d 1 15 the streamwise velocity gradually increases to u u 0 8 different with the distribution shown in fig 3a the time averaged streamlines and streamwise velocity of wavy square cylinder exhibit strong periodicity along spanwise direction the region with negative streamwise velocity displays oval like shape and is shifted further downstream compared with that of square cylinder the maximum and minimum length 1 8 d and 3 6 d of reversed flow region appears alternatively from the saddle to the node location of wavy square cylinder indicating the elongation of reversed flow region these observations suggest that the introducing of wavy geometry modifies the near wake structure significantly and results in longer vortex formation length than that of square cylinder fig 4 shows the time averaged vorticity contours of square and wavy square cylinder in xy plane although previous study wu et al 1996 of instantaneous flow fields suggest the existence of secondary vortices behind various straight bluff bodies it is difficult to capture such vortical structures in a time averaged sense as they are varying in both time and spatial domain for the square cylinder fig 4a no well organized vortical structures can be observed and the vorticity tends to be distributed randomly in the measurement domain similar results are also observed in the horizontal plane behind a circular cylinder by zhang et al 2005 this can be attributed to the unsteadiness of secondary vortices and the cancellation of relatively small scale turbulent fluctuations in the time averaging process for the wavy square cylinder as presented in fig 4b well organized vortices corresponding to geometrical variation are observed to be locked into fixed position with positive and negative peaks distributed alternately along spanwise direction the appearance of vorticity peaks can be attributed to the entrainment of high shear adjacent flow around the geometric nodes saddles the vorticity distribution of wavy square cylinder suggests the three dimensional nature resulting from the wavy leading edge besides it is worthy to note that the wavy square cylinder possesses higher vorticity concentration than that of square cylinder indicating that the wavy geometry enhances the strength of secondary vortical structures the normalized tke turbulent kinetic energy distributions of square and wavy square cylinders are shown in fig 5 for the wavy square cylinder fig 5b the tke varies along spanwise direction and reaches its local maxima in the regions approximately behind the saddle locations which may be due to the entrainment between the wake and main flow and the additional fluctuating energy induced by the secondary vortical structures compared with the square cylinder fig 5a the region with negligible tke is much larger behind the wavy square cylinder which is in accordance with the elongation of reversed flow region presented in fig 3b besides at the further downstream x d 5 of wavy square cylinder the tke is observed to be smaller than that of square cylinder this may imply the suppression of turbulent fluctuations by the wavy leading edge fig 6 displays the time averaged streamline pattern and corresponding time averaged streamwise velocity contours of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise direction for square cylinder the measurement plane was set at the central position along the span for wavy square cylinder as indicated in fig 1 the measurement planes were set at node middle and saddle planes respectively for all four cases two large scale vortical structures within the region of negative time averaged streamwise velocity are almost symmetrically located with respect to the centerline of the wake y d 4 two foci points and a saddle point are well identified by time averaged streamlines in comparison with square cylinder case the foci and saddle points of wavy square cylinder are observed to be shifted further downstream which can be a good evidence for reducing drag acting on square cylinder as for wavy square cylinder the recirculation region increases in both length and width form node to saddle plane which can be attribute to the enhancement of secondary vortical structures induced by wavy leading edge besides the variation of vortex formation length from node to saddle plane is in good agreement with the streamline pattern shown in fig 3a which further indicating the three dimensionality in the wake of wavy square cylinder fig 7 displays the time averaged vorticity contours of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise direction the time averaged vorticity contours show that the two shear layers with opposite sign are almost parallel with respect to the centerline of the wake y d 4 and their strengths are weakened in the wake further downstream for all cases for square cylinder as shown in fig 7a the two shear layers are short and deflected into wake indicating the large scale vortical structures formed immediately in the rear of square cylinder for wavy square cylinder the elongation of shear layers is apparent and the deflected locations are observed to move further downstream suggesting longer distance for the vortex formation besides it is worthy to note that the wavy square cylinder possesses lower vorticity concentration than that of square cylinder indicating that the wavy geometry gives rise to the suppression of vortex shedding process in the near wake the normalized tke turbulent kinetic energy distributions of square and wavy square cylinders in the streamwise direction are presented in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 8a the tke distribution of square cylinder exhibits a high concentrated region locates along the wake centerline due to high intensity of velocity fluctuations caused by large scale vortex shedding similar trend is observed in the node plane of wavy square cylinder fig 8b however the maximum value of tke is decreased from 0 4 to 0 22 and the location of high concentrated region is delayed from x d 3 to x d 4 in the middle and saddle plane the maximum of tke is further reduced to 0 14 showing a 62 5 reduction as compared with square cylinder these features are consistent with the elongation of vortex formation length presented in fig 6 concerning the tke distributions in the middle and saddle plane the high concentrated region is not distinguishable and the region with negligible tke is much larger than that of square cylinder implying the suppression of large scale vortex motion across the wake the tke distribution in the saddle plane displays two peaks attenuating along the streamwise direction this may imply that the generation of small scale vortices is triggered by wavy leading edge and causes velocity fluctuations along the two shear layers 4 1 2 instantaneous flow structures in streamwise plane to capture the spatial characteristics of the vortices formed in the wake region the swirling strength λci which is defined as the imaginary part of the complex eigenvalue of local velocity gradient tensor is adopted for vortex detection when λci 0 adrian et al 2000 zhou et al 1999 fig 9 shows the instantaneous swirling strength distributions and velocity vectors of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise planes in the present study the sign of localized vorticity is used to indicate the senses of vortical rotation in the case of square cylinder fig 9a the developed lower shear layer deflects upwards from lower side of square cylinder while the developing upper shear layer moves in the reverse direction resulting in alternatively distributed karman vortex pair with opposite sense of rotation this observation suggests an asymmetric shedding mode in the wake region which is in agreement with the classical karman vortex shedding process for wavy square cylinder fig 9b d symmetrically distributed vortex pairs are observed with the delay of the interaction of separated shear layers this is helpful in the increment of base pressure and the reduction of drag coefficient compared with the square cylinder the regular asymmetric shedding mode tends to be replaced by the symmetric shedding mode this can be attributed to the three dimensionality of the flow field induced by the wavy leading edge 4 2 time frequency analysis the continuous wavelet transform cwt has been widely applied to time series of signal as it is capable of providing local features of the transformed dataset in both physical temporal space and spectral scale space in order to reveal the time frequency scale characteristics of flow fields behind the square and wavy square cylinder the continuous wavelet transform using mexican hat mother wavelet was adopted in the present study the result of cwt was displayed in a time frequency plane where the contour of wavelet coefficients was mapped versus time and frequency fig 10 shows the time frequency distributions at specific points of square and wavy square cylinder in the streamwise planes x d 0 8 z d 4 3 square cylinder x d 1 1 z d 4 4 node plane x d 2 0 z d 4 5 middle plane x d 2 5 z d 4 7 saddle plane which are approximately on the vortex path and their corresponding time histories of vertical fluctuation velocities are plotted below the contour maps for square cylinder as shown in fig 10a appreciable successions of positive and negative streaks corresponding to the variation of vertical fluctuation velocity are observed around the dominating frequency of 1 34 hz with a strouhal number st fd u of 0 128 which is in accordance with previous experimental studies ozgoren 2006 okajima 1982 chen et al 1999 at reynolds numbers ranging from 550 to 3400 this suggests periodical large scale flow oscillation behind the square cylinder in the range of relatively high frequency 2 5 8 hz some streaks are also observed which may imply the appearance of the relatively small scale vortices for the cases of wavy square cylinder fig 10b d the periodicity of large scale flow oscillation is less evident characterized by relatively unstable variation of alternative positive and negative streaks presented in the contour maps implying that the large scale flow oscillation was weakened in the vortex shedding process in the range of relatively high frequency the number of streaks of wavy square cylinder is more than that of square cylinder in a more unstable state indicating that the relatively small scale vortex motions are enhanced by the wavy leading edge the activation of small scale vortices is considered to be associated with the suppression of vortex shedding process fig 11 shows the time frequency distributions and the corresponding time histories of streamwise fluctuation velocities at specific points in the spanwise planes x d 1 0 y d 6 square cylinder x d 1 5 y d 2 1 node location x d 2 0 y d 3 5 middle location x d 2 3 y d 4 9 saddle location for all cases two series of streaks with different peak frequency are observed one locates in the range of low frequency and the other locates in the range of relatively high frequency suggesting the coexistence of multi scale vortical structures the low frequency components can be associated with a slowly varying shift mode noack et al 2015 within the dead region and the high frequency components may imply the motion of the relatively small scale vortices concerning the time frequency distributions of wavy square cylinder fig 11b d the number of high frequency streaks is more than that of square cylinder which further confirms the activation of the relatively small scale vortices by wavy leading edge in the middle location of wavy square cylinder fig 11b a relatively strong periodicity is observed at the peak frequency of 2 5 hz this observation also provides an evidence for the existence of quasi periodical large scale vortical structures in the wake of wavy square cylinder 4 3 dmd analysis on flow fields 4 3 1 modal energy distribution in the present study 3000 successive fluctuating velocity fields were decomposed into 2999 dynamic modes by the above stated method and the resulting resolution of frequency is 0 083 hz fig 12 shows the modal energy distribution of each mode on the streamwise planes of square and wavy square cylinders the mode energy d m of each mode was plotted versus its corresponding frequency calculated via the transform f im log λ i 2 π δ t since the imaginary part of eigenvalues λ i appears in complex conjugate pairs only the cases with f 0 was displayed as shown in fig 12 the mode energy concentrated in the range of low frequency 0 1 3 75 hz suggesting the dominance of low frequency components in the measured flow field two distinct peaks dm1 and dm2 are observed at the frequency of 1 34 hz and 2 5 hz respectively it is not surprising to find that the frequency of dm1 equals to the vortex shedding frequency revealed by fig 10 compared with square cylinder prominent reductions for the amplitudes of dm1 and dm2 are observed for wavy square cylinder implying that the wavy leading edge weakens the dominance of large scale vortical structure and thus reducing the strength of secondary resonance accompanied with large scale flow oscillation for wavy square cylinder the dominances of dm1 and dm2 are observed to be weakened from node to saddle plane these observations indicate that the variation of vortex formation length can be attributed to the wavy leading edge that significantly changes the vortex shedding process fig 13 shows the modal energy distributions of each mode on the spanwise planes of square and wavy square cylinders as can be seen the mode energy distributes evenly without pronounced peak in the range of low frequency however the dominance of dynamic modes tends to be enhanced around the frequency of 2 5 hz for wavy square cylinder which also provides an evidence that the secondary vortical structures are strengthened by wavy leading edge when the frequency exceeds 10 hz it is worthy to note that mode energy of wavy square cylinder is larger than that of square cylinder in both streamwise and spanwise planes this suggests that the wavy leading edge promotes the transition from large scale vortical structure to small scale vortical structure hence reduces the strength of vortex shedding process 4 3 2 spatial patterns of dynamic modes fig 14 presents the spatial patterns of dynamic mode dm1 on the streamwise planes for square and wavy square cylinders here the streamline pattern and the vorticity contour are expressed based on the velocity components of dynamic mode for square cylinder as shown in fig 14a it is evident that the flow pattern captures the dynamics of large scale karman vortex which introduces periodical variation to the wake flow the streamwise wavelength corresponding to the extreme value of positive and negative vorticity is about 2 5d indicating the convection of large scale vortical structure for wavy square cylinder as presented in fig 14b d the flow patterns are observed to be distorted and deformed in shape suggesting that the wavy leading edge distorts the dominant large scale structure and thus reduces the strength of vortex shedding process fig 15 shows the spatial patterns of dynamic mode dm2 on the streamwise planes for square and wavy square cylinders for square cylinder it is evident that dm2 exhibits periodically convective vortices with opposite sign of vorticity along the streamwise direction and the wavelength of dm2 which reflects the spatial scale decreases form 2 5d to 1 5d although the dynamic mode dm2 is extracted at a specific frequency the flow pattern of wavy square cylinder is less organized compared with that of square cylinder and the spatial scale is smaller from above it can be found that the wavy leading edge changes the wake flow by the distortion of karman vortex and its corresponding secondary vortical structure which makes the vortical structures more unstable and dissipate more quickly this may be inferred as a reason for longer vortex formation length of wavy square cylinder 4 4 phase averaging on flow fields the phase average technique is widely used to extract turbulent structures of periodic disturbance from instantaneous time sequence of velocity fields in a phase averaged sense to this end the identification of the phase information and the extraction of vortical structures buried in the main flow is very desirable and the abovementioned dynamic mode decomposition provides us with an effective tool for performing phase averaging process on flow structure on the basis of dynamic modes the initial flow field can be reconstructed by v 1 n 1 x y t i 1 n 1 a i t d m i x y where the mode coefficient a i t is associated with a specific time scale fig 16 a presents the temporal coefficients of dm1 and dm2 here the left column corresponds to dm1 and right column represents dm2 as can be seen the a 1 t and a 2 t exhibit periodical variation with almost fixed amplitude suggesting the ability of dynamic mode decomposition to extract relevant flow structure at a specific scale to perform phase averaging the temporal coefficients of dm1 and dm2 are used as reference signal and the continuous wavelet based method proposed in our previous study zheng et al 2018 is adopted for phase identification the instantaneous phase angles of dm1 and dm2 along the time axis are shown in fig 16b as can be seen the phase angles are clearly identified and the cycles of flow oscillations are observed at 15 and 30 times for dm1 and dm2 respectively these observations are in accordance with the representative frequency revealed in fig 10 after identifying the phase of each realization the data ensembles are phase sorted to give phase averaged representations of flow field as the dm1 is associated with the dominant vortex shedding frequency the measured flow fields are phase averaged based on the phase information obtained from dm1 fig 17 displays the phase averaged vorticity contours of square cylinder and middle plane of wavy square cylinder calculated from specific phases of measured flow field the phase averaged patterns are displayed at π 4 interval for square cylinder the phased average result based on the measured flow fields exhibits an asymmetric shedding mode in the wake region which is in agreement with the classical karman vortex shedding process for wavy square cylinder as shown in the right column of fig 16 the vortex pairs are observed with the delay of the interaction of separated shear layers and they tend to be symmetric about wake center line in the near wake region to investigate the convection feature of large scale flow structure dash lines connected by the vortex cores are presented in fig 17 as can be seen the strength of separated vortices gradually reduce as the vortices travels downstream for both square and wavy square cylinders and the convection process is accompanied with the distortion of vortical structures in comparison with square cylinder the vortices tend to be less organized and the distortion of them are more evident especially at the further downstream of x d 5 these observations suggest that wavy leading edge distorts the dominant large scale flow structure which weakens the vortex shedding process fig 18 displays the phase averaged vorticity contours of square cylinder and middle plane of wavy square cylinder calculated from specific phases of the flow field reconstructed by dm2 for square cylinder as shown in the left column of fig 18 pairs of vortices with opposite sign of rotation distributes symmetrically with respect to the wake center line and they tend to convey downstream in a relatively stable state indicating the periodicity of convecting vortices behind the square cylinder as for wavy square cylinder as presented in the right column of fig 18 the symmetry of vortex distribution is not evident and the vortex pair along the wake center line exhibits same sign of rotation furthermore it is observed that the vorticity distribution varies in both shape and size with the increasing phase accompanied with the breakdown and merging of vortices this implies the unsteadiness of secondary vortical structure by wavy leading edge even though such structures are extracted at a specific scale 5 conclusions to study the effect of spanwise periodic perturbation on the wake characteristics the flow structures behind a wavy square cylinder are experimentally investigated using piv measurement comparative investigations are performed with a square cylinder in terms of time averaged flow field time frequency analysis dynamic mode decomposition as well as phase averaged flow pattern the experimental results suggest that the perturbation wavelength of 5 6 d changes the wake flow structure significantly and it can be served as a fundamental parameter for the spanwise periodic perturbation at an intermediate reynolds number of 4075 the detailed results are summarized as follows 1 in the spanwise plane the well organized vortices corresponding to geometrical variation are locked into fixed positions with positive and negative peaks distributed alternately along spanwise direction suggesting that the wavy geometry enhances the strength of secondary vortical structures 2 in the streamwise plane the wavy square cylinder possesses lower spanwise vorticity than that of square cylinder indicating that the wavy leading edgy give rise to the suppression of vortex shedding process in the near wake compared with the square cylinder the regular asymmetric shedding mode tends to be replaced by the symmetric shedding mode this can be attributed to the three dimensionality of the flow field induced by the wavy leading edge 3 the time frequency analyses suggest that periodical large scale flows are suppressed while the motions of relatively small scale vortical structures are enhanced by the wavy leading edge 4 compared with the square cylinder the modal energies of dynamic modes dm1 and dm2 are prominently reduced in the streamwise planes of wavy square cylinder implying that the wavy leading edge weakens the dominance of large scale vortical structure and thus reduces the strength of secondary vortex movement the modal energy distribution in spanwise plane indicates that the wavy leading edge promotes the transition from large scale vortical structure to small scale vortical structure hence reduces the strength of vortex shedding 5 the spatial patterns of dynamic modes indicate that the wavy leading edge changes the wake flow by the distortion of karman vortex and its corresponding secondary vortical structure which makes the vortical structures more unstable and dissipates more quickly this may be inferred as a reason for longer vortex formation length of wavy square cylinder 6 in comparison with the square cylinder the phase averaged results of measured flow fields tend to be less organized and the distortion of large scale vortices are more evident especially at the further downstream despite extracted at a specific scale for wavy square cylinder the vorticity distribution based on the flow field reconstructed by dm2 varies in both shape and size with the increasing phase accompanying with the breakdown and merging of vortices credit authorship contribution statement yan zheng investigation visualization writing original draft funding acquisition hiroka rinoshika
