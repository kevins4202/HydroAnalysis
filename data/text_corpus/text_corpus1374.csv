6870,it is generally acknowledged in the environmental sciences that the choice of a computational model impacts the research results in this study of a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin we show that modeling decisions during the model configuration beyond the model choice also impact the model results in our carefully designed experiment we investigated four modeling decisions in ten nested basins the spatial resolution of the model the spatial representation of the forcing data the calibration period and the performance metric the flood characteristics were mainly affected by the performance metric whereas the drought characteristics were mainly affected by the calibration period the results could be related to the processes that triggered the particular events studied the impact of the modeling decisions on the simulations did however vary among the investigated sub basins in spite of the limitations of this study our findings have important implications for the understanding and quantification of uncertainty in any hydrological or even environmental model modeling decisions during model configuration introduce subjectivity from the modeler multiple working hypotheses during model configuration can provide insights on the impact of such subjective modeling decisions keywords hydrological modeling hydrological extremes subjectivity modeling decisions model configuration 1 introduction in jury sports such as gymnastics the jury is supposed to objectively evaluate the outcome of the competition in a study on home advantage for the summer olympic games it was however shown that jury sports experience a significant home advantage in contrast to sports which are based on objective measurements balmer et al 2003 this suggests that the jury is actually making subjective decisions despite their expert knowledge and all the rubrics and directives that have been drafted in order to objectify their decision it is generally acknowledged that models in earth and environmental sciences are affected by several sources of uncertainty oreskes et al 1994 uncertainty can for example stem from the randomness of natural processes so called aleatoric uncertainty or from an insufficient representation of the involved processes epistemic uncertainty there is agreement that the model choice basically the choice for a particular representation of the processes affects the output and thus the results of the study as shown by numerous model intercomparison studies see e g joussaume et al 1999 on climate modeling holländer et al 2009 and clark et al 2015 on hydrological modeling freni et al 2009 on urban stormwater modeling and bennett et al 2013 on benchmarking environmental models the modeler or expert acts as jury to determine the most appropriate model for the question at hand crout et al 2009 while model intercomparison studies provide the modeler with rubrics and directives to judge the model performance in a fair way as such the model choice can be justified based on expert knowledge and the rubrics and directives from model intercomparison studies it should be noted however that expert knowledge is actually a mixture of opinion and knowledge krueger et al 2012 also interestingly shown by the model intercomparison of holländer et al 2009 where different modelers decided differently on which processes were relevant enough to represent in the model the opinion part of expert knowledge introduces subjectivity in the model choice in the same way that the gymnastics jury at the olympic games showed to cause home advantage different experts could make different choices based on the same information furthermore model choice is only the first decision in a sequence of decisions a modeler has to make during model configuration the impact of those modeling decisions is currently overlooked in most if not all model intercomparison studies and an assessment of their relative importance is lacking several studies in different research disciplines have shown that individual modeling decisions during model configuration can have a large impact on model results cosgrove et al 2003 for example showed how the length of the spin up period affects nldas simulations illustrating the large effects that chosen spin up periods can have on land surface modeling this study explicitly validates a spin up modeling decision in the nldas project pappenberger et al 2006 explicitly study the effect of upstream boundary conditions and the way bridges are represented in the model on flood inundation predictions it was demonstrated that the upstream boundary condition had significant impact on the model results a recent study by hauser et al 2017 shows that dependent on the adopted methodology and input data besides the choice for a particular model the european 2015 drought was more likely less likely or unaffected by anthropogenic forcing this demonstrates the large uncertainties that are introduced by methodological choices such as modeling decisions different model configurations are however not always identified as modeling decisions and the subjectivity of these decisions is hardly ever acknowledged for instance ettema et al 2009 showed that 24 more annual precipitation over the greenland ice sheet was obtained from a high resolution regional climate model rcm compared to coarser resolution rcm output though it may depend on the available data or the available computational resources the spatial resolution of the model is often a choice of the modeler neal et al 2010 compared three parallelization methods to model 2d flood inundations where each method i e modeling decision had particular drawbacks neither ettema et al 2009 nor neal et al 2010 explicitly discuss their results as modeling decisions some sources of uncertainty for example concerning model choice model intercomparison studies or optimal model parameters calibration studies have been scrutinized in detail whereas other sources of uncertainty such as modeling decisions during model configuration received considerably less attention or are not recognized as such although they might have an equally relevant impact on the model results a possible explanation can be that the uncertainty caused by modeling decisions is introduced before the first model calculations start making it difficult to quantify this source of uncertainty we note however a slowly growing interest in describing and comprehending modeling decisions and their impact on model output for example in the fields of water resources maier and dandy 2000 and hydrology clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski and clark 2010 clark et al 2011 ceola et al 2015 mendoza et al 2016 mendoza et al 2015 fenicia et al 2016 the attention for this topic in the hydrological sciences is a logical extension of the ambition to improve realism in hydrological models e g beven 1989 mcdonnell et al 2007 clark et al 2016 which are generally known for their conceptual nature especially compared to other environmental sciences such as meteorology and oceanography in this study we argue that the choice for a particular model is only one of several modeling decisions and we illustrate the importance of modeling decisions during model configuration through an example from hydrology in particular we investigate the impacts of four modeling decisions on the simulation of a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin our aim is to demonstrate the impact of multiple modeling decisions on model results and to raise awareness to recognize the uncertainty introduced by modeling decisions a novel contribution of this study is that we systematically investigate and quantify the statistical significance of multiple modeling decisions furthermore the results of this study are particularly relevant because both floods and drought can have a strong societal and economic impact which water managers aim to mitigate by model predictions 2 modeling decisions in hydrology the sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling have been an inspiration for an abundance of scientific literature e g wagener and gupta 2005 liu and gupta 2007 and have led to methods to estimate and quantify uncertainty among others beven and binley 1992 vrugt and sadegh 2013 vrugt and sadegh 2013 developed a bayesian evaluation framework that explicitly recognizes six different sources of uncertainty parameters forcing initial state model structure output and new states as shown in fig 1 hydrologic modeling however is also surrounded by modeling decisions as illustrated in the ellipse in fig 1 and discussed in clark et al 2011 2015 these modeling decisions do not only introduce uncertainty not incorporated in the bayesian evaluation framework in fig 1 they also influence the uncertainty estimated with the framework for example they determine the prior in a bayesian framework or parameter uncertainty as affected by the parameter boundaries many modeling decisions are relevant during the process sometimes referred to as the art of modeling fig 1 in this study we focus on four modeling decisions for which the scientific literature provides ambiguous advice to the hydrologic modeler the spatial resolution the spatial representation of the forcing the calibration period and the performance metric we aim to illustrate and rank the effects of these decisions on the simulation of a flood and a drought event in the swiss thur basin we recognize that since we focus on only four modeling decisions and only two events in one basin the results of our study will be impacted by many other modeling decisions that we as authors made during model configuration and on the specifics of the investigated events this is further discussed in section 5 2 1 spatial resolution an important decision that modelers make when setting up a distributed hydrological model is how to represent the spatial distribution the use of a constant grid is already a first modeling decision leaving aside options such as hydrological response units hru s or sub basins the second decision is the spatial resolution this choice is often bounded by the available data or the calculation time nowadays both the availability of spatially distributed data at high resolution and the computational power are increasing this has led to the call for large scale hyper resolution hydrological modeling wood et al 2011 for the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 it was shown that the spatial resolution applied in the scientific literature has increased over the years melsen et al 2016a several studies have investigated the effect of spatial resolution e g haddeland et al 2002 liang et al 2004 troy et al 2008 melsen et al 2016b but the reported results are ambiguous troy et al 2008 for example found a high sensitivity of the optimal parameter values to the spatial resolution whereas melsen et al 2016b found exactly the opposite for the same model both studies applied a different strategy to identify parameters of a distributed model in this study we compare three different spatial resolutions ranging from the so called hyper resolution as advocated by wood et al 2011 1 1 km to regional scale hydrology 10 10 km representing the finest test resolution of troy et al 2008 and an intermediate spatial resolution 5 5 km 2 2 spatial representation of forcing another important choice for distributed hydrological modeling is the spatial representation of the forcing data in this paper we explore the question do we apply the forcing in a lumped fashion over the basin or in a distributed fashion the choice of forcing data is in many applications a matter of choice between existing datasets whose spatial resolution is already determined one could subjectively select global data sets like watch or era interim which are available at 0 5 or 0 25 resolution worldwide otherwise one needs to invest time and resources in high resolution forcing data e g obtained directly from meteorological stations or weather radars several studies already compared predictive accuracy and summary metrics for hydrologic models fed with spatially distributed and uniform forcing data starting with wilson et al 1979 followed by e g beven and hornberger 1982 1994 2008 2013 2014 none of the studies based on a large range of basins zhao et al 2013 lobligeois et al 2014 reported consistent results the benefit of distributed data depends on the spatial variability of rainfall in the region and at the time scale of interest as pointed out by lobligeois et al 2014 in the basin where our study is conducted see section 3 1 topography causes a high spatial variability in rainfall therefore spatially distributed forcing could potentially be of added value although this could differ for the flood short time scale and drought long time scale event in this study we use spatially interpolated also a modeling decision data based on nine meteorological stations in and around the basin of interest see section 3 1 we compare uniformly applied representing global datasets like watch and era interim versus spatially distributed representing gauge networks or radars forcing 2 3 calibration period the choice of the calibration period is critical for studies where models are used to extrapolate observations in time for example to investigate the effects of climate or land use change future high or low flow events may be beyond the range of historically observed events wagener et al 2010 suggesting that parameter values obtained from calibration on current day observations may not be the most suitable for a future climate to mimic this effect several studies applied a differential split sample test klemeš 1986 in which the calibration and validation periods are significantly different in terms of precipitation and flow regime see e g coron et al 2012 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 showed that the effect of the chosen calibration period on average runoff volume differed per sub basin considered and li et al 2012 concluded that some parameters are more sensitive to that choice than others further merz et al 2011 found that many parameters which are assumed to be time invariant are actually not these considerations make it extremely difficult for a modeler to decide on an appropriate calibration period in this study we compare a high flow calibration period to a low flow calibration period thus applying the differential split sample test shown in fig 2 note however that the length of the calibration period can also impact the modeling results see amongst others vaze et al 2010 melsen et al 2014 this point is further discussed in section 5 2 4 performance metric the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is the most widely used performance metric in hydrology even though several caveats have been identified schaefli and gupta 2007 alternatives for the nse have been proposed for example the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which allows for a better weighing of a correlation term a bias term and a measure of relative variability another approach is to use multiple criteria e g in a pareto optimization framework e g madsen 2003 since the call for a more process based evaluation of hydrologic models mcdonnell et al 2007 gupta et al 2008 clark et al 2016 hydrologic signatures have become more popular as performance metrics hydrologic signatures e g the slope of the flow duration curve or ecologically relevant streamflow indicators as in pool et al 2017 help in providing insights on how adequate process representations are sawicz et al 2011 in this study we compare the nse q and nse logq for floods and drought respectively with the kge q representing average flow conditions 3 methods in this section the basin the investigated extreme events and the conducted analyses are discussed a schematic overview of the analysis is provided in fig 3 3 1 basin and data description this study has been conducted on the thur basin 1703 km2 and its nine nested sub basins of various sizes fig 2 and table 1 in south eastern switzerland the thur basin is characterized by strong topographic variations with the highest point at the säntis alpine peak of 2502 m a s l and the lowest point at the outlet in andelfingen at 356 m a s l the large elevation difference causes orographic effects in the precipitation pattern and temperature gradients within the basin the climate in the thur can be characterized as an alpine pre alpine climatic regime with long term average precipitation varying from 2500 mm yr 1 in the säntis region to 1000 mm yr 1 in the lower parts of the basin in the winter season some parts of the basin are covered with snow because the sub basins are nested the ten basins considered in this study are not completely independent five basins have upstream nested basins frauenfeld st gallen jonschwil halden and the thur see fig 2 the rietholzbach the smallest sub basin of the thur is a research basin since 1976 seneviratne et al 2012 hourly discharge observations were obtained for the ten basins for the period 2002 2003 the discharge observation record is short which also results in short calibration and validation periods although a short observation record clearly is a disadvantage in a modelling exercise we do believe that this short observation period is representative for many practical applications where limited data are available seibert and beven 2009 tada and beven 2012 hourly forcing data for the same period have been obtained from nine meteorological stations in and around the basin these were spatially interpolated using the winmet tool viviroli et al 2009 this provided us with spatially distributed forcing data with a resolution of 1 1 km in order to compare the distributed forcing data with uniform forcing data section 2 2 uniform forcing data have been obtained by spatially averaging the distributed forcing data for every time step a more elaborate description of the discharge and forcing data used in this study can be found in melsen et al 2016b 3 2 extreme events the period 1 august 2002 31 august 2003 is characterized by three flood events in the thur basin august september 2002 as well as the severe 2003 drought june july august 2003 see fig 2 and supporting information s1 the rapid succession of these two contrasting hydrological events makes this period very interesting for our analysis although a range of flood triggering mechanisms can occur in the alpine pre alpine region parajka et al 2010 hall et al 2014 the thur flood events in 2002 were triggered by high rainfall zappa and kan 2007 the events have an estimated return period of 15 to 20 years the rainfall was part of a larger system a so called vb event becker and grünewald 2003 schmocker fackel and naef 2010 where a low pressure system was travelling from the atlantic south east to the mediterranean and from there north east across the alps the same system was responsible for severe flooding in central europe during this period becker and grünewald 2003 contrary to the wet 2002 autumn the 2003 summer was extremely warm and dry in western and central europe with switzerland being among the hottest and driest regions zappa and kan 2007 the 2003 hydrological drought that is anomalies in runoff was not only caused by precipitation anomalies but also by high evapotranspiration rates precipitation deficits already occurred in the early spring of 2003 thereby declining runoff however seneviratne et al 2012 demonstrate based on lysimeter data from the rietholzbach that the onset of soil moisture deficit was only from june onwards caused by evapotranspiration excess which further declined runoff 3 3 model routing and calibration the model choice is probably one of the most important decisions a modeler makes the goal of this study was however to show the impact of modeling decisions during model configuration beyond the model choice to illustrate this the impact of modeling decisions has been tested for one widely used hydrological model three variable infiltration capacity vic models version 4 1 2 i were configured with different spatial resolutions 1 1 km 5 5 km 10 10 km the model was run at an hourly time step solving both the water balance and the energy balance for the period 1 may 2002 31 august 2003 where the first three months were used as spin up period in melsen et al 2016b it was shown that three months are enough to remove the effect of initial conditions model spin up total runoff was routed through the channel network using the mizuroute routine mizukami et al 2016 because drought events usually have a process time scale in the order of weeks or months they do not require to be evaluated at an hourly resolution therefore the model output has first been aggregated from an hourly to a daily time step to analyze the drought event finally six models were configured three different spatial resolutions with two different spatial representations of forcing to identify the most sensitive parameters in the vic model the distributed evaluation of local sensitivity analysis delsa method rakovec et al 2014 has been applied on a selection of 28 parameters including several soil vegetation and snow parameters for computational efficiency the sensitivity analysis has been applied to a lumped version of the vic model of the thur however to investigate the effect of spatial resolution on parameter sensitivity two lumped models of sub basins of the thur have also been subject to a sensitivity analysis the jonschwil sub basin 495 km2 and the rietholzbach sub basin 3 3 km2 the most sensitive parameters have been identified based on the kge q the nse q and the nse logq sensitivity analysis on the three lumped models revealed that parameter sensitivity did not change considerably over the assessed scales and objective functions for the three lumped models four parameters showed high sensitivity the first four parameters in table 2 although the relative sensitivity differed for different spatial scales and objective functions the results of this sensitivity analysis closely resembled the results of demaria et al 2007 who conducted a sensitivity analysis of the vic model for four basins in the united states a fifth parameter was added to the selection because demaria et al 2007 found it to be highly sensitive parameter number 5 in table 2 furthermore two mizuroute parameters were added to the selection because they control the lateral exchange of water between grid cells a more elaborate description of the sensitivity analysis as well as an overview of the included parameters and their boundaries can be found in melsen et al 2016b the seven selected parameters in table 2 of the vic model and the routing routine have been sampled 3150 times using a hierarchical latin hypercube sample voȓechovský 2015 a latin hypercube sampling strategy was chosen because this is more efficient than random sampling strategies the advantage of the hierarchical method is that the size of the sample can be extended step by step inherent to the hierarchical latin hypercube sample voȓechovský 2015 is that every sample extension is twice as large as the previous sample the starting sample size was set at 350 sampled based on a space filling criterion with a uniform prior the next sample size was 350 2 plus the first sample 350 1 050 samples in total with a kolmogorov smirnov test it was tested whether the cumulative distribution function cdf of the objective functions significantly changed with an increased sample size it was shown that the cdf did not significantly change from 1050 samples to 3150 samples indicating that 3150 samples were enough to cover the parameter space melsen et al 2016b the vic model has been run with all 3150 parameter samples the seven sampled parameters table 2 have been applied uniformly over the basin whereas the other soil and land use parameters have been applied in a distributed fashion separate value for each grid cell based on data provided by the swiss federal institute for forest snow and landscape research wsl swisstopo license ja100118 and the harmonized world soil database fao et al 2012 a more elaborate description of these data can be found in melsen et al 2016b the different model configurations have been run with the full parameter sample over the model period fig 2 the use of a complete parameter sample instead of a calibration algorithm allowed us to make a fair comparison between the different model configurations avoiding pitfalls like local minima sensitivity to starting values or sensitivity to the calibration algorithm finally calibration selection of behavioral parameter sets is performed by identifying the best performing 1 32 runs of the 3 150 runs for each case separately the different cases consist of all the different combinations of the three investigated spatial resolutions with two different spatial representations of the forcing the best 1 was selected based on the nse q for the flood events and the nse logq for the drought event and based on the kge q for both events to investigate the influence of the performance metric one of the modeling decisions because the calibration period is also one of the modeling decisions investigated the best performing 32 runs have been determined separately for the high flow calibration period and the low flow calibration period the two calibration periods are indicated in fig 2 an overview of the model performance expressed in nse q and nse logq for the respective validation periods is given in supporting information s2 although direct comparison with obtained model performance in other studies is not fair due to different model periods calibration strategies and objective functions it can provide context on how well our model is able to capture the basin dynamics the highest achieved model performance in the thur basin for the flood validation period in our set up with the vic model is nse q 0 85 and for the drought validation period nse logq 0 58 this compares with the model performance obtained with the swat model by yang et al 2007 with a nse q of 0 77 for the calibration period and is for the drought period lower than performances obtained with the prevah model by zappa and kan 2007 with a nse q and nse logq higher than 0 85 for both calibration and validation period the highest model performance for the rietholzbach basin for the validation period of this study is nse q 0 53 and nse logq 0 63 this is lower than model performances reported by gurtz et al 2003 for the rietholzbach using the wasim eth model nse q 0 80 nse logq 0 82 and the prevah model nse q 0 71 nse logq 0 89 over the validation period 1981 1998 melsen et al 2014 applied a parsimonious stage discharge model to the rietholzbach and reported nse q 0 69 and nse logq 0 74 for the validation period given the relatively limited part of the parameter space that was explored in this study compared to the calibration strategies applied in the studies cited model performance was expected to be somewhat lower the best performing runs are however in range with the literature and therefore seem to be able to mimic the behavior of the thur basin and the rietholzbach basin quite well by selecting the best performing 1 of the runs all model configurations have an equally sized set of runs defined as behavioral this improves the robustness of the statistical test analysis of variance an implication of this approach is that the selected runs can have a relatively low model performance we do not expect that this influences our results to a significant extent either positively or negatively because we investigate the sensitivity of several characteristics for modeling decisions rather than evaluating the model performance directly in total six different model configurations were tested three spatial resolutions and two spatial representations of forcing uniform distributed which have been calibrated on two periods a high flow calibration period from mid september to mid february and a low flow calibration period from mid february to mid july with two objective functions nse q versus kge q for the flood events and nse logq versus kge q for the drought event finally the calibrated model configurations were validated for events that were not included in the calibration periods three flood events and one drought event fig 2 3 4 flood and drought characteristics to investigate the effect of subjective modeling decisions on extreme hydrological events the error in flood and drought characteristics between observations and simulations were investigated for different model configurations fig 3 the flood characteristics have been validated for three flood events fig 2 and the drought characteristics have been validated for one drought event fig 2 the three main characteristics of a flood event are the peak height the timing and the volume lobligeois et al 2014 for each behavioral model run the peak error timing error and relative volume error compared to observations were computed the peak error δ q p describes the difference between the maximum observed q obs p and simulated q sim p discharges 1 δ q p q sim p q obs p the timing error is defined as the difference in hours between the observed and the modeled peak 2 δ t p t q sim p t q obs p where t q sim p is the timing of the modeled peak and t q obs p is the timing of the observed peak both the peak error and the timing error are sensitive to small discharge fluctuations the relative volume error rve is the relative difference in total flow volume between observed and modeled discharge 3 rve q sim q obs q obs where q sim q obs is the summation of the difference in the simulated q sim and observed q obs discharge over all the time steps in the flood event to determine the beginning and the end of the flood event an adapted version of the method of lobligeois et al 2014 is used which is based on a threshold level q 0 the lowest modeled discharge q min in four days before and four days after the observed discharge peak is determined then the threshold level based on the defined q min is calculated 4 q 0 max t 4 t 4 q obs p 4 q min 0 05 q obs p q min the flood event starts as soon as the discharge exceeds threshold level q 0 and ends when the discharge drops below q 0 with this definition the flood event cannot start earlier than four days before the observed peak discharge and the end of the flood event cannot be later than four days after the observed peak discharge eight days in total the response times in our system are short in terms of several hours up to one day for the largest basin the thur and therefore four days should be sufficient to capture the flood event the error between simulations and observations for three specific drought characteristics has been investigated fig 3 drought duration and deficit are the two most common characteristics for a drought event van loon et al 2014 however drought duration was difficult to determine because the drought event was occasionally interrupted by short discharge peaks supporting information s1 for ecology and navigation the minimum flow is a relevant indicator and therefore the error in minimum flow and the error in timing of the minimum flow have been determined in addition to the error in drought deficit all errors in drought characteristics have been computed using a daily time step the error in minimum flow δ q min is defined as 5 δ q min q min sim q min obs which is simply the difference between the lowest simulated discharge q min sim and the lowest observed discharge q min obs during the drought event the error in the timing of the minimum flow δ t min is defined in the same way as the timing error for the peak flow events 6 δ t min t q sim min t q obs min here t q sim min is the timing of the lowest simulated discharge and t q obs min is the timing of the lowest observed discharge in order to define drought deficit first a variable threshold level τ hisdal et al 2004 for drought was defined in this study a drought starts as the discharge drops below the lowest 10 q 90 of the observations the threshold level was determined based on 39 years of daily observations identifying the lowest 10 of the discharge with a moving window of 31 days 15 days before and 15 days after the date for which the threshold level is determined drought deficit is then defined as the integral of the deviations d between the threshold level and the actual discharge van loon et al 2014 the deviation is defined as d t τ t q t if q t τ t 0 if q t τ t the total deficit d for a drought is then defined as 7 d t 1 t d t δ t the duration t of a drought is assumed to be the complete drought event the error in the drought deficit is the difference between the observed deficit d obs and the simulated deficit d sim 8 δ d d sim d obs 3 5 analysis of variance after computing the error in flood and drought characteristics for all the behavioral runs and for the different model configurations as shown in fig 3 analysis of variance anova was conducted ott and longnecker 2010 anova allows to test the hypothesis that the means of several groups in this case for example the peak error obtained with three different spatial resolutions are drawn from the same normal distribution the anova test provides the probability from zero zero probability to one certainty of this hypothesis analysis of variance was conducted for four factors the modeling decisions and has been applied to six response vectors the errors in flood and drought characteristics as shown in fig 3 if the probability p 0 05 the factor was assumed to have significant impact on the response vector the aim of this study was to demonstrate that modeling decisions significantly impact the simulation of two hydrological extremes for a case study in the thur and its nine sub basins this can directly be demonstrated by evaluating if any of the investigated decisions significantly p value lower than 0 05 impacts the error in any of the flood or drought characteristics to investigate how persistent the impact of the modeling decision is on the flood and drought characteristics the results of the ten investigated basins are compared to get insight in the underlying mechanisms causing the impact of subjective modeling decisions it was also investigated how the decisions impact the parameter distribution using anova 4 results 4 1 flood characteristics in this section we focus on three flood events fig 2 fig 4 shows how the different model configurations impact the peak error panel a timing error panel d and relative volume error panel g for the three flood events in the thur basin although the magnitude of the error differs per event the relative difference between the configurations is more or less stable over the events except for the timing error fig 4 also shows to what extent the impact of modeling decisions on the error in characteristics of the three flood events is significant using anova panels c f and i fig 4c shows that the peak error for all basins and for all three flood events is significantly affected by the spatial representation of the forcing the calibration period and the performance metric resolution plays a significant role in some basins for some events the impact of the four investigated modeling decisions on the timing error fig 4f is less clear the spatial representation of the forcing affects many basins for the first and second event but for the third event the calibration period impacts more basins significantly the performance metric significantly affects the timing error in at least six basins the relative volume error fig 4i is mainly impacted by the performance metric followed by the spatial representation of the forcing and the calibration period spatial resolution has considerable effects on the relative volume error only in the smaller basins the simulated flood events are mainly affected by the performance metric followed by the calibration period and the spatial representation of the forcing respectively the spatial resolution plays a minor role the flood peak is the characteristic most affected by subjective modeling decisions a summary of the results is given in table 3 4 2 drought characteristics fig 4 shows how the different model configurations affect the error in minimum flow panel b timing error panel e and deficit error panel h in the thur basin and the nine sub basins the results show that the calibration period has a large impact on the error in drought characteristics fig 4c shows that in all basins the calibration period significantly impacts the error in the minimum flow the spatial representation of the forcing is important for the error in the minimum flow in four basins and the spatial resolution only in one basin using the performance metric kge q as opposed to nse logq significantly affects the error in minimum flow in seven out of ten basins for the timing error in the minimum flow we recognize the same pattern as for the timing error in the peak flow fig 4f the impact of the modeling decisions does not show a consistent pattern over the ten basins although the calibration period has a significant impact in all basins the spatial resolution and the performance metric show to be important in at least six basins for the deficit error fig 4i the choice of the calibration period seems to be the most important decision with a significant impact in eight out of ten basins the spatial representation of the forcing and the performance metric significantly affects the deficit error in five basins spatial resolution significantly affects the deficit error in only four basins these results show that the drought characteristics are mainly affected by the calibration period followed by the performance metric the spatial resolution and the spatial representation of the forcing the summary in table 3 reveals that the timing error in the minimum flow experiences most impact from the investigated subjective modeling decisions 4 3 impact on parameter distribution table 4 provides an overview of the percentage of basins for which the distribution of the sampled parameters table 2 was significantly affected by any of the four modeling decisions using anova for the flood events spatial resolution had the lowest impact on the parameter distribution most basins and most parameters were affected by the calibration period followed by the performance metric the most affected parameters are the depth 2 the depth of soil layer 2 and c the velocity parameter of the routing scheme for the drought event calibration period is by far the most important modeling decision that determines the parameter distribution at a distance this is followed by the performance metric especially the infiltration shape parameter b i and the parameter describing the base flow relation d s are affected by the modeling decisions the affected parameters differ for flood and drought events for the flood events mainly the parameters impacting the response time are influenced by the modeling decisions whereas for the low flows the infiltration and base flow parameter are mostly affected by the decisions for the low flows the calibration period is by far the most important decision whereas spatial resolution only plays a very minor role for high flows the calibration period is most important followed closely by the performance metric and the spatial representation of the forcing 5 discussion the main point of this study was to demonstrate that subjective modeling decisions beyond the model choice affect the simulation of a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin in section 5 1 we aim to relate the results to relevant hydrological processes during the investigate flood and drought event section 5 2 discusses several decisions that we authors and modelers made during the design of this study 5 1 relation between results and hydrological processes preferably we would be able to couple the impact of the investigated modeling decisions on our model simulations to the hydrological functioning of our system or to particular hydrological processes this could help to substantiate certain modeling decisions although this study is a case study with only one flood and drought event type investigated for ten nested basins with comparable climate and land use several links can still be identified the clearest example is the limited impact of the spatial representation of the forcing on the error in drought characteristics the studied hydrological drought was partly caused by a lack of precipitation seneviratne et al 2012 when little or no precipitation is falling the spatial resolution of the precipitation data is not relevant since it will remain nearly zero throughout the basin the results seem to follow the line of expectation however seneviratne et al 2012 also demonstrates that high evapotranspiration et rates played an important role in the onset of the 2003 drought at least in terms of soil moisture gurtz et al 1999 emphasize that the spatial resolution of the model is very important when modelling et rates in mountainous regions for the thur gurtz et al 1999 recommend no coarser resolution than 2 2 km and zappa 2002 even recommends a resolution of max 1 1 km in the hilly sub regions of the thur which can explain why the modelling decision on the resolution of the model had more impact on the drought simulations compared to the flood simulations and compared to the spatial representation of the forcing for the drought simulation the calibration period and the performance metric had most influence on the drought simulation which stresses the importance of modelling decisions concerning calibration strategy for other hydrological drought typologies for example a cold snow season drought below average temperature at the end of the snow season causing a delay in snow melt vann loon and van lanen 2012 et rates might be less relevant and therefore spatial resolution of the model might be less important on the other hand a high spatial resolution might still be needed to capture highly heterogeneous snow melt processes the three high flow events that were studied in the thur basin and the nine subbasins were caused by rainfall from a large low pressure system although the precipitation still displayed a high spatial variation see fig 6 therefore it can be understood that the spatial representation of the forcing i e lumped or distributed did have substantial impact on the flood simulations in most basins on the other hand the spatial resolution of the model only had minor influence on the flood simulations with a high spatial resolution the model can better capture spatial variability in soil moisture which can influence surface runoff processes but perhaps spatial variability in soil moisture was limited because the wet conditions extended over the complete basin for other flood typologies such as flash floods that usually have a very local character the spatial resolution might play a more important role as for the drought simulations calibration period and performance metric also had most impact on the flood simulations in this study underlining the important role of a deliberate calibration in rainfall runoff modeling although the results of this study can be explained through process reasoning this section does show that this case study does not yet provide enough insights to draw robust conclusions to substantiate hydrological modelling decisions concerning drought and floods different flood and drought typologies but also a different climate or spatial variation in elevation or land use given the variation in results among the sub basins could lead to different decisions that have most impact on the simulations more research is needed to provide insights into the impact of modeling decisions on hydrological extremes 5 2 subjectivity in our study design the results of this study also depend on model decisions that we as modelers and authors made for the experimental set up we only investigated the effect of four modeling decisions although many more decisions were made while setting up our experiments clear examples of these decisions are the uniform application of the sampled parameters the length of the calibration period the choice for spatially interpolated station data as forcing and the selection of the best 1 of the model runs as behavioral further we also made important decisions on the parameters included in the sensitivity analysis their boundaries and the sampling strategy adopted the uniform application of the sampled parameters can decrease the effect of spatial resolution most likely the spatial resolution will become a more important modeling decision when the sampled parameters are applied in a distributed fashion a randomly distributed sample would however be a heavy computational burden one potential approach is the use of spatial regularization methods where transfer functions are formulated to relate the model parameters to physical characteristics e g samaniego et al 2010 with this method spatially distributed parameters can be sampled by perturbing the coefficient of the transfer function however no pedo transfer functions have been identified for the vic model therefore sampling parameters in a semi distributed fashion was out of reach in our current set up the length of the calibration period was fixed to five months for the rietholzbach basin this was shown to be a sufficient period to obtain stable parameters for a parsimonious model melsen et al 2014 in this study the calibration period is one of the most influencing decisions investigated which implies that in this case study a five month calibration period is not sufficient to obtain stable parameters this effect can be even stronger when shorter calibration periods are explored therefore the analysis as shown in fig 3 has been repeated with five different calibration periods the initial five months each time shortened with one month up to a calibration period of one month only the different calibration periods have been obtained by decreasing the period each time with 15 days at the beginning of the period and 15 days at the end of the period fig 5 shows that the investigated modeling decisions still have significant impact on the error in characteristics of the hydrological extremes for a shorter calibration period most modeling decisions that have shown to significantly impact the error in the characteristics based on a five month calibration period remain significant for shorter calibration periods and vice versa vaze et al 2010 showed that model parameters are more resilient for climate change when they have been calibrated using a period of 20 years or longer and the mean annual rainfall did not change by more than 20 15 decrease or 20 increase this implies that the impact of the choice of calibration period decreases when the length of the calibration period is increased however our experimental set up with a large parameter sample did not allow a very long calibration period for computational reasons the selection of the best 1 of the sample as behavioral is not so much a modeling decision as it is a decision in the research set up to investigate the effect of this choice the analysis as shown in fig 5 was repeated with 10 different sample sizes 1 the initial size and 10 up to 100 of the sample each time increasing with 10 fig 5 shows that choosing a larger sample affects the results but in most cases it increases the significance level of the modeling decisions concerning the error in characteristics of the extremes the figure also shows that as expected the choices of calibration period and performance metric approach p 1 a very high probability that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution i e no significant difference between the two samples when the complete sample 100 is used as behavioral in other words when the complete parameter sample is used it becomes unimportant which period or metric is used for calibration because essentially no calibration is performed a remarkable result is that the spatial resolution and the spatial representation of the forcing remain important for the complete sample they apparently impact the model output in such a manner that the complete parameter sample changes significantly given the caveats discussed above the order of importance of the investigated modeling decisions on hydrological extremes could change if other modeling decisions or experimental configurations would be adopted nevertheless the conclusion that subjective modeling decisions significantly impact the simulation of hydrological extremes remains valid 6 summary and conclusion computational models in earth and environmental sciences have to deal with uncertainty which is partially augmented by subjective modeling decisions e g model choice performance metric selection the impact of model choice on model results is generally acknowledged whereas the uncertainty introduced by modeling decisions during the configuration of the model is often neglected in this study we show with an example for a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin that modeling decisions beyond the model choice affect model results significantly we investigated four modeling decisions spatial resolution of the model spatial representation of the forcing data calibration period and performance metric and examined the impact of these decisions on the error in three flood characteristics and three drought characteristics for a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin both extreme events were mainly impacted by the two calibration decisions the calibration period and the performance metric for the flood events also the spatial representation of the forcing was important which could be explained by the spatial variability of the precipitation during the studied flood events for the drought event the role of spatial resolution of the model could be related to evapotranspiration processes that played a role during the onset of the studied drought event however extreme events such as floods and drought can be triggered by different processes and a different typology of any of the events could therefore lead to a different impact of the modeling decisions on the model simulations furthermore the impact of the investigated modeling decisions differed from sub basin to sub basin even though the compared basins had much in common in terms of climate and land use therefore more research is needed to provide insights into the impact of subjective modeling decisions on model simulations however in spite of the limitations of this study our results do undeniably show that modeling decisions impact the simulation of hydrological extremes this is undesirable because it implies that the predicted severity of a hydrological extreme would depend on the subjective decisions made by the modeler a better understanding of the uncertainty in hydrological model results can improve the robustness of water management decisions mcmillan et al 2017 many model studies therefore already include some form of uncertainty analysis by comparing several models or several parameter sets modeling decisions however are hardly ever included in these analyses whereas this study has shown that their impact on the results is significant an evaluation of the impact of modeling decisions helps in estimating the value of model results this paper provides an example on how to conduct such an assessment for a specific hydrologic application further it is critical to constrain the spectrum of options or hypotheses for a particular modeling decision based on the information that can be extracted from different data sources e g gupta et al 2008 which provide additional knowledge on the behavior of environmental systems uncertainty associated to a particular modeling decision can be characterized through multiple working hypotheses clark

the following are the supplementary data to this article supplementary data 1 
6870,it is generally acknowledged in the environmental sciences that the choice of a computational model impacts the research results in this study of a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin we show that modeling decisions during the model configuration beyond the model choice also impact the model results in our carefully designed experiment we investigated four modeling decisions in ten nested basins the spatial resolution of the model the spatial representation of the forcing data the calibration period and the performance metric the flood characteristics were mainly affected by the performance metric whereas the drought characteristics were mainly affected by the calibration period the results could be related to the processes that triggered the particular events studied the impact of the modeling decisions on the simulations did however vary among the investigated sub basins in spite of the limitations of this study our findings have important implications for the understanding and quantification of uncertainty in any hydrological or even environmental model modeling decisions during model configuration introduce subjectivity from the modeler multiple working hypotheses during model configuration can provide insights on the impact of such subjective modeling decisions keywords hydrological modeling hydrological extremes subjectivity modeling decisions model configuration 1 introduction in jury sports such as gymnastics the jury is supposed to objectively evaluate the outcome of the competition in a study on home advantage for the summer olympic games it was however shown that jury sports experience a significant home advantage in contrast to sports which are based on objective measurements balmer et al 2003 this suggests that the jury is actually making subjective decisions despite their expert knowledge and all the rubrics and directives that have been drafted in order to objectify their decision it is generally acknowledged that models in earth and environmental sciences are affected by several sources of uncertainty oreskes et al 1994 uncertainty can for example stem from the randomness of natural processes so called aleatoric uncertainty or from an insufficient representation of the involved processes epistemic uncertainty there is agreement that the model choice basically the choice for a particular representation of the processes affects the output and thus the results of the study as shown by numerous model intercomparison studies see e g joussaume et al 1999 on climate modeling holländer et al 2009 and clark et al 2015 on hydrological modeling freni et al 2009 on urban stormwater modeling and bennett et al 2013 on benchmarking environmental models the modeler or expert acts as jury to determine the most appropriate model for the question at hand crout et al 2009 while model intercomparison studies provide the modeler with rubrics and directives to judge the model performance in a fair way as such the model choice can be justified based on expert knowledge and the rubrics and directives from model intercomparison studies it should be noted however that expert knowledge is actually a mixture of opinion and knowledge krueger et al 2012 also interestingly shown by the model intercomparison of holländer et al 2009 where different modelers decided differently on which processes were relevant enough to represent in the model the opinion part of expert knowledge introduces subjectivity in the model choice in the same way that the gymnastics jury at the olympic games showed to cause home advantage different experts could make different choices based on the same information furthermore model choice is only the first decision in a sequence of decisions a modeler has to make during model configuration the impact of those modeling decisions is currently overlooked in most if not all model intercomparison studies and an assessment of their relative importance is lacking several studies in different research disciplines have shown that individual modeling decisions during model configuration can have a large impact on model results cosgrove et al 2003 for example showed how the length of the spin up period affects nldas simulations illustrating the large effects that chosen spin up periods can have on land surface modeling this study explicitly validates a spin up modeling decision in the nldas project pappenberger et al 2006 explicitly study the effect of upstream boundary conditions and the way bridges are represented in the model on flood inundation predictions it was demonstrated that the upstream boundary condition had significant impact on the model results a recent study by hauser et al 2017 shows that dependent on the adopted methodology and input data besides the choice for a particular model the european 2015 drought was more likely less likely or unaffected by anthropogenic forcing this demonstrates the large uncertainties that are introduced by methodological choices such as modeling decisions different model configurations are however not always identified as modeling decisions and the subjectivity of these decisions is hardly ever acknowledged for instance ettema et al 2009 showed that 24 more annual precipitation over the greenland ice sheet was obtained from a high resolution regional climate model rcm compared to coarser resolution rcm output though it may depend on the available data or the available computational resources the spatial resolution of the model is often a choice of the modeler neal et al 2010 compared three parallelization methods to model 2d flood inundations where each method i e modeling decision had particular drawbacks neither ettema et al 2009 nor neal et al 2010 explicitly discuss their results as modeling decisions some sources of uncertainty for example concerning model choice model intercomparison studies or optimal model parameters calibration studies have been scrutinized in detail whereas other sources of uncertainty such as modeling decisions during model configuration received considerably less attention or are not recognized as such although they might have an equally relevant impact on the model results a possible explanation can be that the uncertainty caused by modeling decisions is introduced before the first model calculations start making it difficult to quantify this source of uncertainty we note however a slowly growing interest in describing and comprehending modeling decisions and their impact on model output for example in the fields of water resources maier and dandy 2000 and hydrology clark and kavetski 2010 kavetski and clark 2010 clark et al 2011 ceola et al 2015 mendoza et al 2016 mendoza et al 2015 fenicia et al 2016 the attention for this topic in the hydrological sciences is a logical extension of the ambition to improve realism in hydrological models e g beven 1989 mcdonnell et al 2007 clark et al 2016 which are generally known for their conceptual nature especially compared to other environmental sciences such as meteorology and oceanography in this study we argue that the choice for a particular model is only one of several modeling decisions and we illustrate the importance of modeling decisions during model configuration through an example from hydrology in particular we investigate the impacts of four modeling decisions on the simulation of a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin our aim is to demonstrate the impact of multiple modeling decisions on model results and to raise awareness to recognize the uncertainty introduced by modeling decisions a novel contribution of this study is that we systematically investigate and quantify the statistical significance of multiple modeling decisions furthermore the results of this study are particularly relevant because both floods and drought can have a strong societal and economic impact which water managers aim to mitigate by model predictions 2 modeling decisions in hydrology the sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling have been an inspiration for an abundance of scientific literature e g wagener and gupta 2005 liu and gupta 2007 and have led to methods to estimate and quantify uncertainty among others beven and binley 1992 vrugt and sadegh 2013 vrugt and sadegh 2013 developed a bayesian evaluation framework that explicitly recognizes six different sources of uncertainty parameters forcing initial state model structure output and new states as shown in fig 1 hydrologic modeling however is also surrounded by modeling decisions as illustrated in the ellipse in fig 1 and discussed in clark et al 2011 2015 these modeling decisions do not only introduce uncertainty not incorporated in the bayesian evaluation framework in fig 1 they also influence the uncertainty estimated with the framework for example they determine the prior in a bayesian framework or parameter uncertainty as affected by the parameter boundaries many modeling decisions are relevant during the process sometimes referred to as the art of modeling fig 1 in this study we focus on four modeling decisions for which the scientific literature provides ambiguous advice to the hydrologic modeler the spatial resolution the spatial representation of the forcing the calibration period and the performance metric we aim to illustrate and rank the effects of these decisions on the simulation of a flood and a drought event in the swiss thur basin we recognize that since we focus on only four modeling decisions and only two events in one basin the results of our study will be impacted by many other modeling decisions that we as authors made during model configuration and on the specifics of the investigated events this is further discussed in section 5 2 1 spatial resolution an important decision that modelers make when setting up a distributed hydrological model is how to represent the spatial distribution the use of a constant grid is already a first modeling decision leaving aside options such as hydrological response units hru s or sub basins the second decision is the spatial resolution this choice is often bounded by the available data or the calculation time nowadays both the availability of spatially distributed data at high resolution and the computational power are increasing this has led to the call for large scale hyper resolution hydrological modeling wood et al 2011 for the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 it was shown that the spatial resolution applied in the scientific literature has increased over the years melsen et al 2016a several studies have investigated the effect of spatial resolution e g haddeland et al 2002 liang et al 2004 troy et al 2008 melsen et al 2016b but the reported results are ambiguous troy et al 2008 for example found a high sensitivity of the optimal parameter values to the spatial resolution whereas melsen et al 2016b found exactly the opposite for the same model both studies applied a different strategy to identify parameters of a distributed model in this study we compare three different spatial resolutions ranging from the so called hyper resolution as advocated by wood et al 2011 1 1 km to regional scale hydrology 10 10 km representing the finest test resolution of troy et al 2008 and an intermediate spatial resolution 5 5 km 2 2 spatial representation of forcing another important choice for distributed hydrological modeling is the spatial representation of the forcing data in this paper we explore the question do we apply the forcing in a lumped fashion over the basin or in a distributed fashion the choice of forcing data is in many applications a matter of choice between existing datasets whose spatial resolution is already determined one could subjectively select global data sets like watch or era interim which are available at 0 5 or 0 25 resolution worldwide otherwise one needs to invest time and resources in high resolution forcing data e g obtained directly from meteorological stations or weather radars several studies already compared predictive accuracy and summary metrics for hydrologic models fed with spatially distributed and uniform forcing data starting with wilson et al 1979 followed by e g beven and hornberger 1982 1994 2008 2013 2014 none of the studies based on a large range of basins zhao et al 2013 lobligeois et al 2014 reported consistent results the benefit of distributed data depends on the spatial variability of rainfall in the region and at the time scale of interest as pointed out by lobligeois et al 2014 in the basin where our study is conducted see section 3 1 topography causes a high spatial variability in rainfall therefore spatially distributed forcing could potentially be of added value although this could differ for the flood short time scale and drought long time scale event in this study we use spatially interpolated also a modeling decision data based on nine meteorological stations in and around the basin of interest see section 3 1 we compare uniformly applied representing global datasets like watch and era interim versus spatially distributed representing gauge networks or radars forcing 2 3 calibration period the choice of the calibration period is critical for studies where models are used to extrapolate observations in time for example to investigate the effects of climate or land use change future high or low flow events may be beyond the range of historically observed events wagener et al 2010 suggesting that parameter values obtained from calibration on current day observations may not be the most suitable for a future climate to mimic this effect several studies applied a differential split sample test klemeš 1986 in which the calibration and validation periods are significantly different in terms of precipitation and flow regime see e g coron et al 2012 li et al 2012 merz et al 2011 coron et al 2012 showed that the effect of the chosen calibration period on average runoff volume differed per sub basin considered and li et al 2012 concluded that some parameters are more sensitive to that choice than others further merz et al 2011 found that many parameters which are assumed to be time invariant are actually not these considerations make it extremely difficult for a modeler to decide on an appropriate calibration period in this study we compare a high flow calibration period to a low flow calibration period thus applying the differential split sample test shown in fig 2 note however that the length of the calibration period can also impact the modeling results see amongst others vaze et al 2010 melsen et al 2014 this point is further discussed in section 5 2 4 performance metric the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 is the most widely used performance metric in hydrology even though several caveats have been identified schaefli and gupta 2007 alternatives for the nse have been proposed for example the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 which allows for a better weighing of a correlation term a bias term and a measure of relative variability another approach is to use multiple criteria e g in a pareto optimization framework e g madsen 2003 since the call for a more process based evaluation of hydrologic models mcdonnell et al 2007 gupta et al 2008 clark et al 2016 hydrologic signatures have become more popular as performance metrics hydrologic signatures e g the slope of the flow duration curve or ecologically relevant streamflow indicators as in pool et al 2017 help in providing insights on how adequate process representations are sawicz et al 2011 in this study we compare the nse q and nse logq for floods and drought respectively with the kge q representing average flow conditions 3 methods in this section the basin the investigated extreme events and the conducted analyses are discussed a schematic overview of the analysis is provided in fig 3 3 1 basin and data description this study has been conducted on the thur basin 1703 km2 and its nine nested sub basins of various sizes fig 2 and table 1 in south eastern switzerland the thur basin is characterized by strong topographic variations with the highest point at the säntis alpine peak of 2502 m a s l and the lowest point at the outlet in andelfingen at 356 m a s l the large elevation difference causes orographic effects in the precipitation pattern and temperature gradients within the basin the climate in the thur can be characterized as an alpine pre alpine climatic regime with long term average precipitation varying from 2500 mm yr 1 in the säntis region to 1000 mm yr 1 in the lower parts of the basin in the winter season some parts of the basin are covered with snow because the sub basins are nested the ten basins considered in this study are not completely independent five basins have upstream nested basins frauenfeld st gallen jonschwil halden and the thur see fig 2 the rietholzbach the smallest sub basin of the thur is a research basin since 1976 seneviratne et al 2012 hourly discharge observations were obtained for the ten basins for the period 2002 2003 the discharge observation record is short which also results in short calibration and validation periods although a short observation record clearly is a disadvantage in a modelling exercise we do believe that this short observation period is representative for many practical applications where limited data are available seibert and beven 2009 tada and beven 2012 hourly forcing data for the same period have been obtained from nine meteorological stations in and around the basin these were spatially interpolated using the winmet tool viviroli et al 2009 this provided us with spatially distributed forcing data with a resolution of 1 1 km in order to compare the distributed forcing data with uniform forcing data section 2 2 uniform forcing data have been obtained by spatially averaging the distributed forcing data for every time step a more elaborate description of the discharge and forcing data used in this study can be found in melsen et al 2016b 3 2 extreme events the period 1 august 2002 31 august 2003 is characterized by three flood events in the thur basin august september 2002 as well as the severe 2003 drought june july august 2003 see fig 2 and supporting information s1 the rapid succession of these two contrasting hydrological events makes this period very interesting for our analysis although a range of flood triggering mechanisms can occur in the alpine pre alpine region parajka et al 2010 hall et al 2014 the thur flood events in 2002 were triggered by high rainfall zappa and kan 2007 the events have an estimated return period of 15 to 20 years the rainfall was part of a larger system a so called vb event becker and grünewald 2003 schmocker fackel and naef 2010 where a low pressure system was travelling from the atlantic south east to the mediterranean and from there north east across the alps the same system was responsible for severe flooding in central europe during this period becker and grünewald 2003 contrary to the wet 2002 autumn the 2003 summer was extremely warm and dry in western and central europe with switzerland being among the hottest and driest regions zappa and kan 2007 the 2003 hydrological drought that is anomalies in runoff was not only caused by precipitation anomalies but also by high evapotranspiration rates precipitation deficits already occurred in the early spring of 2003 thereby declining runoff however seneviratne et al 2012 demonstrate based on lysimeter data from the rietholzbach that the onset of soil moisture deficit was only from june onwards caused by evapotranspiration excess which further declined runoff 3 3 model routing and calibration the model choice is probably one of the most important decisions a modeler makes the goal of this study was however to show the impact of modeling decisions during model configuration beyond the model choice to illustrate this the impact of modeling decisions has been tested for one widely used hydrological model three variable infiltration capacity vic models version 4 1 2 i were configured with different spatial resolutions 1 1 km 5 5 km 10 10 km the model was run at an hourly time step solving both the water balance and the energy balance for the period 1 may 2002 31 august 2003 where the first three months were used as spin up period in melsen et al 2016b it was shown that three months are enough to remove the effect of initial conditions model spin up total runoff was routed through the channel network using the mizuroute routine mizukami et al 2016 because drought events usually have a process time scale in the order of weeks or months they do not require to be evaluated at an hourly resolution therefore the model output has first been aggregated from an hourly to a daily time step to analyze the drought event finally six models were configured three different spatial resolutions with two different spatial representations of forcing to identify the most sensitive parameters in the vic model the distributed evaluation of local sensitivity analysis delsa method rakovec et al 2014 has been applied on a selection of 28 parameters including several soil vegetation and snow parameters for computational efficiency the sensitivity analysis has been applied to a lumped version of the vic model of the thur however to investigate the effect of spatial resolution on parameter sensitivity two lumped models of sub basins of the thur have also been subject to a sensitivity analysis the jonschwil sub basin 495 km2 and the rietholzbach sub basin 3 3 km2 the most sensitive parameters have been identified based on the kge q the nse q and the nse logq sensitivity analysis on the three lumped models revealed that parameter sensitivity did not change considerably over the assessed scales and objective functions for the three lumped models four parameters showed high sensitivity the first four parameters in table 2 although the relative sensitivity differed for different spatial scales and objective functions the results of this sensitivity analysis closely resembled the results of demaria et al 2007 who conducted a sensitivity analysis of the vic model for four basins in the united states a fifth parameter was added to the selection because demaria et al 2007 found it to be highly sensitive parameter number 5 in table 2 furthermore two mizuroute parameters were added to the selection because they control the lateral exchange of water between grid cells a more elaborate description of the sensitivity analysis as well as an overview of the included parameters and their boundaries can be found in melsen et al 2016b the seven selected parameters in table 2 of the vic model and the routing routine have been sampled 3150 times using a hierarchical latin hypercube sample voȓechovský 2015 a latin hypercube sampling strategy was chosen because this is more efficient than random sampling strategies the advantage of the hierarchical method is that the size of the sample can be extended step by step inherent to the hierarchical latin hypercube sample voȓechovský 2015 is that every sample extension is twice as large as the previous sample the starting sample size was set at 350 sampled based on a space filling criterion with a uniform prior the next sample size was 350 2 plus the first sample 350 1 050 samples in total with a kolmogorov smirnov test it was tested whether the cumulative distribution function cdf of the objective functions significantly changed with an increased sample size it was shown that the cdf did not significantly change from 1050 samples to 3150 samples indicating that 3150 samples were enough to cover the parameter space melsen et al 2016b the vic model has been run with all 3150 parameter samples the seven sampled parameters table 2 have been applied uniformly over the basin whereas the other soil and land use parameters have been applied in a distributed fashion separate value for each grid cell based on data provided by the swiss federal institute for forest snow and landscape research wsl swisstopo license ja100118 and the harmonized world soil database fao et al 2012 a more elaborate description of these data can be found in melsen et al 2016b the different model configurations have been run with the full parameter sample over the model period fig 2 the use of a complete parameter sample instead of a calibration algorithm allowed us to make a fair comparison between the different model configurations avoiding pitfalls like local minima sensitivity to starting values or sensitivity to the calibration algorithm finally calibration selection of behavioral parameter sets is performed by identifying the best performing 1 32 runs of the 3 150 runs for each case separately the different cases consist of all the different combinations of the three investigated spatial resolutions with two different spatial representations of the forcing the best 1 was selected based on the nse q for the flood events and the nse logq for the drought event and based on the kge q for both events to investigate the influence of the performance metric one of the modeling decisions because the calibration period is also one of the modeling decisions investigated the best performing 32 runs have been determined separately for the high flow calibration period and the low flow calibration period the two calibration periods are indicated in fig 2 an overview of the model performance expressed in nse q and nse logq for the respective validation periods is given in supporting information s2 although direct comparison with obtained model performance in other studies is not fair due to different model periods calibration strategies and objective functions it can provide context on how well our model is able to capture the basin dynamics the highest achieved model performance in the thur basin for the flood validation period in our set up with the vic model is nse q 0 85 and for the drought validation period nse logq 0 58 this compares with the model performance obtained with the swat model by yang et al 2007 with a nse q of 0 77 for the calibration period and is for the drought period lower than performances obtained with the prevah model by zappa and kan 2007 with a nse q and nse logq higher than 0 85 for both calibration and validation period the highest model performance for the rietholzbach basin for the validation period of this study is nse q 0 53 and nse logq 0 63 this is lower than model performances reported by gurtz et al 2003 for the rietholzbach using the wasim eth model nse q 0 80 nse logq 0 82 and the prevah model nse q 0 71 nse logq 0 89 over the validation period 1981 1998 melsen et al 2014 applied a parsimonious stage discharge model to the rietholzbach and reported nse q 0 69 and nse logq 0 74 for the validation period given the relatively limited part of the parameter space that was explored in this study compared to the calibration strategies applied in the studies cited model performance was expected to be somewhat lower the best performing runs are however in range with the literature and therefore seem to be able to mimic the behavior of the thur basin and the rietholzbach basin quite well by selecting the best performing 1 of the runs all model configurations have an equally sized set of runs defined as behavioral this improves the robustness of the statistical test analysis of variance an implication of this approach is that the selected runs can have a relatively low model performance we do not expect that this influences our results to a significant extent either positively or negatively because we investigate the sensitivity of several characteristics for modeling decisions rather than evaluating the model performance directly in total six different model configurations were tested three spatial resolutions and two spatial representations of forcing uniform distributed which have been calibrated on two periods a high flow calibration period from mid september to mid february and a low flow calibration period from mid february to mid july with two objective functions nse q versus kge q for the flood events and nse logq versus kge q for the drought event finally the calibrated model configurations were validated for events that were not included in the calibration periods three flood events and one drought event fig 2 3 4 flood and drought characteristics to investigate the effect of subjective modeling decisions on extreme hydrological events the error in flood and drought characteristics between observations and simulations were investigated for different model configurations fig 3 the flood characteristics have been validated for three flood events fig 2 and the drought characteristics have been validated for one drought event fig 2 the three main characteristics of a flood event are the peak height the timing and the volume lobligeois et al 2014 for each behavioral model run the peak error timing error and relative volume error compared to observations were computed the peak error δ q p describes the difference between the maximum observed q obs p and simulated q sim p discharges 1 δ q p q sim p q obs p the timing error is defined as the difference in hours between the observed and the modeled peak 2 δ t p t q sim p t q obs p where t q sim p is the timing of the modeled peak and t q obs p is the timing of the observed peak both the peak error and the timing error are sensitive to small discharge fluctuations the relative volume error rve is the relative difference in total flow volume between observed and modeled discharge 3 rve q sim q obs q obs where q sim q obs is the summation of the difference in the simulated q sim and observed q obs discharge over all the time steps in the flood event to determine the beginning and the end of the flood event an adapted version of the method of lobligeois et al 2014 is used which is based on a threshold level q 0 the lowest modeled discharge q min in four days before and four days after the observed discharge peak is determined then the threshold level based on the defined q min is calculated 4 q 0 max t 4 t 4 q obs p 4 q min 0 05 q obs p q min the flood event starts as soon as the discharge exceeds threshold level q 0 and ends when the discharge drops below q 0 with this definition the flood event cannot start earlier than four days before the observed peak discharge and the end of the flood event cannot be later than four days after the observed peak discharge eight days in total the response times in our system are short in terms of several hours up to one day for the largest basin the thur and therefore four days should be sufficient to capture the flood event the error between simulations and observations for three specific drought characteristics has been investigated fig 3 drought duration and deficit are the two most common characteristics for a drought event van loon et al 2014 however drought duration was difficult to determine because the drought event was occasionally interrupted by short discharge peaks supporting information s1 for ecology and navigation the minimum flow is a relevant indicator and therefore the error in minimum flow and the error in timing of the minimum flow have been determined in addition to the error in drought deficit all errors in drought characteristics have been computed using a daily time step the error in minimum flow δ q min is defined as 5 δ q min q min sim q min obs which is simply the difference between the lowest simulated discharge q min sim and the lowest observed discharge q min obs during the drought event the error in the timing of the minimum flow δ t min is defined in the same way as the timing error for the peak flow events 6 δ t min t q sim min t q obs min here t q sim min is the timing of the lowest simulated discharge and t q obs min is the timing of the lowest observed discharge in order to define drought deficit first a variable threshold level τ hisdal et al 2004 for drought was defined in this study a drought starts as the discharge drops below the lowest 10 q 90 of the observations the threshold level was determined based on 39 years of daily observations identifying the lowest 10 of the discharge with a moving window of 31 days 15 days before and 15 days after the date for which the threshold level is determined drought deficit is then defined as the integral of the deviations d between the threshold level and the actual discharge van loon et al 2014 the deviation is defined as d t τ t q t if q t τ t 0 if q t τ t the total deficit d for a drought is then defined as 7 d t 1 t d t δ t the duration t of a drought is assumed to be the complete drought event the error in the drought deficit is the difference between the observed deficit d obs and the simulated deficit d sim 8 δ d d sim d obs 3 5 analysis of variance after computing the error in flood and drought characteristics for all the behavioral runs and for the different model configurations as shown in fig 3 analysis of variance anova was conducted ott and longnecker 2010 anova allows to test the hypothesis that the means of several groups in this case for example the peak error obtained with three different spatial resolutions are drawn from the same normal distribution the anova test provides the probability from zero zero probability to one certainty of this hypothesis analysis of variance was conducted for four factors the modeling decisions and has been applied to six response vectors the errors in flood and drought characteristics as shown in fig 3 if the probability p 0 05 the factor was assumed to have significant impact on the response vector the aim of this study was to demonstrate that modeling decisions significantly impact the simulation of two hydrological extremes for a case study in the thur and its nine sub basins this can directly be demonstrated by evaluating if any of the investigated decisions significantly p value lower than 0 05 impacts the error in any of the flood or drought characteristics to investigate how persistent the impact of the modeling decision is on the flood and drought characteristics the results of the ten investigated basins are compared to get insight in the underlying mechanisms causing the impact of subjective modeling decisions it was also investigated how the decisions impact the parameter distribution using anova 4 results 4 1 flood characteristics in this section we focus on three flood events fig 2 fig 4 shows how the different model configurations impact the peak error panel a timing error panel d and relative volume error panel g for the three flood events in the thur basin although the magnitude of the error differs per event the relative difference between the configurations is more or less stable over the events except for the timing error fig 4 also shows to what extent the impact of modeling decisions on the error in characteristics of the three flood events is significant using anova panels c f and i fig 4c shows that the peak error for all basins and for all three flood events is significantly affected by the spatial representation of the forcing the calibration period and the performance metric resolution plays a significant role in some basins for some events the impact of the four investigated modeling decisions on the timing error fig 4f is less clear the spatial representation of the forcing affects many basins for the first and second event but for the third event the calibration period impacts more basins significantly the performance metric significantly affects the timing error in at least six basins the relative volume error fig 4i is mainly impacted by the performance metric followed by the spatial representation of the forcing and the calibration period spatial resolution has considerable effects on the relative volume error only in the smaller basins the simulated flood events are mainly affected by the performance metric followed by the calibration period and the spatial representation of the forcing respectively the spatial resolution plays a minor role the flood peak is the characteristic most affected by subjective modeling decisions a summary of the results is given in table 3 4 2 drought characteristics fig 4 shows how the different model configurations affect the error in minimum flow panel b timing error panel e and deficit error panel h in the thur basin and the nine sub basins the results show that the calibration period has a large impact on the error in drought characteristics fig 4c shows that in all basins the calibration period significantly impacts the error in the minimum flow the spatial representation of the forcing is important for the error in the minimum flow in four basins and the spatial resolution only in one basin using the performance metric kge q as opposed to nse logq significantly affects the error in minimum flow in seven out of ten basins for the timing error in the minimum flow we recognize the same pattern as for the timing error in the peak flow fig 4f the impact of the modeling decisions does not show a consistent pattern over the ten basins although the calibration period has a significant impact in all basins the spatial resolution and the performance metric show to be important in at least six basins for the deficit error fig 4i the choice of the calibration period seems to be the most important decision with a significant impact in eight out of ten basins the spatial representation of the forcing and the performance metric significantly affects the deficit error in five basins spatial resolution significantly affects the deficit error in only four basins these results show that the drought characteristics are mainly affected by the calibration period followed by the performance metric the spatial resolution and the spatial representation of the forcing the summary in table 3 reveals that the timing error in the minimum flow experiences most impact from the investigated subjective modeling decisions 4 3 impact on parameter distribution table 4 provides an overview of the percentage of basins for which the distribution of the sampled parameters table 2 was significantly affected by any of the four modeling decisions using anova for the flood events spatial resolution had the lowest impact on the parameter distribution most basins and most parameters were affected by the calibration period followed by the performance metric the most affected parameters are the depth 2 the depth of soil layer 2 and c the velocity parameter of the routing scheme for the drought event calibration period is by far the most important modeling decision that determines the parameter distribution at a distance this is followed by the performance metric especially the infiltration shape parameter b i and the parameter describing the base flow relation d s are affected by the modeling decisions the affected parameters differ for flood and drought events for the flood events mainly the parameters impacting the response time are influenced by the modeling decisions whereas for the low flows the infiltration and base flow parameter are mostly affected by the decisions for the low flows the calibration period is by far the most important decision whereas spatial resolution only plays a very minor role for high flows the calibration period is most important followed closely by the performance metric and the spatial representation of the forcing 5 discussion the main point of this study was to demonstrate that subjective modeling decisions beyond the model choice affect the simulation of a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin in section 5 1 we aim to relate the results to relevant hydrological processes during the investigate flood and drought event section 5 2 discusses several decisions that we authors and modelers made during the design of this study 5 1 relation between results and hydrological processes preferably we would be able to couple the impact of the investigated modeling decisions on our model simulations to the hydrological functioning of our system or to particular hydrological processes this could help to substantiate certain modeling decisions although this study is a case study with only one flood and drought event type investigated for ten nested basins with comparable climate and land use several links can still be identified the clearest example is the limited impact of the spatial representation of the forcing on the error in drought characteristics the studied hydrological drought was partly caused by a lack of precipitation seneviratne et al 2012 when little or no precipitation is falling the spatial resolution of the precipitation data is not relevant since it will remain nearly zero throughout the basin the results seem to follow the line of expectation however seneviratne et al 2012 also demonstrates that high evapotranspiration et rates played an important role in the onset of the 2003 drought at least in terms of soil moisture gurtz et al 1999 emphasize that the spatial resolution of the model is very important when modelling et rates in mountainous regions for the thur gurtz et al 1999 recommend no coarser resolution than 2 2 km and zappa 2002 even recommends a resolution of max 1 1 km in the hilly sub regions of the thur which can explain why the modelling decision on the resolution of the model had more impact on the drought simulations compared to the flood simulations and compared to the spatial representation of the forcing for the drought simulation the calibration period and the performance metric had most influence on the drought simulation which stresses the importance of modelling decisions concerning calibration strategy for other hydrological drought typologies for example a cold snow season drought below average temperature at the end of the snow season causing a delay in snow melt vann loon and van lanen 2012 et rates might be less relevant and therefore spatial resolution of the model might be less important on the other hand a high spatial resolution might still be needed to capture highly heterogeneous snow melt processes the three high flow events that were studied in the thur basin and the nine subbasins were caused by rainfall from a large low pressure system although the precipitation still displayed a high spatial variation see fig 6 therefore it can be understood that the spatial representation of the forcing i e lumped or distributed did have substantial impact on the flood simulations in most basins on the other hand the spatial resolution of the model only had minor influence on the flood simulations with a high spatial resolution the model can better capture spatial variability in soil moisture which can influence surface runoff processes but perhaps spatial variability in soil moisture was limited because the wet conditions extended over the complete basin for other flood typologies such as flash floods that usually have a very local character the spatial resolution might play a more important role as for the drought simulations calibration period and performance metric also had most impact on the flood simulations in this study underlining the important role of a deliberate calibration in rainfall runoff modeling although the results of this study can be explained through process reasoning this section does show that this case study does not yet provide enough insights to draw robust conclusions to substantiate hydrological modelling decisions concerning drought and floods different flood and drought typologies but also a different climate or spatial variation in elevation or land use given the variation in results among the sub basins could lead to different decisions that have most impact on the simulations more research is needed to provide insights into the impact of modeling decisions on hydrological extremes 5 2 subjectivity in our study design the results of this study also depend on model decisions that we as modelers and authors made for the experimental set up we only investigated the effect of four modeling decisions although many more decisions were made while setting up our experiments clear examples of these decisions are the uniform application of the sampled parameters the length of the calibration period the choice for spatially interpolated station data as forcing and the selection of the best 1 of the model runs as behavioral further we also made important decisions on the parameters included in the sensitivity analysis their boundaries and the sampling strategy adopted the uniform application of the sampled parameters can decrease the effect of spatial resolution most likely the spatial resolution will become a more important modeling decision when the sampled parameters are applied in a distributed fashion a randomly distributed sample would however be a heavy computational burden one potential approach is the use of spatial regularization methods where transfer functions are formulated to relate the model parameters to physical characteristics e g samaniego et al 2010 with this method spatially distributed parameters can be sampled by perturbing the coefficient of the transfer function however no pedo transfer functions have been identified for the vic model therefore sampling parameters in a semi distributed fashion was out of reach in our current set up the length of the calibration period was fixed to five months for the rietholzbach basin this was shown to be a sufficient period to obtain stable parameters for a parsimonious model melsen et al 2014 in this study the calibration period is one of the most influencing decisions investigated which implies that in this case study a five month calibration period is not sufficient to obtain stable parameters this effect can be even stronger when shorter calibration periods are explored therefore the analysis as shown in fig 3 has been repeated with five different calibration periods the initial five months each time shortened with one month up to a calibration period of one month only the different calibration periods have been obtained by decreasing the period each time with 15 days at the beginning of the period and 15 days at the end of the period fig 5 shows that the investigated modeling decisions still have significant impact on the error in characteristics of the hydrological extremes for a shorter calibration period most modeling decisions that have shown to significantly impact the error in the characteristics based on a five month calibration period remain significant for shorter calibration periods and vice versa vaze et al 2010 showed that model parameters are more resilient for climate change when they have been calibrated using a period of 20 years or longer and the mean annual rainfall did not change by more than 20 15 decrease or 20 increase this implies that the impact of the choice of calibration period decreases when the length of the calibration period is increased however our experimental set up with a large parameter sample did not allow a very long calibration period for computational reasons the selection of the best 1 of the sample as behavioral is not so much a modeling decision as it is a decision in the research set up to investigate the effect of this choice the analysis as shown in fig 5 was repeated with 10 different sample sizes 1 the initial size and 10 up to 100 of the sample each time increasing with 10 fig 5 shows that choosing a larger sample affects the results but in most cases it increases the significance level of the modeling decisions concerning the error in characteristics of the extremes the figure also shows that as expected the choices of calibration period and performance metric approach p 1 a very high probability that the two samples are drawn from the same distribution i e no significant difference between the two samples when the complete sample 100 is used as behavioral in other words when the complete parameter sample is used it becomes unimportant which period or metric is used for calibration because essentially no calibration is performed a remarkable result is that the spatial resolution and the spatial representation of the forcing remain important for the complete sample they apparently impact the model output in such a manner that the complete parameter sample changes significantly given the caveats discussed above the order of importance of the investigated modeling decisions on hydrological extremes could change if other modeling decisions or experimental configurations would be adopted nevertheless the conclusion that subjective modeling decisions significantly impact the simulation of hydrological extremes remains valid 6 summary and conclusion computational models in earth and environmental sciences have to deal with uncertainty which is partially augmented by subjective modeling decisions e g model choice performance metric selection the impact of model choice on model results is generally acknowledged whereas the uncertainty introduced by modeling decisions during the configuration of the model is often neglected in this study we show with an example for a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin that modeling decisions beyond the model choice affect model results significantly we investigated four modeling decisions spatial resolution of the model spatial representation of the forcing data calibration period and performance metric and examined the impact of these decisions on the error in three flood characteristics and three drought characteristics for a flood and drought event in the swiss thur basin both extreme events were mainly impacted by the two calibration decisions the calibration period and the performance metric for the flood events also the spatial representation of the forcing was important which could be explained by the spatial variability of the precipitation during the studied flood events for the drought event the role of spatial resolution of the model could be related to evapotranspiration processes that played a role during the onset of the studied drought event however extreme events such as floods and drought can be triggered by different processes and a different typology of any of the events could therefore lead to a different impact of the modeling decisions on the model simulations furthermore the impact of the investigated modeling decisions differed from sub basin to sub basin even though the compared basins had much in common in terms of climate and land use therefore more research is needed to provide insights into the impact of subjective modeling decisions on model simulations however in spite of the limitations of this study our results do undeniably show that modeling decisions impact the simulation of hydrological extremes this is undesirable because it implies that the predicted severity of a hydrological extreme would depend on the subjective decisions made by the modeler a better understanding of the uncertainty in hydrological model results can improve the robustness of water management decisions mcmillan et al 2017 many model studies therefore already include some form of uncertainty analysis by comparing several models or several parameter sets modeling decisions however are hardly ever included in these analyses whereas this study has shown that their impact on the results is significant an evaluation of the impact of modeling decisions helps in estimating the value of model results this paper provides an example on how to conduct such an assessment for a specific hydrologic application further it is critical to constrain the spectrum of options or hypotheses for a particular modeling decision based on the information that can be extracted from different data sources e g gupta et al 2008 which provide additional knowledge on the behavior of environmental systems uncertainty associated to a particular modeling decision can be characterized through multiple working hypotheses clark

6871,under the increasing risk of water scarcity aquifer management strategies can take advantage of a deeper knowledge about the natural long term fluctuations driven by climate patterns this study examines the links between major large scale atmospheric circulation modes and inter annual to decadal oscillations in groundwater levels in portugal precipitation and piezometric records 1987 2016 from two aquifer systems leirosa monte real in the north and querença silves in the south are analyzed using wavelet transform methods and singular spectral analysis wavelet coherences computed between hydrologic time series and the north atlantic oscillation nao east atlantic ea and scandinavia scand climate patterns show non stationary relationships that are nonetheless consistent in distinct period bands the strongest covariability occurs in the 6 10 years band for nao in the 2 4 years band for ea especially after 1999 and in the 4 6 years band for scand mainly after 2005 nao is the mode playing the most relevant role with a stronger influence in the south 60 on average than in the north 40 on average the relatively higher frequency 5 year period contributions of ea and scand are difficult to set apart but their joint impact accounts for approximately 20 and 40 of the total variance of groundwater levels in the south and north of the country respectively wavelet coherence patterns also expose transitive couplings between nao ea and scand often coupled phases between climate modes mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns and shifts in the time frequency domain extremes in groundwater storage coincide with anti phase nao and ea combinations maximum piezometric levels occur during nao ea coincidentally also scand phases while minimum levels occur during nao ea phases keywords groundwater levels climate variability ea nao scand portugal 1 introduction evidence that climate change has already begun and will continue to alter the water cycle resulting in summertime drying trends and increased risk of drought is compelling in portugal guerreiro et al 2017a this situation directly affects the availability and dependency on groundwater resources which are the source of 45 65 of the total fresh water demands in the country ribeiro and da cunha 2010 the persistence of much lower than normal precipitation and higher than normal temperature has been causing exceptionally high evapotranspiration soil moisture deficit and depleted surface water reservoirs ipma 2017 snirh 2017 the year 2017 was among the 4 driest since 1931 all 4 occurred after 2000 and drops of more than 40 in water storage were recorded on most reservoirs and dams across the country because of its buffer capacity it is likely that water demand and supply will increasingly depend on groundwater especially during summertime when tourism inflates significantly the number of people in many coastal areas of portugal to sustain groundwater use under increasing demand aquifer management strategies ought to account for natural long term hydrologic fluctuations the identification of their driving climate patterns would help to understand foresee project and finally better manage them trends in european precipitation and temperature are linked with the phases of major large scale atmospheric circulation modes namely the north atlantic oscillation nao the eastern atlantic pattern ea and the scandinavian pattern scand comas bru and mcdermott 2013 moore et al 2013 in the north atlantic these patterns control the trajectory of frontal systems during the extended winter season trigo et al 2008 which in turn are responsible for most of the precipitation in western iberia belo pereira et al 2011 many climatological studies have established the great influence of nao on the european climate hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and van loon 1997 in western iberia in particular nao has been shown to be the main large scale phenomenon controlling winter precipitation river flow and surface water storage garcía herrera et al 2007 jerez et al 2013 trigo et al 2004 still recent studies found that the phases of both ea and scand not only have a straight impact on local conditions but also modulate the location and strength of the nao dipole thus causing non stationarity on its local fingerprint comas bru and mcdermott 2013 moore et al 2013 the links between other climate patterns e g el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation artic oscillation and low frequency inter annual and decadal oscillations in groundwater levels have been abundantly demonstrated in several parts of the world asoka et al 2017 gurdak et al 2007 kuss and gurdak 2014 tremblay et al 2011 venencio and garcía 2011 examples of such studies in europe focused primarily on the influence of nao de vita et al 2012 holman et al 2011 in iberia despite the important role played by groundwater in water supply the influence of climatological cycles on aquifers has only been addressed locally in southern spain andreo et al 2006 luque espinar et al 2008 and thus remains largely unexplored the primary aim of this study is to examine the impact of leading modes of atmospheric circulation also called teleconnection patterns on the variability of aquifer water levels in portugal western iberia although the impact of these patterns in precipitation is well known in this area their fingerprint on groundwater levels can not be straightforwardly inferred because soil type and depth of water table control the damping processes in the vadose zone resulting in frequency dependent preservation of climate signals on groundwater levels fluctuations dickinson et al 2014 2004 velasco et al 2017 the differential influence of geology and climate on the piezometry of the querença silves qs karst aquifer has been examined by neves et al 2016 the authors suggested that the 3 2 4 3 6 5 and 2 6 year oscillations identified in the qs aquifer were due to natural recharge rates associated with the nao climate cycle but did no attempt to demonstrate this relationship this work completes the previous study and presents the first analysis of piezometric levels in portugal aiming to demonstrate and quantify their dependence on nao ea and scand patterns finally we test if there is a connection between extremes in piezometric levels and shifts in climate mode interactions recent studies demonstrate the advantage of examining the joint contributions of nao ea and scand on variables such as precipitation kalimeris et al 2017 temperature hernández et al 2015 streamflow steirou et al 2017 wind speed zubiate et al 2017 renewable energy production correia et al 2017 jerez and trigo 2013 and net biome productivity bastos et al 2016 but not only climate patterns occur in coupled modes as temporal shifts in their synchronization may prompt hydrological extremes for instance it has been shown that precipitation extremes observed in australia are not a result of any single climate mode but instead are due to transient interactions amongst three climate patterns el niño southern oscillation indian ocean dipole and southern annular mode or antarctic oscillation cleverly et al 2016 motivated by these studies the non stationary relationships between climate indices and groundwater levels are investigated using wavelet transform methods and principal component analysis 2 atmospheric circulation and climate indices the nao ea and scand indices used in this study were retrieved from noaa

means of the 500 mb geopotential height anomaly over the northern hemisphere fig 1 displays the detrended time series of the indices treated here spanning the study period 1987 2016 alongside with the spatial patterns of the corresponding leading modes of variability of the 500 mb geopotential height anomaly positive and negative phases of the indices are defined by winter index values above the 3rd and below the 1st terciles respectively the nao shows up as a meridional dipole of the pressure field between iceland and the azores fig 1a the sign and strength of this dipole present considerable inter annual and decadal oscillations hurrell and van loon 1997 in its positive phase nao high pressures dominate over the azores and low pressures over iceland promoting warmer and wetter winters across northern europe while drier conditions prevail southward in the opposite phase nao westerly winds and storm tracks are shifted southward enhancing precipitation over southern europe in western iberia the pearson s correlation between the winter nao and precipitation 1950 2007 is around 0 7 jerez et al 2013 although this value has changed between 0 5 and 0 7 throughout the 20th century trigo et al 2004 the evolution of the nao index over time 1826 2002 shows modulated oscillations with periods around 4 8 7 7 and 2 4 years along with nonlinear trends gámiz fortis 2002 however caution is required in extrapolating these results as the relation between nao and surface climate has been shown to be non stationary vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 the ea pattern presents a dipole configuration similar to nao but displaced to the southeast in its positive phase ea it exhibits a well defined low pressure centre in the north atlantic to the west of the united kingdon barnston and livezey 1987 the scand shows a primary centre of action over the scandinavian peninsula where high pressures during its positive phase scand give rise to a blocking situation over northern europe leading to a southerly shift of the moisture fluxes advected from the atlantic and intensified westerlies over southern europe bueh and nakamura 2007 the impact of ea and scand on european precipitation have high spatial variability and are much less consistent than the influence of nao trigo et al 2008 nonetheless its contribution to the precipitation variability on iberia is significant particularly in portugal where ea and scand are reported to account for 33 and 13 of the total precipitation variance respectively rodriguez puebla et al 1998 albeit with large differences among the rainy months of the year trigo et al 2008 also it has been demonstrated that ea and scand patterns modulate the influence of nao by modifying the geographic positions of the nao dipole which suffers a southwestward migration when ea and nao are on opposite phases and a clockwise rotation when scand and nao are on opposite phases comas bru and mcdermott 2013 by influencing the shape and strength of the nao dipole the interplay between nao and ea affects the trajectory of the frontal systems and the transport of heat and water vapor over europe bastos et al 2016 in the 1987 2016 period there were several anomalous precipitation events in mainland portugal here referred to as extreme events extreme events in iberia particularly droughts are defined in the literature using a large number of different indices based on a wide range of meteorological or hydrological longer time scales conditions guerreiro et al 2017b lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 martins et al 2012 by cross referencing published results with deviations from winter precipitation in portugal relative to the 1971 2000 normal ipma 2017 we consider there were four major droughts in the studied period namely in 1992 1994 1998 2000 2004 2006 and 2011 2012 some of these droughts lasted for more than one hydrological year most of these drought events were associated with combined positive nao and negative ea phases fig 1b strengthening of nao toward its positive phase contributed to extreme conditions in 2004 2005 although a negative ea during february and an abnormal blocking situation from mid february to mid march 2005 also played a role in this record breaking drought garcía herrera et al 2007 likewise the major drought of 2011 2012 was characterized by months dominated by nao and ea trigo et al 2013 on the other hand anomalously wet winters recorded in 2001 2003 and 2010 occurred in association with negative nao coupled to positive ea and scand phases fig 1b 3 study sites and datasets 3 1 study sites the mediterranean climate prevails in portugal in the classification of köppen geiger the climate to the north of the country nw of iberia is of type csb temperate with dry and mild summers the monthly average temperature ranges between 10 and 20 c and the total annual rainfall is about 1000 mm year the climate in the south sw of iberia is of type csa temperate with dry and hot summers the monthly average temperature ranges between 12 and 24 c and the total annual rainfall is about 500 mm year ipma 2017 on average about 42 of the annual precipitation in portugal falls during the 3 month winter season december to february miranda et al 2002 thus the precipitation during the winter months determines the availability of surface water resources in subsequent months the aquifers studied here the leirosa monte real lm and the querença silves qs were selected firstly for their location one aquifer in each climate zone fig 2 and secondly by the availability and completeness of their groundwater level records the qs aquifer is the largest 324 km2 and most studied groundwater reservoir in south portugal hugman et al 2012 monteiro 2006 stigter et al 2014 it is

from the variscan orogeny divides the aquifer in two compartments with distinct hydrogeological behavior neves et al 2016 the region to the east of the fault is characterized by relatively high 15 hydraulic gradients largely controlled by topography in contrast the region to the west of the fault is a flat lowland area characterized by smooth piezometric isolines predominant e w flow as well as comparatively higher and homogeneous values of transmissivity and water storage capacity groundwater discharge occurs mainly through a small number of springs located in the western limit of the

climate change scenarios on this aquifer shows that wells within 6 km of the coast may be at risk of water quality degradation due to seawater intrusion hugman et al 2017 the leirosa monte real is one of the few aquifer systems in the nw zone that has not suffered from piezometric declining trends due to over exploitation in the last decades ribeiro and da cunha 2010 it extends along a coastal strip up to 8 km wide that gently slopes down to the east and occupies an area of 218 km2 the aquifer is classified as a porous multilayer system mainly formed by plio pleistocene sands that cover sub horizontal deposits of pre miocene sandy clays and mesozoic calcareous loams snirh 2017 the sediments fill depressions between diapiric structures and form sequences varying between 25 and 250 m thick the groundwater flow is directed towards the atlantic ocean and sometimes in the morphologically depressed areas the water table rises up creating ephemeral lagoons the aquifer recharge is estimated to be around 30 of precipitation almeida et al 2000 3 2 datasets the groundwater level records were required to have a monthly temporal resolution be continuous for at least 30 years and be unaffected by pumping two piezometers in each aquifer with records fulfilling these requirements were selected to represent the range of observed hydrogeological conditions carriço and benafim are located at relatively high land elevation while lavos and silves are located near the discharge areas fig 2 the monthly groundwater level time series span from january 1987 to december 2016 and were obtained from the portuguese national system for water resources information snirh site snirh 2017 precipitation data were obtained from two weather stations operated by the portuguese meteorological and ocean office ipma 2017 faro and alcobaça fig 2 these weather stations are 50 km away from the aquifers but are the closest available with continuous records in the 1987 2016 period concerns on the spatial representativeness of the weather station data lead us to consider other precipitation datasets sun et al 2018 such as era interim era i a global atmospheric reanalysis relying on both observations and model based forecasts 80 km spatial resolution available from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf 2017 era i has been shown to perform quite well in western iberia when compared to data based on meteorological stations and rain gauges belo pereira et al 2011 and the two datasets are indeed well correlated at our study sites pearsońs coefficients 0 8 at both faro and alcobaça however the datasets also show some discrepancies such as a systematic bias at faro which require further investigation a future study currently in preparation will analyze these discrepancies but the preliminary results obtained so far made us confident in the suitability of the weather station data for the purpose of this work 4 methods several analytical techniques were employed to characterize the temporal structure and the periodic components of the time series continuous wavelet transform wavelet principal component and singular spectral analysis as well as the temporal correlations between them wavelet coherence each technique has its own purpose and advantages and their combination provides a robust picture of the links between groundwater levels precipitation and the climate indices quite often wavelet and singular spectral analysis are both applied to the same climatic series e g moreno et al 2018 with the latter designed to evaluate short noisy and chaotic signals while the former is better suited to deal with aperiodic and quasi periodic data typical pre processing steps such as searching for outliers interpolation for estimating missing values detrending and normalization by standard deviations were carried out before the analysis 4 1 temporal correlations the links between groundwater level and monthly precipitation are examined using linear regression with a two tailed significant t test at the 95 percent confidence level first monthly precipitation times series are transformed into cumulative departures detrended and normalized using the methods described by hanson et al 2004 lag correlation analysis which gives the correlation coefficient as a function of the lag between two time series is also used to identify the lag of maximum correlation between the causal process precipitation and the aquifer system response groundwater level 4 2 continuous wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform cwt is appropriate to analyze non stationary signals that have temporal variations in both amplitude and frequency its main advantage over classical spectral methods is that it is able to reveal the time evolution of the dominant modes of variability being as such specially tailored for the detection of localized or intermittent events the cwt is defined as the convolution of the signal with a scaled and translated version of the wavelet function daubechies 1990 the method is implemented in matlab using the morlet wavelet described in torrence and compo 1998 the morlet wavelet presents several advantages over other wavelets such as the equivalence between scale and the equivalent fourier period sang 2013 we use 29 scales monthly sampling rate and 4 sub octaves per scale which allows us to analyze periods ranging from 2 months to 21 years the wavelet spectrum depicts the temporal distribution of the power variance of the time series as a function of period scale over the 30 years of analysis the spectrum is normalized by 1 σ2 where σ2 is the variance of the time series the 5 significant levels are computed using a chi square test against a red noise spectrum as the null hypothesis the cone of influence delimits the regions where the edge effects due to zero padding make the results less reliable 4 3 wavelet coherence the wavelet coherence wtc is used to identify time localized common oscillatory behavior in two time series its definition is similar to a localized correlation coefficient between two cwt in time frequency space torrence and webster 1998 the wtc in this study is computed at the 95 confidence level using the algorithm described in grinsted et al 2004 the phase relationship is shown by the orientation of the arrows in regions of high coherence for example horizontal arrows from left to right indicate in phase relationships areas above the 5 significant level indicate locked phase behavior but not necessarily common high power regions in time frequency space with large common power and consistent phase relationship are likely to possess a causality between the time series 4 4 wavelet pca wavelet principal component analysis wpca is suited to detect patterns that are concealed or not visible in raw data katul and parlange 1995 the method is implemented in matlab wavelet toolbox using two processing steps to extract localized signal features the first step is a discrete wavelet transform resulting in the determination of approximation and detail coefficients a5 and d5 d1 we employed a time series decomposition into five levels i e 25 scales using a 2nd order symlet sym2 wavelet and checked that other choices of the number of levels or wavelets e g 2nd order daubechies did not alter the main conclusions the second step involves a principal component analysis applied to the matrix of approximation and details which allows finding the projections of the filtered signal maximizing the variance i e their principal components or pcs partial reconstructions of a selected number of retained principal components provide simplified versions of the original signal in this study we present the first three principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 along with the percentage of the total variance explained by each of them subsequently to wpca we have computed temporal correlations between the pcs of groundwater levels and the climate indices nao ea and scand using spearman s rank coefficients 4 5 ssa of groundwater level the singular spectral analysis ssa is a form of principal component analysis used to extract the dominant frequencies in short and noisy time series the advantage over harmonic analysis through a fourier transform is that the fitted functions are not defined a priori but are based on structures determined through eigenanalysis following the methods outlined by dettinger et al 1995 and hanson et al 2004 the calculations are carried out by diagonalizing a lagged covariance matrix vautard et al 1992 we compute the ssa using the hydrologic and climate analysis toolkit dickinson et al 2004 with window lengths of 60 and 30 months to capture periods longer and shorter than 5 years respectively in any case the window length is less than 1 5 of the time series length as recommended by ghil et al 2002 the relative contributions of the most significant periodic components to the total variance of groundwater levels determined through ssa are in the end compared to the wpca results 5 results 5 1 precipitation versus groundwater level the relation between precipitation and groundwater level is illustrated at each site using a single piezometer the results for other piezometers are similar but not shown since it is not the purpose of this study to give an exhaustive representation of the heterogeneity in each aquifer fig 3 a shows that there is an almost instantaneous response between precipitation and hydraulic head variations the time lag of maximum correlation is zero consistent with the permeable nature of the sediment cover and the shallow depth of the water table at both lavos and silves table 1 the correlation between precipitation and groundwater level is also similar at both sites pearsońs coefficient 0 6 fig 3b the wavelet power spectra of precipitation and groundwater levels are compared at each aquifer and across aquifers in fig 4 although there are some notable differences in mid frequency timing across aquifers the cwt plots are otherwise similar an important common aspect that emerges from these spectra is the power concentration in two distinct bands the first concentrated in the 4 8 years band most intense before 2005 and the second occurring in the 2 4 years band from 2000 onwards the variability modes having enough persistence and amplitude to be statistically significant within white contours peak at different frequencies in the two study sites in the north fig 4a the power is concentrated in the 2 4 years band while in the south fig 4b the variance peaks in the 4 8 years band at smaller scales one can observe several scattered peaks at periods of 1 year the strongest patches occur in 1990 1996 2000 and 2010 which were anomalously wet years it is also noteworthy the strong attenuation of power or lack in variance in the 1 2 year band centered on 2004 but extending for almost a decade this anomaly can be attributed to the outstanding drought that affected the iberian peninsula in 2004 2005 5 2 links between climate indices precipitation and groundwater level fig 5 lm aquifer and fig 6 qs aquifer show the wavelet coherence between climate indices and precipitation or groundwater levels in order to relate climatic extreme events and climate pattern indices vertical lines marking the main droughts in portugal have been drawn over the wtc plots the 2011 2012 event was excluded for being too close to the cone of influence the lines divide the plots into four time windows with distinctive coherence patterns suggesting that extreme events indeed mark as a consequence of abrupt re organizations of climate variability modes at each aquifer results for two piezometer locations intend to demonstrate the effect of spatially varying hydrogeological conditions despite local differences there is a great deal of similarity in coherence patterns across hydrological responses to a given climate index along columns at both study sites fig 5 and fig 6 scand is the index having the most widespread influence presenting statistically significant patches of coherence at several multiannual periodicities especially between 1999 and 2005 each climate index shows consistent phase relationships at characteristic periods although sometimes restricted to a given time window nao at periods of 6 10 years especially in the south fig 6 ea at periods of 2 4 years especially after 1999 fig 5 and scand at periods of 4 6 years especially after 2005 fig 5 and fig 6 regarding the phase angle there is a dominant horizontal anti phase 180 relationship between nao and the hydrologic time series at all sites it is well known that during nao negative phases low pressure systems in the north atlantic are shifted southwards leading to increased precipitation and increased river discharges in iberia lorenzo lacruz et al 2011 trigo et al 2008 2004 thus the out of phase relationship is in agreement with the fact that recharge precipitation is negatively correlated with nao in contrast ea and scand show preferential diagonal or downward pointing arrows that indicate some degree of lead or lag between the indices and the hydrological time series there are also episodes of high coherence that cannot be attributed to a single index such synchronized relationships reveal the impact of the coupling amongst indices for example synchronized coherence patches at periods of around 2 years centered in 2000 fig 5 and fig 6 correspond to coupled nao ea scand phases in 2001 and 2003 fig 1 the impact of coupled phases is better illustrated in fig 7 which displays the hydrological time series averaged over years of positive and negative phases e g hydraulic head variations for nao correspond to monthly values averaged over nao years more consistent relationships can be inferred from piezometric levels than from precipitation which is highly seasonal in iberia owing to the buffer capacity of aquifers higher piezometric levels are associated with negative phases of the winter nao as expected however fig 7 also shows that maximum piezometric levels occur in years of nao ea mostly coincidentally also scand combinations while minimum levels occur during nao ea combinations in fact opposing nao and ea phases seem to provide an envelope to all other possible phases and their combinations not shown due to the limited number of years only three in which these conditions occur fig 1 caution is required in generalizing this result nonetheless these results are qualitatively similar to recent analysis of real wind power generation in portugal that presents its highest lowest values for the nao ea nao ea combination and in between results with nao and nao composites fig 4 in correia et al 2017 5 3 quantified impacts of ea nao and scand on groundwater level fig 8 shows the first three principal components of the time series obtained via wpca we focus on groundwater level although the precipitation decomposition is also shown for completeness the first principal component pc1 accounts for nearly 50 of the total variance in groundwater levels at all sites this component displays variable cycles of relatively long period 5 years repeatedly limited by major droughts the second and third principal components pc2 and pc3 have shorter periods 5 years and together account for 30 to 40 of the total variance these components are hard to distinguish for instance pc2 at benafim looks like pc3 at silves and some of their peaks coincide with anomalous wet year this swap in the ranking of some pcs is a typical caveat of pca analysis when two consecutive components present relatively similar values of explained variance trigo and palutikof 2001 as is the case here of pc2 and pc3 for benafim temporal correlations between complete time series of climate indices and principal components do not produce statistically significant values however correlations are statistically significant for a limited set of seasonal averages table 2 both the summer jjas and winter djfm aggregates of pc1 correlate with the winter nao showing no association to other indices pc2 and pc3 correlate with ea and scand with a delay lag of 6 months i e summer aggregates correlate with winter indices pc3 also partially correlates with nao especially in the south silves and benafim we establish an association between principal components and frequencies extracted from ssa based on the period threshold separating pc1 5 years from pc2 and pc3 5 years the ssa helps to constrain the magnitude of the relative contributions of each climate mode to the overall variability table 3 altogether the climate indices account for 80 on average of the total variance of groundwater levels at both the lm and qs aquifers nao is the index playing the most relevant role in groundwater variability with a stronger influence in the south 60 on average than in the north 40 on average the contributions of ea and scand are difficult to set apart but their joint impact on variance is approximately 20 in the south and 40 in the north discrepancies between ssa and wpca results are due to the presence of a nao component in pc3 this is consistent with the previously recognized existence of nao ea and scand mode coupling 6 discussion this study reinforces the role of nao as the primary driver of hydrological variability in portugal alongside with ea and scand the climate driven periodicities detected in groundwater levels compare well with results from previous studies in the iberian peninsula for example gámiz fortis et al 2008 calculated the main oscillatory components in streamflow series from the main rivers in portugal over the 1920 2004 period the results revealed a set of oscillations with associated periods in the 2 3 4 5 and 6 8 years bands peaking at 6 5 year guadiana river in the south of portugal they concluded that the overall relationship between nao and river streamflow was complex and nonstationary spectral methods applied to a set of 53 piezometer time series from the vega de granada alluvial aquifer in southern spain along with rainfall temperature and river flow data also identified cycles of 8 11 years and 3 2 years luque espinar et al 2008 also in agreement with previous studies our results expose a stronger influence of nao in the south of portugal such dependence on geographic location was previously recognized in studies analyzing the impact of climate modes on iberian lakes hernández et al 2015 streamflow lorenzo lacruz et al 2011 and wind speed correia et al 2017 among others however few studies so far quantified the impact of ea or scand on iberian hydrologic time series despite the increasing awareness of their importance comas bru and mcdermott 2013 steirou et al 2017 bastos et al 2016 quantitative relationships between climate indices and precipitation obtained from individual weather stations demand cautious interpretation since precipitation time series in iberia may display notable differences even among neighboring locations nonetheless according to wavelet pca results nao ea and scand pc1 pc2 pc3 are responsible for 85 and 95 of the total variance of precipitation in the lm and qs aquifers respectively fig 8 among them nao contributes to 64 and 74 of the variance in the north and south respectively in agreement with expected patterns for this teleconnection the groundwater response to rainfall depends on evapotranspiration land cover and geologic factors such as topography and soil permeability which affect infiltration and recharge these factors attenuate climate signals and may explain the relatively weaker impacts of climate indices on piezometric levels than on precipitation in the qs aquifer for instance geological filtering related to spatially heterogeneous geomorphologic and hydrogeologic properties water storage capacity and transmissivity accounts for 15 of differential variability in piezometric levels among eastern and western sectors neves et al 2016 rodriguez puebla et al 1998 quantified the association between climate indices and precipitation at the iberian scale based on an empirical orthogonal function analysis of precipitation from 51 meteorological stations from 1949 to 1995 in spite of showing significant spatial variability their results indicate that on average ea accounts for 33 of the total variance of precipitation while nao and scand explain 19 and 13 of the total precipitation variance respectively differences between these estimates and findings of the present study may be attributed to the local scale of our analysis to the different methods employed and to the different time spans analyzed perhaps the most interesting aspect of the present study and novelty in what concerns to groundwater levels is the recognition that transitive couplings among the indices nao ea and scand greatly affect hydrological responses coupled phases between climate modes may prompt extreme or anomalous precipitation events cleverly et al 2016 kalimeris et al 2017 and indeed our results provide evidence of an association between coupled nao and ea phases and extremes in groundwater levels moreover wavelet transform methods wtc and wpca applied to groundwater levels clearly show that extreme events droughts in portugal mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns among nao ea and scand in future integrated forecast system of groundwater availability can benefit from the identification of such abrupt transitions which define time windows where it is possible to assume quasi stationary behavior of climate patterns understanding the response of hydrologic systems to atmospheric circulation modes is extremely important in the context of climate change groundwater plays a critical role for its value as a buffer system during droughts events and because it is very often the main source of potable water for irrigation certainly in portugal the results of the present study may motivate future investigations focusing on the impacts of coupled climate patterns on aquifer levels and on the association of coupled phases with hydrologic extremes for example national scale assessments of the effects of teleconnections on aquifers across the usa and canada showed that groundwater levels are controlled by interannual and multidecadal variability associated with the el niño southern oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation atlantic multidecadal oscillation and artic oscillation kuss and gurdak 2014 tremblay et al 2011 however from the point of view of the subsurface components of the water cycle the interactions amongst climate patterns remain underestimated in north america in the southern hemisphere strong precipitation anomalies observed in australia occur when teleconnections in the pacific and indian oceans are synchronized cleverly et al 2016 but the impact of such synchronization on aquifers still needs evaluation further investigation is also vital in india and east africa where groundwater storage depends heavily on extreme rainfall related to monsoon precipitation forced by the indian ocean dipole and the el niño southern oscillation asoka et al 2017 taylor et al 2013 likewise studies addressing the influence of long term climate variability on groundwater recharge in europe are scarce and focus only on individual teleconnections holman et al 2011 de vita et al 2012 groundwater simulations incorporating a priori knowledge about local hydroclimatic responses will globally help to improve resources planning and better prepare for climate changing scenarios the sensitivity of aquifers to the propagation of climate signals depends not only on hydrogeological properties but also on the local dynamics of the climate patterns themselves even at relatively small scales as exposed by the north south asymmetry found in portugal site dependent studies are thus required in order to assess the vulnerability of groundwater supplies to long term climate induced variations particularly through its influence on precipitation and pumping as far as projections for the identified leading patterns of variability nao ea and scand becomes available and reliable medium to long term forecasts and inferences about groundwater levels states in portugal could be attempted on an operational mode although no significant trends were detected in the analyzed period neither for the climate indicators nor in the piezometric levels series which hampers an in depth long term trend analysis under future warmer climate conditions recent researches have identified slight positive shifts in the probability distribution of the nao phase barnes and polvani 2015 deser et al 2017 woollings and blackburn 2012 acknowledging that there is still a large uncertainty in these long horizon predictions and that the magnitude of the projected trends is well masked by the natural predominantly stochastic inter annual oscillations of the nao index deser et al 2017 this would imply the risk of lower than current groundwater levels on average that scenario would demand corresponding efforts for the design and implementation of adaptation measures in the medium range these measures could take advantage of the progresses achieved for forecasting the nao and other teleconnection patterns months even one year ahead brands et al 2012 dunstone et al 2016 scaife et al 2014 along with the results reported here 7 conclusions this study examines the teleconnections between nao ea scand and precipitation and groundwater level fluctuations in the particular aquifers considered here leirosa monte real and querença silves precipitation and groundwater levels showed very similar responses to climate modes however monthly fluctuations in groundwater levels were smoother and showed more consistent links to climate indices than precipitation which makes them useful to assist in developing process based models e g hindcast of observed changes in the long term the capacity of wavelet transform methods to analyze processes at various scales exposes not only the impacts of climate modes nao ea and scand on groundwater levels but also the existence of complex transitive couplings among modes extreme events coinciding with coupled phases e g droughts and nao ea mark sharp boundaries in mode interaction patterns or sudden shifts in the time frequency space groundwater levels over the analyzed time interval 1987 2016 display consistent relationships with climate indices in distinct period bands and time windows the strongest covariability occurs in the 6 10 years band for nao in the 2 4 years band for ea especially after 1999 and in the 4 6 years band for scand especially after 2005 episodes displaying simultaneously multiple coherent relationships are associated with coupled phases among nao ea and scand the contribution of each set of oscillations to the total variance of the groundwater levels was evaluated using singular spectral analysis and wavelet principal component analysis as complementary approaches the results indicate that nao ea and scand patterns together are responsible for most 80 of the inter annual variability of groundwater levels in portugal nao is the first leading pattern of variability accounting for 40 and 60 of the total variance of groundwater levels in the north and south of the country respectively the joint contributions of ea and scand account for the remaining 40 of variability in the north and 20 of variability in the south on average their individual contributions are difficult to distinguish but ea associated with peak periods of 2 5 and 3 3 years is relatively more influential in the north while scand associated with peak periods of 4 2 years is relatively more influential in the south monthly groundwater levels averaged over years of positive and negative phases of climate indices provide additional insights the impact of nao alone is clear since lower higher groundwater levels occur during years of positive negative nao phases moreover extreme piezometric levels take place in years of anti phase ea and nao combinations combined winter nao ea phases are associated with maximum groundwater levels while combined nao ea phases are associated with minimum levels climate change projections of more frequent and severe droughts over the next decades will have challenging effects on groundwater demands further understanding on how climate modes influence groundwater storage with particular emphasis on the implications of phase couplings and on their relationship to extreme events will help to improve future projections of groundwater availability and guide integrated water resource management practices not only in portugal but around the world declarations of interest none

6871,under the increasing risk of water scarcity aquifer management strategies can take advantage of a deeper knowledge about the natural long term fluctuations driven by climate patterns this study examines the links between major large scale atmospheric circulation modes and inter annual to decadal oscillations in groundwater levels in portugal precipitation and piezometric records 1987 2016 from two aquifer systems leirosa monte real in the north and querença silves in the south are analyzed using wavelet transform methods and singular spectral analysis wavelet coherences computed between hydrologic time series and the north atlantic oscillation nao east atlantic ea and scandinavia scand climate patterns show non stationary relationships that are nonetheless consistent in distinct period bands the strongest covariability occurs in the 6 10 years band for nao in the 2 4 years band for ea especially after 1999 and in the 4 6 years band for scand mainly after 2005 nao is the mode playing the most relevant role with a stronger influence in the south 60 on average than in the north 40 on average the relatively higher frequency 5 year period contributions of ea and scand are difficult to set apart but their joint impact accounts for approximately 20 and 40 of the total variance of groundwater levels in the south and north of the country respectively wavelet coherence patterns also expose transitive couplings between nao ea and scand often coupled phases between climate modes mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns and shifts in the time frequency domain extremes in groundwater storage coincide with anti phase nao and ea combinations maximum piezometric levels occur during nao ea coincidentally also scand phases while minimum levels occur during nao ea phases keywords groundwater levels climate variability ea nao scand portugal 1 introduction evidence that climate change has already begun and will continue to alter the water cycle resulting in summertime drying trends and increased risk of drought is compelling in portugal guerreiro et al 2017a this situation directly affects the availability and dependency on groundwater resources which are the source of 45 65 of the total fresh water demands in the country ribeiro and da cunha 2010 the persistence of much lower than normal precipitation and higher than normal temperature has been causing exceptionally high evapotranspiration soil moisture deficit and depleted surface water reservoirs ipma 2017 snirh 2017 the year 2017 was among the 4 driest since 1931 all 4 occurred after 2000 and drops of more than 40 in water storage were recorded on most reservoirs and dams across the country because of its buffer capacity it is likely that water demand and supply will increasingly depend on groundwater especially during summertime when tourism inflates significantly the number of people in many coastal areas of portugal to sustain groundwater use under increasing demand aquifer management strategies ought to account for natural long term hydrologic fluctuations the identification of their driving climate patterns would help to understand foresee project and finally better manage them trends in european precipitation and temperature are linked with the phases of major large scale atmospheric circulation modes namely the north atlantic oscillation nao the eastern atlantic pattern ea and the scandinavian pattern scand comas bru and mcdermott 2013 moore et al 2013 in the north atlantic these patterns control the trajectory of frontal systems during the extended winter season trigo et al 2008 which in turn are responsible for most of the precipitation in western iberia belo pereira et al 2011 many climatological studies have established the great influence of nao on the european climate hurrell et al 2003 hurrell and van loon 1997 in western iberia in particular nao has been shown to be the main large scale phenomenon controlling winter precipitation river flow and surface water storage garcía herrera et al 2007 jerez et al 2013 trigo et al 2004 still recent studies found that the phases of both ea and scand not only have a straight impact on local conditions but also modulate the location and strength of the nao dipole thus causing non stationarity on its local fingerprint comas bru and mcdermott 2013 moore et al 2013 the links between other climate patterns e g el niño southern oscillation pacific decadal oscillation artic oscillation and low frequency inter annual and decadal oscillations in groundwater levels have been abundantly demonstrated in several parts of the world asoka et al 2017 gurdak et al 2007 kuss and gurdak 2014 tremblay et al 2011 venencio and garcía 2011 examples of such studies in europe focused primarily on the influence of nao de vita et al 2012 holman et al 2011 in iberia despite the important role played by groundwater in water supply the influence of climatological cycles on aquifers has only been addressed locally in southern spain andreo et al 2006 luque espinar et al 2008 and thus remains largely unexplored the primary aim of this study is to examine the impact of leading modes of atmospheric circulation also called teleconnection patterns on the variability of aquifer water levels in portugal western iberia although the impact of these patterns in precipitation is well known in this area their fingerprint on groundwater levels can not be straightforwardly inferred because soil type and depth of water table control the damping processes in the vadose zone resulting in frequency dependent preservation of climate signals on groundwater levels fluctuations dickinson et al 2014 2004 velasco et al 2017 the differential influence of geology and climate on the piezometry of the querença silves qs karst aquifer has been examined by neves et al 2016 the authors suggested that the 3 2 4 3 6 5 and 2 6 year oscillations identified in the qs aquifer were due to natural recharge rates associated with the nao climate cycle but did no attempt to demonstrate this relationship this work completes the previous study and presents the first analysis of piezometric levels in portugal aiming to demonstrate and quantify their dependence on nao ea and scand patterns finally we test if there is a connection between extremes in piezometric levels and shifts in climate mode interactions recent studies demonstrate the advantage of examining the joint contributions of nao ea and scand on variables such as precipitation kalimeris et al 2017 temperature hernández et al 2015 streamflow steirou et al 2017 wind speed zubiate et al 2017 renewable energy production correia et al 2017 jerez and trigo 2013 and net biome productivity bastos et al 2016 but not only climate patterns occur in coupled modes as temporal shifts in their synchronization may prompt hydrological extremes for instance it has been shown that precipitation extremes observed in australia are not a result of any single climate mode but instead are due to transient interactions amongst three climate patterns el niño southern oscillation indian ocean dipole and southern annular mode or antarctic oscillation cleverly et al 2016 motivated by these studies the non stationary relationships between climate indices and groundwater levels are investigated using wavelet transform methods and principal component analysis 2 atmospheric circulation and climate indices the nao ea and scand indices used in this study were retrieved from noaa s climate prediction center noaa 2017 at the monthly temporal resolution and aggregated for the winter months djfm noaa calculates these indices by rotated pca principal component analysis of monthly means of the 500 mb geopotential height anomaly over the northern hemisphere fig 1 displays the detrended time series of the indices treated here spanning the study period 1987 2016 alongside with the spatial patterns of the corresponding leading modes of variability of the 500 mb geopotential height anomaly positive and negative phases of the indices are defined by winter index values above the 3rd and below the 1st terciles respectively the nao shows up as a meridional dipole of the pressure field between iceland and the azores fig 1a the sign and strength of this dipole present considerable inter annual and decadal oscillations hurrell and van loon 1997 in its positive phase nao high pressures dominate over the azores and low pressures over iceland promoting warmer and wetter winters across northern europe while drier conditions prevail southward in the opposite phase nao westerly winds and storm tracks are shifted southward enhancing precipitation over southern europe in western iberia the pearson s correlation between the winter nao and precipitation 1950 2007 is around 0 7 jerez et al 2013 although this value has changed between 0 5 and 0 7 throughout the 20th century trigo et al 2004 the evolution of the nao index over time 1826 2002 shows modulated oscillations with periods around 4 8 7 7 and 2 4 years along with nonlinear trends gámiz fortis 2002 however caution is required in extrapolating these results as the relation between nao and surface climate has been shown to be non stationary vicente serrano and lópez moreno 2008 the ea pattern presents a dipole configuration similar to nao but displaced to the southeast in its positive phase ea it exhibits a well defined low pressure centre in the north atlantic to the west of the united kingdon barnston and livezey 1987 the scand shows a primary centre of action over the scandinavian peninsula where high pressures during its positive phase scand give rise to a blocking situation over northern europe leading to a southerly shift of the moisture fluxes advected from the atlantic and intensified westerlies over southern europe bueh and nakamura 2007 the impact of ea and scand on european precipitation have high spatial variability and are much less consistent than the influence of nao trigo et al 2008 nonetheless its contribution to the precipitation variability on iberia is significant particularly in portugal where ea and scand are reported to account for 33 and 13 of the total precipitation variance respectively rodriguez puebla et al 1998 albeit with large differences among the rainy months of the year trigo et al 2008 also it has been demonstrated that ea and scand patterns modulate the influence of nao by modifying the geographic positions of the nao dipole which suffers a southwestward migration when ea and nao are on opposite phases and a clockwise rotation when scand and nao are on opposite phases comas bru and mcdermott 2013 by influencing the shape and strength of the nao dipole the interplay between nao and ea affects the trajectory of the frontal systems and the transport of heat and water vapor over europe bastos et al 2016 in the 1987 2016 period there were several anomalous precipitation events in mainland portugal here referred to as extreme events extreme events in iberia particularly droughts are defined in the literature using a large number of different indices based on a wide range of meteorological or hydrological longer time scales conditions guerreiro et al 2017b lorenzo lacruz et al 2013 martins et al 2012 by cross referencing published results with deviations from winter precipitation in portugal relative to the 1971 2000 normal ipma 2017 we consider there were four major droughts in the studied period namely in 1992 1994 1998 2000 2004 2006 and 2011 2012 some of these droughts lasted for more than one hydrological year most of these drought events were associated with combined positive nao and negative ea phases fig 1b strengthening of nao toward its positive phase contributed to extreme conditions in 2004 2005 although a negative ea during february and an abnormal blocking situation from mid february to mid march 2005 also played a role in this record breaking drought garcía herrera et al 2007 likewise the major drought of 2011 2012 was characterized by months dominated by nao and ea trigo et al 2013 on the other hand anomalously wet winters recorded in 2001 2003 and 2010 occurred in association with negative nao coupled to positive ea and scand phases fig 1b 3 study sites and datasets 3 1 study sites the mediterranean climate prevails in portugal in the classification of köppen geiger the climate to the north of the country nw of iberia is of type csb temperate with dry and mild summers the monthly average temperature ranges between 10 and 20 c and the total annual rainfall is about 1000 mm year the climate in the south sw of iberia is of type csa temperate with dry and hot summers the monthly average temperature ranges between 12 and 24 c and the total annual rainfall is about 500 mm year ipma 2017 on average about 42 of the annual precipitation in portugal falls during the 3 month winter season december to february miranda et al 2002 thus the precipitation during the winter months determines the availability of surface water resources in subsequent months the aquifers studied here the leirosa monte real lm and the querença silves qs were selected firstly for their location one aquifer in each climate zone fig 2 and secondly by the availability and completeness of their groundwater level records the qs aquifer is the largest 324 km2 and most studied groundwater reservoir in south portugal hugman et al 2012 monteiro 2006 stigter et al 2014 it is a karst aquifer mainly formed by jurassic carbonate rocks behaving as both a confined and unconfined aquifer system in different areas the s marcos quarteira fault a major regional structure inherited from the variscan orogeny divides the aquifer in two compartments with distinct hydrogeological behavior neves et al 2016 the region to the east of the fault is characterized by relatively high 15 hydraulic gradients largely controlled by topography in contrast the region to the west of the fault is a flat lowland area characterized by smooth piezometric isolines predominant e w flow as well as comparatively higher and homogeneous values of transmissivity and water storage capacity groundwater discharge occurs mainly through a small number of springs located in the western limit of the aquifer studies focusing on the spatial distribution of recharge estimated that the average annual recharge is 45 of the rainfall hugman et al 2012 recently a numerical modeling study on the impact of climate change scenarios on this aquifer shows that wells within 6 km of the coast may be at risk of water quality degradation due to seawater intrusion hugman et al 2017 the leirosa monte real is one of the few aquifer systems in the nw zone that has not suffered from piezometric declining trends due to over exploitation in the last decades ribeiro and da cunha 2010 it extends along a coastal strip up to 8 km wide that gently slopes down to the east and occupies an area of 218 km2 the aquifer is classified as a porous multilayer system mainly formed by plio pleistocene sands that cover sub horizontal deposits of pre miocene sandy clays and mesozoic calcareous loams snirh 2017 the sediments fill depressions between diapiric structures and form sequences varying between 25 and 250 m thick the groundwater flow is directed towards the atlantic ocean and sometimes in the morphologically depressed areas the water table rises up creating ephemeral lagoons the aquifer recharge is estimated to be around 30 of precipitation almeida et al 2000 3 2 datasets the groundwater level records were required to have a monthly temporal resolution be continuous for at least 30 years and be unaffected by pumping two piezometers in each aquifer with records fulfilling these requirements were selected to represent the range of observed hydrogeological conditions carriço and benafim are located at relatively high land elevation while lavos and silves are located near the discharge areas fig 2 the monthly groundwater level time series span from january 1987 to december 2016 and were obtained from the portuguese national system for water resources information snirh site snirh 2017 precipitation data were obtained from two weather stations operated by the portuguese meteorological and ocean office ipma 2017 faro and alcobaça fig 2 these weather stations are 50 km away from the aquifers but are the closest available with continuous records in the 1987 2016 period concerns on the spatial representativeness of the weather station data lead us to consider other precipitation datasets sun et al 2018 such as era interim era i a global atmospheric reanalysis relying on both observations and model based forecasts 80 km spatial resolution available from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf 2017 era i has been shown to perform quite well in western iberia when compared to data based on meteorological stations and rain gauges belo pereira et al 2011 and the two datasets are indeed well correlated at our study sites pearsońs coefficients 0 8 at both faro and alcobaça however the datasets also show some discrepancies such as a systematic bias at faro which require further investigation a future study currently in preparation will analyze these discrepancies but the preliminary results obtained so far made us confident in the suitability of the weather station data for the purpose of this work 4 methods several analytical techniques were employed to characterize the temporal structure and the periodic components of the time series continuous wavelet transform wavelet principal component and singular spectral analysis as well as the temporal correlations between them wavelet coherence each technique has its own purpose and advantages and their combination provides a robust picture of the links between groundwater levels precipitation and the climate indices quite often wavelet and singular spectral analysis are both applied to the same climatic series e g moreno et al 2018 with the latter designed to evaluate short noisy and chaotic signals while the former is better suited to deal with aperiodic and quasi periodic data typical pre processing steps such as searching for outliers interpolation for estimating missing values detrending and normalization by standard deviations were carried out before the analysis 4 1 temporal correlations the links between groundwater level and monthly precipitation are examined using linear regression with a two tailed significant t test at the 95 percent confidence level first monthly precipitation times series are transformed into cumulative departures detrended and normalized using the methods described by hanson et al 2004 lag correlation analysis which gives the correlation coefficient as a function of the lag between two time series is also used to identify the lag of maximum correlation between the causal process precipitation and the aquifer system response groundwater level 4 2 continuous wavelet transform the continuous wavelet transform cwt is appropriate to analyze non stationary signals that have temporal variations in both amplitude and frequency its main advantage over classical spectral methods is that it is able to reveal the time evolution of the dominant modes of variability being as such specially tailored for the detection of localized or intermittent events the cwt is defined as the convolution of the signal with a scaled and translated version of the wavelet function daubechies 1990 the method is implemented in matlab using the morlet wavelet described in torrence and compo 1998 the morlet wavelet presents several advantages over other wavelets such as the equivalence between scale and the equivalent fourier period sang 2013 we use 29 scales monthly sampling rate and 4 sub octaves per scale which allows us to analyze periods ranging from 2 months to 21 years the wavelet spectrum depicts the temporal distribution of the power variance of the time series as a function of period scale over the 30 years of analysis the spectrum is normalized by 1 σ2 where σ2 is the variance of the time series the 5 significant levels are computed using a chi square test against a red noise spectrum as the null hypothesis the cone of influence delimits the regions where the edge effects due to zero padding make the results less reliable 4 3 wavelet coherence the wavelet coherence wtc is used to identify time localized common oscillatory behavior in two time series its definition is similar to a localized correlation coefficient between two cwt in time frequency space torrence and webster 1998 the wtc in this study is computed at the 95 confidence level using the algorithm described in grinsted et al 2004 the phase relationship is shown by the orientation of the arrows in regions of high coherence for example horizontal arrows from left to right indicate in phase relationships areas above the 5 significant level indicate locked phase behavior but not necessarily common high power regions in time frequency space with large common power and consistent phase relationship are likely to possess a causality between the time series 4 4 wavelet pca wavelet principal component analysis wpca is suited to detect patterns that are concealed or not visible in raw data katul and parlange 1995 the method is implemented in matlab wavelet toolbox using two processing steps to extract localized signal features the first step is a discrete wavelet transform resulting in the determination of approximation and detail coefficients a5 and d5 d1 we employed a time series decomposition into five levels i e 25 scales using a 2nd order symlet sym2 wavelet and checked that other choices of the number of levels or wavelets e g 2nd order daubechies did not alter the main conclusions the second step involves a principal component analysis applied to the matrix of approximation and details which allows finding the projections of the filtered signal maximizing the variance i e their principal components or pcs partial reconstructions of a selected number of retained principal components provide simplified versions of the original signal in this study we present the first three principal components pc1 pc2 and pc3 along with the percentage of the total variance explained by each of them subsequently to wpca we have computed temporal correlations between the pcs of groundwater levels and the climate indices nao ea and scand using spearman s rank coefficients 4 5 ssa of groundwater level the singular spectral analysis ssa is a form of principal component analysis used to extract the dominant frequencies in short and noisy time series the advantage over harmonic analysis through a fourier transform is that the fitted functions are not defined a priori but are based on structures determined through eigenanalysis following the methods outlined by dettinger et al 1995 and hanson et al 2004 the calculations are carried out by diagonalizing a lagged covariance matrix vautard et al 1992 we compute the ssa using the hydrologic and climate analysis toolkit dickinson et al 2004 with window lengths of 60 and 30 months to capture periods longer and shorter than 5 years respectively in any case the window length is less than 1 5 of the time series length as recommended by ghil et al 2002 the relative contributions of the most significant periodic components to the total variance of groundwater levels determined through ssa are in the end compared to the wpca results 5 results 5 1 precipitation versus groundwater level the relation between precipitation and groundwater level is illustrated at each site using a single piezometer the results for other piezometers are similar but not shown since it is not the purpose of this study to give an exhaustive representation of the heterogeneity in each aquifer fig 3 a shows that there is an almost instantaneous response between precipitation and hydraulic head variations the time lag of maximum correlation is zero consistent with the permeable nature of the sediment cover and the shallow depth of the water table at both lavos and silves table 1 the correlation between precipitation and groundwater level is also similar at both sites pearsońs coefficient 0 6 fig 3b the wavelet power spectra of precipitation and groundwater levels are compared at each aquifer and across aquifers in fig 4 although there are some notable differences in mid frequency timing across aquifers the cwt plots are otherwise similar an important common aspect that emerges from these spectra is the power concentration in two distinct bands the first concentrated in the 4 8 years band most intense before 2005 and the second occurring in the 2 4 years band from 2000 onwards the variability modes having enough persistence and amplitude to be statistically significant within white contours peak at different frequencies in the two study sites in the north fig 4a the power is concentrated in the 2 4 years band while in the south fig 4b the variance peaks in the 4 8 years band at smaller scales one can observe several scattered peaks at periods of 1 year the strongest patches occur in 1990 1996 2000 and 2010 which were anomalously wet years it is also noteworthy the strong attenuation of power or lack in variance in the 1 2 year band centered on 2004 but extending for almost a decade this anomaly can be attributed to the outstanding drought that affected the iberian peninsula in 2004 2005 5 2 links between climate indices precipitation and groundwater level fig 5 lm aquifer and fig 6 qs aquifer show the wavelet coherence between climate indices and precipitation or groundwater levels in order to relate climatic extreme events and climate pattern indices vertical lines marking the main droughts in portugal have been drawn over the wtc plots the 2011 2012 event was excluded for being too close to the cone of influence the lines divide the plots into four time windows with distinctive coherence patterns suggesting that extreme events indeed mark as a consequence of abrupt re organizations of climate variability modes at each aquifer results for two piezometer locations intend to demonstrate the effect of spatially varying hydrogeological conditions despite local differences there is a great deal of similarity in coherence patterns across hydrological responses to a given climate index along columns at both study sites fig 5 and fig 6 scand is the index having the most widespread influence presenting statistically significant patches of coherence at several multiannual periodicities especially between 1999 and 2005 each climate index shows consistent phase relationships at characteristic periods although sometimes restricted to a given time window nao at periods of 6 10 years especially in the south fig 6 ea at periods of 2 4 years especially after 1999 fig 5 and scand at periods of 4 6 years especially after 2005 fig 5 and fig 6 regarding the phase angle there is a dominant horizontal anti phase 180 relationship between nao and the hydrologic time series at all sites it is well known that during nao negative phases low pressure systems in the north atlantic are shifted southwards leading to increased precipitation and increased river discharges in iberia lorenzo lacruz et al 2011 trigo et al 2008 2004 thus the out of phase relationship is in agreement with the fact that recharge precipitation is negatively correlated with nao in contrast ea and scand show preferential diagonal or downward pointing arrows that indicate some degree of lead or lag between the indices and the hydrological time series there are also episodes of high coherence that cannot be attributed to a single index such synchronized relationships reveal the impact of the coupling amongst indices for example synchronized coherence patches at periods of around 2 years centered in 2000 fig 5 and fig 6 correspond to coupled nao ea scand phases in 2001 and 2003 fig 1 the impact of coupled phases is better illustrated in fig 7 which displays the hydrological time series averaged over years of positive and negative phases e g hydraulic head variations for nao correspond to monthly values averaged over nao years more consistent relationships can be inferred from piezometric levels than from precipitation which is highly seasonal in iberia owing to the buffer capacity of aquifers higher piezometric levels are associated with negative phases of the winter nao as expected however fig 7 also shows that maximum piezometric levels occur in years of nao ea mostly coincidentally also scand combinations while minimum levels occur during nao ea combinations in fact opposing nao and ea phases seem to provide an envelope to all other possible phases and their combinations not shown due to the limited number of years only three in which these conditions occur fig 1 caution is required in generalizing this result nonetheless these results are qualitatively similar to recent analysis of real wind power generation in portugal that presents its highest lowest values for the nao ea nao ea combination and in between results with nao and nao composites fig 4 in correia et al 2017 5 3 quantified impacts of ea nao and scand on groundwater level fig 8 shows the first three principal components of the time series obtained via wpca we focus on groundwater level although the precipitation decomposition is also shown for completeness the first principal component pc1 accounts for nearly 50 of the total variance in groundwater levels at all sites this component displays variable cycles of relatively long period 5 years repeatedly limited by major droughts the second and third principal components pc2 and pc3 have shorter periods 5 years and together account for 30 to 40 of the total variance these components are hard to distinguish for instance pc2 at benafim looks like pc3 at silves and some of their peaks coincide with anomalous wet year this swap in the ranking of some pcs is a typical caveat of pca analysis when two consecutive components present relatively similar values of explained variance trigo and palutikof 2001 as is the case here of pc2 and pc3 for benafim temporal correlations between complete time series of climate indices and principal components do not produce statistically significant values however correlations are statistically significant for a limited set of seasonal averages table 2 both the summer jjas and winter djfm aggregates of pc1 correlate with the winter nao showing no association to other indices pc2 and pc3 correlate with ea and scand with a delay lag of 6 months i e summer aggregates correlate with winter indices pc3 also partially correlates with nao especially in the south silves and benafim we establish an association between principal components and frequencies extracted from ssa based on the period threshold separating pc1 5 years from pc2 and pc3 5 years the ssa helps to constrain the magnitude of the relative contributions of each climate mode to the overall variability table 3 altogether the climate indices account for 80 on average of the total variance of groundwater levels at both the lm and qs aquifers nao is the index playing the most relevant role in groundwater variability with a stronger influence in the south 60 on average than in the north 40 on average the contributions of ea and scand are difficult to set apart but their joint impact on variance is approximately 20 in the south and 40 in the north discrepancies between ssa and wpca results are due to the presence of a nao component in pc3 this is consistent with the previously recognized existence of nao ea and scand mode coupling 6 discussion this study reinforces the role of nao as the primary driver of hydrological variability in portugal alongside with ea and scand the climate driven periodicities detected in groundwater levels compare well with results from previous studies in the iberian peninsula for example gámiz fortis et al 2008 calculated the main oscillatory components in streamflow series from the main rivers in portugal over the 1920 2004 period the results revealed a set of oscillations with associated periods in the 2 3 4 5 and 6 8 years bands peaking at 6 5 year guadiana river in the south of portugal they concluded that the overall relationship between nao and river streamflow was complex and nonstationary spectral methods applied to a set of 53 piezometer time series from the vega de granada alluvial aquifer in southern spain along with rainfall temperature and river flow data also identified cycles of 8 11 years and 3 2 years luque espinar et al 2008 also in agreement with previous studies our results expose a stronger influence of nao in the south of portugal such dependence on geographic location was previously recognized in studies analyzing the impact of climate modes on iberian lakes hernández et al 2015 streamflow lorenzo lacruz et al 2011 and wind speed correia et al 2017 among others however few studies so far quantified the impact of ea or scand on iberian hydrologic time series despite the increasing awareness of their importance comas bru and mcdermott 2013 steirou et al 2017 bastos et al 2016 quantitative relationships between climate indices and precipitation obtained from individual weather stations demand cautious interpretation since precipitation time series in iberia may display notable differences even among neighboring locations nonetheless according to wavelet pca results nao ea and scand pc1 pc2 pc3 are responsible for 85 and 95 of the total variance of precipitation in the lm and qs aquifers respectively fig 8 among them nao contributes to 64 and 74 of the variance in the north and south respectively in agreement with expected patterns for this teleconnection the groundwater response to rainfall depends on evapotranspiration land cover and geologic factors such as topography and soil permeability which affect infiltration and recharge these factors attenuate climate signals and may explain the relatively weaker impacts of climate indices on piezometric levels than on precipitation in the qs aquifer for instance geological filtering related to spatially heterogeneous geomorphologic and hydrogeologic properties water storage capacity and transmissivity accounts for 15 of differential variability in piezometric levels among eastern and western sectors neves et al 2016 rodriguez puebla et al 1998 quantified the association between climate indices and precipitation at the iberian scale based on an empirical orthogonal function analysis of precipitation from 51 meteorological stations from 1949 to 1995 in spite of showing significant spatial variability their results indicate that on average ea accounts for 33 of the total variance of precipitation while nao and scand explain 19 and 13 of the total precipitation variance respectively differences between these estimates and findings of the present study may be attributed to the local scale of our analysis to the different methods employed and to the different time spans analyzed perhaps the most interesting aspect of the present study and novelty in what concerns to groundwater levels is the recognition that transitive couplings among the indices nao ea and scand greatly affect hydrological responses coupled phases between climate modes may prompt extreme or anomalous precipitation events cleverly et al 2016 kalimeris et al 2017 and indeed our results provide evidence of an association between coupled nao and ea phases and extremes in groundwater levels moreover wavelet transform methods wtc and wpca applied to groundwater levels clearly show that extreme events droughts in portugal mark abrupt transitions in synchronization patterns among nao ea and scand in future integrated forecast system of groundwater availability can benefit from the identification of such abrupt transitions which define time windows where it is possible to assume quasi stationary behavior of climate patterns understanding the response of hydrologic systems to atmospheric circulation modes is extremely important in the context of climate change groundwater plays a critical role for its value as a buffer system during droughts events and because it is very often the main source of potable water for irrigation certainly in portugal the results of the present study may motivate future investigations focusing on the impacts of coupled climate patterns on aquifer levels and on the association of coupled phases with hydrologic extremes for example national scale assessments of the effects of teleconnections on aquifers across the usa and canada showed that groundwater levels are controlled by interannual and multidecadal variability associated with the el niño southern oscillation nao pacific decadal oscillation atlantic multidecadal oscillation and artic oscillation kuss and gurdak 2014 tremblay et al 2011 however from the point of view of the subsurface components of the water cycle the interactions amongst climate patterns remain underestimated in north america in the southern hemisphere strong precipitation anomalies observed in australia occur when teleconnections in the pacific and indian oceans are synchronized cleverly et al 2016 but the impact of such synchronization on aquifers still needs evaluation further investigation is also vital in india and east africa where groundwater storage depends heavily on extreme rainfall related to monsoon precipitation forced by the indian ocean dipole and the el niño southern oscillation asoka et al 2017 taylor et al 2013 likewise studies addressing the influence of long term climate variability on groundwater recharge in europe are scarce and focus only on individual teleconnections holman et al 2011 de vita et al 2012 groundwater simulations incorporating a priori knowledge about local hydroclimatic responses will globally help to improve resources planning and better prepare for climate changing scenarios the sensitivity of aquifers to the propagation of climate signals depends not only on hydrogeological properties but also on the local dynamics of the climate patterns themselves even at relatively small scales as exposed by the north south asymmetry found in portugal site dependent studies are thus required in order to assess the vulnerability of groundwater supplies to long term climate induced variations particularly through its influence on precipitation and pumping as far as projections for the identified leading patterns of variability nao ea and scand becomes available and reliable medium to long term forecasts and inferences about groundwater levels states in portugal could be attempted on an operational mode although no significant trends were detected in the analyzed period neither for the climate indicators nor in the piezometric levels series which hampers an in depth long term trend analysis under future warmer climate conditions recent researches have identified slight positive shifts in the probability distribution of the nao phase barnes and polvani 2015 deser et al 2017 woollings and blackburn 2012 acknowledging that there is still a large uncertainty in these long horizon predictions and that the magnitude of the projected trends is well masked by the natural predominantly stochastic inter annual oscillations of the nao index deser et al 2017 this would imply the risk of lower than current groundwater levels on average that scenario would demand corresponding efforts for the design and implementation of adaptation measures in the medium range these measures could take advantage of the progresses achieved for forecasting the nao and other teleconnection patterns months even one year ahead brands et al 2012 dunstone et al 2016 scaife et al 2014 along with the results reported here 7 conclusions this study examines the teleconnections between nao ea scand and precipitation and groundwater level fluctuations in the particular aquifers considered here leirosa monte real and querença silves precipitation and groundwater levels showed very similar responses to climate modes however monthly fluctuations in groundwater levels were smoother and showed more consistent links to climate indices than precipitation which makes them useful to assist in developing process based models e g hindcast of observed changes in the long term the capacity of wavelet transform methods to analyze processes at various scales exposes not only the impacts of climate modes nao ea and scand on groundwater levels but also the existence of complex transitive couplings among modes extreme events coinciding with coupled phases e g droughts and nao ea mark sharp boundaries in mode interaction patterns or sudden shifts in the time frequency space groundwater levels over the analyzed time interval 1987 2016 display consistent relationships with climate indices in distinct period bands and time windows the strongest covariability occurs in the 6 10 years band for nao in the 2 4 years band for ea especially after 1999 and in the 4 6 years band for scand especially after 2005 episodes displaying simultaneously multiple coherent relationships are associated with coupled phases among nao ea and scand the contribution of each set of oscillations to the total variance of the groundwater levels was evaluated using singular spectral analysis and wavelet principal component analysis as complementary approaches the results indicate that nao ea and scand patterns together are responsible for most 80 of the inter annual variability of groundwater levels in portugal nao is the first leading pattern of variability accounting for 40 and 60 of the total variance of groundwater levels in the north and south of the country respectively the joint contributions of ea and scand account for the remaining 40 of variability in the north and 20 of variability in the south on average their individual contributions are difficult to distinguish but ea associated with peak periods of 2 5 and 3 3 years is relatively more influential in the north while scand associated with peak periods of 4 2 years is relatively more influential in the south monthly groundwater levels averaged over years of positive and negative phases of climate indices provide additional insights the impact of nao alone is clear since lower higher groundwater levels occur during years of positive negative nao phases moreover extreme piezometric levels take place in years of anti phase ea and nao combinations combined winter nao ea phases are associated with maximum groundwater levels while combined nao ea phases are associated with minimum levels climate change projections of more frequent and severe droughts over the next decades will have challenging effects on groundwater demands further understanding on how climate modes influence groundwater storage with particular emphasis on the implications of phase couplings and on their relationship to extreme events will help to improve future projections of groundwater availability and guide integrated water resource management practices not only in portugal but around the world declarations of interest none

6872,coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea level rise slr affects seawater intrusion swi in aquifers under coastal flooding events swi from both sea boundary and land surface is expected to increase swi in coastal aquifers is also strongly influenced by geological heterogeneity characteristics in this study the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding on swi is quantified in a two dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer three indices including the seawater toe location x toe the mixing volume v mv and the swi volume v swiv are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of the seawater a series of 50 log normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity with a spherical correlation function is generated using the gcosim3d code then numerical simulations of transient saturated unsaturated variable density flow and solute transport sutra are performed in a stochastic monte carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding and geological heterogeneity effects can change the groundwater salinity during storm surge events seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to reduce temporary of the freshwater quality the results indicate that the storm surge has a short term impact on fresh groundwater the aquifer is significantly influenced by slr as a long term effect while it causes a larger x toe in comparison with pre flooding events conditions also the results obtained under gradual and instantaneous assumption of slr show that the gradual assumption leads to a smaller x toe which is more realistic comparison of the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios indicates the heterogeneity affects swi status both in the presence and the absence of coastal flooding events it causes reduction in x toe and v swiv as well as increase in v mv this study shows the significant value of considering a wide range of variations due to heterogeneity in order to better manage the coastal fresh groundwater aquifers keywords heterogeneous aquifer coastal flooding seawater intrusion storm surge sea level rise 1 introduction in coastal regions aquifers are affected by seawater intrusion swi which can threaten the quality of fresh groundwater resources climate change can significantly influence swi in coastal aquifers it can lead to sea level rise slr associated land surface inundation lsi and more frequent storm surges ataie ashtiani et al 2013 werner et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 yang et al 2015 slr is expected to increase from 0 26 to 1 8 m by year 2100 melloul and collin 2006 ipcc 2013 vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 also the impact of slr due to lsi is significant in low lying coastal regions ketabchi et al 2014 passeri et al 2015 more frequent storm surges increase the frequency of inundating the extensive areas of near sea lands and can also influence the fresh groundwater resources yang et al 2015 2018 as a result of these combined effects seawater interface is now facing many challenges by natural causes in addition to man made interventions such as over pumping ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 many investigators are dealing with modeling the above impacts in order to assess the seawater toe location and the mixing volume the simulation results are affected by simplifications and assumptions such as homogeneity of aquifer which is not the case in many real world applications considering the heterogeneity of aquifer and quantification of its impact on swi due to slr and storm surge events are therefore of most pressing issues ketabchi et al 2016a fig 1 illustrates three conceptual models of a heterogeneous unconfined coastal aquifer fig 1a and b show the status of swi in a coastal aquifer prior to and after a storm surge as shown in fig 1b swi from land surface is caused by a storm surge event due to ocean surge inundation after both slr and storm surge event swi from both sea boundary and land surface can also be expected fig 1c it depends on the land surface slope the topographic characteristics and the geological heterogeneity of the subsurface domain recently some investigations such as yang et al 2015 michael et al 2016 and houben et al 2018 considered heterogeneity through different objectives yang et al 2015 assessed storm surge and slr impacts in an aquifer with six different zones of hydraulic conductivity to incorporate geological heterogeneity however the fully geological heterogeneity was not considered in that study also michael et al 2016 investigated the patterns and statistics of heterogeneous simulations to show the impacts of preferential flow on groundwater salinity distributions and seawater exchange over the ocean floor in this study the impact of storm surge and slr was not incorporated houben et al 2018 investigated the impact of geological heterogeneity on the position of seawater interface and flux rate of freshwater discharge to the ocean they also did not model the impacts of storm surge the main objective of this paper is to consider the fully geological heterogeneity and quantify its impact in combination with the influences of storm surge and slr on swi status for a two dimensional 2d unconfined coastal aquifer accordingly a set of scenarios for instantaneous slr islr gradual slr gslr as well as storm surge event are defined for each scenario a series of 50 log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields is generated and monte carlo simulation is conducted 2 a review of relevant studies a summary of recent studies based on the simulation details and the hydrogeological properties

previous studies e g oude essink et al 2010 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 ketabchi et al 2016a effects of slr and lsi on a coastal groundwater system in netherlands were investigated by oude essink et al 2010 they showed that the impact of slr was limited to areas within 10 km of the coastline also it was shows that salt loads can lead to salinization of surface waters and fresh groundwater in low lying lands of netherlands mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 investigated the impacts of islr lsi and variations in recharge rate on the fresh groundwater lens of kish island iran they showed that the fresh groundwater lens thicknesses were decreased about 24 due to slr also lsi could have a significant impact on the fresh groundwater lens especially in low lying areas near sea lands an analysis of slr impacts on swi was conducted by ketabchi et al 2016a they used both analytical and numerical models for quantification of the seawater toe location under slr impacts in combination with recharge rate variations lsi due to slr aquifer slope variation and different inland boundary conditions their results were limited to the homogeneous aquifers 2 2 storm surge and tsunami the storm surge and tsunami effects studies were mostly done in recent years illangasekare et al 2006 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2015 yu et al 2016 gingerich et al 2017 post and houben 2017 giambastiani et al 2017 illangasekare et al 2006 experimentally investigated the short term and long term impacts of tsunami on a homogeneous aquifer their results demonstrated that as a short term impact many of the operation wells as the critical water supply sources were salinized also accessibility of drinking water was a major long term impact chui and terry 2012 investigated aquifer salinization impacted by the storm surges considering a topographic depression of the atoll island they examined the immediate responses longer term behavior and subsequent recovery of an atoll island after saline damage caused by storm surges chui and terry 2015 studied the influence of a topographic depression on two layer fresh groundwater lenses vulnerability caused by a storm surge event their results demonstrated that the topography was an important factor influencing the potential severity of fresh groundwater lens impacted by swi from the land surface groundwater salinity due to storm surges in a homogeneous coastal aquifer considering the topographic impacts was investigated by yu et al 2016 they showed that topography has a significant impact on groundwater salinity due to ocean surge inundation gingerich et al 2017 investigated the seawater flooding impact due to a storm surge event on water salinity in roi namur island republic of the marshall islands their results indicated that after two days of seawater flooding the observed water salinity reaches to seawater concentration but after ten days it considerably decreased the undesirable effects on the potable water supply of groundwater lasted for 660 days post and houben 2017 studied on the role of density driven fingering mixing of swi and the sequestration of solutes into the deeper part of a sand aquifer on the island of baltrum their results showed that the vertical flow downwards had slowed down over time due to mixing and a decreasing density contrast giambastiani et al 2017 evaluated the impacts of storm events on an unconfined coastal aquifer in ravenna southern po delta italy this study showed that increase of the hydraulic head can lead to a decrease in groundwater salinity and pore water salinity due to rainfall infiltration during the 2 day storm event the observation wells near the coastline recorded a temporary increase in salinity of water due to ocean surge inundation 2 3 tidal fluctuation and storm surge yang et al 2013 and huizer et al 2017 considered the tidal fluctuation and storm surge impacts on real coastal aquifers yang et al 2013 simulated the flow and transport in response to tidal activities and storm surge on a homogeneous aquifer in near bremerhaven germany their results showed that tidal fluctuation causes to the formation of the recirculating zone in the intertidal zone their storm surge simulation results also demonstrated that overtopping seawater penetrates into the aquifer and takes about 10 years for recover groundwater to be suitable for potable water huizer et al 2017 used the measurement method and numerical modeling to assessed tides and storm surges impacts on lsi and swi in a multi layer coastal aquifer in netherlands they found that wave run up and morphological changes have a significant impact on lsi in low lying lands and can be affect the fresh groundwater resources 2 4 storm surge and slr quantification of both storm surge and sea level rise impacts on swi were assessed in a limited number of studies such as chui and terry 2013 yang et al 2015 and mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 the saline damage caused by storm surge and the recovery of the fresh groundwater lens after slr was investigated by chui and terry 2013 their results showed that if the water table was affected by slr the impact of groundwater salinity due to storm surge would be less than at under the current sea level position no slr yang et al 2015 assessed storm surge and slr impacts for an aquifer consisting of six different zones of hydraulic conductivity at the north german coast in this study about 1250 m intrusion of seawater was observed due to slr of 1 m their storm surge simulation results showed that seawater fingers were penetrates into the aquifer below the flooded land surface it takes about 4 years for groundwater to eliminate the seawater fingers and to be suitable for potable use this study also highlighted that seawater fingers and the fate of the plumes of seawater depend on the heterogeneity properties of aquifer chui and terry 2015 and yu et al 2016 found that the topographic depression has a significant impact on groundwater salinity due to storm surges mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 arrived at a similar conclusion they showed that the topographic depression has a significant impact on the swi volume due to storm surge in the short term while in the long term the existence of topographic depression enlarged the swi volume in comparison with that of no topographic depression 2 5 heterogeneity although the geological properties of the aquifer are generally heterogeneous consideration of a homogeneous system has been a typical assumption in many previous studies e g yang et al 2013 chesnaux 2015 yu et al 2016 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 some studies considered the heterogeneity properties of coastal aquifers as two layer systems e g chui and terry 2013 chui and terry 2015 post and houben 2017 and multi layer systems e g yang et al 2015 huizer et al 2017 gingerich et al 2017 kerrou and renard 2010 li et al 2016 pool et al 2015 michael et al 2016 siena and riva 2017 and houben et al 2018 are among a few studies to consider the aquifer geological properties as fully heterogeneous systems kerrou and renard 2010 investigated the impacts of dimensionality and heterogeneity on swi in a hypothetical aquifer they showed that the behavior of the seawater interface is different in 2d and 3d models the seawater toe location is controlled by the horizontal effective hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivity similarly the analyses of abarca et al 2007 in 2d case can be noted in these studies the impacts of tidal fluctuations slr and storm surge were not considered as for 2d numerical models abarca et al 2007 kerrou and renard 2010 and michael et al 2016 showed that increasing heterogeneity causes enlarging the width of the mixing zone and decrease in seawater toe location in 3d numerical models kerrou and renard 2010 and pool et al 2015 found that when heterogeneity increases toe location of seawater increases siena and riva 2018 assessed the combined effects of aquifer heterogeneity and pumping operations on swi in argentona river basin spain in 3d numerical model their results indicated that heterogeneity affects the seawater interface with and without pumping scenarios by reducing the seawater toe location and widening the mixing zone as concluding remarks there have been investigations that considered the heterogeneity of aquifer and its effects on swi with different objectives there has been however a limited number of studies such as chui and terry 2013 and yang et al 2015 that both storm surge and slr impacts on swi in a heterogeneous aquifer were assessed in the studies of chui and terry 2013 and yang et al 2015 the heterogeneity of aquifers was considered as a two layer and a multi zone media with different values of hydraulic conductivity the contribution of this paper is to consider the fully heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field and quantify its impact in combination with the influences of storm surge and slr on swi 3 methods and materials 3 1 problem statement in order to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity a spherical correlation function in a 2d unconfined aquifer domain is employed this will allow to overcome the complexity of a medium by generating different realization of randomly distribution hydraulic conductivity fig 2 shows a selected fully geological heterogeneous realization of 50 log normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity the log normal hydraulic conductivity fields are characterized by their mean variance and directional correlation lengths in two spatial dimensions as presented in this figure the boundary condition used at seaside boundary is seawater pressure with fixed salinity the inland boundary is regional freshwater inflow newman boundary the outflow is freshwater discharge to sea which includes the regional flux entering from inland boundary and the recharge from land surface also a no flow boundary is assumed at the bottom surface of the aquifer the discretization of the problem domain consists of a grid of 38 544 quadrilateral finite elements 39 071 nodes the horizontal size of the grid changes from 1 m 250 m near to seaside boundary to 4 m 250 m to 100 m also the vertical direction size of the grid varies between 0 15 and 0 57 m the effect of different discretization schemes i e finer and coarser discretization was considered to find the most suitable nodes ketabchi et al 2016a the selected discretization satisfies the grid peclet number as the spatial stability criterion voss and souza 1987 voss and provost 2010 1 p e q f δ

presented in table 2 as shown in this table numerical modeling adopted a molecular diffusivity of 1 48 10 9 m 2 s 1 also longitudinal and transverse dispersivity is considered 1 m and 0 1 m respectively as suggested by ketabchi et al 2016a the spatial discretization and velocities support the courant number to be less than 0 75 which ensures the selected temporal discretization voss and souza 1987 voss and provost 2010 3 2 numerical modeling in this study a series of 50 log normally distributed fully hydraulic conductivity fields with a spherical correlation function is generated using gcosim3d code gomez hernandez and journel 1992 numerical simulations of transient saturated unsaturated variable density flow and solute transport code sutra voss and provost 2010 are carried out within a stochastic monte carlo simulation the fluid mass balance and the solute mass balance equations are solved simultaneously to characterize variable density flow associated with swi the fluid mass balance equation demonstrates the single phase flow in saturated and unsaturated porous media and the solute mass balance equation describes the solute transport including advection and dispersion mechanisms voss and provost 2010 table 3 presents the characteristics of simulation model including the simulation setup spatial and the temporal discretization and boundary conditions which are adopted from ketabchi et al 2016a 3 3 description of indices the effects of heterogeneity on swi status are assessed by comparing the results of all monte carlo simulations versus those obtained for a homogeneous aquifer the seawater toe location x toe the mixing volume v mv and the swi volume v swiv are indices which are considered to assess the vulnerability of fresh groundwater of aquifer x toe is the length of seawater along the aquifer basement and is calculated using 50 of salinity concentration v mv and v swiv are a percentage of the occupied volume of aquifer including the groundwater with the salinity concentration between 5 and 95 as well as greater than 50 of the maximum salinity concentration respectively the results discussed in the following sections are organized based on dimensionless parameters dimensionless assessments allow generalization of the results to other cases with different parameters similar to kerrou and renard 2010 ketabchi et al 2016a 2016b

numerical simulations in the numerical assessments both instantaneous slr of 1 m and gradual slr 10 mm yr for 100 years similar to the approach adopted by e g morgan et al 2015 and ketabchi et al 2016a are taken into account the land surface slope of the aquifer and lsi caused by slr is also incorporated it is assumed that a storm surge of 3 m similar to anderson and lauer 2008 and mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 has occurred during the 2 days and seawater which inundates the land surface infiltrates into the aquifer it is also assumed that the topographic depression completely filled by seawater during 30 days after the storm surge event abbreviation terms for the scenarios are noted in table 4 and are used in the following sections base case scenarios i e hom and het scenarios show the conditions with no coastal flooding 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact on the seawater toe location the 5 50 and 95 seawater interface of the steady state salinity distributions for the homogeneous dash and solid lines and the heterogeneous gray bounds scenarios are shown in fig 3 given the assumption of a homogeneous aquifer the x toe reaches to about 409 0 m x toe 0 409 while for the heterogeneous aquifer it varies between 183 1 m and 479 0 m x toe 0 183 0 479 these findings support the numerical results compared to the results of kerrou and renard 2010 that found smaller values for x toe while increasing heterogeneity the value of x toe het is obtained 0 308 which is smaller than x toe hom of 0 409 table 5 summarized x toe after 100 years t 71 22 simulations under gslr and islr scenarios for the homogeneous aquifer x toe has smaller values in gslr scenarios compared to islr scenarios these results confirm the findings of mehdizadeh et al 2017 that the gslr has smaller swi than islr since the assumption of gslr is more realistic when the heterogeneous aquifer is used for het gslr scenarios x toe has smaller values compared to het islr ones when we compare the values of x toe het with the values of x toe hom in both gslr and islr scenarios heterogeneity has a smaller influence on the estimated swi fig 4 shows the 50 seawater interface under a storm surge event and both storm surge and slr scenarios in this figure the x toe is shown by comparing the results of all monte carlo simulations gray bound versus those obtained for the homogeneous aquifer solid line the results highlight that under both storm surge and slr conditions a more significant swi occurs in comparison to the conditions in which only storm surge event is used under homss islr scenario a more significant swi is experienced than the homss gslr scenario see table 6 also the results indicate that the heterogeneity affects swi either in the presence or the absence of coastal flooding events by reducing x toe for instance under hetss scenario the x toe varies between 0 215 and 0 543 which shows that the value of x toe het is smaller than x toe hom this difference confirms the significant impact of heterogeneity on swi the detailed analyses of x toe are summarized in table 6 also in fig 5 the 5 and 95 seawater interfaces are shown for the defined scenarios for instance for t 16 425 16 428 16 47 and 71 22 as shown in these figures the impact of heterogeneity on swi is the same as the 50 seawater interface this is in comparison to those obtained under the homogeneous aquifers 4 2 impact on the swi volume the values of v swiv caused by a storm surge event and slr for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous aquifers are shown in fig 6 when the maximum values of v swiv are assessed it is recognized that increases are up to 53 32 for the homogeneous aquifer and they vary between 30 92 and 117 04 for the heterogeneous aquifer in comparison to those obtained under the base case condition this result shows that the storm surge has short term impact see fig 6a for the combined impacts of storm surge and gslr fig 6b the maximum values of the v swiv reaches to t 71 22 when the combined impacts of storm surge and islr are considered fig 6c the assessments show that v swiv is increased up to 214 30 for the homogeneous aquifer while it varies between 168 4 and 417 0 for the heterogeneous aquifer the results show that the value of v swiv het is smaller than v swiv hom also the storm surge has short term while slr has long term impact the detailed analysis for v swiv and coastal flooding effects are summarized in table 7 as seen in this table the corresponding t is reaching the maximum values of v swiv at 16 47 and 71 22 when the maximum values of the predicted v swiv is compared with the values of steady state v swiv up to 49 2 storm surge effect for the heterogeneous aquifer i e hetss scenario is observed for the homogeneous aquifer the storm surge effect on v swiv is estimated as 82 1 for the homss islr and hetss islr scenarios the storm surge effect is negligible for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers the volume of swi due to islr has more influence than gslr δ v swiv i e difference between steady state and t 16 425 of v swiv is estimated as 1 0 24 for hom islr and hom gslr scenarios respectively also δ v swiv is estimated as 0 41 0 56 for het gslr and 1 07 1 18 for het islr with the same conditions when aquifer is not affected by storm event and slr the value of v swiv is the same as steady state conditions as expected after a storm surge event t 16 428 seawater inundates the land surface and v swiv is increased see fig 4a when the homogeneous aquifer is considered δ v swiv is estimated to be 0 30 while for the heterogeneous aquifer δ v swiv is between 0 24 and 0 31 it is shown that the value of v wv het is less than v wv hom the combined impacts of storm surge and slr indicates that v swiv is increased δ v swiv is obtained 0 56 and 1 42 for homss gslr and homss islr respectively generally considering a storm surge event with gslr slightly reduces the impacts on v swiv compared to islr furthermore when the heterogeneous aquifer is considered δ v swiv varies between 1 37 and 1 43 for hetss islr and between 0 54 and 0 97 for hetss gslr it is shown that the value of v wv het is less than v wv hom for these scenarios after 30 days storm surge event t 16 47 v swiv is increased from land surface known as seawater fingers in previous studies such as yang et al 2015 and ketabchi et al 2016a under this condition seawater intrudes into the aquifer and the plumes of seawater migrate downwards from the land surface because of gravitational influence considering the homogeneous aquifer which is subjected to a storm surge δ v swiv is estimated to be 0 35 while for the heterogeneous aquifer it varies between 0 27 and 0 39 for homss slr which represents the combined impacts of storm surge and slr δ v swiv is estimated as 1 37 for homss islr and 0 54 for homss gslr when the heterogeneous aquifer is considered see table 8 the values of δ v swiv is smaller than that for homss slr scenarios as demonstrated in fig 4 and table 8 for t 17 02 31 years to 71 22 after 100 years δ v swiv is calculated for post storm surge results show that the storm surge has a short term impact on fresh groundwater and reduce effects of the freshwater quality similar results are obtained by illangasekare et al 2006 chui and terry 2013 yang et al 2015 and giambastiani et al 2017 they showed that during storm surge events seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to a temporary withdrawal of the freshwater the values of δ v swiv for the combined storm surge and slr scenarios are presented in table 8 these results show that about 1 year after a storm surge the highest impacts of a storm surge event on aquifer can be detected in other words in early times v swiv is significantly increased after that it is reduced and the aquifer would naturally return to its original state for t 71 22 plume of seawater caused by the storm surge is in most parts dominated in all cases heterogeneity leads to a smaller influence on v swiv the detailed analyses of δ v swiv are summarized in table 8 4 3 impact on the mixing volume the time series of v mv under homogenous and heterogeneous scenarios for one random realization of hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively also the detailed analyses of v mv are summarized in table 9 results show that heterogeneity causes increase in v mv for instance the value of v mv is estimated to be 0 56 for homss scenario while for the hetss scenario v mv is between 0 55 and 1 15 at t 16 425 it is shown that the value of v mv het is more than v mv hom as shown in table 9 heterogeneity leads to a more significant impact on v mv which is in line with the previous finding of pool et al 2015 and michael et al 2016 it is also observed that vertical seawater fingers are developed as they intrude downwards during the 2 days post coastal flooding events followed by a period of merging with the underlying lateral swi the seawater fingers begin mixing with the freshwater and seawater wedge before reaching the aquifer bottom as shown in these figures below the inundated land surfaces the strength of freshwater is gradually reduced as a result of vertical flows induced by the fingers after about 10 years transient salinity fingers caused by lsi are almost completely eliminated the new mixing zone and swi status are created when the salinity fingers reach from the inundated land surface and are getting mixed with the horizontal swi 5 summary and conclusions in this study the swi status under flooding events are analyzed for a 2d heterogeneous coastal aquifer three indices including the seawater toe location x toe the mixing volume v mv and the swi volume v swiv are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of seawater a series of 50 log normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity using the gcosim3d code and numerical simulations using sutra have been implemented in a stochastic monte carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding can change the groundwater salinity with and without geological heterogeneity assumptions the salinity distributions show that the impacts of a storm surge event could last up to about one year however transient salinity fingers from land surface could last for 10 years for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers the storm surge has a short term impact on fresh groundwater results show that during storm surge events seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to a temporary withdrawal of the freshwater that could last for a year smaller x toe is expected with increasing heterogeneity an increased dispersion due to heterogeneity leads to a decreasing density contrast and therefore a smaller seawater toe length also comparing gslr scenarios with islr scenarios shows that in gslr scenarios swi is smaller than that for islr scenarios heterogeneity leads to a smaller influence on the swi volume results also show that for all defined scenarios heterogeneity causes increase in the mixing volume in all cases heterogeneity shows more impact on the mixing volume which is in line with the previous results that heterogeneity causes the enlargement of the area of mixing zone this study could be a basis for implementation of real world cases in coastal areas in order to better manage the fresh groundwater aquifers and to better the assess of swi in coastal ecosystems 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to thank dr zahra zahmatkesh postdoctoral researcher at mcmaster

6872,coastal flooding due to storm surge and sea level rise slr affects seawater intrusion swi in aquifers under coastal flooding events swi from both sea boundary and land surface is expected to increase swi in coastal aquifers is also strongly influenced by geological heterogeneity characteristics in this study the combined impacts of fully geological heterogeneity and coastal flooding on swi is quantified in a two dimensional unconfined coastal aquifer three indices including the seawater toe location x toe the mixing volume v mv and the swi volume v swiv are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of the seawater a series of 50 log normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity with a spherical correlation function is generated using the gcosim3d code then numerical simulations of transient saturated unsaturated variable density flow and solute transport sutra are performed in a stochastic monte carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding and geological heterogeneity effects can change the groundwater salinity during storm surge events seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to reduce temporary of the freshwater quality the results indicate that the storm surge has a short term impact on fresh groundwater the aquifer is significantly influenced by slr as a long term effect while it causes a larger x toe in comparison with pre flooding events conditions also the results obtained under gradual and instantaneous assumption of slr show that the gradual assumption leads to a smaller x toe which is more realistic comparison of the homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios indicates the heterogeneity affects swi status both in the presence and the absence of coastal flooding events it causes reduction in x toe and v swiv as well as increase in v mv this study shows the significant value of considering a wide range of variations due to heterogeneity in order to better manage the coastal fresh groundwater aquifers keywords heterogeneous aquifer coastal flooding seawater intrusion storm surge sea level rise 1 introduction in coastal regions aquifers are affected by seawater intrusion swi which can threaten the quality of fresh groundwater resources climate change can significantly influence swi in coastal aquifers it can lead to sea level rise slr associated land surface inundation lsi and more frequent storm surges ataie ashtiani et al 2013 werner et al 2013 badaruddin et al 2015 yang et al 2015 slr is expected to increase from 0 26 to 1 8 m by year 2100 melloul and collin 2006 ipcc 2013 vermeer and rahmstorf 2009 also the impact of slr due to lsi is significant in low lying coastal regions ketabchi et al 2014 passeri et al 2015 more frequent storm surges increase the frequency of inundating the extensive areas of near sea lands and can also influence the fresh groundwater resources yang et al 2015 2018 as a result of these combined effects seawater interface is now facing many challenges by natural causes in addition to man made interventions such as over pumping ketabchi and ataie ashtiani 2015 many investigators are dealing with modeling the above impacts in order to assess the seawater toe location and the mixing volume the simulation results are affected by simplifications and assumptions such as homogeneity of aquifer which is not the case in many real world applications considering the heterogeneity of aquifer and quantification of its impact on swi due to slr and storm surge events are therefore of most pressing issues ketabchi et al 2016a fig 1 illustrates three conceptual models of a heterogeneous unconfined coastal aquifer fig 1a and b show the status of swi in a coastal aquifer prior to and after a storm surge as shown in fig 1b swi from land surface is caused by a storm surge event due to ocean surge inundation after both slr and storm surge event swi from both sea boundary and land surface can also be expected fig 1c it depends on the land surface slope the topographic characteristics and the geological heterogeneity of the subsurface domain recently some investigations such as yang et al 2015 michael et al 2016 and houben et al 2018 considered heterogeneity through different objectives yang et al 2015 assessed storm surge and slr impacts in an aquifer with six different zones of hydraulic conductivity to incorporate geological heterogeneity however the fully geological heterogeneity was not considered in that study also michael et al 2016 investigated the patterns and statistics of heterogeneous simulations to show the impacts of preferential flow on groundwater salinity distributions and seawater exchange over the ocean floor in this study the impact of storm surge and slr was not incorporated houben et al 2018 investigated the impact of geological heterogeneity on the position of seawater interface and flux rate of freshwater discharge to the ocean they also did not model the impacts of storm surge the main objective of this paper is to consider the fully geological heterogeneity and quantify its impact in combination with the influences of storm surge and slr on swi status for a two dimensional 2d unconfined coastal aquifer accordingly a set of scenarios for instantaneous slr islr gradual slr gslr as well as storm surge event are defined for each scenario a series of 50 log normally distributed hydraulic conductivity fields is generated and monte carlo simulation is conducted 2 a review of relevant studies a summary of recent studies based on the simulation details and the hydrogeological properties

previous studies e g oude essink et al 2010 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 ketabchi et al 2016a effects of slr and lsi on a coastal groundwater system in netherlands were investigated by oude essink et al 2010 they showed that the impact of slr was limited to areas within 10 km of the coastline also it was shows that salt loads can lead to salinization of surface waters and fresh groundwater in low lying lands of netherlands mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 investigated the impacts of islr lsi and variations in recharge rate on the fresh groundwater lens of kish island iran they showed that the fresh groundwater lens thicknesses were decreased about 24 due to slr also lsi could have a significant impact on the fresh groundwater lens especially in low lying areas near sea lands an analysis of slr impacts on swi was conducted by ketabchi et al 2016a they used both analytical and numerical models for quantification of the seawater toe location under slr impacts in combination with recharge rate variations lsi due to slr aquifer slope variation and different inland boundary conditions their results were limited to the homogeneous aquifers 2 2 storm surge and tsunami the storm surge and tsunami effects studies were mostly done in recent years illangasekare et al 2006 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2015 yu et al 2016 gingerich et al 2017 post and houben 2017 giambastiani et al 2017 illangasekare et al 2006 experimentally investigated the short term and long term impacts of tsunami on a homogeneous aquifer their results demonstrated that as a short term impact many of the operation wells as the critical water supply sources were salinized also accessibility of drinking water was a major long term impact chui and terry 2012 investigated aquifer salinization impacted by the storm surges considering a topographic depression of the atoll island they examined the immediate responses longer term behavior and subsequent recovery of an atoll island after saline damage caused by storm surges chui and terry 2015 studied the influence of a topographic depression on two layer fresh groundwater lenses vulnerability caused by a storm surge event their results demonstrated that the topography was an important factor influencing the potential severity of fresh groundwater lens impacted by swi from the land surface groundwater salinity due to storm surges in a homogeneous coastal aquifer considering the topographic impacts was investigated by yu et al 2016 they showed that topography has a significant impact on groundwater salinity due to ocean surge inundation gingerich et al 2017 investigated the seawater flooding impact due to a storm surge event on water salinity in roi namur island republic of the marshall islands their results indicated that after two days of seawater flooding the observed water salinity reaches to seawater concentration but after ten days it considerably decreased the undesirable effects on the potable water supply of groundwater lasted for 660 days post and houben 2017 studied on the role of density driven fingering mixing of swi and the sequestration of solutes into the deeper part of a sand aquifer on the island of baltrum their results showed that the vertical flow downwards had slowed down over time due to mixing and a decreasing density contrast giambastiani et al 2017 evaluated the impacts of storm events on an unconfined coastal aquifer in ravenna southern po delta italy this study showed that increase of the hydraulic head can lead to a decrease in groundwater salinity and pore water salinity due to rainfall infiltration during the 2 day storm event the observation wells near the coastline recorded a temporary increase in salinity of water due to ocean surge inundation 2 3 tidal fluctuation and storm surge yang et al 2013 and huizer et al 2017 considered the tidal fluctuation and storm surge impacts on real coastal aquifers yang et al 2013 simulated the flow and transport in response to tidal activities and storm surge on a homogeneous aquifer in near bremerhaven germany their results showed that tidal fluctuation causes to the formation of the recirculating zone in the intertidal zone their storm surge simulation results also demonstrated that overtopping seawater penetrates into the aquifer and takes about 10 years for recover groundwater to be suitable for potable water huizer et al 2017 used the measurement method and numerical modeling to assessed tides and storm surges impacts on lsi and swi in a multi layer coastal aquifer in netherlands they found that wave run up and morphological changes have a significant impact on lsi in low lying lands and can be affect the fresh groundwater resources 2 4 storm surge and slr quantification of both storm surge and sea level rise impacts on swi were assessed in a limited number of studies such as chui and terry 2013 yang et al 2015 and mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 the saline damage caused by storm surge and the recovery of the fresh groundwater lens after slr was investigated by chui and terry 2013 their results showed that if the water table was affected by slr the impact of groundwater salinity due to storm surge would be less than at under the current sea level position no slr yang et al 2015 assessed storm surge and slr impacts for an aquifer consisting of six different zones of hydraulic conductivity at the north german coast in this study about 1250 m intrusion of seawater was observed due to slr of 1 m their storm surge simulation results showed that seawater fingers were penetrates into the aquifer below the flooded land surface it takes about 4 years for groundwater to eliminate the seawater fingers and to be suitable for potable use this study also highlighted that seawater fingers and the fate of the plumes of seawater depend on the heterogeneity properties of aquifer chui and terry 2015 and yu et al 2016 found that the topographic depression has a significant impact on groundwater salinity due to storm surges mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 arrived at a similar conclusion they showed that the topographic depression has a significant impact on the swi volume due to storm surge in the short term while in the long term the existence of topographic depression enlarged the swi volume in comparison with that of no topographic depression 2 5 heterogeneity although the geological properties of the aquifer are generally heterogeneous consideration of a homogeneous system has been a typical assumption in many previous studies e g yang et al 2013 chesnaux 2015 yu et al 2016 mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 some studies considered the heterogeneity properties of coastal aquifers as two layer systems e g chui and terry 2013 chui and terry 2015 post and houben 2017 and multi layer systems e g yang et al 2015 huizer et al 2017 gingerich et al 2017 kerrou and renard 2010 li et al 2016 pool et al 2015 michael et al 2016 siena and riva 2017 and houben et al 2018 are among a few studies to consider the aquifer geological properties as fully heterogeneous systems kerrou and renard 2010 investigated the impacts of dimensionality and heterogeneity on swi in a hypothetical aquifer they showed that the behavior of the seawater interface is different in 2d and 3d models the seawater toe location is controlled by the horizontal effective hydraulic conductivity and longitudinal and transverse dispersivity similarly the analyses of abarca et al 2007 in 2d case can be noted in these studies the impacts of tidal fluctuations slr and storm surge were not considered as for 2d numerical models abarca et al 2007 kerrou and renard 2010 and michael et al 2016 showed that increasing heterogeneity causes enlarging the width of the mixing zone and decrease in seawater toe location in 3d numerical models kerrou and renard 2010 and pool et al 2015 found that when heterogeneity increases toe location of seawater increases siena and riva 2018 assessed the combined effects of aquifer heterogeneity and pumping operations on swi in argentona river basin spain in 3d numerical model their results indicated that heterogeneity affects the seawater interface with and without pumping scenarios by reducing the seawater toe location and widening the mixing zone as concluding remarks there have been investigations that considered the heterogeneity of aquifer and its effects on swi with different objectives there has been however a limited number of studies such as chui and terry 2013 and yang et al 2015 that both storm surge and slr impacts on swi in a heterogeneous aquifer were assessed in the studies of chui and terry 2013 and yang et al 2015 the heterogeneity of aquifers was considered as a two layer and a multi zone media with different values of hydraulic conductivity the contribution of this paper is to consider the fully heterogeneity in the hydraulic conductivity field and quantify its impact in combination with the influences of storm surge and slr on swi 3 methods and materials 3 1 problem statement in order to evaluate the effect of heterogeneity a spherical correlation function in a 2d unconfined aquifer domain is employed this will allow to overcome the complexity of a medium by generating different realization of randomly distribution hydraulic conductivity fig 2 shows a selected fully geological heterogeneous realization of 50 log normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity the log normal hydraulic conductivity fields are characterized by their mean variance and directional correlation lengths in two spatial dimensions as presented in this figure the boundary condition used at seaside boundary is seawater pressure with fixed salinity the inland boundary is regional freshwater inflow newman boundary the outflow is freshwater discharge to sea which includes the regional flux entering from inland boundary and the recharge from land surface also a no flow boundary is assumed at the bottom surface of the aquifer the discretization of the problem domain consists of a grid of 38 544 quadrilateral finite elements 39 071 nodes the horizontal size of the grid changes from 1 m 250 m near to seaside boundary to 4 m 250 m to 100 m also the vertical direction size of the grid varies between 0 15 and 0 57 m the effect of different discretization schemes i e finer and coarser discretization was considered to find the most suitable nodes ketabchi et al 2016a the selected discretization satisfies the grid peclet number as the spatial stability criterion voss and souza 1987 voss and provost 2010 1 p e q f δ

presented in table 2 as shown in this table numerical modeling adopted a molecular diffusivity of 1 48 10 9 m 2 s 1 also longitudinal and transverse dispersivity is considered 1 m and 0 1 m respectively as suggested by ketabchi et al 2016a the spatial discretization and velocities support the courant number to be less than 0 75 which ensures the selected temporal discretization voss and souza 1987 voss and provost 2010 3 2 numerical modeling in this study a series of 50 log normally distributed fully hydraulic conductivity fields with a spherical correlation function is generated using gcosim3d code gomez hernandez and journel 1992 numerical simulations of transient saturated unsaturated variable density flow and solute transport code sutra voss and provost 2010 are carried out within a stochastic monte carlo simulation the fluid mass balance and the solute mass balance equations are solved simultaneously to characterize variable density flow associated with swi the fluid mass balance equation demonstrates the single phase flow in saturated and unsaturated porous media and the solute mass balance equation describes the solute transport including advection and dispersion mechanisms voss and provost 2010 table 3 presents the characteristics of simulation model including the simulation setup spatial and the temporal discretization and boundary conditions which are adopted from ketabchi et al 2016a 3 3 description of indices the effects of heterogeneity on swi status are assessed by comparing the results of all monte carlo simulations versus those obtained for a homogeneous aquifer the seawater toe location x toe the mixing volume v mv and the swi volume v swiv are indices which are considered to assess the vulnerability of fresh groundwater of aquifer x toe is the length of seawater along the aquifer basement and is calculated using 50 of salinity concentration v mv and v swiv are a percentage of the occupied volume of aquifer including the groundwater with the salinity concentration between 5 and 95 as well as greater than 50 of the maximum salinity concentration respectively the results discussed in the following sections are organized based on dimensionless parameters dimensionless assessments allow generalization of the results to other cases with different parameters similar to kerrou and renard 2010 ketabchi et al 2016a 2016b

numerical simulations in the numerical assessments both instantaneous slr of 1 m and gradual slr 10 mm yr for 100 years similar to the approach adopted by e g morgan et al 2015 and ketabchi et al 2016a are taken into account the land surface slope of the aquifer and lsi caused by slr is also incorporated it is assumed that a storm surge of 3 m similar to anderson and lauer 2008 and mahmoodzadeh and karamouz 2017 has occurred during the 2 days and seawater which inundates the land surface infiltrates into the aquifer it is also assumed that the topographic depression completely filled by seawater during 30 days after the storm surge event abbreviation terms for the scenarios are noted in table 4 and are used in the following sections base case scenarios i e hom and het scenarios show the conditions with no coastal flooding 4 results and discussion 4 1 impact on the seawater toe location the 5 50 and 95 seawater interface of the steady state salinity distributions for the homogeneous dash and solid lines and the heterogeneous gray bounds scenarios are shown in fig 3 given the assumption of a homogeneous aquifer the x toe reaches to about 409 0 m x toe 0 409 while for the heterogeneous aquifer it varies between 183 1 m and 479 0 m x toe 0 183 0 479 these findings support the numerical results compared to the results of kerrou and renard 2010 that found smaller values for x toe while increasing heterogeneity the value of x toe het is obtained 0 308 which is smaller than x toe hom of 0 409 table 5 summarized x toe after 100 years t 71 22 simulations under gslr and islr scenarios for the homogeneous aquifer x toe has smaller values in gslr scenarios compared to islr scenarios these results confirm the findings of mehdizadeh et al 2017 that the gslr has smaller swi than islr since the assumption of gslr is more realistic when the heterogeneous aquifer is used for het gslr scenarios x toe has smaller values compared to het islr ones when we compare the values of x toe het with the values of x toe hom in both gslr and islr scenarios heterogeneity has a smaller influence on the estimated swi fig 4 shows the 50 seawater interface under a storm surge event and both storm surge and slr scenarios in this figure the x toe is shown by comparing the results of all monte carlo simulations gray bound versus those obtained for the homogeneous aquifer solid line the results highlight that under both storm surge and slr conditions a more significant swi occurs in comparison to the conditions in which only storm surge event is used under homss islr scenario a more significant swi is experienced than the homss gslr scenario see table 6 also the results indicate that the heterogeneity affects swi either in the presence or the absence of coastal flooding events by reducing x toe for instance under hetss scenario the x toe varies between 0 215 and 0 543 which shows that the value of x toe het is smaller than x toe hom this difference confirms the significant impact of heterogeneity on swi the detailed analyses of x toe are summarized in table 6 also in fig 5 the 5 and 95 seawater interfaces are shown for the defined scenarios for instance for t 16 425 16 428 16 47 and 71 22 as shown in these figures the impact of heterogeneity on swi is the same as the 50 seawater interface this is in comparison to those obtained under the homogeneous aquifers 4 2 impact on the swi volume the values of v swiv caused by a storm surge event and slr for the homogeneous and the heterogeneous aquifers are shown in fig 6 when the maximum values of v swiv are assessed it is recognized that increases are up to 53 32 for the homogeneous aquifer and they vary between 30 92 and 117 04 for the heterogeneous aquifer in comparison to those obtained under the base case condition this result shows that the storm surge has short term impact see fig 6a for the combined impacts of storm surge and gslr fig 6b the maximum values of the v swiv reaches to t 71 22 when the combined impacts of storm surge and islr are considered fig 6c the assessments show that v swiv is increased up to 214 30 for the homogeneous aquifer while it varies between 168 4 and 417 0 for the heterogeneous aquifer the results show that the value of v swiv het is smaller than v swiv hom also the storm surge has short term while slr has long term impact the detailed analysis for v swiv and coastal flooding effects are summarized in table 7 as seen in this table the corresponding t is reaching the maximum values of v swiv at 16 47 and 71 22 when the maximum values of the predicted v swiv is compared with the values of steady state v swiv up to 49 2 storm surge effect for the heterogeneous aquifer i e hetss scenario is observed for the homogeneous aquifer the storm surge effect on v swiv is estimated as 82 1 for the homss islr and hetss islr scenarios the storm surge effect is negligible for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers the volume of swi due to islr has more influence than gslr δ v swiv i e difference between steady state and t 16 425 of v swiv is estimated as 1 0 24 for hom islr and hom gslr scenarios respectively also δ v swiv is estimated as 0 41 0 56 for het gslr and 1 07 1 18 for het islr with the same conditions when aquifer is not affected by storm event and slr the value of v swiv is the same as steady state conditions as expected after a storm surge event t 16 428 seawater inundates the land surface and v swiv is increased see fig 4a when the homogeneous aquifer is considered δ v swiv is estimated to be 0 30 while for the heterogeneous aquifer δ v swiv is between 0 24 and 0 31 it is shown that the value of v wv het is less than v wv hom the combined impacts of storm surge and slr indicates that v swiv is increased δ v swiv is obtained 0 56 and 1 42 for homss gslr and homss islr respectively generally considering a storm surge event with gslr slightly reduces the impacts on v swiv compared to islr furthermore when the heterogeneous aquifer is considered δ v swiv varies between 1 37 and 1 43 for hetss islr and between 0 54 and 0 97 for hetss gslr it is shown that the value of v wv het is less than v wv hom for these scenarios after 30 days storm surge event t 16 47 v swiv is increased from land surface known as seawater fingers in previous studies such as yang et al 2015 and ketabchi et al 2016a under this condition seawater intrudes into the aquifer and the plumes of seawater migrate downwards from the land surface because of gravitational influence considering the homogeneous aquifer which is subjected to a storm surge δ v swiv is estimated to be 0 35 while for the heterogeneous aquifer it varies between 0 27 and 0 39 for homss slr which represents the combined impacts of storm surge and slr δ v swiv is estimated as 1 37 for homss islr and 0 54 for homss gslr when the heterogeneous aquifer is considered see table 8 the values of δ v swiv is smaller than that for homss slr scenarios as demonstrated in fig 4 and table 8 for t 17 02 31 years to 71 22 after 100 years δ v swiv is calculated for post storm surge results show that the storm surge has a short term impact on fresh groundwater and reduce effects of the freshwater quality similar results are obtained by illangasekare et al 2006 chui and terry 2013 yang et al 2015 and giambastiani et al 2017 they showed that during storm surge events seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to a temporary withdrawal of the freshwater the values of δ v swiv for the combined storm surge and slr scenarios are presented in table 8 these results show that about 1 year after a storm surge the highest impacts of a storm surge event on aquifer can be detected in other words in early times v swiv is significantly increased after that it is reduced and the aquifer would naturally return to its original state for t 71 22 plume of seawater caused by the storm surge is in most parts dominated in all cases heterogeneity leads to a smaller influence on v swiv the detailed analyses of δ v swiv are summarized in table 8 4 3 impact on the mixing volume the time series of v mv under homogenous and heterogeneous scenarios for one random realization of hydraulic conductivity are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively also the detailed analyses of v mv are summarized in table 9 results show that heterogeneity causes increase in v mv for instance the value of v mv is estimated to be 0 56 for homss scenario while for the hetss scenario v mv is between 0 55 and 1 15 at t 16 425 it is shown that the value of v mv het is more than v mv hom as shown in table 9 heterogeneity leads to a more significant impact on v mv which is in line with the previous finding of pool et al 2015 and michael et al 2016 it is also observed that vertical seawater fingers are developed as they intrude downwards during the 2 days post coastal flooding events followed by a period of merging with the underlying lateral swi the seawater fingers begin mixing with the freshwater and seawater wedge before reaching the aquifer bottom as shown in these figures below the inundated land surfaces the strength of freshwater is gradually reduced as a result of vertical flows induced by the fingers after about 10 years transient salinity fingers caused by lsi are almost completely eliminated the new mixing zone and swi status are created when the salinity fingers reach from the inundated land surface and are getting mixed with the horizontal swi 5 summary and conclusions in this study the swi status under flooding events are analyzed for a 2d heterogeneous coastal aquifer three indices including the seawater toe location x toe the mixing volume v mv and the swi volume v swiv are used to assess the vulnerability to the intrusion of seawater a series of 50 log normally distributed random hydraulic conductivity using the gcosim3d code and numerical simulations using sutra have been implemented in a stochastic monte carlo framework to understand how coastal flooding can change the groundwater salinity with and without geological heterogeneity assumptions the salinity distributions show that the impacts of a storm surge event could last up to about one year however transient salinity fingers from land surface could last for 10 years for both homogeneous and heterogeneous aquifers the storm surge has a short term impact on fresh groundwater results show that during storm surge events seawater penetrates into the aquifer and leads to a temporary withdrawal of the freshwater that could last for a year smaller x toe is expected with increasing heterogeneity an increased dispersion due to heterogeneity leads to a decreasing density contrast and therefore a smaller seawater toe length also comparing gslr scenarios with islr scenarios shows that in gslr scenarios swi is smaller than that for islr scenarios heterogeneity leads to a smaller influence on the swi volume results also show that for all defined scenarios heterogeneity causes increase in the mixing volume in all cases heterogeneity shows more impact on the mixing volume which is in line with the previous results that heterogeneity causes the enlargement of the area of mixing zone this study could be a basis for implementation of real world cases in coastal areas in order to better manage the fresh groundwater aquifers and to better the assess of swi in coastal ecosystems 6 declarations of interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to thank dr zahra zahmatkesh postdoctoral researcher at mcmaster

6873,water inrush incidents threaten the safety of coal mining understanding of hydrogeologic parameter distributions is critical for preventing water related hazards in coal mines during the deep mining 1000 m under the north china plain water from water bearing strata discharges into coal seams through geologic conduits i e water inrush due to the fractured zone under the floor of working faces in this study a water inrush incident was exploited as an active stimulus a 3d groundwater flow model was built for the eighth member of the middle ordovician system in xingdong coal mine using this model and an inverse approach we first checked if the data from the incident and an independent pumping test carry non redundant information about the heterogeneity of the mine afterward we combined these datasets to conduct a large scale approximately 10 km hydraulic tomography ht analysis the estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution from the ht analysis is found consistent with the distribution of known geologic faults that is a cluster of faults is characterized as a high conductivity zone a high conductivity zone is identified at locations close to the water inrush location which is the high cement consumption zone during the grouting project finally results of this study promote exploiting the water inrush events as a ht survey for mapping geologic structures over a large area keywords hydraulic tomography pumping test water inrush incident 1 introduction china continues to rely on coal for about 69 6 of its energy yearbook china statistical 2017 therefore coal production is of vital importance for china s economy and development the increasing coal extraction depth results in significant increase of water pressure and groundwater inrush incidents from underlying aquifers which could lead to disastrous consequences vutukuri and singh 1995 zhou 1997 wu et al 2004 zhang 2005 klose 2007 among the reported incidents in china more than 90 are related to limestone aquifers especially the ordovician limestone aquifers shi and singh 2001 a featured aquifer under coal seams in the north china plain wu and wang 2006 for the past decades engineering measures including depressurization grouting backfill mining etc have been used to prevent these inrush incidents in coal mines and tunneling projects gao and shi 1999 sui et al 2011 in principle these measures involve pumping water out from the high pressure confining aquifers to reduce the pressure or the sealing water conducting channels nevertheless a detailed characterization of hydraulic parameters is crucial for the successful applications of these engineering measures as well as for the safe mining due to the presence of fractures faults and karst conduits limestone aquifers are highly heterogeneous and hydrological characterization of limestone aquifers are challenging teutsch 1993 scanlon et al 2003 illman and hughson 2005 in order to face the challenge audouin and bodin 2008 employed cross well slug interference tests to identify the channels and fracture flow paths of a karstic limestone aquifer robert et al 2012 applied electrical resistivity tomography to detect preferential flow paths these techniques work well for delineations in small scales based on the recent advances in aquifer characterization technologies illman 2006 proposed the application of hydraulic tomography ht to characterize aquifers with preferential flow channels ht yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 mao et al 2016 is a recently developed and matured technology for characterizing aquifer at high resolutions it employs a series of interference tests to stimulate aquifers by pumping water from or injecting water into a well while monitoring the aquifer s responses in other wells by stressing the aquifers at different locations non redundant information about the distribution of aquifer parameters oliver 1993 mao et al 2013a can be obtained over the past decades this technology has proven to be robust and flexible in dealing with different types of applications for examples sharmeen et al 2012 proved its effectiveness in delineating micro fractures in a laboratory experiment lee and kitanidis 2014 applied ht for joint inversion of hydraulic head and tracer data illman et al 2009 and zha et al 2017 successfully applied ht to map fractures and faults over kilometer scale granite geologic formations for increasing the resolution of the characterization of fracture distribution zha et al 2014 included flux data in the ht survey zhao and illman 2017 2018 and zha et al 2017 included prior geologic information in ht analysis soueid ahmed et al 2015 applied an image guided method to include structure information ht has also been verified at different scales for examples zhao et al 2015 used it to delineate the heterogeneity of unconfined aquifers in a laboratory sandbox 2 4 m 1 2 m in a small scale field test described in brauchler et al 2011 the hydraulic parameters of a field site 5 m 5 m 2 m were estimated straface et al 2007 employed ht to obtain the transmissivity and storativity for a confined aquifer 100 m 100 m illman et al 2009 explored ht to characterize a large scale granite fractured aquifer successfully 884 m 392 m 1054 m yeh et al 2009 used synthetic examples to promote river stage tomography with river stage acting as a driving force for characterizing a groundwater basin 130 km 130 km wang et al 2017 utilized this river stage tomography concept to obtain the diffusivity of an 1800 km2 basin but was unable to retrieve hydraulic conductivity and specific storage separately due to the ill defined problems mao et al 2013c the lack of large scale stimuli constrains the usage of ht on the other hand integration of different types of information may advance the development of tomographic surveys research as advocated by yeh et al 2008 taking advantage of the natural stimuli for conducting basin scale hydraulic tomography tests is the future of the subsurface science the purpose of this study was to map the distribution of hydrogeologic properties of the eighth member of the deep ordovician limestone aquifers in xingdong coal mine crucial hydrogeologic information was acquired for safe mining and future grouting projects for this purpose we innovatively exploited data collected during water inrush incidents in the coal mine and combined it with one traditional pumping test to perform a large scale ht test approximately 10 km to reveal the geologic structure of the coal mine 2 site description 2 1 site location xingdong coal mine is located 4 km northeast of xingtai city fig 1 the ground elevation is 55 65 m above the sea level geographically it belongs to the north china plain which is one of the main coal production regions in china approximately 70 of all the identified coal resources in china are deposited under the north china plain xingdong coal mine has an administration range of 3 4 km 3 8 km 14 5 km2 in total area the coal mine was planned and undergone geologic investigations in 1998 and started mining operation in november 2001 with an estimated annual coal production 600 000 tons the current mining area is bounded by faults f1 f2 f19 and f30 in four directions as shown in fig 1 the coalfield in the north of fault f19 is reserved for future exploration 2 2 geology background the stratigraphy of the mine consists of ordovician o carboniferous o permian p triassic t and quaternary q systems sequentially cretaceous strata k only exist in the southeast corner of the coalfield two cross sections of the mine area are shown in fig 2 indicating that the inclined strata strike nw with a low dip angle 10 15 dipping ne the depth of 2 coal seam floors extends from 420 m in the west to 980 m in the east part of the coalfield resulting in a higher confining pressure in the ordovician strata in the east part middle ordovician strata are the main water yielding layers possessing threats to deep mining activities the strata have an average thickness of 545 m consisting of three formations xiamajiagou formation o2x shangmajiagou formation o2s and fengfeng formation o2f from bottom to top in sequence fengfeng formation with a thickness of 150 m is the research target of this study which has the shortest distance to the 2 coal seam this formation can be further divided into two members the seventh member o2f 1 with an average thickness of 50 m varying from 40 m to 69 m and the eighth member o2f 2 with an average thickness of 100 m varying from 70 m to 130 m o2f 1 is mainly comprised of clayey breccia and dolomitic breccia and is considered as an aquitard hydrogeologically while o2f 2 is a relative pure limestone unit consisting of thick dark gray limestone and thin brecciated limestone this member of middle ordovician strata is the main water bearing aquifer that threats the safety of the 2 coal seam borehole drilling reveals that the water level in o2f 2 is only dozens of meters below the land surface for example before the pumping test conducted in well d1 the water level in well d3 is 25 9 m about sea level this leads to a confining pressure of 13 35 mpa an equivalent of 1362 m water column calculated from the top of the o2f 2 layer the permian and carboniferous strata are the main coal bearing formations there are 15 layers of coal seams in total but only six layers are suitable for mining at present 2 coal seam is the production seam with a thickness of 4 0 4 6 m the floor of 2 coal seam is about 85 263 m an average thickness of 157 m above the water bearing ordovician majiagou formation including members o2x and o2s in between the majiagou formation and the 2 coal seam there are several layers of aquitards and less developed aquifers acting as a buffer zone preventing water inrushes from the middle ordovician system comparing with the ordovician strata the contribution of these less developed aquifers to water inrush incidents were negligible even though there is a buffer zone between the 2 coal seam and the middle ordovician system the presence of localized flow channels such as fractures or high permeability zone could result in a direct discharge of ordovician water to working faces out of the four possible flow channels summarized by wu and wang 2006 faults or fracture zones are considered as potential hydraulic paths in xingdong coalfield in xingdong coalfield there are 243 faults revealed from extensive geologic surveys borehole drillings and geophysical surveys all the faults are normal faults with a high dip angle 50 65 see figs 1 and 2 for an illustration of the major faults 55 of the faults have drop distances less than 5 m and 5 20 m for 20 faults while the drop distance of the rest faults is more than 20 m the faults strike direction in this area is generally nne ne dipping se 2 3 monitoring boreholes observation wells were drilled to monitor the water level variations in the o2f 2 layer in this study seven observation wells were employed i e d1 d3 d4 d5 d6 d9 and d11 covering the boundaries of the current mining area fig 1 they were installed as long term water level monitoring wells for mining safety no observation wells were installed inside mining area due to safety consideration because of their potential as conduits between aquifers and coal seams these seven wells all fully penetrated into the eighth member of the fengfeng formation o2f 2 and partially penetrate into the seventh member o2f 1 table 1 all the wells were cased from the land surface to the top of o2f 2 layer and the rest was left as unscreened open boreholes their fluctuations represent the depth averaged head response in the eighth member o2f 2 layer 3 water inrush incidents 3 1 water inrush water inrush incidents in china have recorded a maximum water inflow of 2053 m3 min zhang et al 1997 as discussed by zhang 2005 several factors control and influence the occurrence of water inrushes including strata pressures geologic structures mining sizes and water pressures previous geologic surveys indicated that water pressures and geologic structures are the most important factors affecting the water inrushes in xingdong coal mine the ordovician limestone is a confined aquifer with a high water pressure while there are strata between coal seams and the aquifer to prevent water from lower aquifers a fractured damage zone may occur below the floor of the coal seam extending dozens of meters due to mining induced strata failures during mining zhang 2005 as a result a large amount of groundwater could discharge into the working face when the water pressure is greater than the strength of the coal seam floor if there are geologic structures such as water conducting faults close to the damaged zone the high pressure groundwater can break through the coal seam floors more easily shortening the distance between the aquifer and the coal seam see fig 3 for an illustration therefore the water inrush incident on the mining floor with conductive channels presents a significant threat to the mining safety 3 2 grouting project design grouting is an effective way to cut off the flow paths to coal mines li and zhou 2006 grouting materials are injected into the target geologic stratum filling the fractures and pore spaces and replacing water in voids with the grout material after the water inrush incident at location w1 a grouting project targeting o2f 2 strata was initiated to avoid further hazards one vertical borehole was drilled as the main operation borehole a series of parallel directional boreholes were then drilled spreading into the ordovician limestone at depths between 70 m and 90 m below the top of o2f 2 strata the distance between every two parallel boreholes was set to be 70 m based on experience which will ensure a continuous curtain different colors of the parallel boreholes represent different stages of the grouting projects fig 4 a cement and water with a mass ratio 1 3 was mixed for injection the cement slurry was injected while drilling and the weight of cement consumption was recorded wherever the slurry could be injected a total of 17 105 tons of cement were consumed during this project the cement consumption recording locations as well as major faults are shown in fig 4b the solid frame in fig 4b outlines the influence area of this grouting project approximately 1 1 km 2 1 km 4 hydraulic tomography most faults in this mine have high angles and therefore they could be treated as vertically conductive channels the water inrush incident is therefore merely as a pumping test where the pumping well is fully screened through the o2f 2 layer with such conceptualization water inrush incidents could be jointly analyzed with traditional pumping tests conducted in the o2f 2 layer to perform a tomographic survey consequently we combine one pumping test and one water inrush incident to characterize the coal mine the hydraulic tomography algorithm simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle xiang et al 2009 mao et al 2013b was adopted to interpret the head responses from these two datasets the groundwater flow model was implemented with finite element code vsaft3 srivastava and yeh 1992 4 1 inversion algorithm description here we briefly discuss the main elements of simsle during simsle estimation process the head responses from all the interference tests are incorporated into the algorithm simultaneously there is no need to evaluate the effect of data incorporating sequence on the estimated parameters simsle starts with cokriging interpolation to obtain an initial estimate of hydraulic parameter distribution by comparing the difference between simulated and observed head responses the parameters are updated successively by the successive linear estimator yeh et al 1996 which considers the covariance of the hydraulic parameters and cross covariance between the head and the parameter during the update the covariance function of the parameters is also revised to reflect the gain of additional information about the parameter in each iteration therefore at the end of the estimation the diagonal elements of the updated covariances i e residual variances can be employed to represent the uncertainty of estimated parameters 4 2 drawdown data one pumping test conducted in well d5 and one water inrush incident occurred at location w1 were included in the hydraulic tomography test the depth averaged head responses in the eighth member of fengfeng formation o2f2 were recorded during both the pumping test and the water inrush incident the pumping test began on 18 january 2014 and lasted until 25 january 2014 the pumping rate started at 800 m3 day and decreased to 600 m3 day after two days till the end of the test hydraulic heads were monitored every 30 min in five wells d1 d4 d6 d9 and d11 pumping rate was measured every 30 min as well the water inrush incident at location w1 occurred on 1 march 2015 during the coal mining at working face 2222 of the 2 coal seam inrush location w1 is close to fault f22 fig 1 with an initial rate of 10 m3 h it quickly increased to 100 m3 h in a few hours as one of the emergency responses the discharge was pumped out from the working face to avoid further damages the inrush rate was measured based on this emergency pumping rate this incident lasted for about one year with a gradual decrease of discharge rate due to grouting for this study the data from the first seven days were utilized considering that the dataset from such a short duration will be less influenced by the boundaries during the incident the hydraulic head response in six wells d1 d3 d4 d5 d9 and d11 and the discharge rate were monitored every eight hours the hourly atmospheric pressure was recorded in the nearest weather station located in ren county 12 km east of xingdong coal mine and its influence was removed from recorded hydraulic head data for hydraulic tomography inversion both the head response from the pumping test and the water inrush incident and discharge rate were averaged every 0 5 days see fig 5 due to the large drop of hydraulic head in well d9 during the water inrush incident it was plotted separately in fig 5c in total there are 70 drawdown records from the five observation wells in the pumping test and 84 drawdown data from the six observation wells in the water inrush incident because the number of observation wells is limited all drawdown data were used for inversion and there were no data reserved for validation 4 3 numerical model setup with the depth averaged hydraulic head responses in the eighth member o2f2 of fengfeng formation a 3d groundwater flow model was built it had dimensions 15 km 20 km in x and y directions with 100 m in the z direction which was determined by the thickness of the o2f2 layer this simulation domain encompasses both coal mine and grouting project influence area fig 6 the right boundary was only 500 m to the right of the well d9 which was determined by fault f2 the impact of this impermeable boundary is discussed in section 6 1 considering only seven observation wells and two discharge events are available we expect that the ht can only reveal large scale hydrogeologic features therefore relative large elements were used in this analysis the numerical domain was discretized into 7500 elements with element dimensions 200 m 200 m 100 m the top bottom and left boundaries were assigned with constant total head 1000 m and the right boundary was zero flux due to the impermeable nature of the f2 fault an initial total head of 1000 m was used as for the input parameters required by simsle 1000 m and 1000 m were used for the correlation scales in x and y directions the variance of ln k and ln ss is set as 0 3 the initial mean of k and ss were obtained by running an estimation with the forward model vsaft3 and pest doherty 2011 the initial mean of k is 1 5 m day and the uncertainty is indicated by 95 confidence interval which has an upper limit of 1 8 m day and a lower limit of 1 25 m day for ss the estimated mean is 5 10 5 m with an upper limit of 6 1 10 5 m and a lower limit 4 1 10 5 m due to the limited heterogeneity information about the deep o2f2 layer different values of correlation scales and variance magnitudes were tested in inversion it is found that they did not change significantly the estimated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage distributions this corroborates the conclusion from yeh and liu 2000 that these input parameters have minor impacts on the pattern of the estimated parameters when sufficient hydraulic head data are available the pattern of the estimated parameters will ultimately be conditioned by the head responses from the seven observation wells and therefore only the inversion results from the above mentioned input parameters were presented 5 results with two datasets from the pumping test in well d5 and the water inrush incident at location w1 three inversion scenarios were attempted the first two scenarios invert the two datasets independently and the third scenario uses the two datasets as a hydraulic tomography by running two datasets independently we investigated the feasibility of treating water inrush incident as a pumping test for all the three scenarios only part of the numerical domain was illustrated because the estimated parameter values at the rest of the domain were close to their initial uniform values with head responses only from the pumping test in well d5 a less conductive region is unveiled adjacent to the six wells which is surrounded by a conductive structure the conductive structure forms a c shape on the west of the well d11 fig 7 on the other hand there are no major patterns in the estimated specific storage distribution except a high storage region close to the pumping well d5 as shown by the middle column of fig 7 the water inrush incident reveals a less conductive region to the north of inrush location w1 and a conductive region to the south of location w1 however there is not noticeable heterogeneity present in the west of well d5 with the largest drawdown in well d9 among all wells during the incident this head response yielded a relative conductive channel between well d9 and inrush location w1 and a low storage specific region around well d9 there is also a high storage specific region around well d3 while these two tests revealed different heterogeneity distributions similarities between them do exist the conductive region south of water inrush location w1 is an extension of the conductive part of c shape from the inversion of the pumping test data in well d5 more details are found using the data from the inrush incident about the low conductive region surrounded by the c shape the similarities and differences shared by these two tests ultimately suggest that the data from the two events carry non redundant information about the heterogeneity in this area thus it is useful to combine the pumping test with the water inrush incident as a hydraulic tomography survey the inversion results are shown in the right column of fig 7 the features identified by the two independently inversions now are assimilated for example the conductive region identified from the water inrush incident now connects with the c shape structure discovered by the pumping test the less conductive region merges with each other as well however the result of ht analysis indicates that there are no major structures in the estimated specific storage field fig 8 shows the residual covariance distributions corresponding to these three different scenarios which indicate the uncertainty of the estimates a low uncertainty area implies that great hydraulic parameter information gained from the tests and our confidence is high about the estimated parameters in these areas when combining these two tests we see a merge of low residual covariance areas from these two tests the last column of fig 8 the low residual covariance areas expand to the outskirt of the seven well cluster and away from the cluster the residual variance remains as the initial variance 0 3 in other words the estimated parameter distributions from this inversion are likely representative of the true field inside the well cluster the comparison between observed and simulated drawdowns are also shown in fig 9 in general most of the 11 datasets agree with the observed drawdowns reasonably especially the five datasets during the pumping test in well d5 for the water inrush incident the head response in observation well d9 is well reproduced based on the estimated parameter distributions however at the late period of the observation wells d1 d3 d5 and d11 simulated drawdowns are higher than the observed data this hints that after the initial discharge of water from the underlying aquifer there may be a slight change of water inrush channels 6 assessment of inversion results 6 1 effect of boundary conditions a larger numerical domain 15 km 20 km than xingdong coal mine was set to minimize the impact of boundary conditions during both forward and inverse simulations a no flux boundary was set on the right side which is only 500 m away from well d9 the no flux condition was determined by the known fault f2 however fault f2 is not strictly vertically distributed and connected with fault f30 at the bottom which goes left at the location close to well d3 in order to evaluate the effect of the right boundary the no flux boundary assignment was then removed the right boundary was extended for another 5 km and was set as constant head type fig 10 is the estimation results under the extended domain and the dashed lines indicate the locations of the original no flux boundary comparing with the results in the last column of fig 7 there are no significant changes for regions close to the dashed lines the pattern of the estimated parameters is mainly dictated by the observed head responses the low conductivity region in the expanded domain with a constant head assignment supports the impermeable nature of fault f2 this is consistent with the finding by sun et al 2013 that the estimated hydraulic conductivity could indicate the information about boundary types if the boundary condition is wrongly assigned 6 2 grouting records verification fig 11 a and b are the estimated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage distributions around the areas influenced by the grouting project fig 11c is the contour map of the amount of cement consumption interpolated from all the recording locations and the black dots in fig 11c are the recording locations the solid frames in fig 11 represents the scope of the grouting project during the grouting project with the directional boreholes going 70 90 m below the surface of o2f 2 strata the cement goes into the pores of the aquifer the amount of injected cement indicates the volume of pore space that the boreholes encounter and to some extent it reflects the conductivity of the aquifer fig 11b by comparing the contour patterns not the specific storage in the current project when comparing fig 11a and c we observe a clear feature more cement was consumed in the bottom right and less cement is used in the top part and a relative increase of cement consumption right below this top part the pattern is similar to the distribution of hydraulic conductivity however there are more variations in cement consumption than the estimated hydraulic conductivity this is because of the scale differences between the grouting project and the hydraulic tomography test we do not expect a high similarity between the depth averaged hydraulic conductivity and cement consumption along one horizontal level the purpose of this comparison is to show the amount of cement is related to the pattern of hydraulic conductivity in turn more attention is needed on the high conductive zone located at the bottom part of fig 11 for future grouting project 6 3 fault distributions verification in this section the estimated parameter distributions are compared with fault information collected at xingdong coal mine miao et al 2014 as suggested by zha et al 2016 ht is another way to map faults and is complementary to geological surveys the estimated parameters overlay with the major faults in the coalfield fig 12 as shown in the figure the conductive zone located south of the water inrush location w1 agrees with a cluster of faults another conductive zone is located to the left of fault f1 which was identified as a conductive fault during the geologic survey on the other hand f19 was thought of as a conductive fault however the inverted hydraulic conductivity shows that it is less conductive compared with the above two conductive zones it may be because that damage zone of the fault is not significant or the fracture zones are filled with fault gouges and consequently are not as conductive as one expected non conductive fault f2 has already been well determined by the geologic survey the inverted low conductivity located close to f2 and across f2 shows the impermeable nature of this fault is well included in the hydraulic head responses f30 was treated as a non permeable boundary in the geologic survey however it is blurred with the estimated conductive zone this can be explained by the inadequate observation wells in this region more observation wells are needed to further condition the hydraulic properties of fault f30 for specific storage the low storage region coincides with fault f2 this low storage region coexists with the less conductive region the two high storage regions only concentrate around the pumping well d5 and the water inrush location w1 and these two regions have a high conductivity value this pattern is the opposite of the finding by illman et al 2009 in japan mizunami site 7 discussion and conclusions by combining the traditional pumping test and the water inrush incident in xingdong the parameters estimated from the hydraulic tomography test is in general consistent with the local fault distributions and the cement consumption data the assumption of treating water inrush incidents as pumping tests was verified by comparing the pattern of the estimated parameters with the result from the traditional pumping test these findings promote the usage of this type of stimulus in a large scale hydraulic tomography test as advocated by yeh et al 2008 the verifications providing us with further confidence in the validity of our results the results from the aforementioned approaches of evaluating estimated results are encouraging more rigorous and quantitative means to evaluate the estimated parameter distributions are necessary such as to test the predictability of head responses using the estimated parameter fields under different flow scenarios liu et al 2007 in the current application only two tests were employed in the analysis this yield low resolution map about major geologic information but with more tests one should be able to obtain higher resolution information illman et al 2009 zha et al 2017 the target aquifer of o2f 2 strata is not perfectly flat and its continuation is interrupted by geologic faults fig 2 our assumption of a perfect flat aquifer with 100 m in thickness likely yields some incorrect estimates secondly treating the seventh member o2f 1 strata as an aquitard was based on a limited number of boreholes in addition there may be a connection between eighth member o2f 2 aquifer and deeper members in the middle ordovician strata and these were not considered in the current model configuration our assumptions are necessary to conduct a quantitative analysis some major conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 to the best of our knowledge it is the first ht test to combine a traditional pumping test and a water inrush incident the estimated results are encouraging the large scale hydraulic tomography test approximately 10 km propels us to advance hydraulic tomography technology into more innovative applications 2 the water inrush incident on the coal seam floor is treated as a pumping test water discharge into the coal seam is assumed as a pumping test from the underlying aquifer o2f 2 layer through conductive channels this assumption is verified by the pattern of the inverted parameters from an independent pumping test conducted in a different location of the same aquifer 3 the hydraulic conductivity distribution is in general consistent with the cement consumption in the grouting project the conductive zone is related to the high cement consumption zone at the bottom of the grouting project and the less conductive zone is well linked to a low consumption zone the estimated hydraulic parameters can be furthered employed to guide the design of future grouting projects 4 the inversion results from the ht test agree with major faults distribution in this coal field the high conductive zone overlays with a fault cluster in the south of the well cluster the identified impermeable fault f2 is well characterized by a low conductive and small storage zone acknowledgements the first author would like

6873,water inrush incidents threaten the safety of coal mining understanding of hydrogeologic parameter distributions is critical for preventing water related hazards in coal mines during the deep mining 1000 m under the north china plain water from water bearing strata discharges into coal seams through geologic conduits i e water inrush due to the fractured zone under the floor of working faces in this study a water inrush incident was exploited as an active stimulus a 3d groundwater flow model was built for the eighth member of the middle ordovician system in xingdong coal mine using this model and an inverse approach we first checked if the data from the incident and an independent pumping test carry non redundant information about the heterogeneity of the mine afterward we combined these datasets to conduct a large scale approximately 10 km hydraulic tomography ht analysis the estimated hydraulic conductivity distribution from the ht analysis is found consistent with the distribution of known geologic faults that is a cluster of faults is characterized as a high conductivity zone a high conductivity zone is identified at locations close to the water inrush location which is the high cement consumption zone during the grouting project finally results of this study promote exploiting the water inrush events as a ht survey for mapping geologic structures over a large area keywords hydraulic tomography pumping test water inrush incident 1 introduction china continues to rely on coal for about 69 6 of its energy yearbook china statistical 2017 therefore coal production is of vital importance for china s economy and development the increasing coal extraction depth results in significant increase of water pressure and groundwater inrush incidents from underlying aquifers which could lead to disastrous consequences vutukuri and singh 1995 zhou 1997 wu et al 2004 zhang 2005 klose 2007 among the reported incidents in china more than 90 are related to limestone aquifers especially the ordovician limestone aquifers shi and singh 2001 a featured aquifer under coal seams in the north china plain wu and wang 2006 for the past decades engineering measures including depressurization grouting backfill mining etc have been used to prevent these inrush incidents in coal mines and tunneling projects gao and shi 1999 sui et al 2011 in principle these measures involve pumping water out from the high pressure confining aquifers to reduce the pressure or the sealing water conducting channels nevertheless a detailed characterization of hydraulic parameters is crucial for the successful applications of these engineering measures as well as for the safe mining due to the presence of fractures faults and karst conduits limestone aquifers are highly heterogeneous and hydrological characterization of limestone aquifers are challenging teutsch 1993 scanlon et al 2003 illman and hughson 2005 in order to face the challenge audouin and bodin 2008 employed cross well slug interference tests to identify the channels and fracture flow paths of a karstic limestone aquifer robert et al 2012 applied electrical resistivity tomography to detect preferential flow paths these techniques work well for delineations in small scales based on the recent advances in aquifer characterization technologies illman 2006 proposed the application of hydraulic tomography ht to characterize aquifers with preferential flow channels ht yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 mao et al 2016 is a recently developed and matured technology for characterizing aquifer at high resolutions it employs a series of interference tests to stimulate aquifers by pumping water from or injecting water into a well while monitoring the aquifer s responses in other wells by stressing the aquifers at different locations non redundant information about the distribution of aquifer parameters oliver 1993 mao et al 2013a can be obtained over the past decades this technology has proven to be robust and flexible in dealing with different types of applications for examples sharmeen et al 2012 proved its effectiveness in delineating micro fractures in a laboratory experiment lee and kitanidis 2014 applied ht for joint inversion of hydraulic head and tracer data illman et al 2009 and zha et al 2017 successfully applied ht to map fractures and faults over kilometer scale granite geologic formations for increasing the resolution of the characterization of fracture distribution zha et al 2014 included flux data in the ht survey zhao and illman 2017 2018 and zha et al 2017 included prior geologic information in ht analysis soueid ahmed et al 2015 applied an image guided method to include structure information ht has also been verified at different scales for examples zhao et al 2015 used it to delineate the heterogeneity of unconfined aquifers in a laboratory sandbox 2 4 m 1 2 m in a small scale field test described in brauchler et al 2011 the hydraulic parameters of a field site 5 m 5 m 2 m were estimated straface et al 2007 employed ht to obtain the transmissivity and storativity for a confined aquifer 100 m 100 m illman et al 2009 explored ht to characterize a large scale granite fractured aquifer successfully 884 m 392 m 1054 m yeh et al 2009 used synthetic examples to promote river stage tomography with river stage acting as a driving force for characterizing a groundwater basin 130 km 130 km wang et al 2017 utilized this river stage tomography concept to obtain the diffusivity of an 1800 km2 basin but was unable to retrieve hydraulic conductivity and specific storage separately due to the ill defined problems mao et al 2013c the lack of large scale stimuli constrains the usage of ht on the other hand integration of different types of information may advance the development of tomographic surveys research as advocated by yeh et al 2008 taking advantage of the natural stimuli for conducting basin scale hydraulic tomography tests is the future of the subsurface science the purpose of this study was to map the distribution of hydrogeologic properties of the eighth member of the deep ordovician limestone aquifers in xingdong coal mine crucial hydrogeologic information was acquired for safe mining and future grouting projects for this purpose we innovatively exploited data collected during water inrush incidents in the coal mine and combined it with one traditional pumping test to perform a large scale ht test approximately 10 km to reveal the geologic structure of the coal mine 2 site description 2 1 site location xingdong coal mine is located 4 km northeast of xingtai city fig 1 the ground elevation is 55 65 m above the sea level geographically it belongs to the north china plain which is one of the main coal production regions in china approximately 70 of all the identified coal resources in china are deposited under the north china plain xingdong coal mine has an administration range of 3 4 km 3 8 km 14 5 km2 in total area the coal mine was planned and undergone geologic investigations in 1998 and started mining operation in november 2001 with an estimated annual coal production 600 000 tons the current mining area is bounded by faults f1 f2 f19 and f30 in four directions as shown in fig 1 the coalfield in the north of fault f19 is reserved for future exploration 2 2 geology background the stratigraphy of the mine consists of ordovician o carboniferous o permian p triassic t and quaternary q systems sequentially cretaceous strata k only exist in the southeast corner of the coalfield two cross sections of the mine area are shown in fig 2 indicating that the inclined strata strike nw with a low dip angle 10 15 dipping ne the depth of 2 coal seam floors extends from 420 m in the west to 980 m in the east part of the coalfield resulting in a higher confining pressure in the ordovician strata in the east part middle ordovician strata are the main water yielding layers possessing threats to deep mining activities the strata have an average thickness of 545 m consisting of three formations xiamajiagou formation o2x shangmajiagou formation o2s and fengfeng formation o2f from bottom to top in sequence fengfeng formation with a thickness of 150 m is the research target of this study which has the shortest distance to the 2 coal seam this formation can be further divided into two members the seventh member o2f 1 with an average thickness of 50 m varying from 40 m to 69 m and the eighth member o2f 2 with an average thickness of 100 m varying from 70 m to 130 m o2f 1 is mainly comprised of clayey breccia and dolomitic breccia and is considered as an aquitard hydrogeologically while o2f 2 is a relative pure limestone unit consisting of thick dark gray limestone and thin brecciated limestone this member of middle ordovician strata is the main water bearing aquifer that threats the safety of the 2 coal seam borehole drilling reveals that the water level in o2f 2 is only dozens of meters below the land surface for example before the pumping test conducted in well d1 the water level in well d3 is 25 9 m about sea level this leads to a confining pressure of 13 35 mpa an equivalent of 1362 m water column calculated from the top of the o2f 2 layer the permian and carboniferous strata are the main coal bearing formations there are 15 layers of coal seams in total but only six layers are suitable for mining at present 2 coal seam is the production seam with a thickness of 4 0 4 6 m the floor of 2 coal seam is about 85 263 m an average thickness of 157 m above the water bearing ordovician majiagou formation including members o2x and o2s in between the majiagou formation and the 2 coal seam there are several layers of aquitards and less developed aquifers acting as a buffer zone preventing water inrushes from the middle ordovician system comparing with the ordovician strata the contribution of these less developed aquifers to water inrush incidents were negligible even though there is a buffer zone between the 2 coal seam and the middle ordovician system the presence of localized flow channels such as fractures or high permeability zone could result in a direct discharge of ordovician water to working faces out of the four possible flow channels summarized by wu and wang 2006 faults or fracture zones are considered as potential hydraulic paths in xingdong coalfield in xingdong coalfield there are 243 faults revealed from extensive geologic surveys borehole drillings and geophysical surveys all the faults are normal faults with a high dip angle 50 65 see figs 1 and 2 for an illustration of the major faults 55 of the faults have drop distances less than 5 m and 5 20 m for 20 faults while the drop distance of the rest faults is more than 20 m the faults strike direction in this area is generally nne ne dipping se 2 3 monitoring boreholes observation wells were drilled to monitor the water level variations in the o2f 2 layer in this study seven observation wells were employed i e d1 d3 d4 d5 d6 d9 and d11 covering the boundaries of the current mining area fig 1 they were installed as long term water level monitoring wells for mining safety no observation wells were installed inside mining area due to safety consideration because of their potential as conduits between aquifers and coal seams these seven wells all fully penetrated into the eighth member of the fengfeng formation o2f 2 and partially penetrate into the seventh member o2f 1 table 1 all the wells were cased from the land surface to the top of o2f 2 layer and the rest was left as unscreened open boreholes their fluctuations represent the depth averaged head response in the eighth member o2f 2 layer 3 water inrush incidents 3 1 water inrush water inrush incidents in china have recorded a maximum water inflow of 2053 m3 min zhang et al 1997 as discussed by zhang 2005 several factors control and influence the occurrence of water inrushes including strata pressures geologic structures mining sizes and water pressures previous geologic surveys indicated that water pressures and geologic structures are the most important factors affecting the water inrushes in xingdong coal mine the ordovician limestone is a confined aquifer with a high water pressure while there are strata between coal seams and the aquifer to prevent water from lower aquifers a fractured damage zone may occur below the floor of the coal seam extending dozens of meters due to mining induced strata failures during mining zhang 2005 as a result a large amount of groundwater could discharge into the working face when the water pressure is greater than the strength of the coal seam floor if there are geologic structures such as water conducting faults close to the damaged zone the high pressure groundwater can break through the coal seam floors more easily shortening the distance between the aquifer and the coal seam see fig 3 for an illustration therefore the water inrush incident on the mining floor with conductive channels presents a significant threat to the mining safety 3 2 grouting project design grouting is an effective way to cut off the flow paths to coal mines li and zhou 2006 grouting materials are injected into the target geologic stratum filling the fractures and pore spaces and replacing water in voids with the grout material after the water inrush incident at location w1 a grouting project targeting o2f 2 strata was initiated to avoid further hazards one vertical borehole was drilled as the main operation borehole a series of parallel directional boreholes were then drilled spreading into the ordovician limestone at depths between 70 m and 90 m below the top of o2f 2 strata the distance between every two parallel boreholes was set to be 70 m based on experience which will ensure a continuous curtain different colors of the parallel boreholes represent different stages of the grouting projects fig 4 a cement and water with a mass ratio 1 3 was mixed for injection the cement slurry was injected while drilling and the weight of cement consumption was recorded wherever the slurry could be injected a total of 17 105 tons of cement were consumed during this project the cement consumption recording locations as well as major faults are shown in fig 4b the solid frame in fig 4b outlines the influence area of this grouting project approximately 1 1 km 2 1 km 4 hydraulic tomography most faults in this mine have high angles and therefore they could be treated as vertically conductive channels the water inrush incident is therefore merely as a pumping test where the pumping well is fully screened through the o2f 2 layer with such conceptualization water inrush incidents could be jointly analyzed with traditional pumping tests conducted in the o2f 2 layer to perform a tomographic survey consequently we combine one pumping test and one water inrush incident to characterize the coal mine the hydraulic tomography algorithm simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle xiang et al 2009 mao et al 2013b was adopted to interpret the head responses from these two datasets the groundwater flow model was implemented with finite element code vsaft3 srivastava and yeh 1992 4 1 inversion algorithm description here we briefly discuss the main elements of simsle during simsle estimation process the head responses from all the interference tests are incorporated into the algorithm simultaneously there is no need to evaluate the effect of data incorporating sequence on the estimated parameters simsle starts with cokriging interpolation to obtain an initial estimate of hydraulic parameter distribution by comparing the difference between simulated and observed head responses the parameters are updated successively by the successive linear estimator yeh et al 1996 which considers the covariance of the hydraulic parameters and cross covariance between the head and the parameter during the update the covariance function of the parameters is also revised to reflect the gain of additional information about the parameter in each iteration therefore at the end of the estimation the diagonal elements of the updated covariances i e residual variances can be employed to represent the uncertainty of estimated parameters 4 2 drawdown data one pumping test conducted in well d5 and one water inrush incident occurred at location w1 were included in the hydraulic tomography test the depth averaged head responses in the eighth member of fengfeng formation o2f2 were recorded during both the pumping test and the water inrush incident the pumping test began on 18 january 2014 and lasted until 25 january 2014 the pumping rate started at 800 m3 day and decreased to 600 m3 day after two days till the end of the test hydraulic heads were monitored every 30 min in five wells d1 d4 d6 d9 and d11 pumping rate was measured every 30 min as well the water inrush incident at location w1 occurred on 1 march 2015 during the coal mining at working face 2222 of the 2 coal seam inrush location w1 is close to fault f22 fig 1 with an initial rate of 10 m3 h it quickly increased to 100 m3 h in a few hours as one of the emergency responses the discharge was pumped out from the working face to avoid further damages the inrush rate was measured based on this emergency pumping rate this incident lasted for about one year with a gradual decrease of discharge rate due to grouting for this study the data from the first seven days were utilized considering that the dataset from such a short duration will be less influenced by the boundaries during the incident the hydraulic head response in six wells d1 d3 d4 d5 d9 and d11 and the discharge rate were monitored every eight hours the hourly atmospheric pressure was recorded in the nearest weather station located in ren county 12 km east of xingdong coal mine and its influence was removed from recorded hydraulic head data for hydraulic tomography inversion both the head response from the pumping test and the water inrush incident and discharge rate were averaged every 0 5 days see fig 5 due to the large drop of hydraulic head in well d9 during the water inrush incident it was plotted separately in fig 5c in total there are 70 drawdown records from the five observation wells in the pumping test and 84 drawdown data from the six observation wells in the water inrush incident because the number of observation wells is limited all drawdown data were used for inversion and there were no data reserved for validation 4 3 numerical model setup with the depth averaged hydraulic head responses in the eighth member o2f2 of fengfeng formation a 3d groundwater flow model was built it had dimensions 15 km 20 km in x and y directions with 100 m in the z direction which was determined by the thickness of the o2f2 layer this simulation domain encompasses both coal mine and grouting project influence area fig 6 the right boundary was only 500 m to the right of the well d9 which was determined by fault f2 the impact of this impermeable boundary is discussed in section 6 1 considering only seven observation wells and two discharge events are available we expect that the ht can only reveal large scale hydrogeologic features therefore relative large elements were used in this analysis the numerical domain was discretized into 7500 elements with element dimensions 200 m 200 m 100 m the top bottom and left boundaries were assigned with constant total head 1000 m and the right boundary was zero flux due to the impermeable nature of the f2 fault an initial total head of 1000 m was used as for the input parameters required by simsle 1000 m and 1000 m were used for the correlation scales in x and y directions the variance of ln k and ln ss is set as 0 3 the initial mean of k and ss were obtained by running an estimation with the forward model vsaft3 and pest doherty 2011 the initial mean of k is 1 5 m day and the uncertainty is indicated by 95 confidence interval which has an upper limit of 1 8 m day and a lower limit of 1 25 m day for ss the estimated mean is 5 10 5 m with an upper limit of 6 1 10 5 m and a lower limit 4 1 10 5 m due to the limited heterogeneity information about the deep o2f2 layer different values of correlation scales and variance magnitudes were tested in inversion it is found that they did not change significantly the estimated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage distributions this corroborates the conclusion from yeh and liu 2000 that these input parameters have minor impacts on the pattern of the estimated parameters when sufficient hydraulic head data are available the pattern of the estimated parameters will ultimately be conditioned by the head responses from the seven observation wells and therefore only the inversion results from the above mentioned input parameters were presented 5 results with two datasets from the pumping test in well d5 and the water inrush incident at location w1 three inversion scenarios were attempted the first two scenarios invert the two datasets independently and the third scenario uses the two datasets as a hydraulic tomography by running two datasets independently we investigated the feasibility of treating water inrush incident as a pumping test for all the three scenarios only part of the numerical domain was illustrated because the estimated parameter values at the rest of the domain were close to their initial uniform values with head responses only from the pumping test in well d5 a less conductive region is unveiled adjacent to the six wells which is surrounded by a conductive structure the conductive structure forms a c shape on the west of the well d11 fig 7 on the other hand there are no major patterns in the estimated specific storage distribution except a high storage region close to the pumping well d5 as shown by the middle column of fig 7 the water inrush incident reveals a less conductive region to the north of inrush location w1 and a conductive region to the south of location w1 however there is not noticeable heterogeneity present in the west of well d5 with the largest drawdown in well d9 among all wells during the incident this head response yielded a relative conductive channel between well d9 and inrush location w1 and a low storage specific region around well d9 there is also a high storage specific region around well d3 while these two tests revealed different heterogeneity distributions similarities between them do exist the conductive region south of water inrush location w1 is an extension of the conductive part of c shape from the inversion of the pumping test data in well d5 more details are found using the data from the inrush incident about the low conductive region surrounded by the c shape the similarities and differences shared by these two tests ultimately suggest that the data from the two events carry non redundant information about the heterogeneity in this area thus it is useful to combine the pumping test with the water inrush incident as a hydraulic tomography survey the inversion results are shown in the right column of fig 7 the features identified by the two independently inversions now are assimilated for example the conductive region identified from the water inrush incident now connects with the c shape structure discovered by the pumping test the less conductive region merges with each other as well however the result of ht analysis indicates that there are no major structures in the estimated specific storage field fig 8 shows the residual covariance distributions corresponding to these three different scenarios which indicate the uncertainty of the estimates a low uncertainty area implies that great hydraulic parameter information gained from the tests and our confidence is high about the estimated parameters in these areas when combining these two tests we see a merge of low residual covariance areas from these two tests the last column of fig 8 the low residual covariance areas expand to the outskirt of the seven well cluster and away from the cluster the residual variance remains as the initial variance 0 3 in other words the estimated parameter distributions from this inversion are likely representative of the true field inside the well cluster the comparison between observed and simulated drawdowns are also shown in fig 9 in general most of the 11 datasets agree with the observed drawdowns reasonably especially the five datasets during the pumping test in well d5 for the water inrush incident the head response in observation well d9 is well reproduced based on the estimated parameter distributions however at the late period of the observation wells d1 d3 d5 and d11 simulated drawdowns are higher than the observed data this hints that after the initial discharge of water from the underlying aquifer there may be a slight change of water inrush channels 6 assessment of inversion results 6 1 effect of boundary conditions a larger numerical domain 15 km 20 km than xingdong coal mine was set to minimize the impact of boundary conditions during both forward and inverse simulations a no flux boundary was set on the right side which is only 500 m away from well d9 the no flux condition was determined by the known fault f2 however fault f2 is not strictly vertically distributed and connected with fault f30 at the bottom which goes left at the location close to well d3 in order to evaluate the effect of the right boundary the no flux boundary assignment was then removed the right boundary was extended for another 5 km and was set as constant head type fig 10 is the estimation results under the extended domain and the dashed lines indicate the locations of the original no flux boundary comparing with the results in the last column of fig 7 there are no significant changes for regions close to the dashed lines the pattern of the estimated parameters is mainly dictated by the observed head responses the low conductivity region in the expanded domain with a constant head assignment supports the impermeable nature of fault f2 this is consistent with the finding by sun et al 2013 that the estimated hydraulic conductivity could indicate the information about boundary types if the boundary condition is wrongly assigned 6 2 grouting records verification fig 11 a and b are the estimated hydraulic conductivity and specific storage distributions around the areas influenced by the grouting project fig 11c is the contour map of the amount of cement consumption interpolated from all the recording locations and the black dots in fig 11c are the recording locations the solid frames in fig 11 represents the scope of the grouting project during the grouting project with the directional boreholes going 70 90 m below the surface of o2f 2 strata the cement goes into the pores of the aquifer the amount of injected cement indicates the volume of pore space that the boreholes encounter and to some extent it reflects the conductivity of the aquifer fig 11b by comparing the contour patterns not the specific storage in the current project when comparing fig 11a and c we observe a clear feature more cement was consumed in the bottom right and less cement is used in the top part and a relative increase of cement consumption right below this top part the pattern is similar to the distribution of hydraulic conductivity however there are more variations in cement consumption than the estimated hydraulic conductivity this is because of the scale differences between the grouting project and the hydraulic tomography test we do not expect a high similarity between the depth averaged hydraulic conductivity and cement consumption along one horizontal level the purpose of this comparison is to show the amount of cement is related to the pattern of hydraulic conductivity in turn more attention is needed on the high conductive zone located at the bottom part of fig 11 for future grouting project 6 3 fault distributions verification in this section the estimated parameter distributions are compared with fault information collected at xingdong coal mine miao et al 2014 as suggested by zha et al 2016 ht is another way to map faults and is complementary to geological surveys the estimated parameters overlay with the major faults in the coalfield fig 12 as shown in the figure the conductive zone located south of the water inrush location w1 agrees with a cluster of faults another conductive zone is located to the left of fault f1 which was identified as a conductive fault during the geologic survey on the other hand f19 was thought of as a conductive fault however the inverted hydraulic conductivity shows that it is less conductive compared with the above two conductive zones it may be because that damage zone of the fault is not significant or the fracture zones are filled with fault gouges and consequently are not as conductive as one expected non conductive fault f2 has already been well determined by the geologic survey the inverted low conductivity located close to f2 and across f2 shows the impermeable nature of this fault is well included in the hydraulic head responses f30 was treated as a non permeable boundary in the geologic survey however it is blurred with the estimated conductive zone this can be explained by the inadequate observation wells in this region more observation wells are needed to further condition the hydraulic properties of fault f30 for specific storage the low storage region coincides with fault f2 this low storage region coexists with the less conductive region the two high storage regions only concentrate around the pumping well d5 and the water inrush location w1 and these two regions have a high conductivity value this pattern is the opposite of the finding by illman et al 2009 in japan mizunami site 7 discussion and conclusions by combining the traditional pumping test and the water inrush incident in xingdong the parameters estimated from the hydraulic tomography test is in general consistent with the local fault distributions and the cement consumption data the assumption of treating water inrush incidents as pumping tests was verified by comparing the pattern of the estimated parameters with the result from the traditional pumping test these findings promote the usage of this type of stimulus in a large scale hydraulic tomography test as advocated by yeh et al 2008 the verifications providing us with further confidence in the validity of our results the results from the aforementioned approaches of evaluating estimated results are encouraging more rigorous and quantitative means to evaluate the estimated parameter distributions are necessary such as to test the predictability of head responses using the estimated parameter fields under different flow scenarios liu et al 2007 in the current application only two tests were employed in the analysis this yield low resolution map about major geologic information but with more tests one should be able to obtain higher resolution information illman et al 2009 zha et al 2017 the target aquifer of o2f 2 strata is not perfectly flat and its continuation is interrupted by geologic faults fig 2 our assumption of a perfect flat aquifer with 100 m in thickness likely yields some incorrect estimates secondly treating the seventh member o2f 1 strata as an aquitard was based on a limited number of boreholes in addition there may be a connection between eighth member o2f 2 aquifer and deeper members in the middle ordovician strata and these were not considered in the current model configuration our assumptions are necessary to conduct a quantitative analysis some major conclusions can be drawn from this research 1 to the best of our knowledge it is the first ht test to combine a traditional pumping test and a water inrush incident the estimated results are encouraging the large scale hydraulic tomography test approximately 10 km propels us to advance hydraulic tomography technology into more innovative applications 2 the water inrush incident on the coal seam floor is treated as a pumping test water discharge into the coal seam is assumed as a pumping test from the underlying aquifer o2f 2 layer through conductive channels this assumption is verified by the pattern of the inverted parameters from an independent pumping test conducted in a different location of the same aquifer 3 the hydraulic conductivity distribution is in general consistent with the cement consumption in the grouting project the conductive zone is related to the high cement consumption zone at the bottom of the grouting project and the less conductive zone is well linked to a low consumption zone the estimated hydraulic parameters can be furthered employed to guide the design of future grouting projects 4 the inversion results from the ht test agree with major faults distribution in this coal field the high conductive zone overlays with a fault cluster in the south of the well cluster the identified impermeable fault f2 is well characterized by a low conductive and small storage zone acknowledgements the first author would like

6874,parameter calibration and uncertainty estimation are crucial for hydrological simulations in the distributed land surface hydrological model to investigate soil properties impacting hydrological processes five conventional pedo transfer functions ptfs are applied to create a 3d soil hydraulic parameter shp ensemble in the weather research and forecasting hydrological extension wrf hydro a distributed multi physics land surface hydrological model the shps are generated based on a high resolution chinese soil property dataset over the heterogeneous upper huaihe river basin the results show that the shps can influence the streamflow in wrf hydro which is similar to the impact of the scaling parameters on the streamflow over the study basin analyses of the uncertainty in the shp ensemble reveal that shps mainly constrain the peak flow during the flood rise and impact the baseflow during the flood recession a hydrological bayesian model average bma method is constructed to postprocess the streamflow ensemble based on the 3d shps probabilistic streamflow estimations by the bma method are more skillful than the simulations using the individual 3d shp ensemble members for all five studied hydrological stations especially for high flows therefore improved estimation of the uncertainty in the 3d shps may enhance the spatial representation of flood processes resulting in more accurate estimates of the streamflow in the main streams in a heterogeneous basin keywords hydraulic parameter distributed hydrological model wrf hydro uncertainty estimation ensemble 1 introduction the spatial heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties has always been an important factor influencing the performance of land surface hydrological models shellito et al 2016 stolte et al 2003 van genuchten and nielsen 1985 processes related to the estimation of parameter uncertainties are often associated with multiple physically based hydrological procedures including runoff generation surface infiltration soil water diffusion ground water budget etc in addition with a growing requirement for the model resolution as high as the street scale distributed hydrological models have encountered new challenges associated with spatially distributed hydrological parameters baroni et al 2017 blasone et al 2008 christiaens and feyen 2001 livneh et al 2015 mohanty and zhu 2007 refsgaard 1997 quantifying parameter uncertainties pixel by pixel in a distributed model is extremely difficult in a distributed land surface model lsm using scaling parameters or transferred parameters from land properties are major approaches for parameter estimation chen and dudhia 2001 lawrence et al 2011 liang et al 1994 niu et al 2011 a scaling parameter is a factor associated with one model function parameter estimated from early field experiments or direct measurements although these function parameters are pattern fixed by the early estimation their values can still be adjusted within specified intervals because of observational uncertainty and model compatibility the scaling parameters help to modify the function parameters over a new study area refsgaard 1997 since the scaling parameter is an overall modification of the function parameter it is important for the bias control and uncertainty estimation of the hydrological model over different basins the transferred parameters use multiple land properties soil constituent vegetation constituent etc to generate model function parameters or intermediate variables with empirical transfer functions mcbratney et al 2002 pedo transfer functions ptfs are empirical transfer functions generated from statistical analyses between soil hydraulic parameters shps and independent soil constituents the clapp and hornberger clapp and hornberger 1978 ch function and van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 vgm function are two most popular schemes for ptf generation the ch scheme has been widely used by the lsms in north america for climatic and synoptic researches including noah model noah multiparameterization noah mp model common land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model chen and dudhia 2001 dai et al 2003 liang et al 1994 niu et al 2011 the vgm scheme is popular in the soil and agricultural models some lsm also added the vgm for ptf generation including the soil and water assessment tool swat soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf developed hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel model arnold and fohrer 2005 balsamo et al 2009 nrcs 1998 despite the large number of ptfs used in land surface hydrological models their accuracies still need more investigations cornelis et al 2001 mcbratney et al 2002 tietje and hennings 1996 christiaens and feyen 2001 evaluated four approaches including two ptfs for the shp estimation in mike she model and found that discharge ground water and soil water were markedly impacted by the shp uncertainty baroni et al 2010 investigated the uncertainties of shps by the intercomparison of two hydrological models and demonstrated that the discrepancies caused by different shp estimation methods in a same model are larger than that of model differences rieger et al 2010 used a distributed rainfall runoff model to simulate flood events seven different ptfs showed strong influences on the soil parameterization in the model and had noticeable uncertainties for the simulated hydrographs soil predictors are important for the ptf generation vereecken et al 2010 pointed out that the uncertainty in ptfs lies in the spatial temporal variability of the soil predictors soil texture bulk density soil water content organic matter etc due to measurement restrictions quality control and sample collection therefore a ptf with good performance at its representative site may result in problematic relationships beyond that site soil predictors also influence the ptfs pachepsky and rawls 2004 and wösten et al 2001 suggested that including more soil matters in the soil predictors is necessary for constructing robust relationships between ptfs and shps for example rawls et al 2003 shows that adding organic carbon content to soil texture can improve soil water retention estimation therefore a deterministic ptf may suffer from strong uncertainty in terms of hydrological model performance while the ptf ensemble technique could be a better way to estimate model shps cichota et al 2013 dai et al 2013 guber et al 2006 research on the ptf ensemble has mainly focused on water flow and solute transport processes in lsms for example guber et al 2009 used the hydrus 1d code to evaluate 19 published ptfs over a meadow field located in bekkevoort belgium the soil moisture estimate was most accurate at different layers with appropriate postprocessing methods including applying weight averaging and bayesian method to the model outputs cichota et al 2013 proposed an ptf ensemble based on the new zealand soil dataset using the agricultural production systems simulator model for soil water content simulation their results indicated that ensemble ptf based water content was more reliable than the hydraulic conductivity as the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from the ptf ensemble was generally under predicted compared with the measurements liao et al 2014 studied the hydraulic properties over the forestland soil in china based on six published ptfs and concluded that the ptf ensemble method was valuable for simulating the soil water content of forestland the application of the ptf ensemble methods can improve the estimation of soil hydraulic properties although popular ptfs were developed from early studies in field sites in europe vereecken et al 1990 vereecken et al 1989 wagner et al 2001 wösten 1997 wösten et al 1999 and usa rawls and brakensiek 1989 saxton and rawls 2006 few studies in china have analyzed ptf uncertainty or the application of ensemble ptf in land surface hydrological models it is important to study the compatibility and uncertainty of widely used ptfs in models in order to improve their application over chinese basins recently the land atmosphere interaction research group at beijing normal university bnu now at sun yat sen university updated a state of the art china soil dataset derived from high resolution soil maps and the best measurements available in china aiming to enhance the studies of the land surface hydrological system and ecosystem shangguan et al 2014 2013 based on the new soil profile dataset dai et al 2013 proposed a framework of five member ptfs to convert soil data to high resolution spatially distributed shps 3d shps the results show that the shps vary markedly from multiple ptfs over china to date further implementation of shps in lsms or distributed hydrological models is rare in this study the bnu soil property data is used to generate 3d shps for the richards equation based on the ptf ensemble of dai et al 2013 to study the hydrological parameter uncertainties the wrf hydro land surface hydrological model which is distributed and multi physical based is selected to apply the shp ensemble previous studies of parameter uncertainties in wrf hydro simulations focused on the scaling parameters in mountainous regions ryu et al 2017 yucel et al 2015 or dryland in africa arnault et al 2016 but the shps were not discussed due to the heterogeneity in the soil properties usually the shps are considered to be less sensitive than the scaling parameters however wet plain basins can have completely different results than drier areas due to the different behaviours of soil water retention water infiltration and precipitation in this study the upper huaihe river basin is a typical plain dominated region characterized by heterogeneous and moist soil it is of interest to investigate the relative importance of the scaling parameters or 3d shps on the streamflow simulations over the study basin the objectives of this paper are to analyze the relative uncertainties of the 3d shps and scaling parameters in the streamflow simulation over the upper huaihe river basin investigate the mechanism and influence of different 3d shps on the streamflow and evaluate the ability of the probabilistic postprocessing method to improve the ensemble streamflow based on the shps the rest part of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the upper huaihe river basin and datasets used in this study section 3 describes the wrf hydro model and model parameters as well as the calibration and postprocessing methods the results using the scaling parameters the 3d shp ensemble and the probabilistic bma simulations are provided in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study region the huaihe river basin located in the middle region between the yangtze river and yellow river has a drainage area of approximately 270 000 km2 a typical east asian monsoon climate results in a warm season june september with torrential rain and flash flooding the average annual precipitation is approximately 900 mm over the basin due to the thousands of reservoirs and floodgates built in the region zhang et al 2012 the upper region of the huaihe river basin fig 1 delineated by the bengbu gauging station on the middle stream of the huaihe river is selected for our study because it has relatively less human regulation and population the study basin features a drainage area of approximately 121 300 km2 over 70 of the basin area is dominated by an interior floodplain while the western edge is bounded by two mountain ranges the dabie mountains in the south and funiu mountains in the north the basin elevation ranges from approximately 300 m to 2000 m 2 2 datasets the wrf hydro model should first be calibrated in an uncoupled offline model before further applications in a coupled model with the weather research and forecasting wrf model the offline model needs meteorological forcing data including surface downwelling shortwave longwave flux air temperature specific air humidity air pressure near surface wind in the u and v components and liquid precipitation rate to drive both the land surface and hydrological schemes format and technical details of the forcing variables are described in gochis et al 2016 since the conventional hydrological or meteorological stations over the study region lack a complete record of the forcing variables for the wrf hydro model a combined data set of meteorological analyses and gauging observations is adopted and utilized as the forcing data including analyses from the global land data assimilation system gldas ek et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 sheffield et al 2006 the analysis data from the global forecast system gfs and the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph satellite gauge merged quantitative precipitation estimates qpes xie and xiong 2011 yu et al 2015 with spatial resolutions of 0 25 0 25 0 5 0 5 and 0 1 0 1 respectively the gldas data have been widely used for land surface simulations due to the high data resolution good quality control and compatibility of the most meteorological forcing variables but it lacks data on the wind u v components thus the corresponding gfs analysis data are used as a substitute the precipitation forcing data is the most important component during the procedure of hydrological model calibration sun et al 2016 evaluated four of the latest satellite based qpes in china and found that the cmorph satellite gauge merged product provided by the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma had the best performance among the studied datasets in hydrometeorological simulations of the upper huaihe river basin intensive ground based observations merged with data from approximately 2400 meteorological stations over china are the main reason for the better performance of the cmorph cma precipitation dataset shen and xiong 2016 yu et al 2015 according to the independent validation by yu et al 2015 the cmorph cma precipitation dataset has the highest correlation coefficients and the lowest bias both in temporal variation and spatial distribution therefore it is used as the forcing precipitation data these three sets of forcing data are spatially interpolated into the wrf hydro model grid with spatial and temporal resolutions of 3 km and 6 h respectively using the bilinear interpolation method the 1 h accumulated precipitation of cmorph cma is aggregated to 6 h data to calculate the rain rate in the unit of mm s the daily discharge records china 2011 2013 of 5 hydrological stations fig 1 from 2010 to 2012 were selected for evaluating hydrological performance in space the 5 stations are distributed on the main stream of the huaihe river from the eastern outlet bengbu to the western mountainous station xixian in the study region the lsm soil profile data come from bnu based on the 1 1 000 000 soil map derived from the second national soil survey of china which includes 8595 representative soil profiles with 33 039 soil horizons at national and provincial levels shangguan et al 2013 the data are available at a horizontal resolution of 30 30 arc second geographical and at a vertical resolution of eight vertical layers to a depth of 2 296 m and the data include easily measured soil matrices such as the sand silt clay percentages bulk density bd and soil organic matter som this dataset is then converted into wrf hydro grids and layers 3 3 km horizontal grids and vertical layers of 0 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 4 1 0 and 1 0 2 0 m via bilinear interpolation and weight averaging by layer thickness respectively for model utilization chinese soil profiles are measured based on the international society of soil science isss and katschinski schemes katschinski 1956 however the noah mp model uses the soil texture classes of the food and agriculture organization u s department of agriculture fao usda system thus the soil profiles have to be converted to soil category indices that conform to the fao usda standards via the soil texture triangle soil survey staff 1993 the conventional noah and noah mp lsms use vertically uniform soil category indices and the model parameters or variables need to be linked to the indices via corresponding lookup tables as a default run of wrf hydro we choose the first layer of the bnu soil profile to generate soil category indices and link the indices to 2d shp through lookup tables consistent with the noah mp lsm setting the 3d shp run will be described in section 3 2 3 methodology 3 1 model description the offline wrf hydro v3 0 gochis et al 2016 contains the noah mp land surface processes niu et al 2011 and hydrological modules one single wrf based inner domain fig 1 is chosen to cover the upper huaihe river basin with a land surface and hydrological grid spacing of 3 km and 150 m respectively nested domain is not considered in this study to simplify computation the offline wrf hydro was spun up firstly for as long as 5 years the initial and boundary conditions of atmospheric variables such as downwelling shortwave longwave flux air temperature specific air humidity air pressure and liquid precipitation rate come from the ncep gldas data and u v wind components are provided by the ncep gfs analysis data and the initial land surface variables before spin up use the fixed values embedded in the wrf hydro model noah mp model after spin up the mean soil conditions of the area e g soil moisture soil temperature and surface evaporation had reached a stable state with variations less than 1 between two adjacent years and then these variables can be used as real initial land surface conditions in next model simulation e g the model calibration the second half of the water year 1 june to 30 november in 2010 is used for the scaling parameter calibration and shp ensemble tests and the subsequent 2 years 1 january 2011 to 31 december 2012 are used for the model validation the validation uses the soil status variables at the end of the calibration period as initial land surface conditions both the calibration and validation apply the offline wrf hydro for simulations with the atmospheric initial and boundary conditions from the forcing data coupling wrf hydro with wrf is not considered in this study first the noah mp lsm has a hydrology scheme jarvis 1976 performed on individual soil columns with only vertical water exchanges between different soil layers there are no lateral exchanges between the soil columns in the noah mp lsm the runoff infiltration partitioning equation is used by noah mp lsm to calculate water head and surface runoff 1 r h t p d p d p d d x 1 exp i r δ t d x δ z i θ s θ i a n d i r i r 0 k s k ref surface runoff r is defined as the infiltration capacity excess p d is the precipitation on the soil surface h is the water depth d x is the total soil column pore θ s and θ i represent the saturated soil moisture content and the soil moisture at ith layer respectively δ z i is the soil layer depth i r is the scaling parameter for the rate of runoff infiltration partitioning at each time step i r 0 is the reference parameter for i r δ t is the lsm time step which is 86 400 s in this work k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and k ref 2 10 6 m s is the reference hydraulic conductivity wood et al 1998 after infiltration the richards equation is used to calculate the soil water propagation as follows 2 θ t z d z θ k z f θ where θ is the soil moisture d k ψ θ is the soil hydraulic diffusivity wherein ψ represents the soil water tension function and k is the soil hydraulic conductivity ψ and k are computed with the empirical equations ψ ψ s θ θ s β and k k s θ θ s 2 β 3 provided by clapp and hornberger 1978 where β is an index depending on the pore size distribution and k s and ψ s depend on the soil type and f θ represents sources and sinks chen and dudhia 2001 following the lsm hydrological process the hydrological modules of wrf hydro redistribute the land surface and soil water onto the sub grid by routing processes infiltration capacity excess ponded surface water depth and soil moisture from the noah mp lsm are subsequently disaggregated from the 1d soil column to the high resolution 150 m routing grid via a spatially weighted algorithm gochis and chen 2003 and passed to the routing modules including the four major routing modules subsurface routing overland routing bucket model and channel routing lake and reservoir are not considered in this paper senatore et al 2015 yucel et al 2015 3 2 hydrological parameters the scaling parameter of wrf hydro plays a role in bias control for the specific model functions the major scaling parameters examined in our study include the runoff infiltration partitioning parameter i r soil bottom drainage partition p dr water retention depth factor h sf and surface roughness factor r sf table 1 table 1 gives a description of the major scaling parameters and shps see the next section in the wrf hydro model the recommended ranges and default values of the scaling parameters are based on the operational national water model over the entire continental united states the shps are important for the soil hydraulic process in the wrf hydro model the default shps are vertically uniform 2d parameters based on the lookup table and soil category indices however for the 3d shps the lsm module of wrf hydro uses 3d shps directly from an external file for the lsm grids and layers users need to prepare the corresponding external file additionally to create the 3d shps dai et al 2013 suggested the ch scheme and the vgm scheme to generate ptf ensembles each scheme adopted five ptfs over nationwide since the noah mp lsm is not compatible with the vgm ptfs we adopted the five ch ptfs to map the interpolated bnu soil profile data to 3d shps table 2 gives a short description of five ptfs including 2 ptfs provided by cosby et al 1984 cosby a and cosby b hereafter 2 ptfs provided by saxton et al 1986 and saxton and rawls 2006 saxton a and saxton b hereafter and 1 ptf by campbell and shiozawa 1992 campbell a hereafter and their associated soil predictors the most commonly used soil predictors are sand clay and silt contents although saxton b and campbell a also included bd and som into the ptfs note that the 2d shp relationships between the lookup table and soil category indices are based on cosby b the soil category indices of 2d shps are generated from the soil profile data for the first soil layer while the 3d shps of cosby b use soil profile data from all four soil layers as described before the 3d shps of cosby b and the default 2d shps are similar for the first layer but there are more differences for the other layers 3 3 calibration and postprocessing methods the scaling parameters table 1 are calibrated with a stepwise approach yucel et al 2015 in the order of i r p dr h sf and r sf according to the recommended intervals since the bengbu station is the basin outlet its discharge is used for the objective functions for deterministic verification the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce is the major verification score while the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc are also evaluated once a scaling parameter is calibrated the parameter is fixed for the next calibration the default 2d shps are used when calibrating the scaling parameters after the scaling parameters are calibrated 3d shps are used to create an ensemble streamflow simulation the bma duan et al 2007 hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 method is adopted to postprocess the ensemble discharges from the five shps the major bma process is based on duan et al 2007 but the posterior distribution has been modified assuming that the cube root of the discharge follows a gamma distribution the 5 95 interval of the bma cumulative distribution function cdf is used as the postprocessed probabilistic interval the reliability diagram and brier skill score bss are used for probabilistic verification jolliffe and stephenson 2003 4 results 4 1 scaling parameter vs 3d shps in this section the uncertainty of the scaling parameters and 3d shps and their relative influences on the streamflow are evaluated the detailed analyses about the variability and hydraulic feature of 3d shps will be discussed in the next section when four scaling parameters are calibrated with a step wise approach the shps are fixed with the default 2d shps the scaling parameters of h sf and r sf are not sensitive during the calibration period and their discharge uncertainty intervals are under 200 m3 s at bengbu and four other hydrological stations not shown this behaviour is probably because the surface water retention and surface roughness only impact a thin layer of the surface water which has a small fraction of the soil water content in a wet basin fig 2 a and b show the discharge uncertainty intervals at the bengbu station during the calibration period jun 1st to nov 30th 2010 for the scaling parameters i r fig 2a and p dr fig 2b respectively fig 2c represents the discharge uncertainty interval from the 3d shp ensemble after the scaling parameters are calibrated i r and p dr can be regarded as the bias control for the surface infiltration and soil bottom drainage respectively while the 3d shps are site specific as the results show i r mainly affects the two peaks around july 26 and september 10 with a range of approximately 2000 m3 s while p dr and 3d shps have more impacts on the recession periods i r was considered to be the most sensitive parameter of wrf hydro for surface runoff and streamflow according to arnault et al 2016 however the discharge uncertainty intervals of the parameter p dr fig 2b and 3d shps fig 2c are much larger than the uncertainty interval of i r fig 2a at the bengbu station the other four hydrological stations have similar results not shown this discrepancy is probably because the dominant land surface in the upper huaihe river basin is a flat plain with relatively high soil moisture and therefore differs from the steeper or drier conditions in mountainous or sandy soil basins such as arnault et al 2016 therefore in our study area surface infiltration may have less influence on the surface water distribution as fig 3 a shows the dominant soil textures along the huaihe river are loam and clay including clay loam in the northeastern part silty clay in the northwestern area and silt loam in the southern basin the rich soil loam and clay has higher soil moisture contents and lower hydraulic conductivity values thus this soil more easily reaches saturation during the rainy season than dominantly sandy or silty soils meanwhile the huaihe river basin is characterized by a monsoon climate that brings a large amount of precipitation to the basin in summer consequently the soil in the basin generally maintains a high soil moisture content fig 3b gives the relative soil moisture content percentage for the first soil layer at the end of spin up on may 31 2010 and most of the loam and clay soils have reached over 80 saturation the soil condition eventually affects the surface runoff generation while ground water can be extracted from the aquifer and contribute to the streamflow since i r is negatively correlated with the specific soil moisture eq 1 it becomes less sensitive when wet soil is dominant during the runoff infiltration partitioning process on the contrary p dr bottom drainage and shps soil water movement are positively correlated with the soil moisture content when the soil water content is close to saturation changes in the soil water conductivity and diffusivity or the bottom drainage tend to have more impacts on the soil condition and ground water than when the soil is dry therefore the parameter p dr and the shps are as important as i r over the upper huaihe river basin 4 2 the shp ensemble there are still large uncertainties in the ptfs for the estimation of shps dai et al 2013 mcbratney et al 2002 vereecken et al 2010 our research aims to investigate the influences of different shps on the streamflow simulation over the upper huaihe river basin fig 4 shows four default 2d shps column 1 used to estimate the richards equation and their deviations from 3d shp ensemble derived from five ptfs columns 2 6 for the first soil layer first of all the cosby types columns 3 and 4 are similar to the 2d shps derived from soil texture index because they are based on the same ptfs proposed by cosby et al 1984 note that the 2d shps are converted from soil category indices according to the lookup table while the 3d shps are converted from soil profile data using ptfs directly therefore there is still a little deviation over the silt loam soil area the southern basin and mountainous regions columns 3 and 4 in general campbell a column 2 has an increase in θ s although there is little change along the main streams of the huaihe river where loam soil is dominant fig 4 a2 at the same time campbell a shows the strongest decrease in k s and the largest increase in β compared with parameters in other members the d s has a considerable decrease over the southern basin consequently the changes in k s d s and β reduce water conductivity and diffusion and the comprehensive change in θ s increases the soil water capacity fig 5 for saxton a fig 4 column 5 this member has the greatest θ s increase and the strongest d s decrease over most of the basin compared with other members meanwhile k s has a slight decrease and β has a strongest decrease over the central basin saxton b fig 4 column 6 shows a slight decrease in θ s while its other three shps are similar to saxton a with only small differences the influences of the shps on the streamflow vary differently for the flood rise period and flood recession period fig 5 conceptually illustrates the influences of shp changes on surface runoff and baseflow based on the example of campbell a during the flood rise the soil is not yet close to the saturation thus parameters related to soil water movement d s k s and β and soil water capacity θ s become more important in surface runoff generation than they are for nearly saturated soil when k s and d s decrease or β increases the soil water movement is reduced causing more water retention at the surface and weaker infiltration ability consequently the surface water increases surface runoff generation and flood volume in contrast an increase in θ s results in more soil water capacity favouring surface infiltration and reducing surface runoff since the variations in θ s and β are approximately 10 of their absolute values over the study basin fig 4 rows 1 and 4 the variations are relatively small compared with other shps thus the parameters θ s and β may have less effect on streamflow than k s and d s during the flood recession the soil water has already been close to saturation especially for the soil around the main streams in the central basin after the main rainy events the shps of soil water movement mainly influence the speed of ground water charging when k s and d s decrease or β increases the charging speed correspondingly decreases and thus reduces the baseflow or the ground water recession flow baseflow is the fundamental flow and differs from the flood wave hence it mainly influences the flood recession after the peak in the flood recession θ s has less effect on the baseflow since only the rate of saturation influences the baseflow recharge when the soil columns are close to saturation fig 6 represents the river discharges simulated with the 3d shp ensemble and the default 2d shps in fig 6a the discharges of two cosby types are both close to the 2d shp discharge due to similar shps one rapid rise after the second peak on approximately september 14 is the major deviation between the cosby types and the 2d original for the two cosby types the 3d shps in the other soil layers provide different values from the first soil layer therefore the rapid rise must be caused by the accumulated effects of the shp differences with the 2d shps in the four soil layers the campbell a shps have the slowest soil water movement among the shp members although the area mean θ s for the first soil layer has a positive deviation from the 2d θ s there are negative deviations along the main streams of the huaihe river therefore d s k s and β mainly help campbell a to increase the streamflow around the two peak times as illustrated in fig 5 for the flood recession period especially after the second peak campbell a presents the lowest recession flow among the shp members consistent with fig 5 the changes in d s k s and β in campbell a lead to the largest decrease in soil water movement after the major rainy events before the second peak time in 2010 the ground water charging speed of campbell a is much slower than that of other members which results in a rapid drop in the baseflow discharge and a much faster flood recession than the other members the saxton a and saxton b shps can also be explained by fig 5 compared to campbell a the saxton a shps have relatively faster soil water movement and a generally higher θ s these shp trends in saxton a lead to less surface runoff during the flood rise and excessive baseflow during the flood recession relative to campbell a fig 6a purple line saxton b has similar deviations in k s d s and β as saxton a but with weaker values however its decrease trend of θ s is opposite that of saxton a over most of the basin therefore saxton b results in the largest surface runoff and a longer flood recession fig 6a brown line because its shp variations cause an increase in surface runoff applying these methods to other hydrological stations over the upper huaihe river basin results in similar conclusions the simulations at the fuyang and lutaizi stations fig 6b c which are located in the downstream reach of the basin with stream orders bigger than 5 maximum stream order is 7 suffer two common defects similar to the bengbu station the protracted recession and the overestimated peaks after september the highest peaks are underestimated at the western stations including xixian and wangjiaba fig 6d e since the calibration for scaling parameters treats the bengbu station as the reference the shps in mountainous areas have larger variability than those in the plain thus the scaling parameters calibrated in our study may not be suitable for the high elevation stations and a sub basin calibration is recommended for those areas in the future the scores of five stations table 3 are consistent with the analyses above for five 3d shps campbell a obtains the highest scores in terms of rmse nsce and cc due to its better ability to capture the discharge peak and comparatively short recession time saxton a and saxton b are able to obtain high cc values but poor nsce scores mostly because they overestimate the streamflow cosby a and cosby b do not surpass the 2d shp scores because the cosby scores are influenced by the rapid increase in discharge during the second heavy rain period fig 7 shows the discharges during the verification period similar to the calibration period campbell a has the best performance among the shps and 2d shps for larger discharges at five stations although campbell a has comparatively better performance all members underestimate the streamflow peaks especially from july to september in 2011 the stations close to the basin boundary xixian and wangjiaba underestimate the peak more than the downstream stations bengbu fuyang and lutaizi in general the shp ensemble has a better ability to capture the flow peaks than the 2d simulation however the ensemble derived from the multiple ptfs is still underdispersive therefore the probabilistic postprocessing method may be a better approach for streamflow estimation and flood warning 4 3 bma postprocessing the above analyses reveal that shps have uncertainties as large as the scaling parameters in the wrf hydro model over the upper huaihe river basin the ensemble approach may be a better choice to estimate the streamflow probabilistically and mitigate the flood risks in our study the hydrological bma postprocessing method is applied to the ensemble streamflow simulations generated by the five 3d shps to create probabilistic estimates fig 8 shows the bma probabilistic estimates of streamflow during the calibration period the bma statistical model was trained with the ensemble streamflow at the bengbu station since the scaling parameters are calibrated at the bengbu station for all the hydrological stations the 90 from 5 to 95 bma cdf intervals of discharge cover the observations very well the cover rates are 85 8 77 6 92 3 95 1 and 97 8 at the bengbu fuyang lutaizi wangjiaba and xixian stations respectively the peaks are captured well within the 90 interval at the bengbu and lutaizi stations fig 8a c in contrast a peak delay occurs at the fuyang station fig 8b while the simulations at the wangjiaba and xixian stations suffer from both peak delay and peak underestimation fig 8d e the bma deterministic estimation with the 50 cdfs blue dashed lines has a similar skill as the ensemble mean discharge orange dashed lines at all the stations probabilistic verifications and the corresponding statistical scores of the bma results are given in figs 9 and 10 to ensure the large sample size in the probabilistic verification probabilistic scores of the bma estimations are calculated for the 2 year verification period totalling 731 days as fig 9a e show the 90 bma intervals can capture most events with cover rates of 97 3 83 0 99 6 99 7 and 99 7 at the five stations which are better than those of the relatively wet years during the calibration period since the bma model was trained over a period that was comparatively wetter than the verification period the postprocessed probabilistic streamflow tends to capture the large discharge events therefore the upper bound of the bma probabilistic streamflow 95 cdf can cover the peaks better during the verification period than during the calibration period during the verification period the 95 cdf is able to depict the streamflow peaks while most shp members underestimate the events especially at the wangjiaba and xixian stations on the other hand the bma probabilistic results still have defects for smaller streamflow values for example fig 9a shows that the 90 bma interval is excessively wide for streamflow values less than 1000 m3 s this result is because the hypothesis of the gamma distribution in the bma model has more variability near zero where the flow is discrete and the continuous equation cannot simulate it well as a result the bma intervals are more overdispersive for smaller discharges than for the peaks also the probabilistic evaluation reveals that the bma results under the 50 cdf have poor performances inefficient reliability and negative bsss at all stations fig 10a e show reliability diagrams at 50 70 and 90 of the discharge at five hydrological stations during the verification period almost all stations show reasonable reliabilities reliability curves close to the diagonal except for high probabilities at the fuyang station fig 10b which perhaps result from the phase shift of the peaks at fuyang the high quantiles of the discharge at bengbu and lutaizi fig 10a c are slightly overestimated while the simulations at xixian and wangjiaba fig 10d e are overdispersive according to the large deviations from the diagonal fig 10f shows the bsss bma results against 2d shps discharge at the thresholds of 50 70 and 90 of the observed discharge at the five stations the positive bsss suggest that bma probabilistic results greatly improved the original ensemble simulations at all stations for the bengbu and lutaizi stations the simulations are already improved by calibrating the scaling parameters thus the skill gains associated with the bma method are less than those of the other three stations for other stations the improvements most bsss over 0 5 dramatically increase with the discharge thresholds indicating that the bma probabilistic estimations preferentially benefit the peak flows 5 summary and conclusions quantifying the parameter uncertainty in a distributed hydrological model can be very challenging when model parameters are site specific especially for large scale basins the best approach for analysing the parameter uncertainty is to associate the parameters with intermediate observations based on their physical implications in hydrological processes there are limited studies about applying spatially distributed shps with a physically based land surface hydrological model to chinese basins due to a lack of good quality soil profile data the development of a state of the art soil dataset for lsms has motivated the study of physical land surface hydrological models based on precise land information previous studies ryu et al 2017 yucel et al 2015 arnault et al 2016 focused more on the scaling parameters than on the other hydrological parameters in the wrf hydro model however at all the hydrological stations in our study the uncertainties of streamflow simulations due to the 3d shps derived from multiple ptfs are comparable to that caused by the scaling parameters in general the heterogeneous upper huaihe river basin has relatively flat terrain and moist soils resulting in the surface conditions that differ from those of sandy or mountainous regions when soil is close to saturation the sensitivities of land surface infiltration and bottom drainage mainly controlled by scaling parameters are reduced while the soil water movement mainly controlled by shps remains sensitive thereby influencing runoff generation and ground water recharging therefore the estimation of the shps is critical for hydrological simulations over the wet upper huaihe river basin the wrf hydro simulations of the shp ensemble members show that the shps can have different impacts on model discharges during different flood phases during the flood rise the shps of soil water movement k s d s and β and soil water capacity θ s mainly constrained the streamflow peaks during the flood recession the shps of soil water movement strongly influenced the rate of baseflow recharging and the flood recession time while the shp of soil water capacity had little effect on the baseflow since the soil was nearly saturated after the flood rise the ensemble analyses can help to better understand the uncertainties and the effects of the shps with the bma postprocessing of the shp ensemble streamflow the probabilistic discharge estimations improved cover rate and forecast skill for high streamflow values over the basin to estimate the uncertainties of shps over the upper huaihe river basin we adopted five ptfs to generate a 3d shp ensemble based on the bnu soil profile data the direct parameter variances of 3d shp ensemble are not very large over the basin the ensemble variances of the θ s and the k s are less than 0 12 m3 m3 and 1 4 10 6 m s respectively it drives us to consider if the five ptfs are too similar to be dispersive by inspecting the basin region of the two nationwide shp ensembles by dai et al 2013 their results also show small variances for the ch based shp ensemble or the vgm based shp ensemble we believe that the small shp variances are the soil characteristics of the basin it may not be meaningful to compare the vgm based shps with the ch based shps directly because each scheme has a different number of shps 4 parameters in ch and 6 parameters in vgm and the definitions of saturation for their common parameters k and smc are not same if wrf hydro adds a frame of the vgm scheme into the model cross comparison between the ch scheme and the vgm scheme can be performed many studies have discussed the benefits of the vgm scheme instead of the ch scheme e g kleidon and heimann 1998 shao and irannejad 1999 balsamo et al 2009 balsamo et al 2009 replaced ch with vgm in the htessel model and their field experiments show improvements on the prediction of river runoff and soil moisture moreover a wide range of ptfs have already been published for the vgm scheme vereecken et al 1989 vereecken et al 1990 schaap et al 2001 moreover largedatabasesfitting the vgm scheme have been developedindifferentregions over the world includingthe database of hydraulic properties of european soils hypres wösten 2000 therosetta database schaap et al 2001 the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda schaap and leij 1998 and the databases of børgesen et al 2008 and vereecken et al 1989 it s of interest to investigate how the vgm scheme works on the model performance over larger regions after the soil hydrological module can be updated the soil predictors are also important for the shp estimation in addition to the general soil predictors of sand silt and clay in five ptfs the campbell a and the saxton b ptfs added bd and som respectively as a result the transferred shps from campbell a and saxton b showed more spatial variations than those using general soil predictors which indicates the additional soil predictors play an important role in the ptf uncertainty however there is a lack of sufficient site observations to demonstrate whether the estimates of bd and som content over the basin are correct and thus it is not possible to determine which one was more important for intermediate variables and discharge results in the wrf hydro model more researchers have found that the soil predictors could influence the lsm performance greatly han et al 2014 updated the soil moisture and soil properties to clm and found extra soil predictors can greatly influence the land surface performances including soil moisture soil temperature evapotranspiration and heat flux over a forest catchment chen et al 2016 incorporated an organic soil layer into the noah mp and found improvements of soil temperature and soil moisture in deep soils further studies should pay more attention to the bias and reliability of soil properties on the effect of hydrological land surface modeling for the spatial variations in the parameters the mountainous area showed more uncertainties than the central basin and the downstream area however we used one uniform bucket to represent the ground water estimation process over the study basin due to the lack of ground water observation data in addition ground water is associated with baseflow recharging and is thus an important contribution to the river discharge the corresponding parameters can be influenced and contaminated by the ground water process if it is not well represented over regions with diverse topography such as the mountainous area therefore more investigations should be done on different soil predictors hydrological models and sub basins for the ground water process in the future acknowledgements we want to thank david gochis for constructive

6874,parameter calibration and uncertainty estimation are crucial for hydrological simulations in the distributed land surface hydrological model to investigate soil properties impacting hydrological processes five conventional pedo transfer functions ptfs are applied to create a 3d soil hydraulic parameter shp ensemble in the weather research and forecasting hydrological extension wrf hydro a distributed multi physics land surface hydrological model the shps are generated based on a high resolution chinese soil property dataset over the heterogeneous upper huaihe river basin the results show that the shps can influence the streamflow in wrf hydro which is similar to the impact of the scaling parameters on the streamflow over the study basin analyses of the uncertainty in the shp ensemble reveal that shps mainly constrain the peak flow during the flood rise and impact the baseflow during the flood recession a hydrological bayesian model average bma method is constructed to postprocess the streamflow ensemble based on the 3d shps probabilistic streamflow estimations by the bma method are more skillful than the simulations using the individual 3d shp ensemble members for all five studied hydrological stations especially for high flows therefore improved estimation of the uncertainty in the 3d shps may enhance the spatial representation of flood processes resulting in more accurate estimates of the streamflow in the main streams in a heterogeneous basin keywords hydraulic parameter distributed hydrological model wrf hydro uncertainty estimation ensemble 1 introduction the spatial heterogeneity of soil hydraulic properties has always been an important factor influencing the performance of land surface hydrological models shellito et al 2016 stolte et al 2003 van genuchten and nielsen 1985 processes related to the estimation of parameter uncertainties are often associated with multiple physically based hydrological procedures including runoff generation surface infiltration soil water diffusion ground water budget etc in addition with a growing requirement for the model resolution as high as the street scale distributed hydrological models have encountered new challenges associated with spatially distributed hydrological parameters baroni et al 2017 blasone et al 2008 christiaens and feyen 2001 livneh et al 2015 mohanty and zhu 2007 refsgaard 1997 quantifying parameter uncertainties pixel by pixel in a distributed model is extremely difficult in a distributed land surface model lsm using scaling parameters or transferred parameters from land properties are major approaches for parameter estimation chen and dudhia 2001 lawrence et al 2011 liang et al 1994 niu et al 2011 a scaling parameter is a factor associated with one model function parameter estimated from early field experiments or direct measurements although these function parameters are pattern fixed by the early estimation their values can still be adjusted within specified intervals because of observational uncertainty and model compatibility the scaling parameters help to modify the function parameters over a new study area refsgaard 1997 since the scaling parameter is an overall modification of the function parameter it is important for the bias control and uncertainty estimation of the hydrological model over different basins the transferred parameters use multiple land properties soil constituent vegetation constituent etc to generate model function parameters or intermediate variables with empirical transfer functions mcbratney et al 2002 pedo transfer functions ptfs are empirical transfer functions generated from statistical analyses between soil hydraulic parameters shps and independent soil constituents the clapp and hornberger clapp and hornberger 1978 ch function and van genuchten 1980 and mualem 1976 vgm function are two most popular schemes for ptf generation the ch scheme has been widely used by the lsms in north america for climatic and synoptic researches including noah model noah multiparameterization noah mp model common land model clm and variable infiltration capacity vic model chen and dudhia 2001 dai et al 2003 liang et al 1994 niu et al 2011 the vgm scheme is popular in the soil and agricultural models some lsm also added the vgm for ptf generation including the soil and water assessment tool swat soil vegetation atmosphere transfer svat model and the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf developed hydrology tiled ecmwf scheme for surface exchanges over land htessel model arnold and fohrer 2005 balsamo et al 2009 nrcs 1998 despite the large number of ptfs used in land surface hydrological models their accuracies still need more investigations cornelis et al 2001 mcbratney et al 2002 tietje and hennings 1996 christiaens and feyen 2001 evaluated four approaches including two ptfs for the shp estimation in mike she model and found that discharge ground water and soil water were markedly impacted by the shp uncertainty baroni et al 2010 investigated the uncertainties of shps by the intercomparison of two hydrological models and demonstrated that the discrepancies caused by different shp estimation methods in a same model are larger than that of model differences rieger et al 2010 used a distributed rainfall runoff model to simulate flood events seven different ptfs showed strong influences on the soil parameterization in the model and had noticeable uncertainties for the simulated hydrographs soil predictors are important for the ptf generation vereecken et al 2010 pointed out that the uncertainty in ptfs lies in the spatial temporal variability of the soil predictors soil texture bulk density soil water content organic matter etc due to measurement restrictions quality control and sample collection therefore a ptf with good performance at its representative site may result in problematic relationships beyond that site soil predictors also influence the ptfs pachepsky and rawls 2004 and wösten et al 2001 suggested that including more soil matters in the soil predictors is necessary for constructing robust relationships between ptfs and shps for example rawls et al 2003 shows that adding organic carbon content to soil texture can improve soil water retention estimation therefore a deterministic ptf may suffer from strong uncertainty in terms of hydrological model performance while the ptf ensemble technique could be a better way to estimate model shps cichota et al 2013 dai et al 2013 guber et al 2006 research on the ptf ensemble has mainly focused on water flow and solute transport processes in lsms for example guber et al 2009 used the hydrus 1d code to evaluate 19 published ptfs over a meadow field located in bekkevoort belgium the soil moisture estimate was most accurate at different layers with appropriate postprocessing methods including applying weight averaging and bayesian method to the model outputs cichota et al 2013 proposed an ptf ensemble based on the new zealand soil dataset using the agricultural production systems simulator model for soil water content simulation their results indicated that ensemble ptf based water content was more reliable than the hydraulic conductivity as the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity from the ptf ensemble was generally under predicted compared with the measurements liao et al 2014 studied the hydraulic properties over the forestland soil in china based on six published ptfs and concluded that the ptf ensemble method was valuable for simulating the soil water content of forestland the application of the ptf ensemble methods can improve the estimation of soil hydraulic properties although popular ptfs were developed from early studies in field sites in europe vereecken et al 1990 vereecken et al 1989 wagner et al 2001 wösten 1997 wösten et al 1999 and usa rawls and brakensiek 1989 saxton and rawls 2006 few studies in china have analyzed ptf uncertainty or the application of ensemble ptf in land surface hydrological models it is important to study the compatibility and uncertainty of widely used ptfs in models in order to improve their application over chinese basins recently the land atmosphere interaction research group at beijing normal university bnu now at sun yat sen university updated a state of the art china soil dataset derived from high resolution soil maps and the best measurements available in china aiming to enhance the studies of the land surface hydrological system and ecosystem shangguan et al 2014 2013 based on the new soil profile dataset dai et al 2013 proposed a framework of five member ptfs to convert soil data to high resolution spatially distributed shps 3d shps the results show that the shps vary markedly from multiple ptfs over china to date further implementation of shps in lsms or distributed hydrological models is rare in this study the bnu soil property data is used to generate 3d shps for the richards equation based on the ptf ensemble of dai et al 2013 to study the hydrological parameter uncertainties the wrf hydro land surface hydrological model which is distributed and multi physical based is selected to apply the shp ensemble previous studies of parameter uncertainties in wrf hydro simulations focused on the scaling parameters in mountainous regions ryu et al 2017 yucel et al 2015 or dryland in africa arnault et al 2016 but the shps were not discussed due to the heterogeneity in the soil properties usually the shps are considered to be less sensitive than the scaling parameters however wet plain basins can have completely different results than drier areas due to the different behaviours of soil water retention water infiltration and precipitation in this study the upper huaihe river basin is a typical plain dominated region characterized by heterogeneous and moist soil it is of interest to investigate the relative importance of the scaling parameters or 3d shps on the streamflow simulations over the study basin the objectives of this paper are to analyze the relative uncertainties of the 3d shps and scaling parameters in the streamflow simulation over the upper huaihe river basin investigate the mechanism and influence of different 3d shps on the streamflow and evaluate the ability of the probabilistic postprocessing method to improve the ensemble streamflow based on the shps the rest part of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the upper huaihe river basin and datasets used in this study section 3 describes the wrf hydro model and model parameters as well as the calibration and postprocessing methods the results using the scaling parameters the 3d shp ensemble and the probabilistic bma simulations are provided in section 4 followed by discussion and conclusions in section 5 2 study area and datasets 2 1 study region the huaihe river basin located in the middle region between the yangtze river and yellow river has a drainage area of approximately 270 000 km2 a typical east asian monsoon climate results in a warm season june september with torrential rain and flash flooding the average annual precipitation is approximately 900 mm over the basin due to the thousands of reservoirs and floodgates built in the region zhang et al 2012 the upper region of the huaihe river basin fig 1 delineated by the bengbu gauging station on the middle stream of the huaihe river is selected for our study because it has relatively less human regulation and population the study basin features a drainage area of approximately 121 300 km2 over 70 of the basin area is dominated by an interior floodplain while the western edge is bounded by two mountain ranges the dabie mountains in the south and funiu mountains in the north the basin elevation ranges from approximately 300 m to 2000 m 2 2 datasets the wrf hydro model should first be calibrated in an uncoupled offline model before further applications in a coupled model with the weather research and forecasting wrf model the offline model needs meteorological forcing data including surface downwelling shortwave longwave flux air temperature specific air humidity air pressure near surface wind in the u and v components and liquid precipitation rate to drive both the land surface and hydrological schemes format and technical details of the forcing variables are described in gochis et al 2016 since the conventional hydrological or meteorological stations over the study region lack a complete record of the forcing variables for the wrf hydro model a combined data set of meteorological analyses and gauging observations is adopted and utilized as the forcing data including analyses from the global land data assimilation system gldas ek et al 2003 rodell et al 2004 sheffield et al 2006 the analysis data from the global forecast system gfs and the climate prediction center cpc morphing technique cmorph satellite gauge merged quantitative precipitation estimates qpes xie and xiong 2011 yu et al 2015 with spatial resolutions of 0 25 0 25 0 5 0 5 and 0 1 0 1 respectively the gldas data have been widely used for land surface simulations due to the high data resolution good quality control and compatibility of the most meteorological forcing variables but it lacks data on the wind u v components thus the corresponding gfs analysis data are used as a substitute the precipitation forcing data is the most important component during the procedure of hydrological model calibration sun et al 2016 evaluated four of the latest satellite based qpes in china and found that the cmorph satellite gauge merged product provided by the national meteorological information center nmic of the china meteorological administration cma had the best performance among the studied datasets in hydrometeorological simulations of the upper huaihe river basin intensive ground based observations merged with data from approximately 2400 meteorological stations over china are the main reason for the better performance of the cmorph cma precipitation dataset shen and xiong 2016 yu et al 2015 according to the independent validation by yu et al 2015 the cmorph cma precipitation dataset has the highest correlation coefficients and the lowest bias both in temporal variation and spatial distribution therefore it is used as the forcing precipitation data these three sets of forcing data are spatially interpolated into the wrf hydro model grid with spatial and temporal resolutions of 3 km and 6 h respectively using the bilinear interpolation method the 1 h accumulated precipitation of cmorph cma is aggregated to 6 h data to calculate the rain rate in the unit of mm s the daily discharge records china 2011 2013 of 5 hydrological stations fig 1 from 2010 to 2012 were selected for evaluating hydrological performance in space the 5 stations are distributed on the main stream of the huaihe river from the eastern outlet bengbu to the western mountainous station xixian in the study region the lsm soil profile data come from bnu based on the 1 1 000 000 soil map derived from the second national soil survey of china which includes 8595 representative soil profiles with 33 039 soil horizons at national and provincial levels shangguan et al 2013 the data are available at a horizontal resolution of 30 30 arc second geographical and at a vertical resolution of eight vertical layers to a depth of 2 296 m and the data include easily measured soil matrices such as the sand silt clay percentages bulk density bd and soil organic matter som this dataset is then converted into wrf hydro grids and layers 3 3 km horizontal grids and vertical layers of 0 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 4 1 0 and 1 0 2 0 m via bilinear interpolation and weight averaging by layer thickness respectively for model utilization chinese soil profiles are measured based on the international society of soil science isss and katschinski schemes katschinski 1956 however the noah mp model uses the soil texture classes of the food and agriculture organization u s department of agriculture fao usda system thus the soil profiles have to be converted to soil category indices that conform to the fao usda standards via the soil texture triangle soil survey staff 1993 the conventional noah and noah mp lsms use vertically uniform soil category indices and the model parameters or variables need to be linked to the indices via corresponding lookup tables as a default run of wrf hydro we choose the first layer of the bnu soil profile to generate soil category indices and link the indices to 2d shp through lookup tables consistent with the noah mp lsm setting the 3d shp run will be described in section 3 2 3 methodology 3 1 model description the offline wrf hydro v3 0 gochis et al 2016 contains the noah mp land surface processes niu et al 2011 and hydrological modules one single wrf based inner domain fig 1 is chosen to cover the upper huaihe river basin with a land surface and hydrological grid spacing of 3 km and 150 m respectively nested domain is not considered in this study to simplify computation the offline wrf hydro was spun up firstly for as long as 5 years the initial and boundary conditions of atmospheric variables such as downwelling shortwave longwave flux air temperature specific air humidity air pressure and liquid precipitation rate come from the ncep gldas data and u v wind components are provided by the ncep gfs analysis data and the initial land surface variables before spin up use the fixed values embedded in the wrf hydro model noah mp model after spin up the mean soil conditions of the area e g soil moisture soil temperature and surface evaporation had reached a stable state with variations less than 1 between two adjacent years and then these variables can be used as real initial land surface conditions in next model simulation e g the model calibration the second half of the water year 1 june to 30 november in 2010 is used for the scaling parameter calibration and shp ensemble tests and the subsequent 2 years 1 january 2011 to 31 december 2012 are used for the model validation the validation uses the soil status variables at the end of the calibration period as initial land surface conditions both the calibration and validation apply the offline wrf hydro for simulations with the atmospheric initial and boundary conditions from the forcing data coupling wrf hydro with wrf is not considered in this study first the noah mp lsm has a hydrology scheme jarvis 1976 performed on individual soil columns with only vertical water exchanges between different soil layers there are no lateral exchanges between the soil columns in the noah mp lsm the runoff infiltration partitioning equation is used by noah mp lsm to calculate water head and surface runoff 1 r h t p d p d p d d x 1 exp i r δ t d x δ z i θ s θ i a n d i r i r 0 k s k ref surface runoff r is defined as the infiltration capacity excess p d is the precipitation on the soil surface h is the water depth d x is the

equations ψ ψ s θ θ s β and k k s θ θ s 2 β 3 provided by clapp and hornberger 1978 where β is an index depending on the pore size distribution and k s and ψ s depend on the soil type and f θ represents sources and sinks chen and dudhia 2001 following the lsm hydrological process the hydrological modules of wrf hydro redistribute the land surface and soil water onto the sub grid by routing processes infiltration capacity excess ponded surface water depth and soil moisture from the noah mp lsm are subsequently disaggregated from the 1d soil column to the high resolution 150 m routing grid via a spatially weighted algorithm gochis and chen 2003 and passed to the routing modules including the four major routing modules subsurface routing overland routing bucket model and channel routing lake and reservoir are not considered in this paper senatore et al 2015 yucel et al 2015 3 2 hydrological parameters the scaling parameter of wrf hydro plays a role in bias control for the specific model functions the major scaling parameters examined in our study include the runoff infiltration partitioning parameter i r soil bottom drainage partition p dr water retention depth factor h sf and surface roughness factor r sf table 1 table 1 gives a description of the major scaling parameters and shps see the next section in the wrf hydro model the recommended ranges and default values of the scaling parameters are based on the operational national water model over the entire continental united states the shps are important for the soil hydraulic process in the wrf hydro model the default shps are vertically uniform 2d parameters based on the lookup table and soil category indices however for the 3d shps the lsm module of wrf hydro uses 3d shps directly from an external file for the lsm grids and layers users need to prepare the corresponding external file additionally to create the 3d shps dai et al 2013 suggested the ch scheme and the vgm scheme to generate ptf ensembles each scheme adopted five ptfs over nationwide since the noah mp lsm is not compatible with the vgm ptfs we adopted the five ch ptfs to map the interpolated bnu soil profile data to 3d shps table 2 gives a short description of five ptfs including 2 ptfs provided by cosby et al 1984 cosby a and cosby b hereafter 2 ptfs provided by saxton et al 1986 and saxton and rawls 2006 saxton a and saxton b hereafter and 1 ptf by campbell and shiozawa 1992 campbell a hereafter and their associated soil predictors the most commonly used soil predictors are sand clay and silt contents although saxton b and campbell a also included bd and som into the ptfs note that the 2d shp relationships between the lookup table and soil category indices are based on cosby b the soil category indices of 2d shps are generated from the soil profile data for the first soil layer while the 3d shps of cosby b use soil profile data from all four soil layers as described before the 3d shps of cosby b and the default 2d shps are similar for the first layer but there are more differences for the other layers 3 3 calibration and postprocessing methods the scaling parameters table 1 are calibrated with a stepwise approach yucel et al 2015 in the order of i r p dr h sf and r sf according to the recommended intervals since the bengbu station is the basin outlet its discharge is used for the objective functions for deterministic verification the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nsce is the major verification score while the root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc are also evaluated once a scaling parameter is calibrated the parameter is fixed for the next calibration the default 2d shps are used when calibrating the scaling parameters after the scaling parameters are calibrated 3d shps are used to create an ensemble streamflow simulation the bma duan et al 2007 hoeting et al 1999 raftery et al 2005 method is adopted to postprocess the ensemble discharges from the five shps the major bma process is based on duan et al 2007 but the posterior distribution has been modified assuming that the cube root of the discharge follows a gamma distribution the 5 95 interval of the bma cumulative distribution function cdf is used as the postprocessed probabilistic interval the reliability diagram and brier skill score bss are used for probabilistic verification jolliffe and stephenson 2003 4 results 4 1 scaling parameter vs 3d shps in this section the uncertainty of the scaling parameters and 3d shps and their relative influences on the streamflow are evaluated the detailed analyses about the variability and hydraulic feature of 3d shps will be discussed in the next section when four scaling parameters are calibrated with a step wise approach the shps are fixed with the default 2d shps the scaling parameters of h sf and r sf are not sensitive during the calibration period and their discharge uncertainty intervals are under 200 m3 s at bengbu and four other hydrological stations not shown this behaviour is probably because the surface water retention and surface roughness only impact a thin layer of the surface water which has a small fraction of the soil water content in a wet basin fig 2 a and b show the discharge uncertainty intervals at the bengbu station during the calibration period jun 1st to nov 30th 2010 for the scaling parameters i r fig 2a and p dr fig 2b respectively fig 2c represents the discharge uncertainty interval from the 3d shp ensemble after the scaling parameters are calibrated i r and p dr can be regarded as the bias control for the surface infiltration and soil bottom drainage respectively while the 3d shps are site specific as the results show i r mainly affects the two peaks around july 26 and september 10 with a range of approximately 2000 m3 s while p dr and 3d shps have more impacts on the recession periods i r was considered to be the most sensitive parameter of wrf hydro for surface runoff and streamflow according to arnault et al 2016 however the discharge uncertainty intervals of the parameter p dr fig 2b and 3d shps fig 2c are much larger than the uncertainty interval of i r fig 2a at the bengbu station the other four hydrological stations have similar results not shown this discrepancy is probably because the dominant land surface in the upper huaihe river basin is a flat plain with relatively high soil moisture and therefore differs from the steeper or drier conditions in mountainous or sandy soil basins such as arnault et al 2016 therefore in our study area surface infiltration may have less influence on the surface water distribution as fig 3 a shows the dominant soil textures along the huaihe river are loam and clay including clay loam in the northeastern part silty clay in the northwestern area and silt loam in the southern basin the rich soil loam and clay has higher soil moisture contents and lower hydraulic conductivity values thus this soil more easily reaches saturation during the rainy season than dominantly sandy or silty soils meanwhile the huaihe river basin is characterized by a monsoon climate that brings a large amount of precipitation to the basin in summer consequently the soil in the basin generally maintains a high soil moisture content fig 3b gives the relative soil moisture content percentage for the first soil layer at the end of spin up on may 31 2010 and most of the loam and clay soils have reached over 80 saturation the soil condition eventually affects the surface runoff generation while ground water can be extracted from the aquifer and contribute to the streamflow since i r is negatively correlated with the specific soil moisture eq 1 it becomes less sensitive when wet soil is dominant during the runoff infiltration partitioning process on the contrary p dr bottom drainage and shps soil water movement are positively correlated with the soil moisture content when the soil water content is close to saturation changes in the soil water conductivity and diffusivity or the bottom drainage tend to have more impacts on the soil condition and ground water than when the soil is dry therefore the parameter p dr and the shps are as important as i r over the upper huaihe river basin 4 2 the shp ensemble there are still large uncertainties in the ptfs for the estimation of shps dai et al 2013 mcbratney et al 2002 vereecken et al 2010 our research aims to investigate the influences of different shps on the streamflow simulation over the upper huaihe river basin fig 4 shows four default 2d shps column 1 used to estimate the richards equation and their deviations from 3d shp ensemble derived from five ptfs columns 2 6 for the first soil layer first of all the cosby types columns 3 and 4 are similar to the 2d shps derived from soil texture index because they are based on the same ptfs proposed by cosby et al 1984 note that the 2d shps are converted from soil category indices according to the lookup table while the 3d shps are converted from soil profile data using ptfs directly therefore there is still a little deviation over the silt loam soil area the southern basin and mountainous regions columns 3 and 4 in general campbell a column 2 has an increase in θ s although there is little change along the main streams of the huaihe river where loam soil is dominant fig 4 a2 at the same time campbell a shows the strongest decrease in k s and the largest increase in β compared with parameters in other members the d s has a considerable decrease over the southern basin consequently the changes in k s d s and β reduce water conductivity and diffusion and the comprehensive change in θ s increases the soil water capacity fig 5 for saxton a fig 4 column 5 this member has the greatest θ s increase and the strongest d s decrease over most of the basin compared with other members meanwhile k s has a slight decrease and β has a strongest decrease over the central basin saxton b fig 4 column 6 shows a slight decrease in θ s while its other three shps are similar to saxton a with only small differences the influences of the shps on the streamflow vary differently for the flood rise period and flood recession period fig 5 conceptually illustrates the influences of shp changes on surface runoff and baseflow based on the example of campbell a during the flood rise the soil is not yet close to the saturation thus parameters related to soil water movement d s k s and β and soil water capacity θ s become more important in surface runoff generation than they are for nearly saturated soil when k s and d s decrease or β increases the soil water movement is reduced causing more water retention at the surface and weaker infiltration ability consequently the surface water increases surface runoff generation and flood volume in contrast an increase in θ s results in more soil water capacity favouring surface infiltration and reducing surface runoff since the variations in θ s and β are approximately 10 of their absolute values over the study basin fig 4 rows 1 and 4 the variations are relatively small compared with other shps thus the parameters θ s and β may have less effect on streamflow than k s and d s during the flood recession the soil water has already been close to saturation especially for the soil around the main streams in the central basin after the main rainy events the shps of soil water movement mainly influence the speed of ground water charging when k s and d s decrease or β increases the charging speed correspondingly decreases and thus reduces the baseflow or the ground water recession flow baseflow is the fundamental flow and differs from the flood wave hence it mainly influences the flood recession after the peak in the flood recession θ s has less effect on the baseflow since only the rate of saturation influences the baseflow recharge when the soil columns are close to saturation fig 6 represents the river discharges simulated with the 3d shp ensemble and the default 2d shps in fig 6a the discharges of two cosby types are both close to the 2d shp discharge due to similar shps one rapid rise after the second peak on approximately september 14 is the major deviation between the cosby types and the 2d original for the two cosby types the 3d shps in the other soil layers provide different values from the first soil layer therefore the rapid rise must be caused by the accumulated effects of the shp differences with the 2d shps in the four soil layers the campbell a shps have the slowest soil water movement among the shp members although the area mean θ s for the first soil layer has a positive deviation from the 2d θ s there are negative deviations along the main streams of the huaihe river therefore d s k s and β mainly help campbell a to increase the streamflow around the two peak times as illustrated in fig 5 for the flood recession period especially after the second peak campbell a presents the lowest recession flow among the shp members consistent with fig 5 the changes in d s k s and β in campbell a lead to the largest decrease in soil water movement after the major rainy events before the second peak time in 2010 the ground water charging speed of campbell a is much slower than that of other members which results in a rapid drop in the baseflow discharge and a much faster flood recession than the other members the saxton a and saxton b shps can also be explained by fig 5 compared to campbell a the saxton a shps have relatively faster soil water movement and a generally higher θ s these shp trends in saxton a lead to less surface runoff during the flood rise and excessive baseflow during the flood recession relative to campbell a fig 6a purple line saxton b has similar deviations in k s d s and β as saxton a but with weaker values however its decrease trend of θ s is opposite that of saxton a over most of the basin therefore saxton b results in the largest surface runoff and a longer flood recession fig 6a brown line because its shp variations cause an increase in surface runoff applying these methods to other hydrological stations over the upper huaihe river basin results in similar conclusions the simulations at the fuyang and lutaizi stations fig 6b c which are located in the downstream reach of the basin with stream orders bigger than 5 maximum stream order is 7 suffer two common defects similar to the bengbu station the protracted recession and the overestimated peaks after september the highest peaks are underestimated at the western stations including xixian and wangjiaba fig 6d e since the calibration for scaling parameters treats the bengbu station as the reference the shps in mountainous areas have larger variability than those in the plain thus the scaling parameters calibrated in our study may not be suitable for the high elevation stations and a sub basin calibration is recommended for those areas in the future the scores of five stations table 3 are consistent with the analyses above for five 3d shps campbell a obtains the highest scores in terms of rmse nsce and cc due to its better ability to capture the discharge peak and comparatively short recession time saxton a and saxton b are able to obtain high cc values but poor nsce scores mostly because they overestimate the streamflow cosby a and cosby b do not surpass the 2d shp scores because the cosby scores are influenced by the rapid increase in discharge during the second heavy rain period fig 7 shows the discharges during the verification period similar to the calibration period campbell a has the best performance among the shps and 2d shps for larger discharges at five stations although campbell a has comparatively better performance all members underestimate the streamflow peaks especially from july to september in 2011 the stations close to the basin boundary xixian and wangjiaba underestimate the peak more than the downstream stations bengbu fuyang and lutaizi in general the shp ensemble has a better ability to capture the flow peaks than the 2d simulation however the ensemble derived from the multiple ptfs is still underdispersive therefore the probabilistic postprocessing method may be a better approach for streamflow estimation and flood warning 4 3 bma postprocessing the above analyses reveal that shps have uncertainties as large as the scaling parameters in the wrf hydro model over the upper huaihe river basin the ensemble approach may be a better choice to estimate the streamflow probabilistically and mitigate the flood risks in our study the hydrological bma postprocessing method is applied to the ensemble streamflow simulations generated by the five 3d shps to create probabilistic estimates fig 8 shows the bma probabilistic estimates of streamflow during the calibration period the bma statistical model was trained with the ensemble streamflow at the bengbu station since the scaling parameters are calibrated at the bengbu station for all the hydrological stations the 90 from 5 to 95 bma cdf intervals of discharge cover the observations very well the cover rates are 85 8 77 6 92 3 95 1 and 97 8 at the bengbu fuyang lutaizi wangjiaba and xixian stations respectively the peaks are captured well within the 90 interval at the bengbu and lutaizi stations fig 8a c in contrast a peak delay occurs at the fuyang station fig 8b while the simulations at the wangjiaba and xixian stations suffer from both peak delay and peak underestimation fig 8d e the bma deterministic estimation with the 50 cdfs blue dashed lines has a similar skill as the ensemble mean discharge orange dashed lines at all the stations probabilistic verifications and the corresponding statistical scores of the bma results are given in figs 9 and 10 to ensure the large sample size in the probabilistic verification probabilistic scores of the bma estimations are calculated for the 2 year verification period totalling 731 days as fig 9a e show the 90 bma intervals can capture most events with cover rates of 97 3 83 0 99 6 99 7 and 99 7 at the five stations which are better than those of the relatively wet years during the calibration period since the bma model was trained over a period that was comparatively wetter than the verification period the postprocessed probabilistic streamflow tends to capture the large discharge events therefore the upper bound of the bma probabilistic streamflow 95 cdf can cover the peaks better during the verification period than during the calibration period during the verification period the 95 cdf is able to depict the streamflow peaks while most shp members underestimate the events especially at the wangjiaba and xixian stations on the other hand the bma probabilistic results still have defects for smaller streamflow values for example fig 9a shows that the 90 bma interval is excessively wide for streamflow values less than 1000 m3 s this result is because the hypothesis of the gamma distribution in the bma model has more variability near zero where the flow is discrete and the continuous equation cannot simulate it well as a result the bma intervals are more overdispersive for smaller discharges than for the peaks also the probabilistic evaluation reveals that the bma results under the 50 cdf have poor performances inefficient reliability and negative bsss at all stations fig 10a e show reliability diagrams at 50 70 and 90 of the discharge at five hydrological stations during the verification period almost all stations show reasonable reliabilities reliability curves close to the diagonal except for high probabilities at the fuyang station fig 10b which perhaps result from the phase shift of the peaks at fuyang the high quantiles of the discharge at bengbu and lutaizi fig 10a c are slightly overestimated while the simulations at xixian and wangjiaba fig 10d e are overdispersive according to the large deviations from the diagonal fig 10f shows the bsss bma results against 2d shps discharge at the thresholds of 50 70 and 90 of the observed discharge at the five stations the positive bsss suggest that bma probabilistic results greatly improved the original ensemble simulations at all stations for the bengbu and lutaizi stations the simulations are already improved by calibrating the scaling parameters thus the skill gains associated with the bma method are less than those of the other three stations for other stations the improvements most bsss over 0 5 dramatically increase with the discharge thresholds indicating that the bma probabilistic estimations preferentially benefit the peak flows 5 summary and conclusions quantifying the parameter uncertainty in a distributed hydrological model can be very challenging when model parameters are site specific especially for large scale basins the best approach for analysing the parameter uncertainty is to associate the parameters with intermediate observations based on their physical implications in hydrological processes there are limited studies about applying spatially distributed shps with a physically based land surface hydrological model to chinese basins due to a lack of good quality soil profile data the development of a state of the art soil dataset for lsms has motivated the study of physical land surface hydrological models based on precise land information previous studies ryu et al 2017 yucel et al 2015 arnault et al 2016 focused more on the scaling parameters than on the other hydrological parameters in the wrf hydro model however at all the hydrological stations in our study the uncertainties of streamflow simulations due to the 3d shps derived from multiple ptfs are comparable to that caused by the scaling parameters in general the heterogeneous upper huaihe river basin has relatively flat terrain and moist soils resulting in the surface conditions that differ from those of sandy or mountainous regions when soil is close to saturation the sensitivities of land surface infiltration and bottom drainage mainly controlled by scaling parameters are reduced while the soil water movement mainly controlled by shps remains sensitive thereby influencing runoff generation and ground water recharging therefore the estimation of the shps is critical for hydrological simulations over the wet upper huaihe river basin the wrf hydro simulations of the shp ensemble members show that the shps can have different impacts on model discharges during different flood phases during the flood rise the shps of soil water movement k s d s and β and soil water capacity θ s mainly constrained the streamflow peaks during the flood recession the shps of soil water movement strongly influenced the rate of baseflow recharging and the flood recession time while the shp of soil water capacity had little effect on the baseflow since the soil was nearly saturated after the flood rise the ensemble analyses can help to better understand the uncertainties and the effects of the shps with the bma postprocessing of the shp ensemble streamflow the probabilistic discharge estimations improved cover rate and forecast skill for high streamflow values over the basin to estimate the uncertainties of shps over the upper huaihe river basin we adopted five ptfs to generate a 3d shp ensemble based on the bnu soil profile data the direct parameter variances of 3d shp ensemble are not very large over the basin the ensemble variances of the θ s and the k s are less than 0 12 m3 m3 and 1 4 10 6 m s respectively it drives us to consider if the five ptfs are too similar to be dispersive by inspecting the basin region of the two nationwide shp ensembles by dai et al 2013 their results also show small variances for the ch based shp ensemble or the vgm based shp ensemble we believe that the small shp variances are the soil characteristics of the basin it may not be meaningful to compare the vgm based shps with the ch based shps directly because each scheme has a different number of shps 4 parameters in ch and 6 parameters in vgm and the definitions of saturation for their common parameters k and smc are not same if wrf hydro adds a frame of the vgm scheme into the model cross comparison between the ch scheme and the vgm scheme can be performed many studies have discussed the benefits of the vgm scheme instead of the ch scheme e g kleidon and heimann 1998 shao and irannejad 1999 balsamo et al 2009 balsamo et al 2009 replaced ch with vgm in the htessel model and their field experiments show improvements on the prediction of river runoff and soil moisture moreover a wide range of ptfs have already been published for the vgm scheme vereecken et al 1989 vereecken et al 1990 schaap et al 2001 moreover largedatabasesfitting the vgm scheme have been developedindifferentregions over the world includingthe database of hydraulic properties of european soils hypres wösten 2000 therosetta database schaap et al 2001 the unsaturated soil hydraulic database unsoda schaap and leij 1998 and the databases of børgesen et al 2008 and vereecken et al 1989 it s of interest to investigate how the vgm scheme works on the model performance over larger regions after the soil hydrological module can be updated the soil predictors are also important for the shp estimation in addition to the general soil predictors of sand silt and clay in five ptfs the campbell a and the saxton b ptfs added bd and som respectively as a result the transferred shps from campbell a and saxton b showed more spatial variations than those using general soil predictors which indicates the additional soil predictors play an important role in the ptf uncertainty however there is a lack of sufficient site observations to demonstrate whether the estimates of bd and som content over the basin are correct and thus it is not possible to determine which one was more important for intermediate variables and discharge results in the wrf hydro model more researchers have found that the soil predictors could influence the lsm performance greatly han et al 2014 updated the soil moisture and soil properties to clm and found extra soil predictors can greatly influence the land surface performances including soil moisture soil temperature evapotranspiration and heat flux over a forest catchment chen et al 2016 incorporated an organic soil layer into the noah mp and found improvements of soil temperature and soil moisture in deep soils further studies should pay more attention to the bias and reliability of soil properties on the effect of hydrological land surface modeling for the spatial variations in the parameters the mountainous area showed more uncertainties than the central basin and the downstream area however we used one uniform bucket to represent the ground water estimation process over the study basin due to the lack of ground water observation data in addition ground water is associated with baseflow recharging and is thus an important contribution to the river discharge the corresponding parameters can be influenced and contaminated by the ground water process if it is not well represented over regions with diverse topography such as the mountainous area therefore more investigations should be done on different soil predictors hydrological models and sub basins for the ground water process in the future acknowledgements we want to thank david gochis for constructive
