23865,in this study altimeter based sea surface height anomaly ssha observations from the jason 3 altimeter are assimilated in a high resolution indian ocean model and the impact of assimilation is analysed in the bay of bengal region the study uses a 3 d primitive equation numerical ocean model forced with analysed atmospheric data to generate ocean state for a particular period in this case from the year 2018 to study the impact of ssha assimilation two sets of model outputs are generated one in which no ssha is assimilated ctrl r and the other in which along track ssha from the jason 3 satellite is assimilated assim r using ensemble optimum interpolation technique the impact of assimilation is primarily analysed on ocean surface currents for this purpose satellite derived sea surface currents and buoy based vertical current profiles are used to evaluate ctrl r and assim r it is found that there is a profound improvement in ocean current simulation after assimilation of ssha mesoscale eddies that were weak and misplaced in ctrl r have now improved in assim r in terms of both strength and position sub surface current simulation from assim r exhibits observed variability in most of the evaluation period which was absent in the ctrl r computed statistics show much improved 15 35 ocean current simulations in assim r at all the depths particle trajectory analysis has been performed and it is seen that assimilated model velocity fields faithfully simulate the observed trajectory of tracers power spectra of simulated ssha from both assim r and ctrl r were compared with spectra from satellite ssha and it is found that after assimilation the slopes of the simulated spectra become much closer to slope of spectra from the observations these results indicate that the along track assimilation of ssha improves the model analysis and thereby provides accurate initial conditions for model forecast keywords satellite altimeter sea surface height anomaly ocean models assimilation 1 introduction estimation and forecast of oceanic flow is very crucial for safer and efficient navigation numerical ocean models are generally used to forecast the ocean surface currents for next 24 120 h which are then provided to the users for their operational use an accurate estimation of ocean surface and sub surface currents is extremely important for their impact on societal and research needs several activities pertaining to socioeconomic aspects such as maritime trade shipping navigation marine pollution and safety are directly controlled by surface currents isern fontanet et al 2017 indirectly surface currents have a key role to play in potential fishing zone activity and climate change related impacts recognizing its importance surface currents have been recognized as one of the essential climate variables bojinski et al 2014 there are different ways to obtain ocean surface currents ranging from derived information from space based instruments to in situ based measurements such as lagrangian drifters moored buoys radars launch of topex poseidon and ers 1 2 altimeter missions in early 1990s paved the way for near real time global maps of geostrophic currents estimates from satellites yet another means to get direct current estimates from space based instruments is by measuring doppler effect which can be translated to ocean surface current and this is the principle which is used to derive currents from synthetic aperture radar chapron et al 2005 however because of the near real time and globally available altimeter datasets researchers and forecasters have commonly used sea level measurements from space borne altimeter systems chelton et al 2001 fu and cazenave 2000 fu and chelton 2001 morrow and le traon 2012 stammer and cazenave 2017 there are several operational agencies that routinely assimilate both satellite and insitu observations in global as well as regional numerical models to improve the forecasts karmakar et al 2018 made an inter comparison of these reanalyses and brought the strength and weaknesses in each of the products indian national centre for ocean information services incois assimilates temperature salinity profiles from argo floats buoys and ship based observations they also assimilate satellite track sst into their high resolution regional modelling system baduru et al 2019 there are many studies that have discussed the impact of sla on thermocline depth mixed layer depth costa and tanajura 2015 chakraborty et al 2015 ratheesh et al 2014 however none of these have discussed the detailed impact of assimilation on simulated currents in the bay of bengal region in this study we specifically focus on the impact of altimeter derived sea surface height anomaly assimilation on model simulated currents in the bay of bengal the motivation behind present study has been driven by two aspects firstly we wanted to develop a data assimilative system to carry out observation system sensitivity experiments osse in the wake of current and upcoming altimeter satellite missions especially the swot mission and secondly we wanted to assess how faithfully ocean currents both surface and sub surface and mesoscale eddies can be simulated after assimilating along track altimeter data in a model which is specifically configured for bob the basin being unique in several perspectives an additional motive has been to set up a da system that ingests altimeter data in a regional perspective towards setting up an analysis forecasting system with these objectives in mind the present study focusses on two experiments performed for the year 2018 first is the control run ctrl r where no data is assimilated and the other is the experimental run assim r where along track nadir altimeter data has been assimilated different aspects of model set up are discussed in section 2 followed by a description of various data that have been used in this study in section 3 section 4 details about the assimilation technique implementation and experiments performed analysis and assessment of simulations using satellite and in situ data are presented in section 5 the same section also presents a detailed analysis of trajectory simulations and power spectral density psd carried out using the twin simulations section 6 summarizes the findings and presents conclusions 2 model configuration 2 1 model domain and bathymetry the model used in this study is the modified version of modular ocean model pacanovsky and griffies 1999 version 3 0 hereafter referred as mvmom3 and is the same model which was used by mallick et al 2020 2019 2018 the model domain consisted of varying horizontal resolution of uniform 0 1 0 1 in the northern part of io 55 e 100 e and 10 s 23 n and reaches a minimum up to 1 in the rest of the domain fig 1 it has 50 depths z levels with top 14 levels in the upper 36 m the first level is at 1 m depth and deepest 50th level is at 5320 m a finer vertical resolution with successive depth interval of 2 5 m was allocated in the top 12 levels and reaches a maximum depth interval of 590 m near the ocean bottom the bathymetry field was extracted from the modified version of earth topography 2 min etopo 2 of sindhu et al 2007 and is remapped to the model grid is as used by mallick et al 2018 2019 southern and eastern boundaries of the model domain are subjected to sponge boundary conditions with relaxation towards climatological temperature and salinity profiles in mvmom3 0 river runoff is applied as virtual salt flux pacanovsky and griffies 1999 monthly climatology of river runoff r for ganga brahmaputra derived from altimeter observations papa et al 2010 has been used in the model runoff discharge from other prominent rivers that flow into bob irrawaddy damodar and godavari has been taken from vorosmarty et al 1998 2 2 model initialization the model is initialized for the year 2018 using the existing model runs available up to 2017 the spin up runs and other details are presented in mallick et al 2020 the entire simulation until 2018 and thereon was forced with the same forcing as described in section 3 1 the exchange coefficients for the estimation of momentum heat and freshwater fluxes have been computed using coare 3 0 flux formulation details of flux formulations are documented in fairall et al 1996 which was implemented by mallick et al 2020 in mvmom3 where fluxes are iteratively solved by improving the stability functions scalar transfer coefficients a wind dependent parameter and roughness length the model sea surface salinity sss is relaxed to the monthly climatological values of sss with a restoring time scale of 180 days while there is no relaxation applied to the sea surface temperature 3 data

records gdr of sea surface height anomaly ssha from jason3 are used these are along track observations and are quality controlled with best possible corrections applied lillibridge 2020 these data are available at https www ncei noaa gov data oceans jason3 gdr gdr ssha validation data the multi mission gridded absolute dynamic topography adt data available from archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso http www oceanobs aviso com have been used in this work to study the mesoscale features in the bay of bengal bob these are gridded products level 4 and are generated using observation from multiple altimeters the altimeter products were produced by ssalto duacs and distributed by aviso with support from cnes http www aviso altimetry fr duacs the spatial and temporal resolution of these data is 25 km and one day respectively daily gridded data of satellite derived surface currents with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were used these data are derived from satellite observations of ssha sst and sea surface winds using the algorithm based on quasi linear and steady state physics sikhakolli et al 2013 bonjean and lagerloef 2002 and are available from www mosdac gov in 3 3 in situ data acoustic doppler current profiler data from the network of six omni buoys bd08 09 10 11 12 and 13 venkatesan et al 2013 in the bay of bengal have been used for validating vertical profiles of simulated currents these profilers provide data with every 3 hourly intervals at 10 20 30 50 and 100 m depths in the open ocean the data was provided by the indian national centre for ocean information service incois 4 data assimilation implementation in this work ensemble optimal interpolation enoi technique has been used for the assimilation this method has been explained in earlier studies evensen 2003 oke et al 2010 wan et al 2010 ratheesh et al 2015 we present only the essential features we define ensemble members as ψ in our case these ensembles are generated using the past simulations from the same model we used every 5th day of model simulations for the period 2006 2017 from mvmom3 mallick 2021 which resulted in n 888 ensemble members the model states are held in an ensemble matrix a of size n n 1 a ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ n the model state vector a comprises of model s ssha temperature salinity zonal and meridional velocity and for our model each ψ i has the dimension n 4 1 0 7 model s ssha was derived by subtracting long term model s ssha mean 2006 2017 the ensemble approximation of the forecast error covariance matrix p is defined as 2 p a a t n 1 where a a a is the deviation of ensemble members from its ensemble mean a the enoi analysis is computed by solving the following equation 3 ψ a ψ b α p h t α h p h t r 1 d h ψ b where ψ b is the background state vector i e the model state without assimilation ψ a is the analysed model state r is the observation error covariance matrix h is the measurement operator transforming the model state to the measurement space and d is observation vector d h ψ b is known as innovation α 0 1 is a parameter giving different weights for the forecast and measurement error covariance in this study the value of α is chosen as 0 5 in order to take into account the spatial variability of observation errors long term spatially varying standard deviation field of gridded ssha from aviso is used to generate the ensembles of observation errors these are generated using gaussian perturbation around zero mean and the long term normalized standard deviation the size of p matrix in eq 3 is n n 1 0 14 hence we bypass the explicit use of eq 2 and rewrite eq 3 as 4 ψ a ψ b α a h a t n 1 α h a h a t n 1 r 1 d h ψ b further to reduce the computational load we divided the domain in tiles of equal dimensions of size 18 14 pixels with an overlap of two pixels of adjacent tiles once this fragmentation of tiles was done then eq 4 was independently solved on each tile to generate separate analysis of each tile which was then merged and smoothened using 5 point running mean along the edges of the tiles this approach led to an easy and effective implementation of the data assimilation algorithm in our high resolution model since the track ssha observations are used in this work a 1 day observation window may not be sufficient to produce significant increments to correct the model state spatially hence the ssha tracks were accumulated over 5 days centred over t 0 5 th day where t 0 is the day on which the updated initial conditions are required to be generated i e the ssha data is accumulated from t 0 7 to t 0 3 days and is used to constrain the initial conditions on t 0 5 th day the model is then integrated forward in time until t 0 to obtain the analysis this strategy allows the model to better diffuse the analysis increments costa and tanajura 2015 along the integration and discontinuities in the spatial fields due to assimilation are minimized the schematic for assimilation is shown in fig 2 the choice for the length of assimilation window 5 days was fixed so as to get sufficient number of tracks in the domain fig 2 the choice for length of the free run was taken after analysing simulations resulting from different lengths of free run when the length of free run was kept small i e 1 3 days the artefacts of altimeter tracks that are assimilated were clearly visible which got diffused gradually within 5 days beyond 5 days of free run discontinuities due to assimilation were minimal and effect of assimilation in terms of reduced error was also clearly visible in order to assess the impact of assimilation two set of model simulations for the year 2018 were performed in this study in one simulation model was integrated forward in time using the initial conditions of 1st january 2018 control simulation ctrl r with no ssha data were assimilated into it for the entire 2018 in the other simulation assim r using the same initial conditions as used in ctrl r track observations of ssha were assimilated to generate daily analysis as described above in this section for the whole year analysis is performed for the period during april 2018 to december 2018 it is imperative to mention here that although assimilation of jason 3 track sea level data began from 1st january 2018 we refrain from using first three months of simulations primarily for the reason that model needs some time to stabilize due to initial jerks if any 5 results and discussion 5 1 model simulated fields and statistics simulated outputs of ssha and ocean currents from both the runs ctrl r and assim r have been analysed and assessed for this purpose simulated ssh is compared with aviso merged adt product satellite based and ocean currents using remote and in situ datasets while satellite records are very useful for statistical analysis on a larger scale at the same time in situ datasets are invaluable assets for localized and more accurate statistics sea surface height anomaly ssha from model and aviso datasets are then obtained by subtracting averaged april 2018 dec 2018 ssh generated from model and averaged adt over the same period from aviso data this results in same reference dataset in both model and aviso from which ssha is obtained and compared the statistics used to characterize the errors and variability are root mean square error rmse and root mean square rms scores respectively while rmse provides handle on the errors in the simulated parameters rms is a good measure of variability of the parameter in question 5 2 sea surface height anomaly we begin our analysis with simulated ssha ctrl r and assim r and aviso merged product fig 3 depicts the standard deviation of ssha computed over the study period apr dec 2018 from simulations middle panel ctrl r and right panel assim r and aviso left panel to essentially decipher the variability of ssha one can clearly observe that strong ssha variability centres in the bay of bengal are aligned along the western side of the basin and in the coastal regions high variability along the coastal regions are primarily due to seasonal coastally trapped kelvin wave activity and seasonally reversing east india coastal currents eicc shankar et al 1996 mccreary et al 1996 eigenheer and quadfasel 2000 in addition to these western bay is dominated with mesoscale eddies dandapat and chakraborty 2016 cheng et al 2018 while central bay largely exhibits low variability primarily due to absence of quasi permanent eddies and weaker currents in the ctrl r fig 3 middle panel these variability features are rather weak and in some regions even missing the strong ssha variability of the order of 14 20 cm observed in the western bay seen in the observations is just of the order of 10 cm in the ctrl r although one can see faint ssha variability all along the coastal belt but the magnitudes are very weak in the ctrl r the right most panel shows the ssha variability from the assim r where altimeter track data were assimilated in the model as described in section 4 it is encouraging to see that data assimilated model is able to pick the high variability in ssha in the western bob quite faithfully not just magnitude wise but also even patterns are nicely reproduced in assim r the strongest variability centre 20 cm as seen in the aviso ssha standard deviation map fig 3 left panel at 7 n and 84 e in the western side of bob is very accurately simulated in assim r in terms of magnitude extent and variability centre however the simulated assim r ssha exhibits very low variability in some pockets specially in those regions where fresh water from major rivers ganges brahmputra and irrawady discharges in to the ocean eg north most bay of bengal and near myanmar and southeast asia these pockets are very close to the coast model resolution 10 km could be one issue and another possible concern could be non resolving coastal dynamics capability of the model in question nonetheless it is indeed quite encouraging that assimilation results in overall improvement in the sea level as compared to non assimilative model simulations 5 3 ocean surface currents observed and simulated maps of standard deviation of zonal and meridional surface currents are shown in fig 4 with left panel for zonal and right for meridional current similar to fig 3 one can observe relatively higher variability in the western bob for both zonal and meridional currents primarily due to eicc durand et al 2009 the strong eicc during the north east monsoon oct jan is due to the ekman pumping and local alongshore winds hacker et al 1998 which are strongest in the transition months from winter to summer during mar may shenoi 2010 interestingly variability is stronger in the case of zonal component than meridional current the large variability in zonal current is primarily attributed to off shore shedding of eddies by the eicc mesoscale eddies are ubiquitously present all along the indian coastal boundary cheng et al 2018 and that makes this part of bob as high variability region however zonal and meridional components do exhibit moderate variability in the mid basin too and this could be due to seasonally reversing monsoonal winds that impacts the surface currents the observed variability is well simulated by the assim r as against ctrl r where the variabilities are largely weak in most part of the bob the maximum variability in zonal current goes up to 60 cm s in the eastern part along 14 n latitude transect and it is quite well simulated with almost same magnitude in assim r and with much low variability 40 cm s in ctrl r root mean square difference rmsd of the zonal and meridional surface currents from both the simulations computed with respect to satellite derived currents is shown in fig 5 it can be clearly seen that the errors are much higher in ctrl r zonal current top panel left figure as against compared to the current simulations in assim r lower panel left image the maximum error is as high as 65 cm s in ctrl r as compared to 40 cm s in assim r this suggests that assim r has much higher skill in simulating the zonal current it is interesting to notice that the patches of large errors coincide with regions where variabilities are also high fig 3 for meridional currents too one can see reduced errors in assim r as against ctrl r where the rmsd is higher fig 6 shows the histogram of surface current speed obtained from satellite product hereafter referred to as observations ctrl r and assim r surface current from observation peaks at 20 cm s while these peaks shift towards lower current speeds 10 cm s for the two simulations this is in accordance with sharma et al 2020 where it was found that currents at two buoy locations peak in the range of 10 cm s 20 cm s in bob maximum current speed can go as high as 100 cm s 110 cm s which is seen from the right tail in the distribution curve this could be possibly due to the passage of cyclonic storms which are quite common during post monsoon season in the bob another important point to note here is that while both ctrl r and assim r peak at the same value 10 cm s the spread in assim r is much closer to observed distribution and more so towards higher current values the spread is quite narrow in case of ctrl r this clearly suggests that higher current speed values are also well simulated in assim r and are much less in number for ctrl r 5 4 sub surface currents validation of simulated currents in the upper ocean up to 100 m has been carried out to assess the skill of satellite data assimilation in reproducing the sub surface currents using these adcp measurements while we show the snapshot of vertical current profile from buoy bd12 at 10 5 n and 94 e ctrl r and assim r for the period apr nov 2018 in fig 7 for gross comparison the complete statistics for several buoys is presented in table 1 current speeds for the entire column up to 100 m exhibit significant seasonality being stronger during august september and also during june and october of 2018 for small periods the stronger currents during october could be due to very strong winds associated with cyclone titli in the second week of october 2018 in the last week of may and first half of june there were several cyclonic storms deep depressions depressions and extremely severe cyclonic storms in bob en wikipedia org wiki 2018 north indian ocean cyclone season the strong wind associated with these systems might have resulted in strong currents during these months as seen in the buoy data it is intriguing to note that while during august september currents very close to the surface are quite weak and strong at deeper depths 30 60 m in contrast during october and may june surface currents are also quite noticeable while one can clearly observe that currents are extremely weak in ctrl r from surface to 100 m depth assim r shows better skill in reproducing the observed pattern in currents in the ctrl r except for the upper 20 m or so magnitude of currents in the entire column down to 100 m is of the order of 5 10 cm s or less during the entire study period it suggests that unassimilated model has almost no skill in simulating sub surface currents at this location these currents are largely driven by ekman forcing and density variations since the mixed layer depth mld in bob is largely shallow of the order of 10 20 m for most part of the season and region due to fresh water lens at the surface it is the density variations which causes sub surface currents below mld prasad and mcclean 2004 hence the results so obtained suggest that variations in the sub surface density are not correctly picked up by ctrl r interestingly even in the control run small period 10 20 days variations are seen in the upper 20 m currents in contrast to ctrl r assim r shows good skill in simulating the sub surface currents as seen from the bottom panel of fig 7 barring the month of august in which simulated sub surface currents in assim r are unable to reproduce strong magnitudes in the other months currents are faithfully simulated for e g strong currents during sep oct and during jun as seen in the observations are quite reasonably simulated in assim r in other months also simulated currents in assim r are closer to the observations in comparison to ctrl r the comparison statistics for currents using adcp data from 5 five moorings is shown in table 2 computed statistics for assim r show less errors in ocean current simulations at all the depths in the table combined statistical scores for all the 5 adcps have been provided at each of the 7 depths starting 1 25 m down to 100 m at discrete depths along with correlation and rmse standard deviation of the currents is also provided one can see a significant improvement in correlation and much lesser rmse in assim r as compared to ctrl r at all the depths which also indicates robustness of the assimilation methodology it can also be seen from table 2 that the simulated current variability in assim r is in close agreement with the observed variability the variability in the case of ctrl r is far too low and at all the depths hence we can be reasonably sure that altimeter data assimilation has resulted in much improved consistent and robust simulation of currents not just at the surface but also in the upper layers of the ocean 5 5 eddy position extent and amplitude one of the important evaluation criteria of any data assimilative model is to see whether the simulations are able to faithfully represent mesoscale features primarily eddies in terms of position extent shape and magnitude fig 8 shows a snap shot of ssha from observations ctrl r and assim r for the 10th april 2018 surface currents are also overlaid as vectors this is the season april may when western bob is full of mesoscale eddies dandapat and chakraborty 2016 and hence a representative date in this case 10th april has been chosen for the analysis several anticyclonic elevated ssha at the centre with clockwise circulation pattern eddies can be seen in the observations left panel of fig 8 surrounded by these anticyclonic eddies is a small cyclonic feature with depressed ssha at the centre rest of the bay does not show any such closed circulation on a large scale a clear east west sea level gradient is seen with western side having elevated ssha and eastern side with depressed ssha while it is clearly evident that the large scale gradients east west in ssha are quite correctly picked up by both the simulations middle and right panels of fig 8 however the mesoscale eddies are either missing or misplaced and weak in ctrl r this suggests that control simulations fail to reproduce the observed mesoscale dynamics at the same time assim r simulates almost all the eddies both cyclonic and anticyclonic and is quite close to observations in terms of position extent and magnitude the amplitude of anticyclonic eddies in assim r is in the range of 25 30 cm which is of similar order as seen in observations left panel of fig 8 a small cyclonic eddy surrounded by anticyclonic eddies as seen in the observation is also nicely simulated in assim r suggesting that it is not just the bigger eddies but also the smaller eddies are correctly simulated after assimilating along track altimeter data in order to verify that assim r simulates correct eddy position we focus on an anticyclonic eddy centred at 17 5 n and 86 e seen in fig 8 and we show it separately in fig 9 the black dots are centre of this eddy determined from aviso ssha left dot and assim r ssha right dot the black dot to the south of the two close by dots is from ctrl r ssha it is clearly evident that centre of the eddy from assim r is very close to the observed location of the centre while the same from ctrl r is quite misplaced the intensity of the eddy as determined from the ssha magnitude at the centre simulated in assim r 27 cm is quite close to the observations 30 cm while the same is quite underestimated 10 cm in the ctrl r similarly the shape and dimension of this eddy is also simulated well in assim r as compared to ctrl r 5 6 particle trajectory analysis particle tracking capability of any model depends on the accurate simulation of ocean surface currents these currents are extremely useful in developing search and rescue sar aid tools for assisting the authorities in the eventuality of any mishap apart from sar application accurate trajectory also helps in understanding physical processes affecting the ecosystem ullman et al 2006 solano et al 2018 used a simple advection algorithm to compare model trajectories with positional data from floating drifter in the present work we have used simple velocity time relationship which is solved using finite difference approach to compute the particle trajectory using surface current fields from satellite and simulations from ctrl r and assim r since daily averaged fields have been used in the analysis the time step for computing updated particle position is taken as 1 day for this purpose two boxes box 1 and 2 as outlined in fig 10a have been selected to seed the particles around 20 particles were seeded at random locations within 20 km of the marked locations the trajectory was computed for each randomly distributed particle for a period of 10 days and the trajectories were averaged to get the mean trajectory of the particle for that location in this case particle trajectory obtained from satellite derived currents is considered as the reference to assess the trajectories calculated from the models simulated velocity fields the initial position of the particles is shown by red boxes in fig 10b and fig 10c it can be seen that the trajectory obtained from assim r green colour is closer to the observed trajectory black line for initial 5 6 days and then it starts to drift away in both the boxes interestingly these two boxes represent completely different circulation patterns but the validity proximity of the simulated trajectories to the actual in time remains the same up to 5 6 days while box 2 has a very clear anticyclonic eddy elevated ssha at the centre and particles were distributed very close to the centre in the other box 1 the particles were distributed at the periphery of the cyclonic circulation and yet the results were same this clearly indicates the robustness of the assimilation methodology and simulations in assim r at the same time trajectory computed using currents from ctrl r is quite off from the actual trajectory the average separation of the simulated lagrangian trajectories from the two runs with actual particle path derived from satellite currents is shown in fig 10d average separation between actual and predicted dashed lines for assim r and continuous lines for ctrl r for 10 days of integration for both the boxes 1 and 2 is shown in this figure as expected errors increase as the prediction time increases the error within first 1 2 days is nearly the same in two runs here too assim r is slightly better but as the integration time increases errors are much larger in the case of ctrl r as compared to assim r after 2 days of seeding the errors in ctrl r increase linearly rapidly and more so for box 1 the growth in trajectory errors can be attributed to the difference in the surface current speeds between aviso and assim r it can be seen from fig 6 that the surface current speeds from aviso are majorly twice as large as the surface current speeds from assim r effect of which is reflected in fig 10 the daily distance travelled the distance between two consecutive points in aviso in fig 10b and c appears to be twice as large compared to the same in assim r nevertheless it is noticed that up to 8 days of integration deviation in trajectory computed using assim r currents are less than 100 km this result is a direct effect of the satellite data assimilation that resulted in much improved circulation pattern and therefore this data assimilative model will be extremely useful in sar operations and in the understanding of physical processes in ecosystem studies 5 7 power spectral analysis of ssha the largest part of ocean kinetic energy is contained in the mesoscale signals ferrari and wunsch 2009 on the scales of 100 to 300 km chelton et al 2011 and the bay of bengal basin is no exception in fig 11 a we show the rms of ssha suggestive of variability computed from aviso data for the study period a large variability of ssh is concentrated in the western part of bob along the indian coastland and this is largely due to the presence of mesoscale eddies and seasonal reversing eicc maximum variability reaches up to 30 cm central and eastern part are less energetic this east west contrast in the variability pattern and study pertaining to associated energetics is of utmost importance one way to assess how the eddy kinetic energy is distributed in different wavenumber space bands is to perform power spectral density of sea surface height which also indicates the underlying dynamical processes governing these distributions satellite altimetry has led to several studies estimating sea surface height wavenumber spectrum le traon et al 2008 stammer 1997 this motivated us to compare the skill of model simulated ssha against aviso gridded product in this section the meridional ssha wavenumber spectra are calculated from aviso product and model simulations ctrl r and assim r the spectra have been computed from the along track daily ssha over the entire bob region of present study following chaudhary et al 2021 meridional power spectral density psd of ssha from aviso and model simulations ctrl r and assim r have been calculated at each 1 interval in longitude and then were averaged from april 01 2018 to december 31 2018 the slopes of the ssha wavenumber spectra are also calculated over the mesoscale band defined by the typical length scale of 70 km 250 km as suggested by xu and fu 2011 fig 11 b shows the mean ssha wavenumber spectrum as evident from the figure assim r spectra have very similar shape as that of aviso nearly up to the wavelength of 400 500 km beyond which towards lower wavelength assim r psd falls more gently as compared to aviso on the contrary spectrum shape of ctrl r is quite off with reference to aviso and shows very gentle slope right from wavelength 100 km and less for the wavelengths lesser than 70 km all the three psds become flat the above finding once again indicates that model simulations are more realistic when altimeter observations are assimilated slopes computed over the mesoscale band also suggest that assim r slope 2 77 is much steeper than those of ctrl r 1 79 and is closer to aviso 3 64 slope these slopes are much shallower than the one expected k 5 from qg turbulence theory hua and haidvogel 1986 it is to be noted here that shallower slopes in assim r as compared to aviso could be attributed to the contribution of ageostrophic effect in model ssh while altimeter ssh represents geostrophic balance another aspect to mention here is that slope of k 3 64 as obtained from aviso gridded field is higher as compared to the one which is calculated from along track altimeter data which is of the order of k 2 figure 1 of dufau et al 2016 in the central bob similar result was obtained by wang et al 2019 in the north pacific ocean while studying psd from along track altimeter data and gridded data they found that in the north pacific sub tropical counter current stcc region the gridded spectral slope in the mesoscale band is 3 8 0 3 while the along track spectral slope is 2 7 0 3 it is important to mention here that in our case too gridded spectral slope is of the order of 3 64 which is much closer to the one obtained by wang et al 2019 in north pacific xu and fu 2012 while analysing ssh psd using 7 years of jason 1 data found very low slopes between k 1 5 and k 2 5 in tropics and attributed this to the contribution of ageostrophic dynamics it is interesting to see from fig 11 b that assim r psd has remarkably similar shape at large wavelengths 300 km with aviso psd it is only for wavelengths less than 300 km that the assim r psd deviates from aviso psd it has been found by chelton et al 2011 that the smoothening procedure used in generating aviso gridded sla creates artefacts which are visible at scales shorten than 250 km in short it has been found that assim r spectral slope is closer to aviso spectral slope whereas ctrl r slope is far too less having analysed the averaged ssh spectral slope for the bob using gridded fields from the two model simulations and from aviso we analyse the behaviour of slopes in the zonal and meridional directions separately in the high energy region in the bob two transects in western bob as shown in fig 11a were chosen and averaged april december 2018 psd of ssha along these two transects were computed spectral slopes were also computed over the mesoscale band 70 250 km to diagnose the influence of anisotropy on the spectral slopes fig 11 c shows the zonal left and meridional right wave number spectra for ssha from aviso ctrl r and assim r in this case too assim r spectral slopes are closer to those computed from aviso for both zonal and meridional cases interestingly meridional slope 5 34 1 52 is steeper than the slope of its zonal counterpart 4 80 1 44 as computed from aviso psd this finding is in close agreement with the one inferred by wang et al 2019 they found that in the high eddy kinetic energy regions difference between zonal and meridional spectrum slopes could reach a value of 2 with zonal slope being shallower than the meridional slopes in our case it is reassuring to see that this anisotropy between zonal and meridional slopes is remarkably well reproduced by both the model simulations too albeit assim r slopes being much nearer to aviso slopes zonal and meridional spectral slopes of 4 80 1 44 and 5 34 1 52 respectively obtained from aviso are close to the one that is predicted for quasi geostrophic qg turbulence theories k 5 assim r slopes however are somewhat flatter than the predictions of qg theory which is not difficult to understand given the fact that even the most sophisticated data assimilative models are not so accurate nevertheless the results obtained from this analysis highlight the effectiveness of along track assimilation of ssha in improving the model simulations paving the way for its use for research and operational purposes 6 conclusions altimeter track observations of sea level anomaly from jason 3 were assimilated in a high resolution model of the indian ocean the impact of assimilation was analysed on simulated sea level and currents from assimilated and non assimilated model simulations for the year 2018 in the bay of bengal it was seen that the sea level anomaly simulated from assim r reproduced observed variability more realistically as compared to ctrl r root mean square error in current magnitude reduced by almost 50 in the assim r and the impact is seen more in the meridional currents the effect of ssha assimilation was evident in deeper ocean up to 200 m too where assim r was able to reproduce most of the sub surface variability below 20 m depth comparison with adcp currents at 5 mooring locations too reveals that the assim r simulated currents were better than ctrl r the size location and amplitude of assim r simulated eddies were very consistent with the observations on the other hand those from ctrl r were very much misplaced particle trajectory estimated from assim r simulations is closer to the trajectory computed from observations for initial 6 days as compared to the trajectory from ctrl r which was quite off power spectrum analysis carried on ssha from both the simulations suggests that the mesoscale dynamics of the energetic regions is nicely represented in the assim r simulations the current study demonstrates the role of altimeter observations in improving the surface and subsurface oceanic flow this would further help the numerical models to improve upon the initial conditions to generate better and accurate forecast using better ocean models and including more number of altimeter track observations in the assimilation would further improve model s skill in future cnes and nasa s joint surface water and ocean topography swot mission will extend the capability of nadir altimeters in mapping and resolving the small mesoscale and sub mesoscale features morrow and le traon 2012 the present study can be considered as a step forward in the context of swot observations as we have a suitable regional bob set up of ocean model in place ratheesh et al 2020 chaudhary et al 2021 using which we will perform osse experiments to assess relative merits and shortcomings of swath vis à vis nadir

23865,in this study altimeter based sea surface height anomaly ssha observations from the jason 3 altimeter are assimilated in a high resolution indian ocean model and the impact of assimilation is analysed in the bay of bengal region the study uses a 3 d primitive equation numerical ocean model forced with analysed atmospheric data to generate ocean state for a particular period in this case from the year 2018 to study the impact of ssha assimilation two sets of model outputs are generated one in which no ssha is assimilated ctrl r and the other in which along track ssha from the jason 3 satellite is assimilated assim r using ensemble optimum interpolation technique the impact of assimilation is primarily analysed on ocean surface currents for this purpose satellite derived sea surface currents and buoy based vertical current profiles are used to evaluate ctrl r and assim r it is found that there is a profound improvement in ocean current simulation after assimilation of ssha mesoscale eddies that were weak and misplaced in ctrl r have now improved in assim r in terms of both strength and position sub surface current simulation from assim r exhibits observed variability in most of the evaluation period which was absent in the ctrl r computed statistics show much improved 15 35 ocean current simulations in assim r at all the depths particle trajectory analysis has been performed and it is seen that assimilated model velocity fields faithfully simulate the observed trajectory of tracers power spectra of simulated ssha from both assim r and ctrl r were compared with spectra from satellite ssha and it is found that after assimilation the slopes of the simulated spectra become much closer to slope of spectra from the observations these results indicate that the along track assimilation of ssha improves the model analysis and thereby provides accurate initial conditions for model forecast keywords satellite altimeter sea surface height anomaly ocean models assimilation 1 introduction estimation and forecast of oceanic flow is very crucial for safer and efficient navigation numerical ocean models are generally used to forecast the ocean surface currents for next 24 120 h which are then provided to the users for their operational use an accurate estimation of ocean surface and sub surface currents is extremely important for their impact on societal and research needs several activities pertaining to socioeconomic aspects such as maritime trade shipping navigation marine pollution and safety are directly controlled by surface currents isern fontanet et al 2017 indirectly surface currents have a key role to play in potential fishing zone activity and climate change related impacts recognizing its importance surface currents have been recognized as one of the essential climate variables bojinski et al 2014 there are different ways to obtain ocean surface currents ranging from derived information from space based instruments to in situ based measurements such as lagrangian drifters moored buoys radars launch of topex poseidon and ers 1 2 altimeter missions in early 1990s paved the way for near real time global maps of geostrophic currents estimates from satellites yet another means to get direct current estimates from space based instruments is by measuring doppler effect which can be translated to ocean surface current and this is the principle which is used to derive currents from synthetic aperture radar chapron et al 2005 however because of the near real time and globally available altimeter datasets researchers and forecasters have commonly used sea level measurements from space borne altimeter systems chelton et al 2001 fu and cazenave 2000 fu and chelton 2001 morrow and le traon 2012 stammer and cazenave 2017 there are several operational agencies that routinely assimilate both satellite and insitu observations in global as well as regional numerical models to improve the forecasts karmakar et al 2018 made an inter comparison of these reanalyses and brought the strength and weaknesses in each of the products indian national centre for ocean information services incois assimilates temperature salinity profiles from argo floats buoys and ship based observations they also assimilate satellite track sst into their high resolution regional modelling system baduru et al 2019 there are many studies that have discussed the impact of sla on thermocline depth mixed layer depth costa and tanajura 2015 chakraborty et al 2015 ratheesh et al 2014 however none of these have discussed the detailed impact of assimilation on simulated currents in the bay of bengal region in this study we specifically focus on the impact of altimeter derived sea surface height anomaly assimilation on model simulated currents in the bay of bengal the motivation behind present study has been driven by two aspects firstly we wanted to develop a data assimilative system to carry out observation system sensitivity experiments osse in the wake of current and upcoming altimeter satellite missions especially the swot mission and secondly we wanted to assess how faithfully ocean currents both surface and sub surface and mesoscale eddies can be simulated after assimilating along track altimeter data in a model which is specifically configured for bob the basin being unique in several perspectives an additional motive has been to set up a da system that ingests altimeter data in a regional perspective towards setting up an analysis forecasting system with these objectives in mind the present study focusses on two experiments performed for the year 2018 first is the control run ctrl r where no data is assimilated and the other is the experimental run assim r where along track nadir altimeter data has been assimilated different aspects of model set up are discussed in section 2 followed by a description of various data that have been used in this study in section 3 section 4 details about the assimilation technique implementation and experiments performed analysis and assessment of simulations using satellite and in situ data are presented in section 5 the same section also presents a detailed analysis of trajectory simulations and power spectral density psd carried out using the twin simulations section 6 summarizes the findings and presents conclusions 2 model configuration 2 1 model domain and bathymetry the model used in this study is the modified version of modular ocean model pacanovsky and griffies 1999 version 3 0 hereafter referred as mvmom3 and is the same model which was used by mallick et al 2020 2019 2018 the model domain consisted of varying horizontal resolution of uniform 0 1 0 1 in the northern part of io 55 e 100 e and 10 s 23 n and reaches a minimum up to 1 in the rest of the domain fig 1 it has 50 depths z levels with top 14 levels in the upper 36 m the first level is at 1 m depth and deepest 50th level is at 5320 m a finer vertical resolution with successive depth interval of 2 5 m was allocated in the top 12 levels and reaches a maximum depth interval of 590 m near the ocean bottom the bathymetry field was extracted from the modified version of earth topography 2 min etopo 2 of sindhu et al 2007 and is remapped to the model grid is as used by mallick et al 2018 2019 southern and eastern boundaries of the model

up to 2017 the spin up runs and other details are presented in mallick et al 2020 the entire simulation until 2018 and thereon was forced with the same forcing as described in section 3 1 the exchange coefficients for the estimation of momentum heat and freshwater fluxes have been computed using coare 3 0 flux formulation details of flux formulations are documented in fairall et al 1996 which was implemented by mallick et al 2020 in mvmom3 where fluxes are iteratively solved by improving the stability functions scalar transfer coefficients a wind dependent parameter and roughness length the model sea surface salinity sss is relaxed to the monthly climatological values of sss with a restoring time scale of 180 days while there is no relaxation applied to the sea surface temperature 3 data

records gdr of sea surface height anomaly ssha from jason3 are used these are along track observations and are quality controlled with best possible corrections applied lillibridge 2020 these data are available at https www ncei noaa gov data oceans jason3 gdr gdr ssha validation data the multi mission gridded absolute dynamic topography adt data available from archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso http www oceanobs aviso com have been used in this work to study the mesoscale features in the bay of bengal bob these are gridded products level 4 and are generated using observation from multiple altimeters the altimeter products were produced by ssalto duacs and distributed by aviso with support from cnes http www aviso altimetry fr duacs the spatial and temporal resolution of these data is 25 km and one day respectively daily gridded data of satellite derived surface currents with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 were used these data are derived from satellite observations of ssha sst and sea surface winds using the algorithm based on quasi linear and steady state physics sikhakolli et al 2013 bonjean and lagerloef 2002 and are available from www mosdac gov in 3 3 in situ data acoustic doppler current profiler data from the network of six omni buoys bd08 09 10 11 12 and 13 venkatesan et al 2013 in the bay of bengal have been used for validating vertical profiles of simulated currents these profilers provide data with every 3 hourly intervals at 10 20 30 50 and 100 m depths in the open ocean the data was provided by the indian national centre for ocean information service incois 4 data assimilation implementation in this work ensemble optimal interpolation enoi technique has been used for the assimilation this method has been explained in earlier studies evensen 2003 oke et al 2010 wan et al 2010 ratheesh et al 2015 we present only the essential features we define ensemble members as ψ in our case these ensembles are generated using the past simulations from the same model we used every 5th day of model simulations for the period 2006 2017 from mvmom3 mallick 2021 which resulted in n 888 ensemble members the model states are held in an ensemble matrix a of size n n 1 a ψ 1 ψ 2 ψ n the model state vector a comprises of model s ssha temperature salinity zonal and meridional velocity and for our model each ψ i has the dimension n 4 1 0 7 model s ssha was derived by subtracting long term model s ssha mean 2006 2017 the ensemble approximation of the forecast error covariance matrix p is defined as 2 p a a t n 1 where a a a is the deviation of ensemble members from its ensemble mean a the enoi analysis is computed by solving the following equation 3 ψ a ψ b α p h t α h p h t r 1 d h ψ b where ψ b is the background state vector i e the model state without assimilation ψ a is the analysed model state r is the observation error covariance matrix h is the measurement operator transforming the model state to the measurement space and d is observation vector d h ψ b is known as innovation α 0 1 is a parameter giving different weights for the forecast and measurement error covariance in this study the value of α is chosen as 0 5 in order to take into account the spatial variability of observation errors long term spatially varying standard deviation field of gridded ssha from aviso is used to generate the ensembles of observation errors these are generated using gaussian perturbation around zero mean and the long term normalized standard deviation the size of p matrix in eq 3 is n n 1 0 14 hence we bypass the explicit use of eq 2 and rewrite eq 3 as 4 ψ a ψ b α a h a t n 1 α h a h a t n 1 r 1 d h ψ b further to reduce the computational load we divided the domain in tiles of equal dimensions of size 18 14 pixels with an overlap of two pixels of adjacent tiles once this fragmentation of tiles was done then eq 4 was independently solved on each tile to generate separate analysis of each tile which was then merged and smoothened using 5 point running mean along the edges of the tiles this approach led to an easy and effective implementation of the data assimilation algorithm in our high resolution model since the track ssha observations are used in this work a 1 day observation window may not be sufficient to produce significant increments to correct the model state spatially hence the ssha tracks were accumulated over 5 days centred over t 0 5 th day where t 0 is the day on which the updated initial conditions are required to be generated i e the ssha data is accumulated from t 0 7 to t 0 3 days and is used to constrain the initial conditions on t 0 5 th day the model is then integrated forward in time until t 0 to obtain the analysis this strategy allows the model to better diffuse the analysis increments costa and tanajura 2015 along the integration and discontinuities in the spatial fields due to assimilation are minimized the schematic for assimilation is shown in fig 2 the choice for the length of assimilation window 5 days was fixed so as to get sufficient number of tracks in the domain fig 2 the choice for length of the free run was taken after analysing simulations resulting from different lengths of free run when the length of free run was kept small i e 1 3 days the artefacts of altimeter tracks that are assimilated were clearly visible which got diffused gradually within 5 days beyond 5 days of free run discontinuities due to assimilation were minimal and effect of assimilation in terms of reduced error was also clearly visible in order to assess the impact of assimilation two set of model simulations for the year 2018 were performed in this study in one simulation model was integrated forward in time using the initial conditions of 1st january 2018 control simulation ctrl r with no ssha data were assimilated into it for the entire 2018 in the other simulation assim r using the same initial conditions as used in ctrl r track observations of ssha were assimilated to generate daily analysis as described above in this section for the whole year analysis is performed for the period during april 2018 to december 2018 it is imperative to mention here that although assimilation of jason 3 track sea level data began from 1st january 2018 we refrain from using first three months of simulations primarily for the reason that model needs some time to stabilize due to initial jerks if any 5 results and discussion 5 1 model simulated fields and statistics simulated outputs of ssha and ocean currents from both the runs ctrl r and assim r have been analysed and assessed for this purpose simulated ssh is compared with aviso merged adt product satellite based and ocean currents using remote and in situ datasets while satellite records are very useful for statistical analysis on a larger scale at the same time in situ datasets are invaluable assets for localized and more accurate statistics sea surface height anomaly ssha from model and aviso datasets are then obtained by subtracting averaged april 2018 dec 2018 ssh generated from model and averaged adt over the same period from aviso data this results in same reference dataset in both model and aviso from which ssha is obtained and compared the statistics used to characterize the errors and variability are root mean square error rmse and root mean square rms scores respectively while rmse provides handle on the errors in the simulated parameters rms is a good measure of variability of the parameter in question 5 2 sea surface height anomaly we begin our analysis with simulated ssha ctrl r and assim r and aviso merged product fig 3 depicts the standard deviation of ssha computed over the study period apr dec 2018 from simulations middle panel ctrl r and right panel assim r and aviso left panel to essentially decipher the variability of ssha one can clearly observe that strong ssha variability centres in the bay of bengal are aligned along the western side of the basin and in the coastal regions high variability along the coastal regions are primarily due to seasonal coastally trapped kelvin wave activity and seasonally reversing east india coastal currents eicc shankar et al 1996 mccreary et al 1996 eigenheer and quadfasel 2000 in addition to these western bay is dominated with mesoscale eddies dandapat and chakraborty 2016 cheng et al 2018 while central bay largely exhibits low variability primarily due to absence of quasi permanent eddies and weaker currents in the ctrl r fig 3 middle panel these variability features are rather weak and in some regions even missing the strong ssha variability of the order of 14 20 cm observed in the western bay seen in the observations is just of the order of 10 cm in the ctrl r although one can see faint ssha variability all along the coastal belt but the magnitudes are very weak in the ctrl r the right most panel shows the ssha variability from the assim r where altimeter track data were assimilated in the model as described in section 4 it is encouraging to see that data assimilated model is able to pick the high variability in ssha in the western bob quite faithfully not just magnitude wise but also even patterns are nicely reproduced in assim r the strongest variability centre 20 cm as seen in the aviso ssha standard deviation map fig 3 left panel at 7 n and 84 e in the western side of bob is very accurately simulated in assim r in terms of magnitude extent and variability centre however the simulated assim r ssha exhibits very low variability in some pockets specially in those regions where fresh water from major rivers ganges brahmputra and irrawady discharges in to the ocean eg north most bay of bengal and near myanmar and southeast asia these pockets are very close to the coast model resolution 10 km could be one issue and another possible concern could be non resolving coastal dynamics capability of the model in question nonetheless it is indeed quite encouraging that assimilation results in overall improvement in the sea level as compared to non assimilative model simulations 5 3 ocean surface currents observed and simulated maps of standard deviation of zonal and meridional surface currents are shown in fig 4 with left panel for zonal and right for meridional current similar to fig 3 one can observe relatively higher variability in the western bob for both zonal and meridional currents primarily due to eicc durand et al 2009 the strong eicc during the north east monsoon oct jan is due to the ekman pumping and local alongshore winds hacker et al 1998 which are strongest in the transition months from winter to summer during mar may shenoi 2010 interestingly variability is stronger in the case of zonal component than meridional current the large variability in zonal current is primarily attributed to off shore shedding of eddies by the eicc mesoscale eddies are ubiquitously present all along the indian coastal boundary cheng et al 2018 and that makes this part of bob as high variability region however zonal and meridional components do exhibit moderate variability in the mid basin too and this could be due to seasonally reversing monsoonal winds that impacts the surface currents the observed variability is well simulated by the assim r as against ctrl r where the variabilities are largely weak in most part of the bob the maximum variability in zonal current goes up to 60 cm s in the eastern part along 14 n latitude transect and it is quite well simulated with almost same magnitude in assim r and with much low variability 40 cm s in ctrl r root mean square difference rmsd of the zonal and meridional surface currents from both the simulations computed with respect to satellite derived currents is shown in fig 5 it can be clearly seen that the errors are much higher in ctrl r zonal current top panel left figure as against compared to the current simulations in assim r lower panel left image the maximum error is as high as 65 cm s in ctrl r as compared to 40 cm s in assim r this suggests that assim r has much higher skill in simulating the zonal current it is interesting to notice that the patches of large errors coincide with regions where variabilities are also high fig 3 for meridional currents too one can see reduced errors in assim r as against ctrl r where the rmsd is higher fig 6 shows the histogram of surface current speed obtained from satellite product hereafter referred to as observations ctrl r and assim r surface current from observation peaks at 20 cm s while these peaks shift towards lower current speeds 10 cm s for the two simulations this is in accordance with sharma et al 2020 where it was found that currents at two buoy locations peak in the range of 10 cm s 20 cm s in bob maximum current speed can go as high as 100 cm s 110 cm s which is seen from the right tail in the distribution curve this could be possibly due to the passage of cyclonic storms which are quite common during post monsoon season in the bob another important point to note here is that while both ctrl r and assim r peak at the same value 10 cm s the spread in assim r is much closer to observed distribution and more so towards higher current values the spread is quite narrow in case of ctrl r this clearly suggests that higher current speed values are also well simulated in assim r and are much less in number for ctrl r 5 4 sub surface currents validation of simulated currents in the upper ocean up to 100 m has been carried out to assess the skill of satellite data assimilation in reproducing the sub surface currents using these adcp measurements while we show the snapshot of vertical current profile from buoy bd12 at 10 5 n and 94 e ctrl r and assim r for the period apr nov 2018 in fig 7 for gross comparison the complete statistics for several buoys is presented in table 1 current speeds for the entire column up to 100 m exhibit significant seasonality being stronger during august september and also during june and october of 2018 for small periods the stronger currents during october could be due to very strong winds associated with cyclone titli in the second week of october 2018 in the last week of may and first half of june there were several cyclonic storms deep depressions depressions and extremely severe cyclonic storms in bob en wikipedia org wiki 2018 north indian ocean cyclone season the strong wind associated with these systems might have resulted in strong currents during these months as seen in the buoy data it is intriguing to note that while during august september currents very close to the surface are quite weak and strong at deeper depths 30 60 m in contrast during october and may june surface currents are also quite noticeable while one can clearly observe that currents are extremely weak in ctrl r from surface to 100 m depth assim r shows better skill in reproducing the observed pattern in currents in the ctrl r except for the upper 20 m or so magnitude of currents in the entire column down to 100 m is of the order of 5 10 cm s or less during the entire study period it suggests that unassimilated model has almost no skill in simulating sub surface currents at this location these currents are largely driven by ekman forcing and density variations since the mixed layer depth mld in bob is largely shallow of the order of 10 20 m for most part of the season and region due to fresh water lens at the surface it is the density variations which causes sub surface currents below mld prasad and mcclean 2004 hence the results so obtained suggest that variations in the sub surface density are not correctly picked up by ctrl r interestingly even in the control run small period 10 20 days variations are seen in the upper 20 m currents in contrast to ctrl r assim r shows good skill in simulating the sub surface currents as seen from the bottom panel of fig 7 barring the month of august in which simulated sub surface currents in assim r are unable to reproduce strong magnitudes in the other months currents are faithfully simulated for e g strong currents during sep oct and during jun as seen in the observations are quite reasonably simulated in assim r in other months also simulated currents in assim r are closer to the observations in comparison to ctrl r the comparison statistics for currents using adcp data from 5 five moorings is shown in table 2 computed statistics for assim r show less errors in ocean current simulations at all the depths in the table combined statistical scores for all the 5 adcps have been provided at each of the 7 depths starting 1 25 m down to 100 m at discrete depths along with correlation and rmse standard deviation of the currents is also provided one can see a significant improvement in correlation and much lesser rmse in assim r as compared to ctrl r at all the depths which also indicates robustness of the assimilation methodology it can also be seen from table 2 that the simulated current variability in assim r is in close agreement with the observed variability the variability in the case of ctrl r is far too low and at all the depths hence we can be reasonably sure that altimeter data assimilation has resulted in much improved consistent and robust simulation of currents not just at the surface but also in the upper layers of the ocean 5 5 eddy position extent and amplitude one of the important evaluation criteria of any data assimilative model is to see whether the simulations are able to faithfully represent mesoscale features primarily eddies in terms of position extent shape and magnitude fig 8 shows a snap shot of ssha from observations ctrl r and assim r for the 10th april 2018 surface currents are also overlaid as vectors this is the season april may when western bob is full of mesoscale eddies dandapat and chakraborty 2016 and hence a representative date in this case 10th april has been chosen for the analysis several anticyclonic elevated ssha at the centre with clockwise circulation pattern eddies can be seen in the observations left panel of fig 8 surrounded by these anticyclonic eddies is a small cyclonic feature with depressed ssha at the centre rest of the bay does not show any such closed circulation on a large scale a clear east west sea level gradient is seen with western side having elevated ssha and eastern side with depressed ssha while it is clearly evident that the large scale gradients east west in ssha are quite correctly picked up by both the simulations middle and right panels of fig 8 however the mesoscale eddies are either missing or misplaced and weak in ctrl r this suggests that control simulations fail to reproduce the observed mesoscale dynamics at the same time assim r simulates almost all the eddies both cyclonic and anticyclonic and is quite close to observations in terms of position extent and magnitude the amplitude of anticyclonic eddies in assim r is in the range of 25 30 cm which is of similar order as seen in observations left panel of fig 8 a small cyclonic eddy surrounded by anticyclonic eddies as seen in the observation is also nicely simulated in assim r suggesting that it is not just the bigger eddies but also the smaller eddies are correctly simulated after assimilating along track altimeter data in order to verify that assim r simulates correct eddy position we focus on an anticyclonic eddy centred at 17 5 n and 86 e seen in fig 8 and we show it separately in fig 9 the black dots are centre of this eddy determined from aviso ssha left dot and assim r ssha right dot the black dot to the south of the two close by dots is from ctrl r ssha it is clearly evident that centre of the eddy from assim r is very close to the observed location of the centre while the same from ctrl r is quite misplaced the intensity of the eddy as determined from the ssha magnitude at the centre simulated in assim r 27 cm is quite close to the observations 30 cm while the same is quite underestimated 10 cm in the ctrl r similarly the shape and dimension of this eddy is also simulated well in assim r as compared to ctrl r 5 6 particle trajectory analysis particle tracking capability of any model depends on the accurate simulation of ocean surface currents these currents are extremely useful in developing search and rescue sar aid tools for assisting the authorities in the eventuality of any mishap apart from sar application accurate trajectory also helps in understanding physical processes affecting the ecosystem ullman et al 2006 solano et al 2018 used a simple advection algorithm to compare model trajectories with positional data from floating drifter in the present work we have used simple velocity time relationship which is solved using finite difference approach to compute the particle trajectory using surface current fields from satellite and simulations from ctrl r and assim r since daily averaged fields have been used in the analysis the time step for computing updated particle position is taken as 1 day for this purpose two boxes box 1 and 2 as outlined in fig 10a have been selected to seed the particles around 20 particles were seeded at random locations within 20 km of the marked locations the trajectory was computed for each randomly distributed particle for a period of 10 days and the trajectories were averaged to get the mean trajectory of the particle for that location in this case particle trajectory obtained from satellite derived currents is considered as the reference to assess the trajectories calculated from the models simulated velocity fields the initial position of the particles is shown by red boxes in fig 10b and fig 10c it can be seen that the trajectory obtained from assim r green colour is closer to the observed trajectory black line for initial 5 6 days and then it starts to drift away in both the boxes interestingly these two boxes represent completely different circulation patterns but the validity proximity of the simulated trajectories to the actual in time remains the same up to 5 6 days while box 2 has a very clear anticyclonic eddy elevated ssha at the centre and particles were distributed very close to the centre in the other box 1 the particles were distributed at the periphery of the cyclonic circulation and yet the results were same this clearly indicates the robustness of the assimilation methodology and simulations in assim r at the same time trajectory computed using currents from ctrl r is quite off from the actual trajectory the average separation of the simulated lagrangian trajectories from the two runs with actual particle path derived from satellite currents is shown in fig 10d average separation between actual and predicted dashed lines for assim r and continuous lines for ctrl r for 10 days of integration for both the boxes 1 and 2 is shown in this figure as expected errors increase as the prediction time increases the error within first 1 2 days is nearly the same in two runs here too assim r is slightly better but as the integration time increases errors are much larger in the case of ctrl r as compared to assim r after 2 days of seeding the errors in ctrl r increase linearly rapidly and more so for box 1 the growth in trajectory errors can be attributed to the difference in the surface current speeds between aviso and assim r it can be seen from fig 6 that the surface current speeds from aviso are majorly twice as large as the surface current speeds from assim r effect of which is reflected in fig 10 the daily distance travelled the distance between two consecutive points in aviso in fig 10b and c appears to be twice as large compared to the same in assim r nevertheless it is noticed that up to 8 days of integration deviation in trajectory computed using assim r currents are less than 100 km this result is a direct effect of the satellite data assimilation that resulted in much improved circulation pattern and therefore this data assimilative model will be extremely useful in sar operations and in the understanding of physical processes in ecosystem studies 5 7 power spectral analysis of ssha the largest part of ocean kinetic energy is contained in the mesoscale signals ferrari and wunsch 2009 on the scales of 100 to 300 km chelton et al 2011 and the bay of bengal basin is no exception in fig 11 a we show the rms of ssha suggestive of variability computed from aviso data for the study period a large variability of ssh is concentrated in the western part of bob along the indian coastland and this is largely due to the presence of mesoscale eddies and seasonal reversing eicc maximum variability reaches up to 30 cm central and eastern part are less energetic this east west contrast in the variability pattern and study pertaining to associated energetics is of utmost importance one way to assess how the eddy kinetic energy is distributed in different wavenumber space bands is to perform power spectral density of sea surface height which also indicates the underlying dynamical processes governing these distributions satellite altimetry has led to several studies estimating sea surface height wavenumber spectrum le traon et al 2008 stammer 1997 this motivated us to compare the skill of model simulated ssha against aviso gridded product in this section the meridional ssha wavenumber spectra are calculated from aviso product and model simulations ctrl r and assim r the spectra have been computed from the along track daily ssha over the entire bob region of present study following chaudhary et al 2021 meridional power spectral density psd of ssha from aviso and model simulations ctrl r and assim r have been calculated at each 1 interval in longitude and then were averaged from april 01 2018 to december 31 2018 the slopes of the ssha wavenumber spectra are also calculated over the mesoscale band defined by the typical length scale of 70 km 250 km as suggested by xu and fu 2011 fig 11 b shows the mean ssha wavenumber spectrum as evident from the figure assim r spectra have very similar shape as that of aviso nearly up to the wavelength of 400 500 km beyond which towards lower wavelength assim r psd falls more gently as compared to aviso on the contrary spectrum shape of ctrl r is quite off with reference to aviso and shows very gentle slope right from wavelength 100 km and less for the wavelengths lesser than 70 km all the three psds become flat the above finding once again indicates that model simulations are more realistic when altimeter observations are assimilated slopes computed over the mesoscale band also suggest that assim r slope 2 77 is much steeper than those of ctrl r 1 79 and is closer to aviso 3 64 slope these slopes are much shallower than the one expected k 5 from qg turbulence theory hua and haidvogel 1986 it is to be noted here that shallower slopes in assim r as compared to aviso could be attributed to the contribution of ageostrophic effect in model ssh while altimeter ssh represents geostrophic balance another aspect to mention here is that slope of k 3 64 as obtained from aviso gridded field is higher as compared to the one which is calculated from along track altimeter data which is of the order of k 2 figure 1 of dufau et al 2016 in the central bob similar result was obtained by wang et al 2019 in the north pacific ocean while studying psd from along track altimeter data and gridded data they found that in the north pacific sub tropical counter current stcc region the gridded spectral slope in the mesoscale band is 3 8 0 3 while the along track spectral slope is 2 7 0 3 it is important to mention here that in our case too gridded spectral slope is of the order of 3 64 which is much closer to the one obtained by wang et al 2019 in north pacific xu and fu 2012 while analysing ssh psd using 7 years of jason 1 data found very low slopes between k 1 5 and k 2 5 in tropics and attributed this to the contribution of ageostrophic dynamics it is interesting to see from fig 11 b that assim r psd has remarkably similar shape at large wavelengths 300 km with aviso psd it is only for wavelengths less than 300 km that the assim r psd deviates from aviso psd it has been found by chelton et al 2011 that the smoothening procedure used in generating aviso gridded sla creates artefacts which are visible at scales shorten than 250 km in short it has been found that assim r spectral slope is closer to aviso spectral slope whereas ctrl r slope is far too less having analysed the averaged ssh spectral slope for the bob using gridded fields from the two model simulations and from aviso we analyse the behaviour of slopes in the zonal and meridional directions separately in the high energy region in the bob two transects in western bob as shown in fig 11a were chosen and averaged april december 2018 psd of ssha along these two transects were computed spectral slopes were also computed over the mesoscale band 70 250 km to diagnose the influence of anisotropy on the spectral slopes fig 11 c shows the zonal left and meridional right wave number spectra for ssha from aviso ctrl r and assim r in this case too assim r spectral slopes are closer to those computed from aviso for both zonal and meridional cases interestingly meridional slope 5 34 1 52 is steeper than the slope of its zonal counterpart 4 80 1 44 as computed from aviso psd this finding is in close agreement with the one inferred by wang et al 2019 they found that in the high eddy kinetic energy regions difference between zonal and meridional spectrum slopes could reach a value of 2 with zonal slope being shallower than the meridional slopes in our case it is reassuring to see that this anisotropy between zonal and meridional slopes is remarkably well reproduced by both the model simulations too albeit assim r slopes being much nearer to aviso slopes zonal and meridional spectral slopes of 4 80 1 44 and 5 34 1 52 respectively obtained from aviso are close to the one that is predicted for quasi geostrophic qg turbulence theories k 5 assim r slopes however are somewhat flatter than the predictions of qg theory which is not difficult to understand given the fact that even the most sophisticated data assimilative models are not so accurate nevertheless the results obtained from this analysis highlight the effectiveness of along track assimilation of ssha in improving the model simulations paving the way for its use for research and operational purposes 6 conclusions altimeter track observations of sea level anomaly from jason 3 were assimilated in a high resolution model of the indian ocean the impact of assimilation was analysed on simulated sea level and currents from assimilated and non assimilated model simulations for the year 2018 in the bay of bengal it was seen that the sea level anomaly simulated from assim r reproduced observed variability more realistically as compared to ctrl r root mean square error in current magnitude reduced by almost 50 in the assim r and the impact is seen more in the meridional currents the effect of ssha assimilation was evident in deeper ocean up to 200 m too where assim r was able to reproduce most of the sub surface variability below 20 m depth comparison with adcp currents at 5 mooring locations too reveals that the assim r simulated currents were better than ctrl r the size location and amplitude of assim r simulated eddies were very consistent with the observations on the other hand those from ctrl r were very much misplaced particle trajectory estimated from assim r simulations is closer to the trajectory computed from observations for initial 6 days as compared to the trajectory from ctrl r which was quite off power spectrum analysis carried on ssha from both the simulations suggests that the mesoscale dynamics of the energetic regions is nicely represented in the assim r simulations the current study demonstrates the role of altimeter observations in improving the surface and subsurface oceanic flow this would further help the numerical models to improve upon the initial conditions to generate better and accurate forecast using better ocean models and including more number of altimeter track observations in the assimilation would further improve model s skill in future cnes and nasa s joint surface water and ocean topography swot mission will extend the capability of nadir altimeters in mapping and resolving the small mesoscale and sub mesoscale features morrow and le traon 2012 the present study can be considered as a step forward in the context of swot observations as we have a suitable regional bob set up of ocean model in place ratheesh et al 2020 chaudhary et al 2021 using which we will perform osse experiments to assess relative merits and shortcomings of swath vis à vis nadir

23866,assimilation of hydrographic profiles into isopycnal model is not trivial since one is in z level coordinate and the other is discretized in potential density coordinate there are two ways to calculate innovation one realizes innovation in the observation vertical space and the other in the model isopycnal coordinates this work aims to better understand the impacts and accuracy of each one three experiments were conducted over the south atlantic with hycom employing the ensemble optimal interpolation enoi each 3 days during six years in which the last four years were used for evaluation the first experiment assimilated argo data with innovations in isopycnal coordinates argo dp the second assimilated argo data with innovation in z levels argo z the third assimilated only argo temperature with innovation in z levels argo z t a control run with no assimilation was also used for comparison considering the hindcast a reduction of 12 17 and 18 was observed on temperature rmsd with respect to control and of 15 20 and 5 on salinity for argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively major impacts were observed in sea surface height ssh and ocean heat content ohc in the subtropical gyre region 10 s 40 s especially near the coast argo dp generally reduced ssh increasing model bias while argo z managed to correct ssh towards aviso and argo z t produced small negative impacts this was confirmed by ssh spatial correlation with respect to aviso which was 0 754 0 723 0 756 and 0 740 for control argodp argoz and argozt respectively the overall mean of ohc in the top 2000 m was 42 84 41 98 41 41 42 18 and 42 00 mega joule per square metre mj m 2 for woa18 control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively a correct uplift of model isopycnals considering climatology was verified at the vertical cross section along 42 5 w and around 28 s for argo z and argo z t and an excessively uplift for argo dp this led to stronger and thicker intermediate western boundary current and weaker brazil current bc between 20 s and 27 s control argo z and argo z t presented a bc mean transport in agreement with literature while argo dp underestimated it the results indicate that innovation in observation space is more adequate than in model vertical space particularly for low vertical model resolutions keywords hydrographic profiles isopycnal ocean models ensemble optimal interpolation south atlantic ocean brazil current remo ocean data assimilation system 1 introduction data assimilation da is a powerful technique to improve the representation of the ocean and atmosphere by numerical models and to help for understanding of their dynamics it combines model outputs with observations and produces the analysis with smaller errors than the model one da method greatly used is the ensemble optimal interpolation enoi which is a simplified version of the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 it employs a stationary ensemble of model states from a past long model integration providing a suboptimal solution compared to the enkf evensen 2003 wan et al 2010 the latter needs to integrate the model n times been n the ensemble size which makes enoi n times cheaper oke et al 2010 wan et al 2010 due to its multivariate nature enoi also transfers individual observational information to all model state variables among the most important in situ observations today for regional and global ocean forecasting systems is the array for real time geostrophic oceanography argo roemmich et al 2019 in august 2020 there were 3 865 argo floats collecting temperature and salinity data down to 2 000 m several authors have demonstrated the crucial role of assimilating this data in order to constrain the ocean model oke and schiller 2007 and tanajura et al 2020 showed that the assimilation of argo profiles is crucial for constraining the thermohaline structure of ocean models especially for salinity argo is today being expanded by adding profilers to measure biogeochemical variables such as oxygen and chlorophyll and to observe the ocean in full depth jayne et al 2017 roemmich et al 2019 gasparin et al 2020 showed through an observing system simulation experiment osse that an array of 1 200 deep argo floats would significantly constrain the deep ocean by reducing model temperature and salinity errors by around 50 these data are collected in z or p level coordinate while some ocean models are formulated in terms of isopycnal layers with thicknesses and depths that varies in space and time xie and zhu 2010 and its assimilation is not trivial ocean models with this characteristic includes the miami isopycnal coordinate ocean model micom and its successor the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom the latter combines three different vertical coordinates in order to produce a better vertical representation of the thermohaline structure of the ocean without loss of discretization on coastal regions and in the mixed layer there are basically two strategies for the assimilation of argo data into hycom differing on the choice of vertical coordinate employed in the innovation z level or isopycnal xie and zhu 2010 have compared these two strategies with hycom in a numerical experiment over the pacific ocean for four years they concluded that calculating the innovation in isopycnal coordinate produced the smallest error for temperature and salinity with respect to argo data when compared to the scheme with innovation in z level below 200 m the latter presented a salinity error greater than the control run error which had no assimilation wang et al 2017 performed a single assimilation of 1 500 synthetic profiles into micom and compared the two schemes unlike xie and zhu 2010 they pointed out that innovation at z level outperforms the innovation in isopycnic layers in almost every depth for temperature especially below 100 m the same behaviour was observed for salinity except for intermediate depths where both schemes led to similar errors these are the only studies that compare the two schemes and none investigates the impacts on the sea level and the currents changes in ocean salinity and temperature lead to volume changes which affects sea level fu et al 2011 also due to the multivariate nature of enoi assimilation of hydrographic profiles can directly impact model sea surface height ssh and ocean currents in order to assimilate sea level anomaly sla observations one needs the mean ssh mssh of the model to subtract it from the instantaneous model ssh to get the model sla yan et al 2015 assimilated altimetry sla data into hycom employing two different msshs one derived from a model free run and the other from an assimilation run with in situ temperature and salinity data the first one resulted in worse estimates of subsurface temperature and salinity even with the assimilation of in situ data while the other led to improvements on subsurface yan et al 2015 also observed that the assimilation of in situ data leads to a lower mssh in another by mignac et al 2015 the assimilation of argo profile reduced the ocean heat content ohc of the model and consequently produced a lower mssh therefore changes on the model mssh due to hydrographic profiles assimilation strongly influence the performance when to assimilate sla as the estimation of the latter depends on the model mssh this can also affect density and pressure gradients leading to impacts on the geostrophic component of currents this paper investigates the different impacts of the two strategies for assimilating argo data into hycom s thermohaline structure ssh and western boundary currents wbc in the south atlantic ocean here we use the oceanographic modelling and observation network remo ocean data assimilation system rodas which is based on the enoi lima et al 2013 tanajura et al 2014 carvalho et al 2019 santana et al 2020 tanajura et al 2020 and employs the hycom model this system was developed to assimilate t s profiles exclusively through the innovation in isopycnal layers presented in detail in tanajura et al 2014 and mignac et al 2015 this work makes rodas more versatile by enabling the possibility to assimilate t s profiles in isopycnal coordinate ocean models with the innovation in z level 2 methodology 2 1 ocean model description and configuration hycom is a primitive equation general circulation model that solves five prognostic equations two for the horizontal motion one for the continuity equation and two for the thermodynamic conservation bleck 2002 chassignet et al 2009 it employs isopycnal coordinates for the open stratified ocean to ensure conservation of water masses properties in long integrations it smoothly transitions into z coordinates in unstratified regions such as the mixed layer and into sigma coordinates in shallow and coastal waters this work uses the hycom version 2 2 18 with a set of two nested grids one with a coarse horizontal resolution of 1 4 and the other with 1 12 the first one covers almost all the atlantic ocean and provides boundary conditions to the 1 12 grid which extends from 46 s to 10 n and from 60 w to 20 w more details of the 1 4 and the nesting are described in tanajura et al 2020 and in carvalho et al 2019 respectively the experiments were conducted on the higher resolution grid and nested on the 1 4 grid which had no assimilation the models were set with 21 vertical hybrid layers with surface pressure as reference for potential density aiming to improve the representation of near surface fields the target densities were set equal to 19 50 20 25 21 00 21 75 22 50 23 25 24 00 24 70 25 28 25 77 26 18 26 52 26 80 27 03 27 22 27 38 27 52 27 64 27 74 27 82 and 27 88 the first three layers are intentionally set with low values to guarantee a minimum of three fixed depth layers on the ocean surface hycom was initialized by interpolating the results of a 31 year climatological integration of the 1 4 grid forced with monthly mean fields of atmospheric forcing from the comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set coads woodruff et al 1987 and then integrated another 10 years with the same forcing afterwards it was integrated from 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2007 employing the 6 hourly atmospheric fields of 10 m wind stress and speed 2 m air temperature and mixing ratio net shortwave and long wave radiation fluxes and precipitation from the national centers for environmental prediction national center for atmospheric research ncep ncar coupled forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010 the initial condition produced by this spin up on 1 january of 2008 was used for all experiments 2 2 the data assimilation scheme the enoi is based on the following equation 1 x a x b k y h x b where x a and x b are the analysis and background respectively y is the observations vector and h is observational operator k is the kalman gain matrix which transfers observations information in its native space to model state vectors in its original grid points k is given by the equation 2 k α σ b h t α h σ b h t r 1 where α is a scalar comprehended in 0 1 to reduce ensemble spread σ denotes the localization operator applied to the b matrix using the schur product to remove spurious correlations with a radius of influence equal to 150 km the localization operator was applied according to the formula by gaspari and cohn 1999 also employed in xie and zhu 2010 and mignac et al 2015 b is the co variance matrix of the model error the superscript t represents the transpose of a matrix or vector and r stands for the variance diagonal matrix of the observational error for ensemble methods b is given by 3 b a a t n 1 where a a 1 a 2 a n a m x m 1 n n 1 n x n x m represents the model state vector for the ensemble member m with m varying from 1 to the total number of ensemble members n for enoi this ensemble of model anomalies is taken from a previous model free run evensen 2003 rodas employs a running seasonal ensemble to consider intra seasonal variability and high frequency model dynamics as in xie and zhu 2010 xie et al 2011 and mignac et al 2015 to achieve this 21 model states from the free run are selected within a centred 60 day window for each year in this case 2008 2013 with a total of 126 members this member selection is performed every 3 days following the assimilation cycle for more details the reader is referred to tanajura et al 2020 and the schematic figure 3 in santana et al 2020 2 3 the two approaches in the innovation calculation the innovation in model s isopycnal coordinate for hydrographic profiles available in z level coordinates was introduced by thacker and esenkov 2002 followed by xie and zhu 2010 and implemented in rodas by mignac et al 2015 it consists in estimating potential density profiles from ts observations and comparing with model s layer density once they match pseudo observed layer thicknesses dp obs are generated for each isopycnic layer and a step function is created for dp obs t and s errors estimates of these new observations followed xie and zhu 2010 and mignac et al 2015 these observations are then sequentially assimilated the first one is dp obs so that increments of the model s layer thicknesses dp and velocity components are produced then t and s are assimilated in a univariate way at last xie and zhu 2010 recommend that for isopycnal layers it is preferable to discard the t analysis under the mixed layer and diagnose them from the seawater state equation in order to conserve layer density this recommendation is based on the evidence that the assimilation of dp obs is able to substantially change the vertical profile of t so that the increments of t would be small and to conserve the densities in the isopycnal layers maintaining the analysis of s and diagnosing t after the assimilation of dp obs would provide that best representation of the ts profile for z level coordinates layers there is no assimilation of dp obs and both t and s analysis are preserved some particularities that rise up from this approach must be highlighted the first one is the vertical resolution degradation of observations hydrographic profiles such as the ones from argo have hundreds of sampling levels while ocean models have a few dozens e g in the present work only 21 also the error estimates for dp obs are produced by their standard deviation they reach magnitudes similar to model standard deviation and attain values of 100 m or more below 1000 m at last for this approach it is indispensable to have both t and s in order to produce dp obs this stands as a limitation and excludes observations from expendable bathythermographs xbts some moored buoys and argo data in which the temperature profile is accompanied by low quality salinity data discarded by quality control in the present work about 20 of the argo ts data presented high quality temperature but were rejected due to low quality salinity in order to do a fair comparison only argo with good quality ts were used for all experiments in this way the same argo profiles were assimilated in all experiments for the other scheme one needs to interpolate discrete model ts values to observational space in z levels on isopycnal layers ts are defined at the centre of each layer and its corresponding depth can be calculated from dp here linear interpolation is employed for simplicity but it leads to similar results compared with higher order interpolation wang et al 2017 the assimilation with this approach is done jointly and in a multivariate way i e t and s are assimilated at the same time with a single analysis increment generated for all model state vector thus the quality of the dp increments relies on the ensemble quality and no diagnosing for t or s leaving the density adjust to the model if necessary in this scheme vertical resolution of observations is preserved and t can be assimilated in the absence of s therefore the aforementioned negative aspects of innovation in isopycnal layers are avoided when innovation is performed in the vertical observational space 2 4 experiment design in order to evaluate the best strategy for assimilating argo ts profiles into hycom a set of three experiments were performed from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2013 forced every 6 h with the ncep cfsr atmospheric fields the first one assimilated argo data with innovations in isopycnal coordinates argo dp the second assimilated argo data with innovation in z levels argo z the third assimilated only argo s temperature with innovation in z levels argo z t a three day observational window covering the analysis day and the two previous days was employed and the assimilation cycle was set to three days the model was also integrated without assimilation control to better help understanding the impacts of each strategy considering that argo data have limited local impact in each assimilation cycle the first two years were discarded and the evaluation focused on 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2013 for argo dp vertical localization was implemented only on the covariance of dp in the b matrix as suggested by mignac et al 2015 see table 1 2 5 data used in assimilation and evaluation the argo data were downloaded from the coriolis data centre ftp ftp ifremer fr ifremer argo geo atlantic ocean and submitted to quality control tests recommended by the global temperature salinity profile programme gtspp 2010 as a result a total of 18 111 argo ts profiles were assimilated from 2008 to 2013 and 12 714 from 2010 to 2013 were employed in the validation of the experiments in addition gridded absolute dynamical topography adt data from the archiving validation and interpretation of oceanographic satellites aviso with 1 4 resolution available at ftp my cmems du eu core sealevel glo phy l4 rep observations 008 047 dataset duacs rep global merged allsat phy l4 were used in the validation in order to make a valid direct comparison of the simulated ssh with aviso adt the mssh field from each model run was adjusted by offsets in such a way that the area averaged model mssh matches the aviso mssh average over the domain the monthly temperature and salinity climatology 1955 2017 from world ocean atlas woa18 locarnini et al 2018 zweng et al 2018 available at https www nodc noaa gov oc5 woa18 with a 1 4 horizontal resolution was employed in the evaluation of the ohc and density 3 results as mentioned above assimilation was realized each 3 days therefore after each assimilation the model produced 72 h hindcasts before the next assimilation the results of the experiments were objectively evaluated considering the outputs at 24 h 48 h and 72 h after each assimilation step it is important to highlight that the argo data used for evaluation of the assimilation experiments were not employed in the assimilation at the time of the evaluation since they would be assimilated only in the next cycle therefore these data may be considered as independent the exceptions to this approach in the evaluation of the results are shown in figs 1 and 2 which present the analyses performed with innovation in z level and model layers observations in model layers were generated following thacker and esenkov 2002 methodology and therefore are the same assimilated in argo dp run to further investigate the differences between the assimilation strategies the impacts on the brazil current bc and intermediate western boundary current iwbc were also assessed fig 1 shows the vertical mean profile of root mean squared deviation rmsd for temperature and salinity control analysis and background with respect to argo data analysis rmsd of temperature and salinity in z level show similar pattern for the top 50 m and 100 m for temperature and salinity respectively argo dp presented the best analysis and below these levels argo z was the best the first outperforms the latter at these top levels because there hycom employs z coordinates and there is no dependence on the quality of the dp analysis also argo dp is realized with a univariate assimilation algorithm while argo z is multivariate argo z t was able to reduce salinity background error in the top 400 m despite no assimilation of s except for the top 100 m where analysis and background are practically the same and the background presents error greater than control for temperature argo z t showed the smallest correction for the first 700 m and below this level it presented smaller rmsd than argo dp also below 700 m argo dp analysis and background for temperature and salinity presented similar rmsds and below 1 450 m they were greater than control the background errors near surface 100 m were very similar considering the temperature for all assimilation runs and sometimes very close to control even when analysis presented large differences for instance at 100 m temperature analysis rmsd was 1 25 1 5 and 2 0 c for argo z argo dp and argo z t respectively while background rmsd was 2 2 c for all four runs including control at this level salinity analysis rmsd was 0 21 0 22 and 0 35 psu for argo z argo dp and argo z t respectively and background rmsd was 0 30 0 31 0 35 and 0 33 psu for argo z argo dp argo z t and control respectively the biggest differences in the temperature background rmsds were in deep levels like 1450 m where the error was 0 3 c for argo z and argo z t 0 37 c for argo dp and 0 35 c for control this indicates that the model temperature has a strong bias in the top 150 m since the background rmsds are very similar and very close to control for deeper levels the model temperature is able to conserve some of the analysis quality for salinity the quality of the analysis is conserved on almost all levels since there are significant differences between argo z t background rmsd and argo dp and argo z background rmsd again the argo z produces the smallest averaged rsmd along the profile 0 13 psu the importance of assimilating s is evident since the rmsd of the argo z t is the largest 0 20 psu among the experiments for both the analysis and the background considering analysis rmsd in model layers fig 2 argo dp presented the best analysis for the top 14 layers while argo z was the best for the deepest 5 layers for temperature and salinity argo z t analysis presented a more significant impact on temperature in the top layers compared to its impact considering z level yet no significant impact on deeper layers is observed namely on layers 9 19 also in the first nine layers the model has a strong temperature bias since the background rmsds of all runs are very similar despite significant difference among the analysis rmsds but still conserves some analysis quality as control presents greater rmsd for salinity the model is able to conserve more of the analysis quality for all layers since argo z t background and control rmsd are significantly higher than argo dp and argo z background rmsd although similar results are observed in the evaluation at model layers and at z levels at the model layers argo dp produces the best analysis in most part of the vertical profile in the model layers 1 14 while argo z produces the best result in most part of the profile in z levels 150 2000 m also argo dp analysis produces the smallest rmsd of dp not shown in isopycnal layers considering that observations employed for the evaluation at model layers are pseudo observations and at z levels are the real observations one can conclude that the synthetic profiles of dp obs temperature and salinity projected into model layers are not accurate and precise otherwise argo dp analysis quality on model layers should have been also observed in z level considering the hindcasts rmsd for temperature and salinity with respect to argo data fig 3 in which the analyses are not considered all experiments reduced the control rmsd for temperature at practically all depths in the first 200 m the reduction was very similar but below this level the argo z and argo z t clearly outperformed the argo dp this result is consistent with the one presented by wang et al 2017 argo z t and argo z produce similar results for temperature since the difference between them is very small this is due to the aforementioned strong bias of model temperature the vertically averaged rmsd in the top 2000 m was 1 08 0 95 0 90 and 0 89 for control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively argo z presented a 5 2 and 16 7 reduction with respect to the argo dp and control respectively for salinity fig 3b the argo dp and argo z showed significant reduction of the rmsd with respect to control as in wang et al 2017 similar impacts were observed for the first 200 m with the argo z presenting slightly better results than argo dp and a more pronounced impact below this level considering the vertical average the rmsd was 0 20 0 17 0 16 and 0 19 psu for control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively argo z rmsd was 5 8 and 20 smaller than argo dp and control respectively when only temperature is assimilated argo z t salinity rmsd increases in the first 150 m with respect to control but it decreases below this is an indication that the model mixed layer salinity in the south western atlantic has in general small correlation with temperature and it is mostly controlled by atmospheric forcing however this behaviour was not observed in the brazil malvinas confluence not shown where temperature and salinity showed good correlation in the first 400 m and reduced salinity rmsd by 5 4 yet assimilation of salinity in this specific region still presented significant positive impact leading to a rsmd reduction of 13 5 with respect to control the two strategies to assimilate argo profiles into hycom led to different impacts on the mssh as shown in fig 4 around 5 n grey dashed line the ssh produced by the experiments decreases towards the east as observed in aviso however the latter decreases from 0 56 m to 0 44 m while control argo z and argo z t change from 0 56 to 0 48 m and argo dp from 0 56 to 0 52 m in the subtropical gyre region 10 s 40 s the assimilation runs and control were able to represent the large scale ssh structure with high values in the subtropical region and lower ssh towards the north and south the greatest magnitudes of 0 68 0 76 m were observed around 30 s in aviso control and argo z while in argo dp they range from 0 52 to 0 60 m and in argo z t from 0 56 to 0 64 m the greatest negative impacts were observed in the subregion enclosed by the dashed lines in fig 4 where argo dp reduced control mssh and increased the model bias south of 30 s this was also observed but with smaller intensity for argo z and argo z t at some locations this can be more clearly verified in fig 5 fig 5 shows the mssh differences with respect to aviso for control control minus aviso and with respect to control for the assimilation runs experiments minus control this strategy to present the impact in mssh aims to better capture the magnitude of the corrections produced by assimilation and to identify if they are in the right direction in this way if control minus aviso has positive values and the experiments minus control have negative values assimilation decreased model bias the opposite also indicates improvement by assimilation however if the same sign is observed in control minus aviso and experiments minus control it means that assimilation degraded the representation of mssh the black dashed line displayed in the results of all runs represents the zero isoline from control minus aviso north of 30 s control presents higher mssh with respect to aviso except around 26 s 44 w where it attains 0 125 m between 30 s and 36 s negative bias dominates except along the coast and south of 36 s there is the greatest positive bias of more than 0 30 m surrounded by some locations with negative bias north of 30 s all assimilation runs reduced control mssh and lead mssh towards aviso however east of 41 w control bias has maxima of 0 05 m while argo dp and argo z t reduce it by 0 10 m and argo z by 0 075 m around 26 s 44 w none of the experiments were able to increase control ssh towards aviso but argo z achieved the best result since it presented the smallest reduction between 30 s and 36 s argo dp greatly increases the control bias e g 0 15 m at 32 s 48 w argo z in general presents correction in the right direction but sometimes it also increases the bias by 0 025 m argo z t is similar to argo z with a broader coverage of corrections in the wrong direction south of 36 s assimilation runs presented similar impacts with mssh reduction dominating for argo dp therefore argo z showed the best mssh among the assimilation runs correcting most of the model mssh towards aviso while argo dp mostly degraded it in order to objectively evaluate and confirm the results about the assimilation impact on mssh time series of space correlation of ssh with respect to aviso was also investigated fig 6 it may be verified that argodp presented the lowest ssh correlation along all integration in comparison to the two other assimilation runs on the other hand argoz attained the highest correlation most of the time alternating with control for instance from january 2010 to august 2010 argoz had the highest correlation while from september 2010 to december 2010 it was control the overall correlation mean was 0 754 0 723 0 756 and 0 740 for control argodp argoz and argozt respectively since the region enclosed by the dashed lines in fig 4 presented the greatest impacts on ssh and it contains the wbc the next results will focus on this region fig 7 shows the ohc differences for control with respect to woa control minus woa and for the assimilation runs with respect to control experiments minus control considering the control run positive negative values indicate that the control has higher lower ohc than woa considering the assimilation runs positive negative values indicate that they increased decreased control ohc in this way if both assimilation and control runs have positive or negative differences it means that assimilation increased model bias otherwise it reduced considering that woa18 is a climatology rmsd with respect to argo ts data in this region is presented in table 2 it shows that woa18 has the smallest error and therefore it is a valid dataset to be used as reference also woa18 ts rmsds were the smallest for all levels not shown the map with the difference control minus woa may be divided into three subregions separated by the dashed lines in fig 7 with a well defined bias of the control with respect to woa subregion a with lower ohc subregion b with higher ohc and subregion c with lower ohc subregion a follows the coast where the wbc flows it shows the highest negative differences reaching magnitudes of 8 mj m 2 south of 30 s except around 38 s 54 w where it is observed a positive difference of 8 mj m 2 for this specific location 38 s 54 w all assimilation runs corrected the model towards woa the assimilation of argo dp intensified the negative bias in practically all subregion a with maximum of 4 mj m 2 around 32 s on the other hand argo z t reduced the model bias in some regions around 32 s 46 w and increased in others around 24 s 42 w argo z presented the best result correcting the model towards woa for most of subregion a in subregion b all assimilation runs reduced ohc with respect to control argo dp presented the greatest impact but in some locations around 30 s 41 w it exceeded the control bias of 0 8 to 1 6 mj m 2 decreasing it by 2 4 to 3 2 mj m 2 while argo z and argo z t decreased 0 8 mj m 2 in subregion c it was observed a lower ohc for control with respect to woa and all assimilation runs presented similar impacts increasing ohc in general but reducing it in some regions finally it is important to note the transition of the control bias from subregion a to c negative to positive to negative argo dp increments were not able to invert this pattern as it increased control ohc bias in subregion a while argo z presented a good correction especially between subregion a and b the overall mean of ohc in the top 2000 m are 42 84 41 98 41 41 42 18 and 42 00 mj m 2 for woa18 control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively confirming that argo z presented the best increments while argo dp increased model bias and degraded the solution impacts on the wbc were also assessed by two vertical cross sections of velocity and density difference with respect to woa the cross sections are represented by the solid lines in fig 7 the first is along 42 25 w fig 8 where the bc veers westward following the 200 m isobath rocha et al 2014 argo dp presented a weaker 0 25 m s in its core and shallower 0 200 m bc with respect to control argo z and argo z t for these were observed velocity of 0 30 m s and vertical extension of 300 m for control and argo z and 250 m for argo z t for the iwbc the maximum velocity was 0 15 0 30 0 20 and 0 35 m s for control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively at 24 4 s the iwbc reaches the surface for all runs but with greater velocities of 0 20 m s at 300 m in argo dp and argo z t while in control and argo z it was 0 10 m s also at 24 s the iwbc reaches 200 m and 250 m in argo dp and argo z t respectively while in the control and argo z runs it is deeper and extends up to 400 m according to observations at 24 15 s 42 4 w january 2003 to may 2004 presented by rocha et al 2014 the bc mean velocity is 0 17 0 14 m s and the inversion of velocity direction occurs around 400 m these authors also suggest based on other observations that this mooring is dislocated from the bc core and therefore the observed mean velocity is underestimated besides this the bc presents a high variability due to a continuously adjustment of potential vorticity for the iwbc the maximum observed velocity was 0 11 0 03 m s at 800 m comparing to the hycom runs the bc does not reach the mooring location but in control and argo z it extends more eastward than argo z t and especially argo dp also despite vertical extension of the bc be smaller than observed control and argo z produce patterns closer to observations than argo z t and argo dp these runs overestimated iwbc core velocity while control and argo z are in agreement with observations the shallower and weaker bc with a more extensive and intense iwbc produced in the assimilation runs especially argo dp was due to a general uplift of isopycnals with respect to control mainly the 26 18 isopycnal for instance at 24 2 s this uplift was of 75 m and for argo z and argo z t the uplift was of 25 m it can be verified that argo z and argo z t presented a more precise correction of density towards woa climatology fig 8b in fact for control around 350 m where the 26 18 isopycnal is located there is an inversion of density bias from negative 0 350 m to positive 350 1000 m argo dp increased density in practically all the section including levels that control presented higher density with respect to woa and ended up with higher density than climatology around 250 m where the 26 18 isopycnal is located on the other hand argo z and argo z t reduced control bias with respect to woa at practically all levels and presented a good correction around 350 m increasing density above this level and reducing beneath it therefore argo z and argo z t correctly uplifted the 26 18 isopycnal while argo dp excessively uplifted it also argo z presented the greatest magnitude of corrections among the assimilation runs similar pattern was verified in cross section around 28 s fig 9 argo dp simulated the bc with mean velocity of 0 20 m s while the other runs produced 0 25 m s the inversion of velocity occurred at 400 m for all runs and the iwbc presented a mean core velocity of 0 25 m s for control and argo z and 0 30 m s for argo dp and argo z t in situ observation at 27 9 s 46 7 w presented by rocha et al 2014 showed the bc extending down to 850 m with a mean velocity in its core of 0 34 0 04 m s the mooring did not capture the iwbc core velocity the uplift of the 26 18 isopycnal was observed in all assimilation runs especially argo dp also it can be verified that the inversion of density bias for the control with respect to woa occurred at 350 m fig 9b from negative 0 350 m to positive 350 1000 m as it was observed along 42 5 w fig 8b argo dp inverted the control run bias around 250 m and presented higher density with respect woa indicating an over lift of the 26 8 isopycnal on the other hand argo z t and argo z reduced the control bias in almost all levels without inverting it similarly to what was verified in fig 8b argo z presented the largest corrections towards woa among the assimilation runs this reinforces the importance of assimilation of salinity the bc transport was calculated from 21 s to 30 s fig 10 region of the greatest impacts of assimilation the depth limits of the bc were defined based on the four years mean 2010 2013 of the vertical cross sections of velocity for each latitude and only negative velocities were considered argo dp presented the smallest transport in this latitudinal range followed by argo z t argo z and control between 21 s and 22 s argo z transport are in agreement with napolitano et al 2019 and pita et al 2020 while argo dp transport at 22 s is in agreement with schmid and majumder 2018 argo z and control simulated very similar transports north of 27 s except for 24 s in this latitudinal range quasi synoptic xbt transects near 22 s mata et al 2012 and 25 s garzoli et al 2013 indicates high mesoscale variability according to schmid and majumder 2018 estimates based on individual transects can result in a transport twice as large if one considers the monthly mean velocity field these authors employed argo ts profiles subsurface velocity from floats trajectories ssh and wind fields from 1993 to 2015 to derive a monthly three dimensional geostrophic velocity fields they estimated a mean bc transport of 2 7 sv and 3 3 sv considering the top 400 m and the top 800 m respectively between 20 s and 27 s these values are in relatively good agreement with control argo z and argo z t whose mean transports were 3 37 2 98 and 2 81 sv respectively while argo dp produced 2 13 sv and underestimated the transport at 24 s the bc experiences high and complicated variability as it tries to continuously adjust itself to change in coast orientation while conserving potential vorticity rocha et al 2014 schmid and majumder 2018 as a consequence of this large variability schmid and majumder 2018 estimated the bc transport ranging from 0 4 to 5 1 sv therefore large differences among the experiments are expected south of 27 s differences between control and argo z increase due to thickening and intensification of the bc despite producing similar mean velocity sections as shown in fig 9a around 28 s comparing the argo z and argo z t the importance of salinity becomes clearer as the latter showed in general a weaker bc with respect to literature the runs presented low values of transport for all latitudes 4 discussion and conclusions in this study six years of argo ts profiles were assimilated into hycom with two different strategies one in which the innovation is performed in the model isopycnal layers and the other in which the innovation is performed in observational space in z level coordinate one integration was realized with the first approach argo dp and two were realized with the second approach one assimilating both temperature and salinity argo z and the other only temperature argo z t overall analyses and hindcasts rmsds for temperature and salinity with respect to argo data were reduced employing the two strategies therefore both are suitable for assimilating hydrographic profiles however objective comparison of the analyses rmsds in z levels and in model layers showed that innovation in isopycnal coordinates is not as accurate as innovation in z levels in addition considering the sequence of 3 day hindcasts after each assimilation argo z also outperformed argo dp for both temperature fig 3a and salinity fig 3b as wang et al 2017 pointed out the main difference on the performance of the two schemes is the non linearity of the observation operator h and the construction of the pseudo observation of the model layer thicknesses by argo data dp obs the first one depends only on the choice of the vertical interpolation here linear interpolation was used after preliminary experiments with third order splines not showing substantial difference on the other hand the calculation of dp obs is strongly non linear and non unique since one tries to reconstruct three state variables t s and dp obs from only two observed variables t and s employing the seawater state equation wang et al 2017 this was objectively confirmed by evaluating the analyses rmsds of the experiments moreover the standard deviation of dp obs used in assimilation to estimate the errors of this variable presents magnitudes comparable to model standard deviation which are large below 1 000 m this leads to reduced impact of the dp obs assimilation on the thermohaline correction also the low vertical resolution employed by the model has a direct impact on the vertical resolution of the observed profile for the argo dp strategy which compromises the analysis quality especially in regions of intense temperature and salinity gradients such as the thermocline however it is important to mention that argo z scheme relies on ensemble quality to update model s prognostic variables and different ensemble could lead to different results these are the main key points of each scheme that led to different impacts on hycom thermohaline structure this in turn led to impacts on other model variables and features like mssh heat content and wbc despite an overall reduction of t and s rmsd with respect to argo modifications were not always positive on other variables over all the domain small negative impacts on the mssh produced by the argo dp run around 5 n and significant impacts in the subregion limited by the dashed lines in fig 4 were verified in this subregion assimilation runs in general were able to reduce the model bias towards aviso however on few locations north of 30 s the analysis increments were larger than expected and the bias was inverted for argo z t and especially for argo dp also between 30 s and 36 s argo dp greatly increased the model bias while argo z and argo z t reduced it therefore argo dp presented the largest negative impacts and argo z had the best mssh among the assimilation runs this was confirmed by the highest mssh correlation with aviso attained by argo z 0 76 while argo dp and argo z t produced 0 72 and 0 74 respectively changes in mssh reflect the assimilation impact on the subsurface by the updated model thermohaline structure evaluating the vertically integrated ohc in the top 2 000 m argo z t and especially argoz showed good performance by producing accurate increments with complex spatial structure considering subregions a b and c in fig 7 and therefore reducing the model bias on the other hand argo dp was not able to invert this pattern it reduced the ohc in the subregions a and b and increased the error in subregion a also in two vertical sections close to the coast in subregion a along 42 5 w and around 28 s a good representation of thermohaline structure by argo z t and especially argo z was obtained they correctly increased the model density above 350 m and decreased below it reducing the control bias on the other hand argo dp inverted the control bias on density around 250 m due to an excessive increase on model density and not capturing the transition of control bias around 350 m subregion a follows the coast and it is a region of intense mesoscale activity as the bc meanders and develops several eddies silveira et al 2008 mill et al 2015 santana et al 2020 thus it is a region to be difficultly simulated and the quality of the assimilated observations is crucial to produce accurate impacts the mssh reduction observed for argo dp in fig 5 is consistent with the ohc reduction shown in fig 7 despite a smaller ts rmsd with respect to argo than control this was caused by an increase in model density associated with colder and saltier waters occupying more of the total water column this can be noted in figs 8b and 9b and was observed in several vertical sections in the region not shown therefore effects of argo dp on mssh ohc and density evidences the need to increase vertical resolution of dp obs and confirms the low accuracy on the construction of dp obs which directly affects isopycnal vertical positioning as vertical resolution of observations in argo dp scheme depends on model vertical resolution increasing it leads to greater computational cost to integrate the model on the other hand vertical resolution of observations in argo z does not depend on model s vertical resolution this reinforces the superiority of argo z moreover comparison of argo z and argo z t results showed the importance of salinity to obtain larger magnitude and accurate corrections in ocean thermohaline structure since it could produce more adequate increments on the model layer thicknesses correction on model density led to uplift of isopycnals surfaces like 27 52 and especially 26 18 the first one represents the equatorward flow of antarctic intermediate water aaiw associated to the iwbc and the last one a poleward flow of south atlantic central water sacw associated to the bc soutelino et al 2013 napolitano et al 2019 as the assimilation runs uplifted these isopycnals they led to a stronger and thicker iwbc and consequently a weaker and shallower bc this impact was more intense on argo dp since it was verified an excessive lift of the isopycnals while argo z showed good representation of the isopycnals position despite a better representation of thermohaline structure by argo z the bc and the iwbc position and structure still deviated from observations which resulted in a weaker transport of bc with respect to control and literature references especially those that considers individual transects therefore a joint and multivariate assimilation of sla sea surface temperature sst and argo z are necessary in order to simulate the wbc more accurately in this study it was shown that when assimilating ts profiles into isopycnal model it is better to perform innovation in observational space z levels coordinate than in model isopycnal layers also it was verified the importance of salinity in order to obtain more efficient corrections it is important to highlight that no salinity was assimilated in the argo z t experiment however considering that no near real time argo data were employed in the assimilation experiments only a small part of ts profiles came with low quality salinity assimilation of all available profiles including the ones with no salinity should probably lead to more positive impacts rather than not realizing assimilation of single temperature profiles alternatively salinity profiles could be estimated from linear regression or simply filled with climatology goes et al 2018 dorfschäfer et al 2020

23866,assimilation of hydrographic profiles into isopycnal model is not trivial since one is in z level coordinate and the other is discretized in potential density coordinate there are two ways to calculate innovation one realizes innovation in the observation vertical space and the other in the model isopycnal coordinates this work aims to better understand the impacts and accuracy of each one three experiments were conducted over the south atlantic with hycom employing the ensemble optimal interpolation enoi each 3 days during six years in which the last four years were used for evaluation the first experiment assimilated argo data with innovations in isopycnal coordinates argo dp the second assimilated argo data with innovation in z levels argo z the third assimilated only argo temperature with innovation in z levels argo z t a control run with no assimilation was also used for comparison considering the hindcast a reduction of 12 17 and 18 was observed on temperature rmsd with respect to control and of 15 20 and 5 on salinity for argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively major impacts were observed in sea surface height ssh and ocean heat content ohc in the subtropical gyre region 10 s 40 s especially near the coast argo dp generally reduced ssh increasing model bias while argo z managed to correct ssh towards aviso and argo z t produced small negative impacts this was confirmed by ssh spatial correlation with respect to aviso which was 0 754 0 723 0 756 and 0 740 for control argodp argoz and argozt respectively the overall mean of ohc in the top 2000 m was 42 84 41 98 41 41 42 18 and 42 00 mega joule per square metre mj m 2 for woa18 control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively a correct uplift of model isopycnals considering climatology was verified at the vertical cross section along 42 5 w and around 28 s for argo z and argo z t and an excessively uplift for argo dp this led to stronger and thicker intermediate western boundary current and weaker brazil current bc between 20 s and 27 s control argo z and argo z t presented a bc mean transport in agreement with literature while argo dp underestimated it the results indicate that innovation in observation space is more adequate than in model vertical space particularly for low vertical model resolutions keywords hydrographic profiles isopycnal ocean models ensemble optimal interpolation south atlantic ocean brazil current remo ocean data assimilation system 1 introduction data assimilation da is a powerful technique to improve the representation of the ocean and atmosphere by numerical models and to help for understanding of their dynamics it combines model outputs with observations and produces the analysis with smaller errors than the model one da method greatly used is the ensemble optimal interpolation enoi which is a simplified version of the ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 2003 it employs a stationary ensemble of model states from a past long model integration providing a suboptimal solution compared to the enkf evensen 2003 wan et al 2010 the latter needs to integrate the model n times been n the ensemble size which makes enoi n times cheaper oke et al 2010 wan et al 2010 due to its multivariate nature enoi also transfers individual observational information to all model state variables among the most important in situ observations today for regional and global ocean forecasting systems is the array for real time geostrophic oceanography argo roemmich et al 2019 in august 2020 there were 3 865 argo floats collecting temperature and salinity data down to 2 000 m several authors have demonstrated the crucial role of assimilating this data in order to constrain the ocean model oke and schiller 2007 and tanajura et al 2020 showed that the assimilation of argo profiles is crucial for constraining the thermohaline structure of ocean models especially for salinity argo is today being expanded by adding profilers to measure biogeochemical variables such as oxygen and chlorophyll and to observe the ocean in full depth jayne et al 2017 roemmich et al 2019 gasparin et al 2020 showed through an observing system simulation experiment osse that an array of 1 200 deep argo floats would significantly constrain the deep ocean by reducing model temperature and salinity errors by around 50 these data are collected in z or p level coordinate while some ocean models are formulated in terms of isopycnal layers with thicknesses and depths that varies in space and time xie and zhu 2010 and its assimilation is not trivial ocean models with this characteristic includes the miami isopycnal coordinate ocean model micom and its successor the hybrid coordinate ocean model hycom the latter combines three different vertical coordinates in order to produce a better vertical representation of the thermohaline structure of the ocean without loss of discretization on coastal regions and in the mixed layer there are basically two strategies for the assimilation of argo data into hycom differing on the choice of vertical coordinate employed in the innovation z level or isopycnal xie and zhu 2010 have compared these two strategies with hycom in a numerical experiment over the pacific ocean for four years they concluded that calculating the innovation in isopycnal coordinate produced the smallest error for temperature and salinity with respect to argo data when compared to the scheme with innovation in z level below 200 m the latter presented a salinity error greater than the control run error which had no assimilation wang et al 2017 performed a single assimilation of 1 500 synthetic profiles into micom and compared the two schemes unlike xie and zhu 2010 they pointed out that innovation at z level outperforms the innovation in isopycnic layers in almost every depth for temperature especially below 100 m the same behaviour was observed for salinity except for intermediate depths where both schemes led to similar errors these are the only studies that compare the two schemes and none investigates the impacts on the sea level and the currents changes in ocean salinity and temperature lead to volume changes which affects sea level fu et al 2011 also due to the multivariate nature of enoi assimilation of hydrographic profiles can directly impact model sea surface height ssh and ocean currents in order to assimilate sea level anomaly sla observations one needs the mean ssh mssh of the model to subtract it from the instantaneous model ssh to get the model sla yan et al 2015 assimilated altimetry sla data into hycom employing two different msshs one derived from a model free run and the other from an assimilation run with in situ temperature and salinity data the first one resulted in worse estimates of subsurface temperature and salinity even with the assimilation of in situ data while the other led to improvements on subsurface yan et al 2015 also observed that the assimilation of in situ data leads to a lower mssh in another by mignac et al 2015 the assimilation of argo profile reduced the ocean heat content ohc of the model and consequently produced a lower mssh therefore changes on the model mssh due to hydrographic profiles assimilation strongly influence the performance when to assimilate sla as the estimation of the latter depends on the model mssh this can also affect density and pressure gradients leading to impacts on the geostrophic component of currents this paper investigates the different impacts of the two strategies for assimilating argo data into hycom s thermohaline structure ssh and western boundary currents wbc in the south atlantic ocean here we use the oceanographic modelling and observation network remo ocean data assimilation system rodas which is based on the enoi lima et al 2013 tanajura et al 2014 carvalho et al 2019 santana et al 2020 tanajura et al 2020 and employs the hycom model this system was developed to assimilate t s profiles exclusively through the innovation in isopycnal layers presented in detail in tanajura et al 2014 and mignac et al 2015 this work makes rodas more versatile by enabling the possibility to assimilate t s profiles in isopycnal coordinate ocean models with the innovation in z level 2 methodology 2 1 ocean model description and configuration hycom is a primitive equation general circulation model that solves five prognostic equations two for the horizontal motion one for the continuity equation and two for the thermodynamic conservation bleck 2002 chassignet et al 2009 it employs isopycnal coordinates for the open stratified ocean to ensure conservation of water masses properties in long integrations it smoothly transitions into z coordinates in unstratified regions such as the mixed layer and into sigma coordinates in shallow and coastal waters this work uses the hycom version 2 2 18 with a set of two nested grids one with a coarse horizontal resolution of 1 4 and the other with 1 12 the first one covers almost all the atlantic ocean and provides boundary conditions to the 1 12 grid which extends from 46 s to 10 n and from 60 w to 20 w more details of the 1 4 and the nesting are described in tanajura et al 2020 and in carvalho et al 2019 respectively the experiments were conducted on the higher resolution grid and nested on the 1 4 grid which had no assimilation the models were set with 21 vertical hybrid layers with surface pressure as reference for potential density aiming to improve the representation of near surface fields the target densities were set equal to 19 50 20 25 21 00 21 75 22 50 23 25 24 00 24 70 25 28 25 77 26 18 26 52 26 80 27 03 27 22 27 38 27 52 27 64 27 74 27 82 and 27 88 the first three layers

the localization operator applied to the b matrix using the schur product to remove spurious correlations with a radius of influence equal to 150 km the localization operator was applied according to the formula by gaspari and cohn 1999 also employed in xie and zhu 2010 and mignac et al 2015 b is the co variance matrix of the model error the superscript t represents the transpose of a matrix or vector and r stands for the variance diagonal matrix of the observational error for ensemble methods b is given by 3 b a a t n 1 where a a 1 a 2 a n a m x m 1 n n 1 n x n x m represents the model state vector for the ensemble member m with m varying from 1 to the total number of ensemble members n for enoi this ensemble of model anomalies is taken from a previous model free run evensen 2003 rodas employs a running seasonal ensemble to consider intra seasonal variability and high frequency model dynamics as in xie and zhu 2010 xie et al 2011 and mignac et al 2015 to achieve this 21 model states from the free run are selected within a centred 60 day window for each year in this case 2008 2013 with a total of 126 members this member selection is performed every 3 days following the assimilation cycle for more details the reader is referred to tanajura et al 2020 and the schematic figure 3 in santana et al 2020 2 3 the two approaches in the innovation calculation the innovation in model s isopycnal coordinate for hydrographic profiles available in z level coordinates was introduced by thacker and esenkov 2002 followed by xie and zhu 2010 and implemented in rodas by mignac et al 2015 it consists in estimating potential density profiles from ts observations and comparing with model s layer density once they match pseudo observed layer thicknesses dp obs are generated for each isopycnic layer and a step function is created for dp obs t and s errors estimates of these new observations followed xie and zhu 2010 and mignac et al 2015 these observations are then sequentially assimilated the first one is dp obs so that increments of the model s layer thicknesses dp and velocity components are produced then t and s are assimilated in a univariate way at last xie and zhu 2010 recommend that for isopycnal layers it is preferable to discard the t analysis under the mixed layer and diagnose them from the seawater state equation in order to conserve layer density this recommendation is based on the evidence that the assimilation of dp obs is able to substantially change the vertical profile of t so that the increments of t would be small and to conserve the densities in the isopycnal layers maintaining the analysis of s and diagnosing t after the assimilation of dp obs would provide that best representation of the ts profile for z level coordinates layers there is no assimilation of dp obs and both t and s analysis are preserved some particularities that rise up from this approach must be highlighted the first one is the vertical resolution degradation of observations hydrographic profiles such as the ones from argo have hundreds of sampling levels while ocean models have a few dozens e g in the present work only 21 also the error estimates for dp obs are produced by their standard deviation they reach magnitudes similar to model standard deviation and attain values of 100 m or more below 1000 m at last for this approach it is indispensable to have both t and s in order to produce dp obs this stands as a limitation and excludes observations from expendable bathythermographs xbts some moored buoys and argo data in which the temperature profile is accompanied by low quality salinity data discarded by quality control in the present work about 20 of the argo ts data presented high quality temperature but were rejected due to low quality salinity in order to do a fair comparison only argo with good quality ts were used for all experiments in this way the same argo profiles were assimilated in all experiments for the other scheme one needs to interpolate discrete model ts values to observational space in z levels on isopycnal layers ts are defined at the centre of each layer and its corresponding depth can be calculated from dp here linear interpolation is employed for simplicity but it leads to similar results compared with higher order interpolation wang et al 2017 the assimilation with this approach is done jointly and in a multivariate way i e t and s are assimilated at the same time with a single analysis increment generated for all model state vector thus the quality of the dp increments relies on the ensemble quality and no diagnosing for t or s leaving the density adjust to the model if necessary in this scheme vertical resolution of observations is preserved and t can be assimilated in the absence of s therefore the aforementioned negative aspects of innovation in isopycnal layers are avoided when innovation is performed in the vertical observational space 2 4 experiment design in order to evaluate the best strategy for assimilating argo ts profiles into hycom a set of three experiments were performed from 1 january 2008 to 31 december 2013 forced every 6 h with the ncep cfsr atmospheric fields the first one assimilated argo data with innovations in isopycnal coordinates argo dp the second assimilated argo data with innovation in z levels argo z the third assimilated only argo s temperature with innovation in z levels argo z t a three day observational window covering the analysis day and the two previous days was employed and the assimilation cycle was set to three days the model was also integrated without assimilation control to better help understanding the impacts of each strategy considering that argo data have limited local impact in each assimilation cycle the first two years were discarded and the evaluation focused on 1 january 2010 to 31 december 2013 for argo dp vertical localization was implemented only on the covariance of dp in the b matrix as suggested by mignac et al 2015 see table 1 2 5 data used in assimilation and evaluation the argo data were downloaded from the coriolis data centre ftp ftp ifremer fr ifremer argo geo atlantic ocean and submitted to quality control tests recommended by the global temperature salinity profile programme gtspp 2010 as a result a total of 18 111 argo ts profiles were assimilated from 2008 to 2013 and 12 714 from 2010 to 2013 were employed in the validation of the experiments in addition gridded absolute dynamical topography adt data from the archiving validation and interpretation of oceanographic satellites aviso with 1 4 resolution available at ftp my cmems du eu core sealevel glo phy l4 rep observations 008 047 dataset duacs rep global merged allsat phy l4 were used in the validation in order to make a valid direct comparison of the simulated ssh with aviso adt the mssh field from each model run was adjusted by offsets in such a way that the area averaged model mssh matches the aviso mssh average over the domain the monthly temperature and salinity climatology 1955 2017 from world ocean atlas woa18 locarnini et al 2018 zweng et al 2018 available at https www nodc noaa gov oc5 woa18 with a 1 4 horizontal resolution was employed in the evaluation of the ohc and density 3 results as mentioned above assimilation was realized each 3 days therefore after each assimilation the model produced 72 h hindcasts before the next assimilation the results of the experiments were objectively evaluated considering the outputs at 24 h 48 h and 72 h after each assimilation step it is important to highlight that the argo data used for evaluation of the assimilation experiments were not employed in the assimilation at the time of the evaluation since they would be assimilated only in the next cycle therefore these data may be considered as independent the exceptions to this approach in the evaluation of the results are shown in figs 1 and 2 which present the analyses performed with innovation in z level and model layers observations in model layers were generated following thacker and esenkov 2002 methodology and therefore are the same assimilated in argo dp run to further investigate the differences between the assimilation strategies the impacts on the brazil current bc and intermediate western boundary current iwbc were also assessed fig 1 shows the vertical mean profile of root mean squared deviation rmsd for temperature and salinity control analysis and background with respect to argo data analysis rmsd of temperature and salinity in z level show similar pattern for the top 50 m and 100 m for temperature and salinity respectively argo dp presented the best analysis and below these levels argo z was the best the first outperforms the latter at these top levels because there hycom employs z coordinates and there is no dependence on the quality of the dp analysis also argo dp is realized with a univariate assimilation algorithm while argo z is multivariate argo z t was able to reduce salinity background error in the top 400 m despite no assimilation of s except for the top 100 m where analysis and background are practically the same and the background presents error greater than control for temperature argo z t showed the smallest correction for the first 700 m and below this level it presented smaller rmsd than argo dp also below 700 m argo dp analysis and background for temperature and salinity presented similar rmsds and below 1 450 m they were greater than control the background errors near surface 100 m were very similar considering the temperature for all assimilation runs and sometimes very close to control even when analysis presented large differences for instance at 100 m temperature analysis rmsd was 1 25 1 5 and 2 0 c for argo z argo dp and argo z t respectively while background rmsd was 2 2 c for all four runs including control at this level salinity analysis rmsd was 0 21 0 22 and 0 35 psu for argo z argo dp and argo z t respectively and background rmsd was 0 30 0 31 0 35 and 0 33 psu for argo z argo dp argo z t and control respectively the biggest differences in the temperature background rmsds were in deep levels like 1450 m where the error was 0 3 c for argo z and argo z t 0 37 c for argo dp and 0 35 c for control this indicates that the model temperature has a strong bias in the top 150 m since the background rmsds are very similar and very close to control for deeper levels the model temperature is able to conserve some of the analysis quality for salinity the quality of the analysis is conserved on almost all levels since there are significant differences between argo z t background rmsd and argo dp and argo z background rmsd again the argo z produces the smallest averaged rsmd along the profile 0 13 psu the importance of assimilating s is evident since the rmsd of the argo z t is the largest 0 20 psu among the experiments for both the analysis and the background considering analysis rmsd in model layers fig 2 argo dp presented the best analysis for the top 14 layers while argo z was the best for the deepest 5 layers for temperature and salinity argo z t analysis presented a more significant impact on temperature in the top layers compared to its impact considering z level yet no significant impact on deeper layers is observed namely on layers 9 19 also in the first nine layers the model has a strong temperature bias since the background rmsds of all runs are very similar despite significant difference among the analysis rmsds but still conserves some analysis quality as control presents greater rmsd for salinity the model is able to conserve more of the analysis quality for all layers since argo z t background and control rmsd are significantly higher than argo dp and argo z background rmsd although similar results are observed in the evaluation at model layers and at z levels at the model layers argo dp produces the best analysis in most part of the vertical profile in the model layers 1 14 while argo z produces the best result in most part of the profile in z levels 150 2000 m also argo dp analysis produces the smallest rmsd of dp not shown in isopycnal layers considering that observations employed for the evaluation at model layers are pseudo observations and at z levels are the real observations one can conclude that the synthetic profiles of dp obs temperature and salinity projected into model layers are not accurate and precise otherwise argo dp analysis quality on model layers should have been also observed in z level considering the hindcasts rmsd for temperature and salinity with respect to argo data fig 3 in which the analyses are not considered all experiments reduced the control rmsd for temperature at practically all depths in the first 200 m the reduction was very similar but below this level the argo z and argo z t clearly outperformed the argo dp this result is consistent with the one presented by wang et al 2017 argo z t and argo z produce similar results for temperature since the difference between them is very small this is due to the aforementioned strong bias of model temperature the vertically averaged rmsd in the top 2000 m was 1 08 0 95 0 90 and 0 89 for control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively argo z presented a 5 2 and 16 7 reduction with respect to the argo dp and control respectively for salinity fig 3b the argo dp and argo z showed significant reduction of the rmsd with respect to control as in wang et al 2017 similar impacts were observed for the first 200 m with the argo z presenting slightly better results than argo dp and a more pronounced impact below this level considering the vertical average the rmsd was 0 20 0 17 0 16 and 0 19 psu for control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively argo z rmsd was 5 8 and 20 smaller than argo dp and control respectively when only temperature is assimilated argo z t salinity rmsd increases in the first 150 m with respect to control but it decreases below this is an indication that the model mixed layer salinity in the south western atlantic has in general small correlation with temperature and it is mostly controlled by atmospheric forcing however this behaviour was not observed in the brazil malvinas confluence not shown where temperature and salinity showed good correlation in the first 400 m and reduced salinity rmsd by 5 4 yet assimilation of salinity in this specific region still presented significant positive impact leading to a rsmd reduction of 13 5 with respect to control the two strategies to assimilate argo profiles into hycom led to different impacts on the mssh as shown in fig 4 around 5 n grey dashed line the ssh produced by the experiments decreases towards the east as observed in aviso however the latter decreases from 0 56 m to 0 44 m while control argo z and argo z t change from 0 56 to 0 48 m and argo dp from 0 56 to 0 52 m in the subtropical gyre region 10 s 40 s the assimilation runs and control were able to represent the large scale ssh structure with high values in the subtropical region and lower ssh towards the north and south the greatest magnitudes of 0 68 0 76 m were observed around 30 s in aviso control and argo z while in argo dp they range from 0 52 to 0 60 m and in argo z t from 0 56 to 0 64 m the greatest negative impacts were observed in the subregion enclosed by the dashed lines in fig 4 where argo dp reduced control mssh and increased the model bias south of 30 s this was also observed but with smaller intensity for argo z and argo z t at some locations this can be more clearly verified in fig 5 fig 5 shows the mssh differences with respect to aviso for control control minus aviso and with respect to control for the assimilation runs experiments minus control this strategy to present the impact in mssh aims to better capture the magnitude of the corrections produced by assimilation and to identify if they are in the right direction in this way if control minus aviso has positive values and the experiments minus control have negative values assimilation decreased model bias the opposite also indicates improvement by assimilation however if the same sign is observed in control minus aviso and experiments minus control it means that assimilation degraded the representation of mssh the black dashed line displayed in the results of all runs represents the zero isoline from control minus aviso north of 30 s control presents higher mssh with respect to aviso except around 26 s 44 w where it attains 0 125 m between 30 s and 36 s negative bias dominates except along the coast and south of 36 s there is the greatest positive bias of more than 0 30 m surrounded by some locations with negative bias north of 30 s all assimilation runs reduced control mssh and lead mssh towards aviso however east of 41 w control bias has maxima of 0 05 m while argo dp and argo z t reduce it by 0 10 m and argo z by 0 075 m around 26 s 44 w none of the experiments were able to increase control ssh towards aviso but argo z achieved the best result since it presented the smallest reduction between 30 s and 36 s argo dp greatly increases the control bias e g 0 15 m at 32 s 48 w argo z in general presents correction in the right direction but sometimes it also increases the bias by 0 025 m argo z t is similar to argo z with a broader coverage of corrections in the wrong direction south of 36 s assimilation runs presented similar impacts with mssh reduction dominating for argo dp therefore argo z showed the best mssh among the assimilation runs correcting most of the model mssh towards aviso while argo dp mostly degraded it in order to objectively evaluate and confirm the results about the assimilation impact on mssh time series of space correlation of ssh with respect to aviso was also investigated fig 6 it may be verified that argodp presented the lowest ssh correlation along all integration in comparison to the two other assimilation runs on the other hand argoz attained the highest correlation most of the time alternating with control for instance from january 2010 to august 2010 argoz had the highest correlation while from september 2010 to december 2010 it was control the overall correlation mean was 0 754 0 723 0 756 and 0 740 for control argodp argoz and argozt respectively since the region enclosed by the dashed lines in fig 4 presented the greatest impacts on ssh and it contains the wbc the next results will focus on this region fig 7 shows the ohc differences for control with respect to woa control minus woa and for the assimilation runs with respect to control experiments minus control considering the control run positive negative values indicate that the control has higher lower ohc than woa considering the assimilation runs positive negative values indicate that they increased decreased control ohc in this way if both assimilation and control runs have positive or negative differences it means that assimilation increased model bias otherwise it reduced considering that woa18 is a climatology rmsd with respect to argo ts data in this region is presented in table 2 it shows that woa18 has the smallest error and therefore it is a valid dataset to be used as reference also woa18 ts rmsds were the smallest for all levels not shown the map with the difference control minus woa may be divided into three subregions separated by the dashed lines in fig 7 with a well defined bias of the control with respect to woa subregion a with lower ohc subregion b with higher ohc and subregion c with lower ohc subregion a follows the coast where the wbc flows it shows the highest negative differences reaching magnitudes of 8 mj m 2 south of 30 s except around 38 s 54 w where it is observed a positive difference of 8 mj m 2 for this specific location 38 s 54 w all assimilation runs corrected the model towards woa the assimilation of argo dp intensified the negative bias in practically all subregion a with maximum of 4 mj m 2 around 32 s on the other hand argo z t reduced the model bias in some regions around 32 s 46 w and increased in others around 24 s 42 w argo z presented the best result correcting the model towards woa for most of subregion a in subregion b all assimilation runs reduced ohc with respect to control argo dp presented the greatest impact but in some locations around 30 s 41 w it exceeded the control bias of 0 8 to 1 6 mj m 2 decreasing it by 2 4 to 3 2 mj m 2 while argo z and argo z t decreased 0 8 mj m 2 in subregion c it was observed a lower ohc for control with respect to woa and all assimilation runs presented similar impacts increasing ohc in general but reducing it in some regions finally it is important to note the transition of the control bias from subregion a to c negative to positive to negative argo dp increments were not able to invert this pattern as it increased control ohc bias in subregion a while argo z presented a good correction especially between subregion a and b the overall mean of ohc in the top 2000 m are 42 84 41 98 41 41 42 18 and 42 00 mj m 2 for woa18 control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively confirming that argo z presented the best increments while argo dp increased model bias and degraded the solution impacts on the wbc were also assessed by two vertical cross sections of velocity and density difference with respect to woa the cross sections are represented by the solid lines in fig 7 the first is along 42 25 w fig 8 where the bc veers westward following the 200 m isobath rocha et al 2014 argo dp presented a weaker 0 25 m s in its core and shallower 0 200 m bc with respect to control argo z and argo z t for these were observed velocity of 0 30 m s and vertical extension of 300 m for control and argo z and 250 m for argo z t for the iwbc the maximum velocity was 0 15 0 30 0 20 and 0 35 m s for control argo dp argo z and argo z t respectively at 24 4 s the iwbc reaches the surface for all runs but with greater velocities of 0 20 m s at 300 m in argo dp and argo z t while in control and argo z it was 0 10 m s also at 24 s the iwbc reaches 200 m and 250 m in argo dp and argo z t respectively while in the control and argo z runs it is deeper and extends up to 400 m according to observations at 24 15 s 42 4 w january 2003 to may 2004 presented by rocha et al 2014 the bc mean velocity is 0 17 0 14 m s and the inversion of velocity direction occurs around 400 m these authors also suggest based on other observations that this mooring is dislocated from the bc core and therefore the observed mean velocity is underestimated besides this the bc presents a high variability due to a continuously adjustment of potential vorticity for the iwbc the maximum observed velocity was 0 11 0 03 m s at 800 m comparing to the hycom runs the bc does not reach the mooring location but in control and argo z it extends more eastward than argo z t and especially argo dp also despite vertical extension of the bc be smaller than observed control and argo z produce patterns closer to observations than argo z t and argo dp these runs overestimated iwbc core velocity while control and argo z are in agreement with observations the shallower and weaker bc with a more extensive and intense iwbc produced in the assimilation runs especially argo dp was due to a general uplift of isopycnals with respect to control mainly the 26 18 isopycnal for instance at 24 2 s this uplift was of 75 m and for argo z and argo z t the uplift was of 25 m it can be verified that argo z and argo z t presented a more precise correction of density towards woa climatology fig 8b in fact for control around 350 m where the 26 18 isopycnal is located there is an inversion of density bias from negative 0 350 m to positive 350 1000 m argo dp increased density in practically all the section including levels that control presented higher density with respect to woa and ended up with higher density than climatology around 250 m where the 26 18 isopycnal is located on the other hand argo z and argo z t reduced control bias with respect to woa at practically all levels and presented a good correction around 350 m increasing density above this level and reducing beneath it therefore argo z and argo z t correctly uplifted the 26 18 isopycnal while argo dp excessively uplifted it also argo z presented the greatest magnitude of corrections among the assimilation runs similar pattern was verified in cross section around 28 s fig 9 argo dp simulated the bc with mean velocity of 0 20 m s while the other runs produced 0 25 m s the inversion of velocity occurred at 400 m for all runs and the iwbc presented a mean core velocity of 0 25 m s for control and argo z and 0 30 m s for argo dp and argo z t in situ observation at 27 9 s 46 7 w presented by rocha et al 2014 showed the bc extending down to 850 m with a mean velocity in its core of 0 34 0 04 m s the mooring did not capture the iwbc core velocity the uplift of the 26 18 isopycnal was observed in all assimilation runs especially argo dp also it can be verified that the inversion of density bias for the control with respect to woa occurred at 350 m fig 9b from negative 0 350 m to positive 350 1000 m as it was observed along 42 5 w fig 8b argo dp inverted the control run bias around 250 m and presented higher density with respect woa indicating an over lift of the 26 8 isopycnal on the other hand argo z t and argo z reduced the control bias in almost all levels without inverting it similarly to what was verified in fig 8b argo z presented the largest corrections towards woa among the assimilation runs this reinforces the importance of assimilation of salinity the bc transport was calculated from 21 s to 30 s fig 10 region of the greatest impacts of assimilation the depth limits of the bc were defined based on the four years mean 2010 2013 of the vertical cross sections of velocity for each latitude and only negative velocities were considered argo dp presented the smallest transport in this latitudinal range followed by argo z t argo z and control between 21 s and 22 s argo z transport are in agreement with napolitano et al 2019 and pita et al 2020 while argo dp transport at 22 s is in agreement with schmid and majumder 2018 argo z and control simulated very similar transports north of 27 s except for 24 s in this latitudinal range quasi synoptic xbt transects near 22 s mata et al 2012 and 25 s garzoli et al 2013 indicates high mesoscale variability according to schmid and majumder 2018 estimates based on individual transects can result in a transport twice as large if one considers the monthly mean velocity field these authors employed argo ts profiles subsurface velocity from floats trajectories ssh and wind fields from 1993 to 2015 to derive a monthly three dimensional geostrophic velocity fields they estimated a mean bc transport of 2 7 sv and 3 3 sv considering the top 400 m and the top 800 m respectively between 20 s and 27 s these values are in relatively good agreement with control argo z and argo z t whose mean transports were 3 37 2 98 and 2 81 sv respectively while argo dp produced 2 13 sv and underestimated the transport at 24 s the bc experiences high and complicated variability as it tries to continuously adjust itself to change in coast orientation while conserving potential vorticity rocha et al 2014 schmid and majumder 2018 as a consequence of this large variability schmid and majumder 2018 estimated the bc transport ranging from 0 4 to 5 1 sv therefore large differences among the experiments are expected south of 27 s differences between control and argo z increase due to thickening and intensification of the bc despite producing similar mean velocity sections as shown in fig 9a around 28 s comparing the argo z and argo z t the importance of salinity becomes clearer as the latter showed in general a weaker bc with respect to literature the runs presented low values of transport for all latitudes 4 discussion and conclusions in this study six years of argo ts profiles were assimilated into hycom with two different strategies one in which the innovation is performed in the model isopycnal layers and the other in which the innovation is performed in observational space in z level coordinate one integration was realized with the first approach argo dp and two were realized with the second approach one assimilating both temperature and salinity argo z and the other only temperature argo z t overall analyses and hindcasts rmsds for temperature and salinity with respect to argo data were reduced employing the two strategies therefore both are suitable for assimilating hydrographic profiles however objective comparison of the analyses rmsds in z levels and in model layers showed that innovation in isopycnal coordinates is not as accurate as innovation in z levels in addition considering the sequence of 3 day hindcasts after each assimilation argo z also outperformed argo dp for both temperature fig 3a and salinity fig 3b as wang et al 2017 pointed out the main difference on the performance of the two schemes is the non linearity of the observation operator h and the construction of the pseudo observation of the model layer thicknesses by argo data dp obs the first one depends only on the choice of the vertical interpolation here linear interpolation was used after preliminary experiments with third order splines not showing substantial difference on the other hand the calculation of dp obs is strongly non linear and non unique since one tries to reconstruct three state variables t s and dp obs from only two observed variables t and s employing the seawater state equation wang et al 2017 this was objectively confirmed by evaluating the analyses rmsds of the experiments moreover the standard deviation of dp obs used in assimilation to estimate the errors of this variable presents magnitudes comparable to model standard deviation which are large below 1 000 m this leads to reduced impact of the dp obs assimilation on the thermohaline correction also the low vertical resolution employed by the model has a direct impact on the vertical resolution of the observed profile for the argo dp strategy which compromises the analysis quality especially in regions of intense temperature and salinity gradients such as the thermocline however it is important to mention that argo z scheme relies on ensemble quality to update model s prognostic variables and different ensemble could lead to different results these are the main key points of each scheme that led to different impacts on hycom thermohaline structure this in turn led to impacts on other model variables and features like mssh heat content and wbc despite an overall reduction of t and s rmsd with respect to argo modifications were not always positive on other variables over all the domain small negative impacts on the mssh produced by the argo dp run around 5 n and significant impacts in the subregion limited by the dashed lines in fig 4 were verified in this subregion assimilation runs in general were able to reduce the model bias towards aviso however on few locations north of 30 s the analysis increments were larger than expected and the bias was inverted for argo z t and especially for argo dp also between 30 s and 36 s argo dp greatly increased the model bias while argo z and argo z t reduced it therefore argo dp presented the largest negative impacts and argo z had the best mssh among the assimilation runs this was confirmed by the highest mssh correlation with aviso attained by argo z 0 76 while argo dp and argo z t produced 0 72 and 0 74 respectively changes in mssh reflect the assimilation impact on the subsurface by the updated model thermohaline structure evaluating the vertically integrated ohc in the top 2 000 m argo z t and especially argoz showed good performance by producing accurate increments with complex spatial structure considering subregions a b and c in fig 7 and therefore reducing the model bias on the other hand argo dp was not able to invert this pattern it reduced the ohc in the subregions a and b and increased the error in subregion a also in two vertical sections close to the coast in subregion a along 42 5 w and around 28 s a good representation of thermohaline structure by argo z t and especially argo z was obtained they correctly increased the model density above 350 m and decreased below it reducing the control bias on the other hand argo dp inverted the control bias on density around 250 m due to an excessive increase on model density and not capturing the transition of control bias around 350 m subregion a follows the coast and it is a region of intense mesoscale activity as the bc meanders and develops several eddies silveira et al 2008 mill et al 2015 santana et al 2020 thus it is a region to be difficultly simulated and the quality of the assimilated observations is crucial to produce accurate impacts the mssh reduction observed for argo dp in fig 5 is consistent with the ohc reduction shown in fig 7 despite a smaller ts rmsd with respect to argo than control this was caused by an increase in model density associated with colder and saltier waters occupying more of the total water column this can be noted in figs 8b and 9b and was observed in several vertical sections in the region not shown therefore effects of argo dp on mssh ohc and density evidences the need to increase vertical resolution of dp obs and confirms the low accuracy on the construction of dp obs which directly affects isopycnal vertical positioning as vertical resolution of observations in argo dp scheme depends on model vertical resolution increasing it leads to greater computational cost to integrate the model on the other hand vertical resolution of observations in argo z does not depend on model s vertical resolution this reinforces the superiority of argo z moreover comparison of argo z and argo z t results showed the importance of salinity to obtain larger magnitude and accurate corrections in ocean thermohaline structure since it could produce more adequate increments on the model layer thicknesses correction on model density led to uplift of isopycnals surfaces like 27 52 and especially 26 18 the first one represents the equatorward flow of antarctic intermediate water aaiw associated to the iwbc and the last one a poleward flow of south atlantic central water sacw associated to the bc soutelino et al 2013 napolitano et al 2019 as the assimilation runs uplifted these isopycnals they led to a stronger and thicker iwbc and consequently a weaker and shallower bc this impact was more intense on argo dp since it was verified an excessive lift of the isopycnals while argo z showed good representation of the isopycnals position despite a better representation of thermohaline structure by argo z the bc and the iwbc position and structure still deviated from observations which resulted in a weaker transport of bc with respect to control and literature references especially those that considers individual transects therefore a joint and multivariate assimilation of sla sea surface temperature sst and argo z are necessary in order to simulate the wbc more accurately in this study it was shown that when assimilating ts profiles into isopycnal model it is better to perform innovation in observational space z levels coordinate than in model isopycnal layers also it was verified the importance of salinity in order to obtain more efficient corrections it is important to highlight that no salinity was assimilated in the argo z t experiment however considering that no near real time argo data were employed in the assimilation experiments only a small part of ts profiles came with low quality salinity assimilation of all available profiles including the ones with no salinity should probably lead to more positive impacts rather than not realizing assimilation of single temperature profiles alternatively salinity profiles could be estimated from linear regression or simply filled with climatology goes et al 2018 dorfschäfer et al 2020 since the assimilation of salinity greatly amplifies increments on both temperature and salinity fig 1 an observing system experiment ose is recommended in order to evaluate the best approach to

23867,the transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean is dependent upon the velocity difference between the seawater and overlying air this is commonly known as relative wind or ocean current interaction and its direct effect is to damp mesoscale ocean eddies through the imposition of an opposing surface torque if an ocean model neglects the ocean velocity in its bulk formulae this can lead to an increase in power input to the ocean and a large increase in eddy kinetic energy eke other secondary effects that are dependent upon the current system under consideration may also occur here we show that the neglect of relative wind leads to an 50 increase in surface eke in a circumpolar model of the southern ocean this acts to increase the southwards eddy heat transport fluxing more heat into the seasonal ice zone and subsequently reducing ice cover in all seasons the net reduction in planetary albedo may be a way for a largescale impact on climate keywords southern

https nsidc org data 1 introduction the turbulent transfer of momentum between atmosphere and ocean is typically expressed as a surface wind stress as calculated via a bulk formula parameterisation this relates the wind stress to the difference between the atmospheric wind usually at an elevation of 10 m and the surface ocean velocity 1 τ s ρ a c d u 10 u s u 10 u s where τ s is the surface wind stress ρ a is the atmospheric density c d is the drag coefficient u 10 is the 10 m atmospheric wind and u s is the surface ocean velocity note that the drag coefficient may also be a function of u 10 u s the inclusion of the surface ocean velocity in the bulk formula referred to as relative wind or ocean current interaction feedback acts as a source of friction at the ocean surface that directly dissipates mesoscale ocean eddies dewar and flierl 1987 and equatorial waves pacanowski 1987 furthermore there is a substantial difference in the surface power input to the ocean between calculations that use relative wind vs absolute wind when the u s is neglected in eq 1 for wind stress calculations duhaut and straub 2006 estimates of the change in power input differ but are typically 10 35 of the total duhaut and straub 2006 dawe and thompson 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 zhai and greatbatch 2007 zhai et al 2012 munday and zhai 2015 the additional friction under a relative wind stress acts to efficiently damp the eddy field such that the eddy kinetic energy eke is reduced with respect to an absolute wind stress simulation the exact decrease depends upon the region under consideration for the california upwelling system renault et al 2016b found that surface eke decreased by 50 whilst the depth averaged eke decreased by 27 decreases in surface eke of 25 have also been found for the gulf stream and agulhas current renault et al 2016a 2017 as well as the california current system and arabian sea seo et al 2016 seo 2017 changes in eke are particularly pronounced in the bay of bengal where a switch between absolute and relative wind can result in a factor of two change seo et al 2019 the switch to relative wind stress can lead to a more realistic simulation specifically renault et al 2016a show improved gulf stream circulation post separation and luo et al 2005 show improvements in the equatorial pacific s warm pool cold tongue structure other aspects of the eddy field other than changes to its energy such as their propagation and lifetime can also lead to improvements renault et al 2017 the use of coupled atmosphere ocean models has highlighted that the response of the coupled atmosphere partially mitigates the impact of relative wind stress on eke this is due to a slightly increased wind stress with respect to that achieved by a prescribed atmosphere leading to a partial re energisation of the eke of the ocean renault et al 2016b the southern ocean so is a region of strong wind forcing in which the mesoscale eddy field plays important roles in its budgets of momentum munk and palmén 1951 johnson and bryden 1989 and heat bryden 1979 jayne and marotzke 2002 meijers et al 2007 the strong winds do considerable work on the ocean due to the prevailing eastward direction of the so s currents of the 1 tw of power input to the geostrophic circulation roughly 0 5 tw takes place in the so wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 ferrari and wunsch 2009 this has the potential to create a perfect storm in terms of the impacts of relative wind with the mesoscale eddies being directly damped and the power input to the ocean reduced in a region where both are of first order importance the impact of using relative vs absolute wind stress on so circulation has been previously explored hutchinson et al 2010 show a 38 sv increase in the circumpolar transport of a quasi geostrophic antarctic circumpolar current acc when switching from an absolute to relative wind stress formulation this occurs due to a weakening of the eddy field and an accompanying steepening of the isopycnals under relative wind stress in contrast munday and zhai 2015 use a primitive equation but idealised channel model of the so in which the circumpolar transport increases by a more modest 10 15 sv under relative wind stress due to the same mechanism furthermore they find that the sensitivity of the residual meridional overturning circulation rmoc to changing wind stress is effectively the same under both absolute and relative wind stress this is due to a cancellation between steepening isopycnal slope and reduced eddy diffusivity under relative wind stress despite the above progress outstanding questions remain for example hutchinson et al 2010 use a coupled quasi geostrophic model q gcm see hogg et al 2003 although in this case the atmosphere above the boundary layer does not evolve freely it is subject to simplifications in the governing equations that are not present in the primitive equation model mitgcm see marshall et al 1993 1994 used by munday and zhai 2015 however it benefits through the inclusion of complex bathymetry albeit vertically truncated to 780 m above a mean ocean depth of 4000 m the idealised domain of munday and zhai 2015 is flat bottomed which results in a zonally symmetric mean state that is not subject to concentration of eddy activity behind bathymetric obstacles neither study includes variability in the atmospheric forcing or sea ice which excludes a potentially important feedback on circulation changes the 1 20 drake passage model of song et al 2020 also uses mitgcm this time in a realistically complex model domain with untruncated bathymetry in their case use of relative wind results in a 24 drop in eke with respect to an absolute wind run of the same model this is comparable to that found in other regions of the ocean see above however it is spatially limited to 140 of longitude and may be subject to additional limitations from its lateral boundary conditions this paper aims to investigate the differences between the use of relative and absolute wind stress in a circumpolar model of the so that includes realistically complex bathymetry and time varying forcing via the use of reanalysis products this model includes a coupled sea ice component in section 2 we describe the fundamentals of the model configuration and surface forcing section 2 2 in section 3 we briefly review the large scale circulation of our experiments we break our discussion of the model results into section 4 on wind power input section 5 on eke section 6 on meridional heat transport and section 7 on sea ice extent area and the sea ice seasonal cycle we end the paper with a summary and discussion in section 8 2 model setup and data sources 2 1 nemo model configuration we use a circumpolar configuration of nemo the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean coupled to lim3 the louvain la neuve sea ice model vancoppenolle et al 2009 rousset et al 2015 due to the time period during which this configuration was developed our nemo lim revision is intermediate between that of the previous release v3 6 and that of the current nemo lim release v4 0 nemo system team 2019 it incorporates some bugfixes and code developments made as part of v4 0 the model s horizontal grid spacing is 1 12 to allow for a vigorous mesoscale eddy field and there are 75 levels spread unevenly through the water column we make use of the z star vertical coordinate system adcroft and campin 2004 with partial vertical steps adcroft et al 1997 and the thermodynamic equation of state for seawater teos 10 e g roquet et al 2015 there is no sea surface restoring to either temperature or salinity the model is run on 2542 cores with land suppression active which eliminates roughly half of the model domain without land suppression 4944 cores would be required and a timestep of 300 s to the south the ocean is bounded by the antarctic continent and the latitude of the northern boundary is staggered in each ocean basin this is to accommodate a second version of the model currently in development that incorporates a new hybrid vertical coordinate ice shelves and potentially tides the northern boundary has been moved to avoid being too close to tidal amphidromes which can lead to spurious generation of tidal energy in the atlantic basin the northern boundary is at 7 27 s whilst it is at 22 83 s and 29 04 s in the indian and pacific basins respectively the positions of the amphidromes and thus the position of the northern boundary was determined with a test of the current configuration that included tides not shown at the northern boundary we strongly restore to an annual climatology from the eccov4r2 state estimate forget et al 2015 2016 the initial state of the model is taken as january of this climatology eccov4r2 has a small misfit to observations and is an optimal estimate of the ocean s circulation over the period 1992 to 2011 by using a state estimate derived climatology we avoid inheriting modelling issues resulting from e g a global model and being limited to the run length of this parent model note that we have to transform the potential temperature and practical salinity of ecco4v2 to conservative temperature and absolute salinity for use with teos 10 at the northern boundary a flather condition is applied to the barotropic flow and a neumann condition to the baroclinic flow temperature and salinity are restored as per the flow relaxation scheme davies 1976 engerdahl 1995 over a 24 gridbox wide sponge the lateral boundaries use freeslip boundary conditions for momentum and we make use of the vector invariant form of the momentum equation the hollingsworth et al 1983 correction is applied to the ke term since it can otherwise give rise to spurious energy bell et al 2016 the coriolis acceleration is calculated using the energy and enstrophy conserving form over the global ocean this is known to reduce noise in the vertical velocity le sommer et al 2009 and when combined with partial vertical steps improves flow topography interaction barnier et al 2006 penduff et al 2007 a split explicit scheme following that of shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 is used to solve the free surface equation the horizontal viscosity is biharmonic with a coefficient equivalent to 1 25 1 0 10 m 4 s 1 at the equator the biharmonic viscosity is scaled by the model grid spacing and so varies with latitude for the advection of temperature salinity and age tracers we use the muscl scheme van leer 1979 the choice of tracer advection scheme can influence a model s circulation in profound ways gerdes et al 1991 griffies et al 2000 complex advection schemes such as that due to prather 1986 may lead to improvements in the modelled circulation hofmann and morales maqueda 2006 morales maqueda and holloway 2006 muscl is an upwind biased scheme that is relatively cheap in computational terms there are persuasive arguments of the benefits of such schemes with respect to the over and under shoots that may be experienced with dispersive schemes typically centred in nature van leer 1973 1974 1977a b 1979 1997 hecht et al 1995 the diffusion on the tracer fields is laplacian in nature and applied along isopycnals e g redi 1982 with a coefficient equivalent to 125 m 2 s 1 at the equator the laplacian viscosity is scaled by the model grid spacing and so varies with latitude at each timestep the total freshwater flux i e evaporation minus precipitation minus runoff and including contributions from ice shelf runoff but excluding flow through the northern boundary and sea ice growth melt is set to zero via a uniform correction applied to the area integrated evaporation minus precipitation this correction will not be an accurate representation of the freshwater forcing i e over a seasonal cycle the southern ocean may gain or loss freshwater however it prevents any slight imbalance leading to an increase decrease of volume in the ocean component or a long term salinity drift as a result surface freshwater fluxes are really a redistribution of freshwater within the model domain rather than a net gain or loss rainfall is as provided by the surface forcing set see section 2 2 with the evaporation as determined by bulk formula the sea ice component is lim3 coupled to nemo at every timestep and using the 5th order ultimate macho advection scheme and no diffusion the ice levitates on the sea surface and exchanges mass and salt with no pressure effect there are five ice categories two ice layers and one snow layer advective and diffusive bottom boundary layer parameterisations are applied to improve the connection between non adjacent bottom cells the momentum equations are additionally subject to nonlinear bottom friction with a spatially varying coefficient vertical mixing processes are represented by a tke scheme based on that of blanke and delecluse 1993 we have adopted a number of modelling options from configurations of the uk met office in particular bottom enhanced tidal mixing on the eorca12 grid associated with the k1 and m2 tide is applied as per simmons et al 2004 and a climatological geothermal heat flux from goutorbe et al 2011 is applied at the sea bed rather than use the runoff from the specific forcing sets we do not intend to follow the established protocols of the forcing sets we use river and iceshelf runoff provided by the met office this is adapted to our high resolution grid and shoreline the iceshelf runoff is vertically spread over 10 m the model includes a pair of age tracers which are subject to the same advection diffusion schemes as temperature and salinity see above the first tracer is set to zero within the northern boundary sponge for the flow relaxation scheme outside of this sponge it ages at a rate of 1 s s it measures the age relative to water that has just entered left the domain at the northern boundary the second age tracer is set to zero near the northern boundary and within 10 m of the surface it measures the age of the water relative to both these locations and so conflates multiple sources of information we take this approach due to numerical issues near the northern boundary that lead to the generation of spurious values for unconstrained age tracers an alternative would have been to provide an age value appropriate to eccov4r2 at the northern boundary however no such profile was available at the time of running the model the combination of the two tracers help disentangle surface subduction from entry into the domain via the northern boundary 2 2 surface forcing we have performed three experiments the first of these is a control run using the core2 normal year forcing large and yeager 2004 2009 for 40 years referred to as core2nyf munday et al 2021 note that this does not include leap days this is used to spinup an initial eddy field and circulation without biasing it towards a specific calendar year the nominal start date for this control run is 1948 with the stratification reset to eccov4r2 conditions at the beginning of january of 1949 and 1950 this initialisation period allows us to start in january with no sea ice whilst preventing the generation of overly saline water within the seasonal ice zone core2nyf nominally ends on 31 december 1987 results presented from core2nyf are largely from the last five years 1 january 1983 to 31 december 1987 the second control run is forced by jra55 do interannually varying forcing tsujino et al 2018 and is also run for 40 years referred to as jra55iaf munday et al 2021 note that the jra55 do forcing does include leap days and benefits from an increased horizontal 55 km and temporal resolution 3 hr with respect to core2 jra55iaf is started on 1 january 1978 from a restart of core2nyf and runs until 31 december 2017 this provides an already energetic eddy field and helps mitigate the additional spinup due to changing forcing set the third experiment uses the jra55 do forcing under an absolute wind stress condition referred to as jra55abs munday and zhai 2021 this experiment is 20 years long and starts on 1 january 1988 from a restart of jra55iaf this allows a 10 year adjustment to the change from core2nyf to jra55iaf and maintains an overlapping control run for the life of jra55abs the switch to absolute instead of relative wind stress also removes the impact of the ocean velocity on other fluxes through the bulk formulae the majority of our presented results from jra55iaf and jra55abs are from 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2007 this corresponds to the last five years of jra55abs and ensures that both jra55 do forced models have comparable atmospheric forcing we have also examined the 1983 1987 and 2013 2017 averages for jra55abs and whilst the quantitative detail changes our conclusions do not in initial tests with core2 normal year forcing it was found that beyond an integration threshold of 12 years the model would generate a large weddell sea polynya due to thermal wind shear this led to acceleration of the antarctic circumpolar current and ultimately numerical instability in order to suppress polynya formation we followed the guidance of kjellson et al 2015 and added additional freshwater to the prescribed runoff to do so we triple the amount of prescribed runoff to include an additional 2500 gt yr and also include an additional 1500 gt yr south of 60 s to simulate iceberg melt this additional freshwater is still subject to the constraint that the area integrated freshwater flux be zero at every timestep and so remains a redistribution of freshwater rather than strictly an extra volume the extra flux suppresses the polynya throughout the 40 years of core2nyf allowing a stable ocean circulation to develop in order to maintain comparability between the two control runs we also maintain this additional freshwater forcing in jra55iaf and jra55abs the formation process of the weddell sea polynya is described in appendix a 2 3 data sources to provide an estimate of eke we make use of altimetry from the archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso in the form of daily level 4 reprocessed derived variables from 1 1 2003 to 12 31 2007 the product has been processed by ssalto duacs to merge all flying altimeters via optimal interpolation onto a regular 1 4 grid we use absolute geostrophic velocities derived from absolute dynamic topography to calculate the eke sea ice area and extent data are taken from the national snow and ice data center nsidc satellite derived sea ice extent is provided by the nsidc sea ice index v3 fetterer et al 2017 updated daily this combines nimbus 7 smmr and dmsp ssm i ssmis passive microwave data satellite images to generate daily and monthly images the sea ice index runs from november 1978 to present we use an average from 1983 to 2010 we also use monthly averages of sea ice concentration as a spatial field cavalieri et al 1996 updated yearly 3 large scale circulation the zonal circulation of all three models is dominated by the acc over much of the model domain as per the transport streamfunction in fig 1a for jra55iaf which is representative of all three models subtropical gyres are present in the atlantic and indian basins with the brazil and agulhas currents interacting with the acc north of the falkland islands and south of cape agulhas respectively due to the placement of the northern boundary the wind driven gyre to the east of australia and new zealand is particularly weak and there is little signature of the east australia current eac present in this sector of the model the northern boundary is at 29 04 s which is very close to the latitude of sugarloaf point where the eac leaves the coast of australia and flows towards new zealand as such the model domain is excluding most of its formation region and the result is a very weak current in these broad strokes the models are largely very similar there are differences in e g the position and intensity of the brazil malvinas confluence or the strength of the agulhas current however the result is a credible simulation of the southern ocean horizontal circulation inline with other models of similar resolution see e g mazloff et al 2010 and delworth et al 2012 etc the volume transport through drake passage t a c c is a commonly taken metric of the zonal flow of the southern ocean recent observational estimates give a transport of 136 7 6 9 sv meredith et al 2011 based on analysis of historical hydrographic sections and 173 3 10 7 sv donohue et al 2016 which includes the barotropic flow for all three models we calculate t a c c using five day averages of the product of the zonal velocity and level thickness across drake passage we take a five year average value over 1983 1987 for core2nyf and 2003 2007 for jra55iaf and jra55abs we use the standard deviation of the five day mean values over these time periods as a measure of variability due to model spinup internal variability of the ocean and variability in the surface forcing for jra55iaf and jra55abs the particular five year period chosen for the average value can lead to changes in both the mean and standard deviation of t a c c t a c c for all three experiments is intermediate between the observational estimates of meredith et al 2011 and donohue et al 2016 for core2nyf the transport is 151 58 5 14 sv where the uncertainty indicates the standard deviation of all five day means contributing to the average for jra55iaf and jra55abs the transport is 147 57 5 78 sv and 147 58 5 68 sv respectively given the variability in the model these values are largely indistinguishable based on the results of hutchinson et al 2010 and munday and zhai 2015 we would expect to see a larger difference in the drake passage transport of jra55iaf and jra55abs specifically we would expect that the relative wind damping of the mesoscale eddy field in jra55iaf would lead to steeper isopycnals and therefore an increased drake passage transport due to thermal wind shear the lack of an increased transport may be due to a number of affects firstly the model runs are all short in a timeframe of a few decades we would not expect the stratification of the ocean to reach its new equilibrium especially given the spinup time of the ocean s baroclinic structure wunsch and heimbach 2008 allison et al 2011 with 80 of t a c c due to thermal wind shear it is reasonable to expect its adjustment time to be dictated by the baroclinic rather than barotropic mode secondly it could reflect the increase in complexity of the model bathymetry relative to that of hutchinson et al 2010 and munday and zhai 2015 with complex untruncated bathymetry the models under consideration here may have a fundamentally different response to those previously employed thirdly the surface forcing used here varies strongly in time in contrast to the constant forcing of both hutchinson et al 2010 and munday and zhai 2015 variable wind stress alters the sensitivity of both t a c c and the rmoc to wind stress via changes in near surface mixing munday and zhai 2017 to unravel whether the drake passage transport of jra55iaf and jra55abs would differ substantially at equilibrium would require a minimum of several hundred model years of further integration which is beyond the available computing resources in depth investigations into the role of complex bathymetry and surface forcing variability are beyond the scope of the current paper both the mean wind stress and the mesoscale eddy field of the southern ocean play first order roles in setting its average meridional circulation in the zonal integral sense the rmoc is a small difference between much larger individual components determined by the wind stress and the eddy field the eulerian overturning set by the wind stress and the bolus overturning set by the eddy field marshall and radko 2003 these give rise to a two cell structure for the rmoc marshall and speer 2012 in which mesoscale eddies play an active role due to their capacity to dynamically interact with the stratification of the ocean marshall et al 2002 karsten et al 2002 the two cells are usually identified with the clockwise circulation of north atlantic deep water nadw overlying anticlockwise circulating antarctic bottom water aabw there are subtleties to the calculation of the rmoc due to the impacts of different forms of averaging nurser and lee 2004a b we diagnose the rmoc using density as the vertical coordinate by rebinning the meridional velocity into 160 density layers that are 0 05 kg m 3 thick due to modelling constraints this is done as an offline post processing calculation using five year s worth of five day means we calculate the density referenced to 2000 m using the five day mean temperature salinity and teos 10 before using the 3d field to rebin the velocity and integrating the result is shown in fig 1b for jra55iaf the expected two cell structure is clear although the aabw cell is over a narrow range of density with the flow below the mixed layer being largely adiabatic due to the use of five day means for the calculation both for the advection field and for the calculation of density there will be some slight misallocation of transport between density classes in our rmoc calculation in addition variability at frequencies higher than 1 5 days will be averaged away and this will lead to a reduction of the bolus overturning the non zero values at the low densities are due to the surface freshwater flux the surface value of the rmoc at each latitude matches the freshwater flux accumulated from the southern boundary to that latitude as expected as a quantitative comparison of the overturning between the three models we plot the density profile of the rmoc streamfunction at 30 s in fig 1c this is a common latitude for such comparisons see e g morrison et al 2011 at densities greater than 1037 kg m 3 all three models have a similarly narrow aabw cell implying that this is a property of the general model configuration rather than of the surface forcing for core2nyf this cell transports 14 62 sv of water which is slightly stronger than the 12 83 sv and 12 49 sv transported by jra55iaf and jra55abs respectively between densities of around 1035 kg m 3 and 1037 kg m 3 the models have their nadw cell with all three being comparable in strength at 15 sv near the surface at densities lighter than 1035 kg m 3 all three models show the presence of a relatively intense surface cell with a peak transport of 16 17 sv this cell is most likely a directly wind driven ekman cell and is beyond the scope of this paper the increase in strength of this cell from jra55iaf to jra55abs is consistent with the slight increase in mean wind stress under absolute wind stress in summary the large scale circulation of all three models is broadly similar and in line with other ocean models of similar grid spacing forcing etc we do not find a significant difference in drake passage transport or residual moc the first is something of an anomaly given differences between previous relative and absolute wind driven experiments this may be due to length of the model runs not allowing for sufficient modification of isopycnal slopes although fundamental differences in model formulation may also play a role the lack of significant differences between the rmoc of jra55iaf and jra55abs is consistent with the hypothesis that the length of the model run has not allowed for major change in isopycnal slope and flow it is also consistent with the results of munday and zhai 2015 which show no large differences in sensitivity of the rmoc to changes in surface wind stress under relative absolute wind stress 4 wind power input the single largest input of power to the ocean is from atmospheric wind wunsch and ferrari 2004 ferrari and wunsch 2009 observational estimates of the wind power input are usually constructed from the geostrophic flow using altimetry such estimates suggest that global power input is 1 tw or less wunsch 1998 hughes and wilson 2008 scott and xu 2009 with the exact figure depending upon subtleties such as the inclusion of high frequency winds zhai et al 2012 roughly half of this wind power input occurs in the southern ocean where strong westerly winds align with strong eastward surface currents roquet et al 2011 considerably more power is thought to be input to the ageostrophic circulation and surface waves with estimates reaching 3 tw wang and huang 2004a and 60 tw wang and huang 2004b respectively much of this extra power does little to drive the actual circulation for example 70 of the near inertial energy input from the wind is dissipated in the upper 200 m zhai et al 2009 using our different model runs we calculate two estimates of wind power input the first of these uses the model s full surface ocean current and a five year average is calculated using every timestep of the model we use reynolds averaging to split this into the mean power input and the eddy power input 2 τ s u s τ s u s τ s u s where τ s is the surface wind stress u s is the surface ocean current overbars indicate a five year time average and primes deviations from that average the second estimate uses a series of one day averages of the surface wind stress and the one day average sea surface height to estimate the geostrophic current using reynolds averaging we again split this into the mean geostrophic power input and the eddy geostrophic power input 3 τ 1 d u g τ 1 d u g τ 1 d u g where τ 1 d is the one day averaged surface wind stress the estimate of the geostrophic surface currents u g is calculated from the one day average sea surface height 4 u g g f k η 1 d where g 9 80665 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration in nemo f is the coriolis frequency and η 1 d is the one day average sea surface height the spatial pattern of the total power input for both jra55iaf and jra55abs reflects the dominant westerly wind over the eastward currents of the southern ocean see fig 2a d energy is input over much of the model domain in a few locations most obviously over the agulhas current energy is instead extracted from the ocean by the wind this is due to the mean flow opposing the mean wind stress as can be clearly seen in the mean power input of fig 2b e there is little obvious qualitative difference between the total and mean power input of the two experiments in addition because the change from relative to absolute wind does not significantly impact the magnitude of the mean wind or the mean ocean current there is little clear difference between the mean power input of jra55abs with respect to jra55iaf reynolds averaging reveals that there are more obvious differences in the eddy power input between jra55iaf and jra55abs in fig 2c f the colour bar has been constrained to better show the detail over the agulhas current and its extension across the indian ocean sector fig 2c shows power loss from the ocean there is also powerloss from the ocean over the falklands current this power loss is largely absent from jra55abs in fig 2f whilst this is symptomatic of the expected damping of the eddy field under relative wind stress in jra55iaf the use of the full velocity disguises this damping we shall return to this below when considering the geostrophic power input the total power input using the full velocity is of order 1 1 1 2tw for jra55iaf due to the interannual variation in the forcing the specific 5 year period used for the average matters for example as per table 1 2013 2017 is a particularly windy period in jra55 do and so the power input to the ocean is 1 195 tw compared to 1 12tw during 1983 1987 as expected the use of absolute wind in jra55abs leads to an increase in the power input to the ocean for 2003 2007 relative to jra55iaf the increase from 1 151tw to 1 274tw is 10 which is somewhat lower than the reported 20 35 in the literature duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 zhai and greatbatch 2007 zhai et al 2012 any variation in the total power input for core2nyf is purely due to internal variability of the ocean as such the total power input does not vary much around the figure of 0 957 tw in table 1 whilst the eddy power input is typically lower in magnitude than the mean power input its distribution is also less localised in space as a result the eddy power input makes up roughly 30 40 of the total with the exact percentage depending upon the details of the particular experiment and its forcing there is a very strong correlation between short term fluctuations in the wind inertial oscillations and other high frequency ageostrophic motions as a result the eddy power input is dominated by these motions and the expected damping of the mesoscale eddy field is disguised in order to tease out this damping we use the method of wu et al 2017 and renault et al 2016a and renault et al 2017 and use daily mean ssh fields to calculate the surface geostrophic flow as per eq 4 this is then combined with daily wind averages to estimate the geostrophic power input as per eq 3 the result and its decomposition into geostrophic mean and geostrophic eddy power inputs is shown in fig 3 the geostrophic total and geostrophic mean power input for both jra55iaf and jra55abs in figs 3a b d e are qualitatively very similar to that obtained with the full velocity in figs 2a b d e the broad strokes of the most intense values being over the acc and lower power input to the north and south remain true likewise there is power loss over the agulhas and falklands current regions there is a general reduction in magnitude most clearly seen outside of the acc such that the total power input to the geostrophic flow is 0 45 0 56 tw compared to 1 0 1 3 tw for the full velocity this is comparable to observational estimates of wunsch and ferrari 2004 and ferrari and wunsch 2009 which place the power input at 0 5 tw for the southern ocean furthermore it suggests that somewhere in the region of 0 5 0 6 tw is fed into near surface ageostrophic motions and or mixing processes a large part of the surface ageostrophic flow is probably due to ekman transport whilst the net ekman transport is expected to be at a right angle to the wind and thus cannot contribute to its power input this need not be the case for the surface current the percentage increase in geostrophic power input from jra55iaf to jra55abs is 20 which compares well to values previously quoted in the literature duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 zhai and greatbatch 2007 zhai et al 2012 the real difference in using the geostrophic velocity to estimate the power input is brought out in the geostrophic eddy power input as seen in figs 3c f note the change in the colour bar which highlights the regions of power loss for jra55iaf which uses relative wind stress there is clear power loss in regions of high eke in particular the agulhas current region and its extension north of the falklands south of australia and new zealand and near other regions of bathymetry extending high into the water column broadly speaking the spatial pattern of power loss reflects the eke see section 5 as one would expect given that relative wind is expected to directly damp mesoscale eddies in contrast jra55abs which uses absolute wind lacks these large areas of power loss within the core of the acc there are instead small regions of both positive and negative power input which highlights the lack of mesoscale damping from absolute wind stress however positive values in coastal areas around australia new zealand argentina and chile persist in these shelf regions the model eke is low see section 5 which may mean that there are insufficient eddies for the damping effect of relative wind stress to be significant as shown in table 2 the integral of the geostrophic eddy power input over the whole domain is negative for core2nyf and jra55iaf and the figure of 0 02 tw is 4 of the total geostrophic power input broadly speaking it is an order of magnitude less than the eddy power input using the full velocity as shown in table 1 for jra55iaf the power loss is somewhat low compared to the observational estimate of 0 0257 tw for the southern ocean hughes and wilson 2008 however if we exclude the shelf regions noted to have high power input in our model and which the altimeter may not represent well in hughes and wilson 2008 we instead estimate a figure of 0 03 tw for water deeper than 1000 m which compares well to their figure of 0 0257 tw in contrast to the experiments with relative wind stress the area integrated geostrophic eddy power input estimate of jra55abs is 0 042 tw excluding the shelf regions reduces the magnitude to 0 027 tw with the difference between the two estimates being roughly the same as for core2nyf and jra55iaf i e the positive power input over the shelf regions is broadly the same regardless of the use of relative wind stress the overall positive value is to be expected for jra55abs because the source of additional friction due to relative wind stress has been removed the use of one day averages for the geostrophic power input estimate will tend to affect the total power input τ 1 d u g and the eddy power input τ 1 d u g the mean power input cannot be affected because the longterm time average of τ 1 d and u g will still contain all the necessary information from every timestep of the model we can assess how much this impacts our estimates by using one day averages of surface velocity to reconstruct the equivalent calculation for the full surface velocity for jra55iaf and jra55abs using one day averages to calculate the wind power input reduces the total by 17 in the case of core2nyf the reduction is only 10 the reduced impact is likely because of the lower frequency of the forcing which means that there are fewer frequencies that get averaged away than for the jra55 do forced experiments this suggests that the geostrophic estimate of eddy power input may be underestimated in magnitude by 10 20 however some of the decrease is probably due to inertial and near inertial motions being filtered from the surface velocity by the daily averaging as such we expect 10 to be an upper bound on the error in the model s geostrophic power input estimates there is a strong seasonal cycle in southern ocean wind and surface wind stress in reanalyses hogg et al 2015 lin et al 2018 we also find a seasonal cycle in ke and geostrophic ke in all three models see section 5 as such we would expect to find a seasonal cycle in the total power input from the wind and in its reynolds averaged components to investigate we construct seasonal averages from daily values of wind stress and ssh over the three month periods january march jfm april june amj june september jas and october december ond for the period 2003 2007 we redefine the mean wind stress and ssh on a seasonal basis such that both the mean and eddy power input components may contain sub annual variability in the seasonal averages of fig 4 jra55iaf and jra55abs show the same broad patterns as in the full averages of fig 3c and f for jra55iaf the damping due to relative wind stress visually dominates with large amplitude values in areas of expected high eke shallow seas are dominated by power input in all seasons jra55abs shows the familiar pattern of inter mingled positive and negative region at small scales the highest amplitudes are still found around the acc band where eke is expected to be higher there is a general pattern of higher amplitudes for both models in the amj and jas averages i e the austral autumn and winter this is borne out by the area integrals of table 3 both models show higher total geostrophic power input in amj and jas the maximum and average not shown zonal wind stress is also higher for these two seasonal averages as expected this higher wind stress contributes to the mean power input of both models also being higher in amj and jas the integrated eddy power input for jra55iaf is negative in every season whilst that of jra55abs is positive however whilst jra55abs has the expected pattern of higher eddy power input in amj and jas jra55iaf s eddy power input is less negative in amj and jas than it is in jfm and ond this is contrary to our expectation that stronger wind should lead to more damping especially in amj when the overall power loss is about half of that in jfm and ond we can reconcile this by splitting the integral into regions where the eddy power input is positive and negative as per table 3 we can then see that for both models the gross power loss is higher in austral winter however the gross power gain is also higher in the same period for jra55iaf the increase in gross power gain is proportionally higher than for the gross power loss leading to a net decrease in the integrated eddy power input in contrast the gross power gain and loss for jra55abs both increase in magnitude by about the same proportional amount hence the integrated eddy power input also increases by about the same proportion 5 eddy kinetic energy kinetic energy responds quickly to the change in forcing between core2nyf and jra55iaf as well as to the transition to absolute wind stress in jra55abs this is illustrated in the timeseries of fig 5a which is built from squared daily means of surface velocity for comparison with fig 5b note that the use of squared daily mean velocity as opposed to daily mean of squared velocity underestimates the ke by 20 jra55iaf has a higher minimum value than core2nyf over the seasonal cycle and yet the maximum value is about the same and there is not a particularly notable spinup period at the beginning of jra55iaf however there is more interannual variability in the seasonal cycle in jra55iaf as might be expected due to the normal year forcing in core2nyf after the change to absolute wind stress in jra55abs there is a 2 3 year transition period in which the kinetic energy grows by 25 this time scale is fairly typical of the eddy field s response to a change in wind stress see e g meredith and hogg 2006 the timeseries of geostrophic ke in fig 5b constructed using daily averages of ssh shows a similar pattern albeit with a seasonal cycle of lesser magnitude some of this magnitude reduction will be due to the loss of high frequency ssh variations from using daily mean values to calculate geostrophic ke however it still suggests a significant amount of surface variability is due to ageostrophic motions such as inertial oscillations and ekman affects the spatial variation of the eke is shown in fig 6 as a series of five year averages for both total and geostrophic eke for jra55iaf and jra55abs we average over the period 2003 2007 and use the last five years of the run 1983 1987 for core2nyf we also include an estimate of observed geostrophic eke from aviso altimetry which can be more directly compared with geostrophic eke than the total eke the patterns are typical of that found in models of similar resolution e g barnier et al 2006 delworth et al 2012 or penduff et al 2010 high values are seen in the core of the acc within the separated agulhas current where the brazil and falklands currents meet and near bathymetry such as kerguelen island plateau away from these regions the eke is lower although there is a general increase from core2nyf to jra55iaf to jra55abs which is consistent with the timeseries of fig 5 the regions of high eke are particularly prominent in the geostrophic eke panels due to very low values in the seasonal ice zone which is also seen in the aviso estimate the geostrophic eke of core2nyf and jra55iaf are consistently lower than aviso to the north of the acc the general increase in eke for jra55abs leads to a better comparison in this respect the zonal average of fig 7a indicates that on average the total eke of jra55abs exceeds that of the other models at every latitude north of the agulhas current between roughly 40 s and 30 s jra55abs is a good fit to the aviso estimate south of approximately 55 s all three models have higher eke in the zonal average than aviso in the range 55 40 s core2nyf and jra55iaf are roughly on par with aviso whilst jra55abs exceeds it the story is somewhat different for geostrophic eke in fig 7b all three models are roughly on par with aviso south of 55 s suggesting that the extra eke in fig 7a is largely ageostrophic in nature north of the agulhas current all three models are low in eke whilst jra55abs is a good fit to eke in the latitude band 55 40 s the other two models are on par with each other and below the aviso estimate overall the eke of the models is as good a match to observations as most other models of similar grid spacing averaged over the whole domain jra55abs has 50 more surface eke than either of the other two models for the total eke the surface average value for jra55abs is 0 018 m 2 s 1 compared with 0 012 m 2 s 1 for both core2nyf and jra55iaf the proportional increase for the geostrophic eke is similar with values of 0 014 m 2 s 1 for jra55abs and 0 009 m 2 s 1 for core2nyf and jra55iaf the 30 gw of power removed from the eddy field discussed in section 4 appears small compared to the 0 5 tw supplied to the geostrophic flow however as it is applied directly to each individual eddy its removal is able to affect significant change in the eddy field this increase in eke between jra55iaf and jra55abs is consistent with the results of renault et al 2016a b 2017 2019 seo et al 2016 and seo 2017 these results suggest that this 50 increase in surface eke is robust across most of the ocean s major current systems the bay of bengal stands out with a particularly large change in eke seo et al 2019 these results also include fully coupled models where the increase in eke between experiments such as jra55iaf and jra55abs is moderated by an accompanying increase in the wind stress this suggests that for a coupled model the neglect of relative wind stress ocean current interaction would lead to an 35 increase in surface eke renault et al 2016b our analysis of both total eke and geostrophic eke implies that this increase would be largely in the geostrophic component of the flow i e the most relevant to the general circulation of the ocean 6 heat transports and fluxes at statistical equilibrium the ocean s stratification will no longer be adjusting to changes in forcing when considering a long enough time average and the divergence of the ocean heat transport must match the surface heat flux after the 20 40 years of model integration our numerical experiments are not at statistical equilibrium however the mixed layer has adjusted and we might expect that the surface heat fluxes are close to their final value the subsurface density structure is still adjusting which means that individual density layers may be gaining or losing volume and care must be taken when interpreting the ocean heat transport however a decomposition of the heat transport can be used to indicate an important route through which the changes in the eddy field outlined in sections section 5 and appendix b can affect global climate we estimate the model s heat transport note this is a misleading choice of nomenclature albeit consistent with the extant literature see warren 1999 using time averages of the product of the meridional velocity v the potential temperature t and the vertical grid spacing at v points e 3 v this takes account of the evolution of all the quantities at every timestep as well as ensuring that the muscl advection scheme is properly accounted for the temperature transport is then reynolds averaged thusly 5 ρ 0 c p l x h η v t d z ρ 0 c p l x h η v t d z ρ 0 c p l x h η v t d z ρ 0 c p l x h η v t d z where ρ 0 1026 kg m 3 is the boussinesq reference density c p 3991 9 j kg 1 k 1 is the specific heat capacity l x is the zonal extent of the ocean as a function of latitude h is the depth of the sea bed η is the height of the free surface indicates a time averages indicates the deviation from the time average indicates a zonal average and indicates deviations from the zonal mean we take the time average over the five year period 2003 2007 the same time period used for our analysis of eke and temperature variance in appendix b for jra55iaf and jra55abs the first term on the right hand side of eq 5 is the mean heat transport and largely reflects the eulerian overturning the second term on the right hand side is the heat transport due to standing meanders i e all deviations from a strictly zonal flow in the time mean the third term on the right hand side is the contribution of purely transient features crossing lines of constant latitude if the zonal integration was replaced with an integration following the flow then the standing component would become very small and be replaced by a larger transient component marshall et al 1993 the thick green line in fig 8a is the total heat transport for experiment jra55iaf whilst the thin line is the same for jra55abs the total heat transport has previously been found to be largely insensitive to model formulation and resolution meijers et al 2007 and references therein the structure and form of the total heat transport for both models is broadly consistent with that of previous estimates such as those of meijers et al 2007 and mazloff et al 2010 the total heat transport of jra55abs is higher in magnitude than that of jra55iaf at every latitude although it tends to have its maxima and minima at roughly the same latitudes indicating that the ocean heat transport is converging diverging heat in roughly the same latitude bands the decomposition of eq 5 allows us to attribute the difference in total heat transport between the two experiments to mean or eddy transport processes as shown by the thick and thin orange lines in fig 8a there is little substantial differences between the mean heat transport of each model given the relatively minor change in zonal wind a 1 change in the maximum and 2 7 change in the mean and short integration time it is unsurprising that there is little difference in mean heat transport the change in wind would not be expected to cause a major shift in the flow structure and any changes in temperature transport have not been active for sufficiently long to influence the mean stratification if the model was given longer to spinup then the mean stratification might change enough to allow the mean flow to transport more less heat by altering the top to bottom temperature difference at each meridional location with the mean heat transport undergoing little change it stands to reason that the difference in total heat transport between jra55iaf and jra55abs must be due to standing and or transient meaders this is borne out by the pairs of blue and fuchsia lines in fig 8 it is generally the case that the magnitude of jra55abs s standing and transient heat transport are higher than those of jra55iaf at most latitudes both contribute to making the total heat transport more southwards in jra55abs the generally southwards heat transport of these components is consistent with previous model estimates e g jayne and marotzke 2002 meijers et al 2007 and mazloff et al 2010 as well as many observational estimates from e g floats gille 2003 sallée et al 2008 or satellites stammer 1998 hausmann and czaja 2012 observational estimates of eddy heat transport are consistently southwards with error bars that are a large enough relative to the estimates so as to overlap and make them indistinguishable the differences in transient heat flux are consistent with the general increase in eke from jra55iaf to jra55abs since 2 e k e is a good estimate of the velocity anomaly v in v t similarly t t would be a good estimate of the temperature anomaly in v t as such the lack of substantial change in temperature variance seen in appendix b indicates that the eddy heat transport is largely altered by changes in the rate at which transient standing features move warmer colder water around rather than a change in temperature of the water being moved the grey shading in fig 8a indicates where the zonally averaged net surface heat flux changes sign as shown in fig 8b for both jra55iaf and jra55abs we find this is at similar latitudes by comparison it can be seen that in regions where there is stronger heat convergence in jra55abs largely driven by changes in eddy fluxes as described above there is more heat lost by the ocean for example between 54 s and the pole the ocean heat transport in each model is converging and so the zonal mean net heat flux is negative upwards indicated a loss of heat to the atmosphere because the heat transport at 54 s is stronger in jra55abs more heat is converging into this region than in jra55iaf and so the zonal mean net heat flux is larger in magnitude in contrast between 43 s and 54 s the heat transport in both models is divergent and so they are gaining heat at the surface however as the heat transport difference is a near constant offset between the models there is little difference in the net heat flux even though the magnitude of the heat transport in jra55abs is higher the change from relative to absolute wind also affects the other air sea fluxes calculated by the bulk formulae due to this it could be the case that the changes in heat flux in fig 8b are due to this modification rather than the changes in the eddy field the increased heat transport in fig 8a would then be the response of the ocean to balance this extra loss gain of heat essentially the causality would point in the other direction to that argued above if we examine the zonal mean sst difference in fig 8c we find that south of 45 s jra55abs has warmed relative to jra55iaf this indicates that it is the change to absolute wind elevating the eke that drives the change the elevated eke then increases the eddy heat transport resulting in warmer sst and increased net heat loss if the net heat flux led the change we might instead expect to see a decrease in sst which would be partially compensated by the increased heat transport the increased convergence of heat between 54 s and the pole in jra55abs could potentially alter the seasonal cycle and or mean ice cover in this region due to the strong link between planetary albedo and climate this is a route for the change from relative to absolute wind stress to have global reach to establish such a link we examine the difference in sea ice between the two models in section 7 7 sea ice extent and seasonal cycle the seasonal cycle in total sea ice area for core2nyf is very regular as shown by the green line in fig 9a this is consistent with the more regular with respect to jra55iaf and jra55abs seasonal cycles in other quantities such as kinetic energy see fig 5a the transition to the jra55 do forcing set introduces interannual variability in the total ice area as well as contracting the range of minimum to maximum ice area orange and mauve lines in fig 9a the use of absolute wind stress acts to reduce the minimum and maximum total ice area slightly we compare the model sea ice cover with satellite derived data from the national snow and ice data center s nsidc sea ice index fetterer et al 2017 updated daily and monthly averages of sea ice concentration cavalieri et al 1996 updated yearly we begin with the nsidc s ice extent which assumes total ice cover wherever sea ice concentration 0 15 we compare a five year climatology of monthly values for each model experiment to the nsidc antarctic sea ice extent from 1983 2010 we use pentades of 1983 1987 for core2nyf and 2003 2007 for jra55iaf and jra55abs to correspond with previous analysis in fig 9b we also include the nsidc interquartile and interdecile ranges as dark and light grey shading respectively the nsidc data are plotted as average daily values in contrast to the monthly averages for the model data the sea ice extent of jra55iaf and jra55abs is greater than that of the nsidc record over the entire year it is plausible that the extra freshwater added to prevent polynya formation may contribute to this extra sea ice however it is not possible to definitively conclude this without an additional costly numerical experiment over the ice growth season of april to august jra55iaf and jra55abs remain a roughly constant offset of 1 1 0 6 km 2 from the nsidc data implying that their growth rates are a good match during september to march jra55iaf and jra55abs ice extent exceeds that of the nsidc data by a larger amount throughout the year jra55abs ice extent is less than that of jra55iaf this is consistent with the ice area timeseries of fig 9a and whilst the difference is small it is present throughout the year over the full length of jra55abs in contrast to jra55iaf and jra55abs core2nyf s ice extent is much lower than the nsidc data in february and march it grows very rapidly from april to august such that it exceeds the ice extent of the nsidc data over the winter before melting very rapidly in december and january a more detailed breakdown of seasonal ice concentrations is presented in fig 10 which uses nsidc seasonal data in concert with pentadal averages of jra55iaf and jra55abs over the same three month periods the spatial maps of seasonal average ice concentration reinforce the clear pattern of ice growth and melt in fig 9 the jfm average broadly corresponds to the period of ice extent minimum with peak ice extent occurring in the final month of the jas average the amj and ond seasonal averages are periods of rapid sea ice growth and melt respectively we concentrate on jra55iaf and jra55abs which have more realistic ice extent concentrations than core2nyf to develop the previous section s argument regarding the impact of relative vs absolute wind stress on heat transport in terms of the general spatial pattern there is a good agreement between the jra forced nemo models and the nsidc seasonal data in jfm high concentrations are restricted to a small region of the western weddell sea and the ross sea whilst the ice extent of jra55iaf and jra55abs is systematically higher than that of the nsidc in this season we find that ice concentrations are lower but spread over a broader area over the growing season and towards the peak sea ice extent in september the ice concentrations for jra55iaf and jra55abs are broadly similar the regions of ice concentration 0 8 expand rapidly over amj figs 10f g and over the jas season the characteristic pentagon with near total ice coverage is achieved notably the models have higher concentrations over large areas in contrast to the nsidc seasonal averages in fig 10e and i the satellite observations tend towards a concentration of 1 in similar regions that retain high concentration in jfm fig 10a however the typical concentration is around 0 75 rather than the 1 of the nemo models this does not impact the sea ice extent comparison in fig 9 because the satellite observations and models both have large areas with sea ice concentration 0 15 over the course of the ond averaging period the sea ice melts and the sea ice edge retreats towards the antarctic continent there is not a big discrepancy between the nsidc fig 10m and jra55iaf jra55abs fig 10n o the model ond seasonal averages do tend towards more complete coverage as in the jas average in addition the regions that retain high ice concentration or broader coverage at lower concentration than nsidc in jfm also tend to high concentration in this season taking the difference between the jra55iaf and jra55abs shows where the use of relative wind stress acts to increase ice cover as per fig 10d h l and p for the four seasons across the four seasons we find that absolute wind acts to decrease sea ice concentration in a broad circumpolar way the largest differences are at the edge of the ice pack and there are only very small areas where absolute wind stress increases sea ice cover the decrease in sea ice is not concentrated at specific bathymetric features such as kerguelen plateau or the southeast indian ridge this indicates that if the increased eddy heat transport under absolute wind stress does take preferred routes in localised regions the additional heat is spread throughout the southern ocean by the rest of the circulation it is in jas and ond when the ice extent is large and ice concentration is typically 75 that the extra sea ice in jra55iaf with respect to jra55abs is most concentrated in jfm and amj the extra sea ice is more diffusely spread out particularly in the weddell sea this may reflect the local circulation redistributing ice concentrations as the ice pack breaks up forms in summary we note that the ice extent and ice area for jra55abs is always lower than that of jra55iaf the difference is relatively small but systematic and does not appear to be tied to a specific region of the southern ocean the reduced ice cover of jra55abs is consistent with the larger convergence of heat into the seasonal ice zone seen in section 6 not only does this lead to higher sst and higher net heat loss the additional heat acts to reduce sea ice cover in all seasons 8 summary and discussion relative wind stress acts as a form of friction at the sea surface that torques down every single eddy dewar and flierl 1987 and equatorial wave pacanowski 1987 in our model this leads to a loss of power 30 gw from the geostrophic eddy field once the high power input areas on the shelf are ignored this power sink is small but has a disproportionate impact upon the surface eke leading to an 50 increase under absolute wind stress which is consistent with other major current systems renault et al 2016a b 2017 2019 seo et al 2016 seo 2017 seo et al 2019 this impacts the heat transport of the eddy field such that under absolute wind stress the polewards heat transport is increased in magnitude at all latitudes due to the meridional structure there is then a stronger convergence of heat into the seasonal ice zone which is accompanied by higher sst greater heat loss to the atmosphere and reduced ice cover throughout the year the surface wind stress is a transfer of momentum between atmosphere and ocean in a coupled model the reduction in ocean currents due to relative wind stress reduces the momentum transfer from the atmosphere relative to an equivalent ocean only experiment this leads to a slightly stronger wind stress although still less than an absolute wind case this increased wind stress then leads to a partial re energisation of the ocean eke with respect to the same ocean only experiment the result being that in a coupled system the eke difference between absolute and relative wind experiments is lower than found here at about 35 e g renault et al 2016b we would therefore expect the impact on the heat transport and the ice cover to similarly be ameliorated however we would also expect the coupled system to less vigorously damp the sst anomalies associated with long lived mesoscale features see appendix b this may partly offset the amelioration of the eke change and offset any impact on the meridional heat transport however we do not see a significant impact of absolute vs relative wind stress on the temperature variance air sea heat flux feedback and so it is difficult to speculate how these would be impacted in a coupled model with certainty note that the impact of ocean velocity acts on every aspect of the bulk formulae where it would normally apply not just the wind stress calculation and so even a coupled model s heat fluxes etc would experience both direct and indirect impacts from relative wind stress a remaining question is how differing resolution in coupled models impact the difference between relative and absolute wind stress for example if the wind stress is calculated on the atmospheric grid which is significantly coarser than the ocean one how much does this influence the damping due to relative wind stress would we see the same increase in eke polewards ocean heat transport as under absolute wind stress seen here how different resolutions of coupled model both atmosphere and ocean components might impact the strength of air sea heat flux feedbacks is also currently unknown the total heat transport in a coupled model is largely fixed primarily set by the geometry of the planet in question and the amount of in coming solar radiation stone 1978 we would therefore expect a coupled model to compensate the changes in the ocean by reducing the heat transport in its atmosphere in idealised coupled models relatively minor seeming changes in the heat transport partitioning can lead to large changes in global climate marshall et al 2007 ferreira et al 2010 2011 as a result even if the reduction in planetary albedo due to reduced ice cover under absolute wind stress did not lead to significantly more absorbed solar radiation such a repartitioning

about weddell sea polynyas appendix a weddell sea polynya formation in this appendix we take a brief look at the development of the weddell sea polynya found in initial tests and suppressed by the addition of extra freshwater we identify the core2 normal year forced run that produced the weddell sea polynya as polynya this description is intended to illustrate the development of the polynya allowing it to be traced backwards in time to its initiation in fig a 1a the black line shows the evolution of the total ice area for polynya over the full length of its model run juxtaposed with the first 20 years of core2nyf s total ice area the seasonal cycle of core2nyf is very regular there is little interannual variation in either the maximum or minimum ice area this remains true over the full 40 years of the core2nyf control in contrast polynya s maximum ice area is markedly reduced by the end of its tenth year nominally 1957 and the decrease subsequently becomes precipitous by the winter of 1966 polynya s maximum ice area is under 60 of core2nyf s at the same point in time ice thickness is also about 60 of core2nyf with the volume being about 56 shortly before reaching the expected peak ice concentration in 1966 polynya becomes numerically unstable and the model run comes to an abrupt end this numerical instability is caused by an increasing density difference across the model s acc which leads to a 25 increase in the drake passage transport over the second half of polynya as shown in fig a 1b polynya s issues begin in the central weddell sea as a thinning of the sea ice that results in an open polynya in winter see fig a 2a the polynya consistently reopens in the western weddell sea whilst extending eastwards towards maud rise as shown in fig a 2b the polynya also extends northwards until it reaches the ice edge at which point it resembles a bite taken out of the ice rather than a polynya compared to the 1965 ice cover of core2nyf in fig a 2c the reduction in ice area extent is clear the development of the polynya can be traced backwards in time via the model s surface age tracer as described in section 2 this ideal age tracer is set to zero within 10 m of the surface and 2 of the northern boundary low age at depth i e dark blue in fig a 3 indicates that water has been recently ventilated via contact with the surface through deep convection as is typical with models that produce weddell sea polynyas deep convection occurs throughout the water column in polynya when the model run experiences numerical instability this convection is over a large fraction of the weddell sea and is able to bring warm circumpolar deep water cdw to the surface and melt large amounts of the seasonal sea ice fig a 3b by looking back through earlier years we are able to track the evolution of the deep convection and the polynya as shown in fig a 3a five years previous to the numerical instability the deep convection is at the northern edge of the continental slope in fact the convection originates over the shelf and marches out over the continental shelf as each winter season occurs this is due to the successive years of winter cooling weakening the near surface stratification which allows the next year s heat loss to generate convection slightly further out from the coast the polynya only forms when the edge of the convection reaches the warm cdw and brings sufficient heat to the surface so as to melt any sea ice in contrast fig a 3c shows that in core2nyf convection never reaches the edge of the continental slope and is always confined to the top few hundred metres the additional freshwater prevents surface water from becoming dense enough to reach the bottom of the weddell sea and so the warm cdw remains isolated from the surface appendix b temperature variance and air sea heat flux feedbacks in addition to eke another measure of eddy activity is the temperature variance which is a partial measure of eddy potential energy and links to section 6 s discussion of meridional heat transport a full measure of eddy potential energy would examine density variance and or include salinity variance however anecdotally we find salinity variance to be very low in each of the models and choose to neglect it here in this appendix we discuss how the temperature variance varies across our model experiments and use covariance of sea surface temperature sst and net surface heat flux to discuss how this might be related to air sea flux feedbacks we use a number of data sources to construct estimates of sea surface temperature sst variance and the covariance of sst with net surface heat flux we rely upon a range of other data sources available as high resolution gridded products as an observational record of sst and its variance we use v2 1 of the level 4 analysis climate data record cdr from the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci merchant et al 2019 good et al 2019 these data are a globally complete daily analysis of sst on a 0 05 grid and combine data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and along track scanning radiometer atsr satellites where there are gaps in the measurements data assimilation is used to provide sst we use data from 1 1 2003 to 31 12 2007 corresponding to the analysis period of jra55iaf and jra55abs rather than the full length of the esa cci record as an optimal combination of observations and model we also make use of the southern ocean state estimate sose mazloff et al 2010 sose uses a 1 6 ocean model and the adjoint method to construct a continuous trajectory through the model s phase space that is an optimal fit to many thousands of observations in a least squares sense the initial conditions and surface forcing fields are subject to adjoint based modification to facilitate the optimal fit sose spans calendar years 2005 2010 although we discard the first year as model spinup net surface heat flux observations are sparse over the southern ocean as a result when considering the covariance of sst and surface heat flux we use the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010a b as a proxy for a purely observational data set cfsr is a next generation reanalysis using global high resolution coupled atmosphere ocean sea ice land surface components the atmospheric component has a resolution of 38 km t382 with 64 levels and assimilates satellite radiances it is coupled to a global ocean every 6 h at the equator the ocean component has a grid spacing of 1 4 which extends to 1 2 outside of the tropics and has 40 levels cfsr spans calendar years 1979 to 2010 and we make use of the full reanalysis to provide a high resolution model estimate of sst variance and the covariance of sst and net heat flux we use a version of the community earth system model with a 1 10 ocean component cesm small et al 2014 this coupled model has an atmosphere with a 1 4 grid spacing and an ocean with a 1 10 grid spacing this high resolution coupled model was run for a total of 100 model years although we only use the last 5 15 years due to model spinup the atmosphere communicates with the coupler every 10 min and the ocean communicates with the coupler every 6 h to compute sst variance we use daily mean values of sst from esa cci sose and cesm to construct 5 year time averages of sst and the square of sst these are then reynolds averaged to produce the variance of sst t t for each nemo experiment the square of sst is obtained directly from nemo and so includes higher frequencies than the three comparators this might be expected to elevate the t t of the nemo experiments although recalculation using a series of one day means of sst indicates a difference of 0 5 the spatial maps of surface temperature variance in fig b 1a c show little qualitative difference between the three nemo experiments which broadly agree with the esa cci estimate of fig b 1d high values of temperature variance are found where the western boundary currents i e the brazil current agulhas current and east australia current bring warm subtropical water southwards potentially interacting with the acc the high values associated with the agulhas current persist for thousands of kilometres downstream of the agulhas retroflection there is a minimum in temperature variance within the core of the acc which is clearer and deeper in the nemo experiments than in the esa cci estimate south of these minima values are elevated in a roughly pentagonal shape characteristic of the winter sea ice edge very low values are then found close to antarctica where the temperature would be close to the freezing point for much of the year in general the esa cci estimate has higher values of temperature variance than all three nemo experiments throughout the model domain this is particularly noticeable north of the acc for core2nyf there are notably higher variances in the weddell and ross gyres with respect to jra55iaf and jra55iaf which we attribute to the lower sea ice cover in summer allowing for more warming near the surface see section 7 the temperature variance estimates from sose and cesm in fig b 1e and f show areas of much higher values than the nemo models and esa cci the regions of higher temperature variance are located in similar geographical areas such as east of the kerguelen plateau and south east of new zealand the high variance at the edge of the seasonal ice zone stands out as being both broader in area and higher in value although very low variance is still found at the heart of the weddell and ross seas the minimum in the core of the acc is however still present because of the generally higher values the minimum is obscured over much of the atlantic and indian sectors with the most prominent region standing out between drake passage and new zealand however as seen in the zonal average of b 2a there is still a distinct minimum between 50 s and 60 s which is visually more prominent than in the other estimates due to the higher values to the south of 60 s the zonal average also makes it clear that all three nemo models have low temperature variance with respect to their comparators why are all three nemo models temperature variances systematically lower than the other estimates it seems unlikely that it is a matter of model resolution the grid spacing of sose is coarser than that of the cesm and nemo configuration used here the difference between the 1 10 of cesm and the 1 12 of our nemo configuration is probably marginal if the reason for the lower temperature variance in the nemo experiments was a systematic under representation of the ocean s eddy potential energy field then it would be reasonable to expect sose to have lower variance than cesm and nemo it seems far more likely that some other systematic difference between the models is the reason for the variation in their temperature variance estimates the forcing sets for the nemo experiments use a prescribed atmospheric temperature in this sense the atmospheric temperature is fixed and a key feedback between ocean and atmosphere is missing since any heat flux anomalies due to sst anomalies cannot change the atmospheric temperature in contrast cesm is a coupled model and the presence of this feedback allows sst and atmospheric temperature to covary and influence each other s evolution through time the lack of this feedback in ocean only experiments is expected to result in overly strong damping of the sst towards the atmospheric temperature imposed by the forcing set as a result of this anomalies of sst are more rapidly eroded than would be the case in reality or in a coupled climate model sose is a six year long state estimate although we have restricted our analysis to the last five years to allow for spinup of the forward model s eddy field by adjusting its forcing and initial conditions sose provides a dynamically consistent trajectory through phase space which is an optimal fit to the contributing observations in a least squares sense in this regard sose might be expected to give the optimal estimate of many of the ocean s properties although it does so in part by adjusting the atmospheric temperature of its forcing a side effect of this is to ensure that sst anomalies can persist in a similar manner to that of cesm the rate at which sst anomalies are damped by air sea interaction α n e t in w m 2 k 1 with positive value indicating damping of sst anomalies is an important parameter of the climate system observations indicate that α n e t varies in space and time frankignoul 1985 frankignoul and kestenare 2002 park et al 2005 and depends on the scale of the sst anomalies themselves for midlatitudes α n e t is typically 20 w m 2 k 1 frankignoul 1985 frankignoul et al 1998 and recent southern ocean estimates hausmann et al 2016a b suggest lower values over the acc this suggests weaker damping of sst anomalies over much of the southern ocean with respect to the midlatitudes based on the estimates of temperature variance in figs b 1 and b 2a and the above argument we expect our nemo experiments to exhibit higher values of α n e t than in the results of hausmann et al 2016a b sose and cesm as a starting point we would expect α n e t for our nemo models to be at least the upper bound obtained from the bulk formula which is 20 40 w m 2 k 1 for the so hausmann et al 2016b to estimate α n e t we adopt the method of hausmann et al 2016a as established by frankignoul et al 1998 and rooted in the theoretical framework of frankignoul and hasselmann 1977 based on stochastic climate models this method uses lagged covariances to separate the key role of air sea heat fluxes in generating sst anomalies from the damping feedback our estimate is given by b 1 α n e t 1 n i 1 n t t q t i δ t t t t t i δ t where t and q are monthly sst and net surface heat flux anomalies respectively an overbar is a time average over the full length of the time series and δ t is one month we construct a time series for each data source of monthly anomalies from a time average of sst and net surface heat flux over the length of that time series in contrast to hausmann et al 2016a we set n 2 as we find that using n 3 leads to noisy estimates of α n e t due to low statistical significance of t t t t i δ t at a lag of 3 months this may reflect the finite length of our timeseries in locations where student s t test indicates that the t autocorrelation is statistically insignificant at a lag of two months we revert to a n 1 estimate for α n e t we mask regions with sea ice concentration 0 15 in calculating α n e t regardless of the statistical significance of the t autocorrelation for core2nyf jra55iaf and jra55abs we use a 15 year long time series since we found the five years used for our other analyses to lead to lower statistical significance in the required co variances we take the last 15 years of core2nyf from 1973 to 1987 inclusive and the last 15 years of jra55abs from 1993 to 2007 inclusive using this same period for jra55iaf this maximises the spinup time of jra55iaf after the change from core2 to jra55 do forcing whilst also giving jra55abs five years to spinup its stronger eddy field after the start of the experiment for similar reasons we use the last 15 years of the same cesm experiments as used above in lieu of an observational estimate we use data from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010a b which uses an ocean component with a 0 25 grid spacing at the equator extending to 0 5 globally outside of the tropics we use the full length of the cfsr record which begins in 1979 and ends in 2010 for our anomaly time series maps of our α n e t estimate for core2nyf jra55iaf and jra55abs are shown in figs b 3a c all three models have large areas of α n e t in excess of 85 w m 2 k 1 extending circumpolarly around the southern ocean the values are broadly four times the observational estimates of hausmann et al 2016a b for similar regions even close to antarctica and under the seasonal sea ice as indicated by the white shading the nemo experiment estimates remain large and mostly positive this indicates that damping of sst anomalies by net air sea heat flux in the models is much stronger than we would expect from observations core2nyf has the largest values of α n e t particularly over the indo pacific sector given the otherwise similar model configuration this must reflect some difference between the core2 and jra55 do forcing sets such as the longer time period between successive atmospheric fields the other three α n e t estimates in fig b 3d f correspond to cfsr sose and cesm they are all notably lower then for the nemo experiments as the longest time series the cfsr estimate is probably the most statistically valid hence its smoother spatial patterns which its lower resolution may also contribute to whilst α n e t remains large 60 w m 2 k 1 over much of the atlantic and indian sectors low values 20 w m 2 k 1 are found in the core of the acc over the pacific sector these values are more in line with the observation estimates of hausmann et al 2016a b that they are clearly an imprint of the dynamically distinct acc on this quantitative estimate of the heat flux feedback on sst anomalies is extremely intriguing it could be related to the strong currents tending to advect mesoscale eddies with their small scale anomaly pattern largely eastward rather than allowing clear migration north or south where their temperature would be more anomalous we leave understanding this to future work with its shortest time series the sose estimate of α n e t in fig b 3e is the noisiest with a lot of small scale structure and frequent sign changes broadly speaking and without drawing overly strong conclusions based on the short length of the time series there is good agreement with the cfsr estimate large positive values are found in the atlantic and indian sectors and most importantly this is the only other estimate that shows low values of α n e t in the core of the acc over the pacific sector as the only coupled high resolution coupled model we could reasonably expect cesm s α n e t to be somewhere between that of cfsr and the nemo experiments accordingly fig b 3f shows considerably lower values than for all the nemo experiments compared to cfsr and sose the peak values of α n e t are lower but spread over a broader area this is borne out by the zonal mean of fig b 2b which shows that the zonal mean values for cfsr sose and cesm are all very similar the general pattern of a peak at 50 60 s and lower values towards the pole where the estimate is seasonally masked due to ice cover is very similar the zonal averages for the nemo experiments are all considerably higher particularly for core2nyf however they continue to show the peak in α n e t between 50 60 s which is the general location of the minima in temperature variance as shown in fig b 2a this supports our hypothesis that the temperature variance is lower in the nemo experiment because they are overly strongly restoring the sst to the prescribed atmospheric temperature which results in overly strong damping of sst anomalies they also support the minima in temperature variance being due to where the strongest damping is present in all data sources whilst this argument is consistent with our arguments there are clearly subtleties cesm has more temperature variance and a stronger α n e t estimate than sose whilst zonal asymmetry is most distinct in the cfsr estimate there may be other effects coming into play here such as the resolution of the ocean the details of the bulk formulae in use and the formulation of the model state estimate vs coupled climate we leave a full exploration of such effects to a future publication 
23867,the transfer of momentum between the atmosphere and ocean is dependent upon the velocity difference between the seawater and overlying air this is commonly known as relative wind or ocean current interaction and its direct effect is to damp mesoscale ocean eddies through the imposition of an opposing surface torque if an ocean model neglects the ocean velocity in its bulk formulae this can lead to an increase in power input to the ocean and a large increase in eddy kinetic energy eke other secondary effects that are dependent upon the current system under consideration may also occur here we show that the neglect of relative wind leads to an 50 increase in surface eke in a circumpolar model of the southern ocean this acts to increase the southwards eddy heat transport fluxing more heat into the seasonal ice zone and subsequently reducing ice cover in all seasons the net reduction in planetary albedo may be a way for a largescale impact on climate keywords southern

https nsidc org data 1 introduction the turbulent transfer of momentum between atmosphere and ocean is typically expressed as a surface wind stress as calculated via a bulk formula parameterisation this relates the wind stress to the difference between the atmospheric wind usually at an elevation of 10 m and the surface ocean velocity 1 τ s ρ a c d u 10 u s u 10 u s where τ s is the surface wind stress ρ a is the atmospheric density c d is the drag coefficient u 10 is the 10 m atmospheric wind and u s is the surface ocean velocity note that the drag coefficient may also be a function of u 10 u s the inclusion of the surface ocean velocity in the bulk formula referred to as relative wind or ocean current interaction feedback acts as a source of friction at the ocean surface that directly dissipates mesoscale ocean eddies dewar and flierl 1987 and equatorial waves pacanowski 1987 furthermore there is a substantial difference in the surface power input to the ocean between calculations that use relative wind vs absolute wind when the u s is neglected in eq 1 for wind stress calculations duhaut and straub 2006 estimates of the change in power input differ but are typically 10 35 of the total duhaut and straub 2006 dawe and thompson 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 zhai and greatbatch 2007 zhai et al 2012 munday and zhai 2015 the additional friction under a relative wind stress acts to efficiently damp the eddy field such that the eddy kinetic energy eke is reduced with respect to an absolute wind stress simulation the exact decrease depends upon the region under consideration for the california upwelling system renault et al 2016b found that surface eke decreased by 50 whilst the depth averaged eke decreased by 27 decreases in surface eke of 25 have also been found for the gulf stream and agulhas current renault et al 2016a 2017 as well as the california current system and arabian sea seo et al 2016 seo 2017 changes in eke are particularly pronounced in the bay of bengal where a switch between absolute and relative wind can result in a factor of two change seo et al 2019 the switch to relative wind stress can lead to a more realistic simulation specifically renault et al 2016a show improved gulf stream circulation post separation and luo et al 2005 show improvements in the equatorial pacific s warm pool cold tongue structure other aspects of the eddy field other than changes to its energy such as their propagation and lifetime can also lead to improvements renault et al 2017 the use of coupled atmosphere ocean models has highlighted that the response of the coupled atmosphere partially mitigates the impact of relative wind stress on eke this is due to a slightly increased wind stress with respect to that achieved by a prescribed atmosphere leading to a partial re energisation of the eke of the ocean renault et al 2016b the southern ocean so is a region of strong wind forcing in which the mesoscale eddy field plays important roles in its budgets of momentum munk and palmén 1951 johnson and bryden 1989 and heat bryden 1979 jayne and marotzke 2002 meijers et al 2007 the strong winds do considerable work on the ocean due to the prevailing eastward direction of the so s currents of the 1 tw of power input to the geostrophic circulation roughly 0 5 tw takes place in the so wunsch 1998 wunsch and ferrari 2004 ferrari and wunsch 2009 this has the potential to create a perfect storm in terms of the impacts of relative wind with the mesoscale eddies being directly damped and the power input to the ocean reduced in a region where both are of first order importance the impact of using relative vs absolute wind stress on so circulation has been previously explored hutchinson et al 2010 show a 38 sv increase in the circumpolar transport of a quasi geostrophic antarctic circumpolar current acc when switching from an absolute to relative wind stress formulation this occurs due to a weakening of the eddy field and an accompanying steepening of the isopycnals under relative wind stress in contrast munday and zhai 2015 use a primitive equation but idealised channel model of the so in which the circumpolar transport increases by a more modest 10 15 sv under relative wind stress due to the same mechanism furthermore they find that the sensitivity of the residual meridional overturning circulation rmoc to changing wind stress is effectively the same under both absolute and relative wind stress this is due to a cancellation between steepening isopycnal slope and reduced eddy diffusivity under relative wind stress despite the above progress outstanding questions remain for example hutchinson et al 2010 use a coupled quasi geostrophic model q gcm see hogg et al 2003 although in this case the atmosphere above the boundary layer does not evolve freely it is subject to simplifications in the governing equations that are not present in the primitive equation model mitgcm see marshall et al 1993 1994 used by munday and zhai 2015 however it benefits through the inclusion of complex bathymetry albeit vertically truncated to 780 m above a mean ocean depth of 4000 m the idealised domain of munday and zhai 2015 is flat bottomed which results in a zonally symmetric mean state that is not subject to concentration of eddy activity behind bathymetric obstacles neither study includes variability in the atmospheric forcing or sea ice which excludes a potentially important feedback on circulation changes the 1 20 drake passage model of song et al 2020 also uses mitgcm this time in a realistically complex model domain with untruncated bathymetry in their case use of relative wind results in a 24 drop in eke with respect to an absolute wind run of the same model this is comparable to that found in other regions of the ocean see above however it is spatially limited to 140 of longitude and may be subject to additional limitations from its lateral boundary conditions this paper aims to investigate the differences between the use of relative and absolute wind stress in a circumpolar model of the so that includes realistically complex bathymetry and time varying forcing via the use of reanalysis products this model includes a coupled sea ice component in section 2 we describe the fundamentals of the model configuration and surface forcing section 2 2 in section 3 we briefly review the large scale circulation of our experiments we break our discussion of the model results into section 4 on wind power input section 5 on eke section 6 on meridional heat transport and section 7 on sea ice extent area and the sea ice seasonal cycle we end the paper with a summary and discussion in section 8 2 model setup and data sources 2 1 nemo model configuration we use a circumpolar configuration of nemo the nucleus for european modelling of the ocean coupled to lim3 the louvain la neuve sea ice model vancoppenolle et al 2009 rousset et al 2015 due to the time period during which this configuration was developed our nemo lim revision is intermediate between that of the previous release v3 6 and that of the current nemo lim release v4 0 nemo system team 2019 it incorporates some bugfixes and code developments made as part of v4 0 the model s horizontal grid spacing is 1 12 to allow for a vigorous mesoscale eddy field and there are 75 levels spread unevenly through the water column we make use of the z star vertical coordinate system adcroft and campin 2004 with partial vertical steps adcroft et al 1997 and the thermodynamic equation of state for seawater teos 10 e g roquet et al 2015 there is no sea surface restoring to either temperature or salinity the model is run on 2542 cores with land suppression active which eliminates roughly half of the model domain without land suppression 4944 cores would be required and a timestep of 300 s to the south the ocean is bounded by the antarctic continent and the latitude of the northern boundary is staggered in each ocean basin this is to accommodate a second version of the model currently in development that incorporates a new hybrid vertical coordinate ice shelves and potentially tides the northern boundary has been moved to avoid being too close to tidal amphidromes which can lead to spurious generation of tidal energy in the atlantic basin the northern boundary is at 7 27 s whilst it is at 22 83 s and 29 04 s in the indian and pacific basins respectively the positions of the amphidromes and thus the position of the northern boundary was determined with a test of the current configuration that included tides not shown at the northern boundary we strongly restore to an annual climatology from the eccov4r2 state estimate forget et al 2015 2016 the initial state of the model is taken as january of this climatology eccov4r2 has a small misfit to observations and is an optimal estimate of the ocean s circulation over the period 1992 to 2011 by using a state estimate derived climatology we avoid inheriting modelling issues resulting from e g a global model and being limited to the run length of this parent model note that we have to transform the potential temperature and practical salinity of ecco4v2 to conservative temperature and absolute salinity for use with teos 10 at the northern boundary a flather condition is applied to the barotropic flow and a neumann condition to the baroclinic flow temperature and salinity are restored as per the flow relaxation scheme davies 1976 engerdahl 1995 over a 24 gridbox wide sponge the lateral boundaries use freeslip boundary conditions for momentum and we make use of the vector invariant form of the momentum equation the hollingsworth et al 1983 correction is applied to the ke term since it can otherwise give rise to spurious energy bell et al 2016 the coriolis acceleration is calculated using the energy and enstrophy conserving form over the global ocean this is known to reduce noise in the vertical velocity le sommer et al 2009 and when combined with partial vertical steps improves flow topography interaction barnier et al 2006 penduff et al 2007 a split explicit scheme following that of shchepetkin and mcwilliams 2005 is used to solve the free surface equation the horizontal viscosity is biharmonic with a coefficient equivalent to 1 25 1 0 10 m 4 s 1 at the equator the biharmonic viscosity is scaled by the model grid spacing and so varies with latitude for the advection of temperature salinity and age tracers we use the muscl scheme van leer 1979 the choice of tracer advection scheme can influence a model s circulation in profound ways gerdes et al 1991 griffies et al 2000 complex advection schemes such as that due to prather 1986 may lead to improvements in the modelled circulation hofmann and morales maqueda 2006 morales maqueda and holloway 2006 muscl is an upwind biased scheme that is relatively cheap in computational terms there are persuasive arguments of the benefits of such schemes with respect to the over and under shoots that may be experienced with dispersive schemes typically centred in nature van leer 1973 1974 1977a b 1979 1997 hecht et al 1995 the diffusion on the tracer fields is laplacian in nature and applied along isopycnals e g redi 1982 with a coefficient equivalent to 125 m 2 s 1 at the equator the laplacian viscosity is scaled by the model grid spacing and so varies with latitude at each timestep the total freshwater flux i e evaporation minus precipitation minus runoff and including contributions from ice shelf runoff but excluding flow through the northern boundary and sea ice growth melt is set to zero via a uniform correction applied to the area integrated evaporation minus precipitation this correction will not be an accurate representation of the freshwater forcing i e over a seasonal cycle the southern ocean may gain or loss freshwater however it prevents any slight imbalance leading to an increase decrease of volume in the ocean component or a long term salinity drift as a result surface freshwater fluxes are really a redistribution of freshwater within the model domain rather than a net gain or loss rainfall is as provided by the surface forcing set see section 2 2 with the evaporation as determined by bulk formula the sea ice component is lim3 coupled to nemo at every timestep and using the 5th order ultimate macho advection scheme and no diffusion the ice levitates on the sea surface and exchanges mass and salt with no pressure effect there are five ice categories two ice layers and one snow layer advective and diffusive bottom boundary layer parameterisations are applied to improve the connection between non adjacent bottom cells the momentum equations are additionally subject to nonlinear bottom friction with a spatially varying coefficient vertical mixing processes are represented by a tke scheme based on that of blanke and delecluse 1993 we have adopted a number of modelling options from configurations of the uk met office in particular bottom enhanced tidal mixing on the eorca12 grid associated with the k1 and m2 tide is applied as per simmons et al 2004 and a climatological geothermal heat flux from goutorbe et al 2011 is applied at the sea bed rather than use the runoff from the specific forcing sets we do not intend to follow the established protocols of the forcing sets we use river and iceshelf runoff provided by the met office this is adapted to our high resolution grid and shoreline the iceshelf runoff is vertically spread over 10 m the model includes a pair of age tracers which are subject to the same advection diffusion schemes as temperature and salinity see above the first tracer is set to zero within the northern boundary sponge for the flow relaxation scheme outside of this sponge it ages at a rate of 1 s s it measures the age relative to water that has just entered left the domain at the northern boundary the second age tracer is set to zero near the northern boundary and within 10 m of the surface it measures the age of the water relative to both these locations and so conflates multiple sources of information we take this approach due to numerical issues near the northern boundary that lead to the generation of spurious values for unconstrained age tracers an alternative would have been to provide an age value appropriate to eccov4r2 at the northern boundary however no such profile was available at the time of running the model the combination of the two tracers help disentangle surface subduction from entry into the domain via the northern boundary 2 2 surface forcing we have performed three experiments the first of these is a control run using the core2 normal year forcing large and yeager 2004 2009 for 40 years referred to as core2nyf munday et al 2021 note that this does not include leap days this is used to spinup an initial eddy field and circulation without biasing it towards a specific calendar year the nominal start date for this control run is 1948 with the stratification reset to eccov4r2 conditions at the beginning of january of 1949 and 1950 this initialisation period allows us to start in january with no sea ice whilst preventing the generation of overly saline water within the seasonal ice zone core2nyf nominally ends on 31 december 1987 results presented from core2nyf are largely from the last five years 1 january 1983 to 31 december 1987 the second control run is forced by jra55 do interannually varying forcing tsujino et al 2018 and is also run for 40 years referred to as jra55iaf munday et al 2021 note that the jra55 do forcing does include leap days and benefits from an increased horizontal 55 km and temporal resolution 3 hr with respect to core2 jra55iaf is started on 1 january 1978 from a restart of core2nyf and runs until 31 december 2017 this provides an already energetic eddy field and helps mitigate the additional spinup due to changing forcing set the third experiment uses the jra55 do forcing under an absolute wind stress condition referred to as jra55abs munday and zhai 2021 this experiment is 20 years long and starts on 1 january 1988 from a restart of jra55iaf this allows a 10 year adjustment to the change from core2nyf to jra55iaf and maintains an overlapping control run for the life of jra55abs the switch to absolute instead of relative wind stress also removes the impact of the ocean velocity on other fluxes through the bulk formulae the majority of our presented results from jra55iaf and jra55abs are from 1 january 2003 to 31 december 2007 this corresponds to the last five years of jra55abs and ensures that both jra55 do forced models have comparable atmospheric forcing we have also examined the 1983 1987 and 2013 2017 averages for jra55abs and whilst the quantitative detail changes our conclusions do not in initial tests with core2 normal year forcing it was found that beyond an integration threshold of 12 years the model would generate a large weddell sea polynya due to thermal wind shear this led to acceleration of the antarctic circumpolar current and ultimately numerical instability in order to suppress polynya formation we followed the guidance of kjellson et al 2015 and added additional freshwater to the prescribed runoff to do so we triple the amount of prescribed runoff to include an additional 2500 gt yr and also include an additional 1500 gt yr south of 60 s to simulate iceberg melt this additional freshwater is still subject to the constraint that the area integrated freshwater flux be zero at every timestep and so remains a redistribution of freshwater rather than strictly an extra volume the extra flux suppresses the polynya throughout the 40 years of core2nyf allowing a stable ocean circulation to develop in order to maintain comparability between the two control runs we also maintain this additional freshwater forcing in jra55iaf and jra55abs the formation process of the weddell sea polynya is described in appendix a 2 3 data sources to provide an estimate of eke we make use of altimetry from the archiving validation and interpretation of satellite oceanographic data aviso in the form of daily level 4 reprocessed derived variables from 1 1 2003 to 12 31 2007 the product has been processed by ssalto duacs to merge all flying altimeters via optimal interpolation onto a regular 1 4 grid we use absolute geostrophic velocities derived from absolute dynamic topography to calculate the eke sea ice area and extent data are taken from the national snow and ice data center nsidc satellite derived sea ice extent is provided by the nsidc sea ice index v3 fetterer et al 2017 updated daily this combines nimbus 7 smmr and dmsp ssm i ssmis passive microwave data satellite images to generate daily and monthly images the sea ice index runs from november 1978 to present we use an average from 1983 to 2010 we also use monthly averages of sea ice concentration as a spatial field cavalieri et al 1996 updated yearly 3 large scale circulation the zonal circulation of all three models is dominated by the acc over much of the model domain as per the transport streamfunction in fig 1a for jra55iaf which is representative of all three models subtropical gyres are present in the atlantic and indian basins with the brazil and agulhas currents interacting with the acc north of the falkland islands and south of cape agulhas respectively due to the placement of the northern boundary the wind driven gyre to the east of australia and new zealand is particularly weak and there is little signature of the east australia current eac present in this sector of the model the northern boundary is at 29 04 s which is very close to the latitude of sugarloaf point where the eac leaves the coast of australia and flows towards new zealand as such the model domain is excluding most of its formation region and the result is a very weak current in these broad strokes the models are largely very similar there are differences in e g the position and intensity of the brazil malvinas confluence or the strength of the agulhas current however the result is a credible simulation of the southern ocean horizontal circulation inline with other models of similar resolution see e g mazloff et al 2010 and delworth et al 2012 etc the volume transport through drake passage t a c c is a commonly taken metric of the zonal flow of the southern ocean recent observational estimates give a transport of 136 7 6 9 sv meredith et al 2011 based on analysis of historical hydrographic sections and 173 3 10 7 sv donohue et al 2016 which includes the barotropic flow for all three models we calculate t a c c using five day averages of the product of the zonal velocity and level thickness across drake passage we take a five year average value over 1983 1987 for core2nyf and 2003 2007 for jra55iaf and jra55abs we use the standard deviation of the five day mean values over these time periods as a measure of variability due to model spinup internal variability of the ocean and variability in the surface forcing for jra55iaf and jra55abs the particular five year period chosen for the average value can lead to changes in both the mean and standard deviation of t a c c t a c c for all three experiments is intermediate between the observational estimates of meredith et al 2011 and donohue et al 2016 for core2nyf the transport is 151 58 5 14 sv where the uncertainty indicates the standard deviation of all five day means contributing to the average for jra55iaf and jra55abs the transport is 147 57 5 78 sv and 147 58 5 68 sv respectively given the variability in the model these values are largely indistinguishable based on the results of hutchinson et al 2010 and munday and zhai 2015 we would expect to see a larger difference in the drake passage transport of jra55iaf and jra55abs specifically we would expect that the relative wind damping of the mesoscale eddy field in jra55iaf would lead to steeper isopycnals and therefore an increased drake passage transport due to thermal wind shear the lack of an increased transport may be due to a number of affects firstly the model runs are all short in a timeframe of a few decades we would not expect the stratification of the ocean to reach its new equilibrium especially given the spinup time of the ocean s baroclinic structure wunsch and heimbach 2008 allison et al 2011 with 80 of t a c c due to thermal wind shear it is reasonable to expect its adjustment time to be dictated by the baroclinic rather than barotropic mode secondly it could reflect the increase in complexity of the model bathymetry relative to that of hutchinson et al 2010 and munday and zhai 2015 with complex untruncated bathymetry the models under consideration here may have a fundamentally different response to those previously employed thirdly the surface forcing used here varies strongly in time in contrast to the constant forcing of both hutchinson et al 2010 and munday and zhai 2015 variable wind stress alters the sensitivity of both t a c c and the rmoc to wind stress via changes in near surface mixing munday and zhai 2017 to unravel whether the drake passage transport of jra55iaf and jra55abs would differ substantially at equilibrium would require a minimum of several hundred model years of further integration which is beyond the available computing resources in depth investigations into the role of complex bathymetry and surface forcing variability are beyond the scope of the current paper both the mean wind stress and the mesoscale eddy field of the southern ocean play first order roles in setting its average meridional circulation in the zonal integral sense the rmoc is a small difference between much larger individual components determined by the wind stress and the eddy field the eulerian overturning set by the wind stress and the bolus overturning set by the eddy field marshall and radko 2003 these give rise to a two cell structure for the rmoc marshall and speer 2012 in which mesoscale eddies play an active role due to their capacity to dynamically interact with the stratification of the ocean marshall et al 2002 karsten et al 2002 the two cells are usually identified with the clockwise circulation of north atlantic deep water nadw overlying anticlockwise circulating antarctic bottom water aabw there are subtleties to the calculation of the rmoc due to the impacts of different forms of averaging nurser and lee 2004a b we diagnose the rmoc using density as the vertical coordinate by rebinning the meridional velocity into 160 density layers that are 0 05 kg m 3 thick due to modelling constraints this is done as an offline post processing calculation using five year s worth of five day means we calculate the density referenced to 2000 m using the five day mean temperature salinity and teos 10 before using the 3d field to rebin the velocity and integrating the result is shown in fig 1b for jra55iaf the expected two cell structure is clear although the aabw cell is over a narrow range of density with the flow below the mixed layer being largely adiabatic due to the use of five day means for the calculation both for the advection field and for the calculation of density there will be some slight misallocation of transport between density classes in our rmoc calculation in addition variability at frequencies higher than 1 5 days will be averaged away and this will lead to a reduction of the bolus overturning the non zero values at the low densities are due to the surface freshwater flux the surface value of the rmoc at each latitude matches the freshwater flux accumulated from the southern boundary to that latitude as expected as a quantitative comparison of the overturning between the three models we plot the density profile of the rmoc streamfunction at 30 s in fig 1c this is a common latitude for such comparisons see e g morrison et al 2011 at densities greater than 1037 kg m 3 all three models have a similarly narrow aabw cell implying that this is a property of the general model configuration rather than of the surface forcing for core2nyf this cell transports 14 62 sv of water which is slightly stronger than the 12 83 sv and 12 49 sv transported by jra55iaf and jra55abs respectively between densities of around 1035 kg m 3 and 1037 kg m 3 the models have their nadw cell with all three being comparable in strength at 15 sv near the surface at densities lighter than 1035 kg m 3 all three models show the presence of a relatively intense surface cell with a peak transport of 16 17 sv this cell is most likely a directly wind driven ekman cell and is beyond the scope of this paper the increase in strength of this cell from jra55iaf to jra55abs is consistent with the slight increase in mean wind stress under absolute wind stress in summary the large scale circulation of all three models is broadly similar and in line with other ocean models of similar grid spacing forcing etc we do not find a significant difference in drake passage transport or residual moc the first is something of an anomaly given differences between previous relative and absolute wind driven experiments this may be due to length of the model runs not allowing for sufficient modification of isopycnal slopes although fundamental differences in model formulation may also play a role the lack of significant differences between the rmoc of jra55iaf and jra55abs is consistent with the hypothesis that the length of the model run has not allowed for major change in isopycnal slope and flow it is also consistent with the results of munday and zhai 2015 which show no large differences in sensitivity of the rmoc to changes in surface wind stress under relative absolute wind stress 4 wind power input the single largest input of power to the ocean is from atmospheric wind wunsch and ferrari 2004 ferrari and wunsch 2009 observational estimates of the wind power input are usually constructed from the geostrophic flow using altimetry such estimates suggest that global power input is 1 tw or less wunsch 1998 hughes and wilson 2008 scott and xu 2009 with the exact figure depending upon subtleties such as the inclusion of high frequency winds zhai et al 2012 roughly half of this wind power input occurs in the southern ocean where strong westerly winds align with strong eastward surface currents roquet et al 2011 considerably more power is thought to be input to the ageostrophic circulation and surface waves with estimates reaching 3 tw wang and huang 2004a and 60 tw wang and huang 2004b respectively much of this extra power does little to drive the actual circulation for example 70 of the near inertial energy input from the wind is dissipated in the upper 200 m zhai et al 2009 using our different model runs we calculate two estimates of wind power input the first of these uses the model s full surface ocean current and a five year average is calculated using every timestep of the model we use reynolds averaging to split this into the mean power input and the eddy power input 2 τ s u s τ s u s τ s u s where τ s is the surface wind stress u s is the surface ocean current overbars indicate a five year time average and primes deviations from that average the second estimate uses a series of one day averages of the surface wind stress and the one day average sea surface height to estimate the geostrophic current using reynolds averaging we again split this into the mean geostrophic power input and the eddy geostrophic power input 3 τ 1 d u g τ 1 d u g τ 1 d u g where τ 1 d is the one day averaged surface wind stress the estimate of the geostrophic surface currents u g is calculated from the one day average sea surface height 4 u g g f k η 1 d where g 9 80665 m s 2 is the gravitational acceleration in nemo f is the coriolis frequency and η 1 d is the one day average sea surface height the spatial pattern of the total power input for both jra55iaf and jra55abs reflects the dominant westerly wind over the eastward currents of the southern ocean see fig 2a d energy is input over much of the model domain in a few locations most obviously over the agulhas current energy is instead extracted from the ocean by the wind this is due to the mean flow opposing the mean wind stress as can be clearly seen in the mean power input of fig 2b e there is little obvious qualitative difference between the total and mean power input of the two experiments in addition because the change from relative to absolute wind does not significantly impact the magnitude of the mean wind or the mean ocean current there is little clear difference between the mean power input of jra55abs with respect to jra55iaf reynolds averaging reveals that there are more obvious differences in the eddy power input between jra55iaf and jra55abs in fig 2c f the colour bar has been constrained to better show the detail over the agulhas current and its extension across the indian ocean sector fig 2c shows power loss from the ocean there is also powerloss from the ocean over the falklands current this power loss is largely absent from jra55abs in fig 2f whilst this is symptomatic of the expected damping of the eddy field under relative wind stress in jra55iaf the use of the full velocity disguises this damping we shall return to this below when considering the geostrophic power input the total power input using the full velocity is of order 1 1 1 2tw for jra55iaf due to the interannual variation in the forcing the specific 5 year period used for the average matters for example as per table 1 2013 2017 is a particularly windy period in jra55 do and so the power input to the ocean is 1 195 tw compared to 1 12tw during 1983 1987 as expected the use of absolute wind in jra55abs leads to an increase in the power input to the ocean for 2003 2007 relative to jra55iaf the increase from 1 151tw to 1 274tw is 10 which is somewhat lower than the reported 20 35 in the literature duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 zhai and greatbatch 2007 zhai et al 2012 any variation in the total power input for core2nyf is purely due to internal variability of the ocean as such the total power input does not vary much around the figure of 0 957 tw in table 1 whilst the eddy power input is typically lower in magnitude than the mean power input its distribution is also less localised in space as a result the eddy power input makes up roughly 30 40 of the total with the exact percentage depending upon the details of the particular experiment and its forcing there is a very strong correlation between short term fluctuations in the wind inertial oscillations and other high frequency ageostrophic motions as a result the eddy power input is dominated by these motions and the expected damping of the mesoscale eddy field is disguised in order to tease out this damping we use the method of wu et al 2017 and renault et al 2016a and renault et al 2017 and use daily mean ssh fields to calculate the surface geostrophic flow as per eq 4 this is then combined with daily wind averages to estimate the geostrophic power input as per eq 3 the result and its decomposition into geostrophic mean and geostrophic eddy power inputs is shown in fig 3 the geostrophic total and geostrophic mean power input for both jra55iaf and jra55abs in figs 3a b d e are qualitatively very similar to that obtained with the full velocity in figs 2a b d e the broad strokes of the most intense values being over the acc and lower power input to the north and south remain true likewise there is power loss over the agulhas and falklands current regions there is a general reduction in magnitude most clearly seen outside of the acc such that the total power input to the geostrophic flow is 0 45 0 56 tw compared to 1 0 1 3 tw for the full velocity this is comparable to observational estimates of wunsch and ferrari 2004 and ferrari and wunsch 2009 which place the power input at 0 5 tw for the southern ocean furthermore it suggests that somewhere in the region of 0 5 0 6 tw is fed into near surface ageostrophic motions and or mixing processes a large part of the surface ageostrophic flow is probably due to ekman transport whilst the net ekman transport is expected to be at a right angle to the wind and thus cannot contribute to its power input this need not be the case for the surface current the percentage increase in geostrophic power input from jra55iaf to jra55abs is 20 which compares well to values previously quoted in the literature duhaut and straub 2006 hughes and wilson 2008 zhai and greatbatch 2007 zhai et al 2012 the real difference in using the geostrophic velocity to estimate the power input is brought out in the geostrophic eddy power input as seen in figs 3c f note the change in the colour bar which highlights the regions of power loss for jra55iaf which uses relative wind stress there is clear power loss in regions of high eke in particular the agulhas current region and its extension north of the falklands south of australia and new zealand and near other regions of bathymetry extending high into the water column broadly speaking the spatial pattern of power loss reflects the eke see section 5 as one would expect given that relative wind is expected to directly damp mesoscale eddies in contrast jra55abs which uses absolute wind lacks these large areas of power loss within the core of the acc there are instead small regions of both positive and negative power input which highlights the lack of mesoscale damping from absolute wind stress however positive values in coastal areas around australia new zealand argentina and chile persist in these shelf regions the model eke is low see section 5 which may mean that there are insufficient eddies for the damping effect of relative wind stress to be significant as shown in table 2 the integral of the geostrophic eddy power input over the whole domain is negative for core2nyf and jra55iaf and the figure of 0 02 tw is 4 of the total geostrophic power input broadly speaking it is an order of magnitude less than the eddy power input using the full velocity as shown in table 1 for jra55iaf the power loss is somewhat low compared to the observational estimate of 0 0257 tw for the southern ocean hughes and wilson 2008 however if we exclude the shelf regions noted to have high power input in our model and which the altimeter may not represent well in hughes and wilson 2008 we instead estimate a figure of 0 03 tw for water deeper than 1000 m which compares well to their figure of 0 0257 tw in contrast to the experiments with relative wind stress the area integrated geostrophic eddy power input estimate of jra55abs is 0 042 tw excluding the shelf regions reduces the magnitude to 0 027 tw with the difference between the two estimates being roughly the same as for core2nyf and jra55iaf i e the positive power input over the shelf regions is broadly the same regardless of the use of relative wind stress the overall positive value is to be expected for jra55abs because the source of additional friction due to relative wind stress has been removed the use of one day averages for the geostrophic power input estimate will tend to affect the total power input τ 1 d u g and the eddy power input τ 1 d u g the mean power input cannot be affected because the longterm time average of τ 1 d and u g will still contain all the necessary information from every timestep of the model we can assess how much this impacts our estimates by using one day averages of surface velocity to reconstruct the equivalent calculation for the full surface velocity for jra55iaf and jra55abs using one day averages to calculate the wind power input reduces the total by 17 in the case of core2nyf the reduction is only 10 the reduced impact is likely because of the lower frequency of the forcing which means that there are fewer frequencies that get averaged away than for the jra55 do forced experiments this suggests that the geostrophic estimate of eddy power input may be underestimated in magnitude by 10 20 however some of the decrease is probably due to inertial and near inertial motions being filtered from the surface velocity by the daily averaging as such we expect 10 to be an upper bound on the error in the model s geostrophic power input estimates there is a strong seasonal cycle in southern ocean wind and surface wind stress in reanalyses hogg et al 2015 lin et al 2018 we also find a seasonal cycle in ke and geostrophic ke in all three models see section 5 as such we would expect to find a seasonal cycle in the total power input from the wind and in its reynolds averaged components to investigate we construct seasonal averages from daily values of wind stress and ssh over the three month periods january march jfm april june amj june september jas and october december ond for the period 2003 2007 we redefine the mean wind stress and ssh on a seasonal basis such that both the mean and eddy power input components may contain sub annual variability in the seasonal averages of fig 4 jra55iaf and jra55abs show the same broad patterns as in the full averages of fig 3c and f for jra55iaf the damping due to relative wind stress visually dominates with large amplitude values in areas of expected high eke shallow seas are dominated by power input in all seasons jra55abs shows the familiar pattern of inter mingled positive and negative region at small scales the highest amplitudes are still found around the acc band where eke is expected to be higher there is a general pattern of higher amplitudes for both models in the amj and jas averages i e the austral autumn and winter this is borne out by the area integrals of table 3 both models show higher total geostrophic power input in amj and jas the maximum and average not shown zonal wind stress is also higher for these two seasonal averages as expected this higher wind stress contributes to the mean power input of both models also being higher in amj and jas the integrated eddy power input for jra55iaf is negative in every season whilst that of jra55abs is positive however whilst jra55abs has the expected pattern of higher eddy power input in amj and jas jra55iaf s eddy power input is less negative in amj and jas than it is in jfm and ond this is contrary to our expectation that stronger wind should lead to more damping especially in amj when the overall power loss is about half of that in jfm and ond we can reconcile this by splitting the integral into regions where the eddy power input is positive and negative as per table 3 we can then see that for both models the gross power loss is higher in austral winter however the gross power gain is also higher in the same period for jra55iaf the increase in gross power gain is proportionally higher than for the gross power loss leading to a net decrease in the integrated eddy power input in contrast the gross power gain and loss for jra55abs both increase in magnitude by about the same proportional amount hence the integrated eddy power input also increases by about the same proportion 5 eddy kinetic energy kinetic energy responds quickly to the change in forcing between core2nyf and jra55iaf as well as to the transition to absolute wind stress in jra55abs this is illustrated in the timeseries of fig 5a which is built from squared daily means of surface velocity for comparison with fig 5b note that the use of squared daily mean velocity as opposed to daily mean of squared velocity underestimates the ke by 20 jra55iaf has a higher minimum value than core2nyf over the seasonal cycle and yet the maximum value is about the same and there is not a particularly notable spinup period at the beginning of jra55iaf however there is more interannual variability in the seasonal cycle in jra55iaf as might be expected due to the normal year forcing in core2nyf after the change to absolute wind stress in jra55abs there is a 2 3 year transition period in which the kinetic energy grows by 25 this time scale is fairly typical of the eddy field s response to a change in wind stress see e g meredith and hogg 2006 the timeseries of geostrophic ke in fig 5b constructed using daily averages of ssh shows a similar pattern albeit with a seasonal cycle of lesser magnitude some of this magnitude reduction will be due to the loss of high frequency ssh variations from using daily mean values to calculate geostrophic ke however it still suggests a significant amount of surface variability is due to ageostrophic motions such as inertial oscillations and ekman affects the spatial variation of the eke is shown in fig 6 as a series of five year averages for both total and geostrophic eke for jra55iaf and jra55abs we average over the period 2003 2007 and use the last five years of the run 1983 1987 for core2nyf we also include an estimate of observed geostrophic eke from aviso altimetry which can be more directly compared with geostrophic eke than the total eke the patterns are typical of that found in models of similar resolution e g barnier et al 2006 delworth et al 2012 or penduff et al 2010 high values are seen in the core of the acc within the separated agulhas current where the brazil and falklands currents meet and near bathymetry such as kerguelen island plateau away from these regions the eke is lower although there is a general increase from core2nyf to jra55iaf to jra55abs which is consistent with the timeseries of fig 5 the regions of high eke are particularly prominent in the geostrophic eke panels due to very low values in the seasonal ice zone which is also seen in the aviso estimate the geostrophic eke of core2nyf and jra55iaf are consistently lower than aviso to the north of the acc the general increase in eke for jra55abs leads to a better comparison in this respect the zonal average of fig 7a indicates that on average the total eke of jra55abs exceeds that of the other models at every latitude north of the agulhas current between roughly 40 s and 30 s jra55abs is a good fit to the aviso estimate south of approximately 55 s all three models have higher eke in the zonal average than aviso in the range 55 40 s core2nyf and jra55iaf are roughly on par with aviso whilst jra55abs exceeds it the story is somewhat different for geostrophic eke in fig 7b all three models are roughly on par with aviso south of 55 s suggesting that the extra eke in fig 7a is largely ageostrophic in nature north of the agulhas current all three models are low in eke whilst jra55abs is a good fit to eke in the latitude band 55 40 s the other two models are on par with each other and below the aviso estimate overall the eke of the models is as good a match to observations as most other models of similar grid spacing averaged over the whole domain jra55abs has 50 more surface eke than either of the other two models for the total eke the surface average value for jra55abs is 0 018 m 2 s 1 compared with 0 012 m 2 s 1 for both core2nyf and jra55iaf the proportional increase for the geostrophic eke is similar with values of 0 014 m 2 s 1 for jra55abs and 0 009 m 2 s 1 for core2nyf and jra55iaf the 30 gw of power removed from the eddy field discussed in section 4 appears small compared to the 0 5 tw supplied to the geostrophic flow however as it is applied directly to each individual eddy its removal is able to affect significant change in the eddy field this increase in eke between jra55iaf and jra55abs is consistent with the results of renault et al 2016a b 2017 2019 seo et al 2016 and seo 2017 these results suggest that this 50 increase in surface eke is robust across most of the ocean s major current systems the bay of bengal stands out with a particularly large change in eke seo et al 2019 these results also include fully coupled models where the increase in eke between experiments such as jra55iaf and jra55abs is moderated by an accompanying increase in the wind stress this suggests that for a coupled model the neglect of relative wind stress ocean current interaction would lead to an 35 increase in surface eke renault et al 2016b our analysis of both total eke and geostrophic eke implies that this increase would be largely in the geostrophic component of the flow i e the most relevant to the general circulation of the ocean 6 heat transports and fluxes at statistical equilibrium the ocean s stratification will no longer be adjusting to changes in forcing when considering a long enough time average and the divergence of the ocean heat transport must match the surface heat flux after the 20 40 years of model integration our numerical experiments are not at statistical equilibrium however the mixed layer has adjusted and we might expect that the surface heat fluxes are close to their final value the subsurface density structure is still adjusting which means that individual density layers may be gaining or losing volume and care must be taken when interpreting the ocean heat transport however a decomposition of the heat transport can be used to indicate an important route through which the changes in the eddy field outlined in sections section 5 and appendix b can affect global climate we estimate the model s heat transport note this is a misleading choice of nomenclature albeit consistent with the extant literature see warren 1999 using time averages of the product of the meridional velocity v the potential temperature t and the vertical grid spacing at v points e 3 v this takes account of the evolution of all the quantities at every timestep as well as ensuring that the muscl advection scheme is properly accounted for the temperature transport is then reynolds averaged

the time average indicates a zonal average and indicates deviations from the zonal mean we take the time average over the five year period 2003 2007 the same time period used for our analysis of eke and temperature variance in appendix b for jra55iaf and jra55abs the first term on the right hand side of eq 5 is the mean heat transport and largely reflects the eulerian overturning the second term on the right hand side is the heat transport due to standing meanders i e all deviations from a strictly zonal flow in the time mean the third term on the right hand side is the contribution of purely transient features crossing lines of constant latitude if the zonal integration was replaced with an integration following the flow then the standing component would become very small and be replaced by a larger transient component marshall et al 1993 the thick green line in fig 8a is the total heat transport for experiment jra55iaf whilst the thin line is the same for jra55abs the total heat transport has previously been found to be largely insensitive to model formulation and resolution meijers et al 2007 and references therein the structure and form of the total heat transport for both models is broadly consistent with that of previous estimates such as those of meijers et al 2007 and mazloff et al 2010 the total heat transport of jra55abs is higher in magnitude than that of jra55iaf at every latitude although it tends to have its maxima and minima at roughly the same latitudes indicating that the ocean heat transport is converging diverging heat in roughly the same latitude bands the decomposition of eq 5 allows us to attribute the difference in total heat transport between the two experiments to mean or eddy transport processes as shown by the thick and thin orange lines in fig 8a there is little substantial differences between the mean heat transport of each model given the relatively minor change in zonal wind a 1 change in the maximum and 2 7 change in the mean and short integration time it is unsurprising that there is little difference in mean heat transport the change in wind would not be expected to cause a major shift in the flow structure and any changes in temperature transport have not been active for sufficiently long to influence the mean stratification if the model was given longer to spinup then the mean stratification might change enough to allow the mean flow to transport more less heat by altering the top to bottom temperature difference at each meridional location with the mean heat transport undergoing little change it stands to reason that the difference in total heat transport between jra55iaf and jra55abs must be due to standing and or transient meaders this is borne out by the pairs of blue and fuchsia lines in fig 8 it is generally the case that the magnitude of jra55abs s standing and transient heat transport are higher than those of jra55iaf at most latitudes both contribute to making the total heat transport more southwards in jra55abs the generally southwards heat transport of these components is consistent with previous model estimates e g jayne and marotzke 2002 meijers et al 2007 and mazloff et al 2010 as well as many observational estimates from e g floats gille 2003 sallée et al 2008 or satellites stammer 1998 hausmann and czaja 2012 observational estimates of eddy heat transport are consistently southwards with error bars that are a large enough relative to the estimates so as to overlap and make them indistinguishable the differences in transient heat flux are consistent with the general increase in eke from jra55iaf to jra55abs since 2 e k e is a good estimate of the velocity anomaly v in v t similarly t t would be a good estimate of the temperature anomaly in v t as such the lack of substantial change in temperature variance seen in appendix b indicates that the eddy heat transport is largely altered by changes in the rate at which transient standing features move warmer colder water around rather than a change in temperature of the water being moved the grey shading in fig 8a indicates where the zonally averaged net surface heat flux changes sign as shown in fig 8b for both jra55iaf and jra55abs we find this is at similar latitudes by comparison it can be seen that in regions where there is stronger heat convergence in jra55abs largely driven by changes in eddy fluxes as described above there is more heat lost by the ocean for example between 54 s and the pole the ocean heat transport in each model is converging and so the zonal mean net heat flux is negative upwards indicated a loss of heat to the atmosphere because the heat transport at 54 s is stronger in jra55abs more heat is converging into this region than in jra55iaf and so the zonal mean net heat flux is larger in magnitude in contrast between 43 s and 54 s the heat transport in both models is divergent and so they are gaining heat at the surface however as the heat transport difference is a near constant offset between the models there is little difference in the net heat flux even though the magnitude of the heat transport in jra55abs is higher the change from relative to absolute wind also affects the other air sea fluxes calculated by the bulk formulae due to this it could be the case that the changes in heat flux in fig 8b are due to this modification rather than the changes in the eddy field the increased heat transport in fig 8a would then be the response of the ocean to balance this extra loss gain of heat essentially the causality would point in the other direction to that argued above if we examine the zonal mean sst difference in fig 8c we find that south of 45 s jra55abs has warmed relative to jra55iaf this indicates that it is the change to absolute wind elevating the eke that drives the change the elevated eke then increases the eddy heat transport resulting in warmer sst and increased net heat loss if the net heat flux led the change we might instead expect to see a decrease in sst which would be partially compensated by the increased heat transport the increased convergence of heat between 54 s and the pole in jra55abs could potentially alter the seasonal cycle and or mean ice cover in this region due to the strong link between planetary albedo and climate this is a route for the change from relative to absolute wind stress to have global reach to establish such a link we examine the difference in sea ice between the two models in section 7 7 sea ice extent and seasonal cycle the seasonal cycle in total sea ice area for core2nyf is very regular as shown by the green line in fig 9a this is consistent with the more regular with respect to jra55iaf and jra55abs seasonal cycles in other quantities such as kinetic energy see fig 5a the transition to the jra55 do forcing set introduces interannual variability in the total ice area as well as contracting the range of minimum to maximum ice area orange and mauve lines in fig 9a the use of absolute wind stress acts to reduce the minimum and maximum total ice area slightly we compare the model sea ice cover with satellite derived data from the national snow and ice data center s nsidc sea ice index fetterer et al 2017 updated daily and monthly averages of sea ice concentration cavalieri et al 1996 updated yearly we begin with the nsidc s ice extent which assumes total ice cover wherever sea ice concentration 0 15 we compare a five year climatology of monthly values for each model experiment to the nsidc antarctic sea ice extent from 1983 2010 we use pentades of 1983 1987 for core2nyf and 2003 2007 for jra55iaf and jra55abs to correspond with previous analysis in fig 9b we also include the nsidc interquartile and interdecile ranges as dark and light grey shading respectively the nsidc data are plotted as average daily values in contrast to the monthly averages for the model data the sea ice extent of jra55iaf and jra55abs is greater than that of the nsidc record over the entire year it is plausible that the extra freshwater added to prevent polynya formation may contribute to this extra sea ice however it is not possible to definitively conclude this without an additional costly numerical experiment over the ice growth season of april to august jra55iaf and jra55abs remain a roughly constant offset of 1 1 0 6 km 2 from the nsidc data implying that their growth rates are a good match during september to march jra55iaf and jra55abs ice extent exceeds that of the nsidc data by a larger amount throughout the year jra55abs ice extent is less than that of jra55iaf this is consistent with the ice area timeseries of fig 9a and whilst the difference is small it is present throughout the year over the full length of jra55abs in contrast to jra55iaf and jra55abs core2nyf s ice extent is much lower than the nsidc data in february and march it grows very rapidly from april to august such that it exceeds the ice extent of the nsidc data over the winter before melting very rapidly in december and january a more detailed breakdown of seasonal ice concentrations is presented in fig 10 which uses nsidc seasonal data in concert with pentadal averages of jra55iaf and jra55abs over the same three month periods the spatial maps of seasonal average ice concentration reinforce the clear pattern of ice growth and melt in fig 9 the jfm average broadly corresponds to the period of ice extent minimum with peak ice extent occurring in the final month of the jas average the amj and ond seasonal averages are periods of rapid sea ice growth and melt respectively we concentrate on jra55iaf and jra55abs which have more realistic ice extent concentrations than core2nyf to develop the previous section s argument regarding the impact of relative vs absolute wind stress on heat transport in terms of the general spatial pattern there is a good agreement between the jra forced nemo models and the nsidc seasonal data in jfm high concentrations are restricted to a small region of the western weddell sea and the ross sea whilst the ice extent of jra55iaf and jra55abs is systematically higher than that of the nsidc in this season we find that ice concentrations are lower but spread over a broader area over the growing season and towards the peak sea ice extent in september the ice concentrations for jra55iaf and jra55abs are broadly similar the regions of ice concentration 0 8 expand rapidly over amj figs 10f g and over the jas season the characteristic pentagon with near total ice coverage is achieved notably the models have higher concentrations over large areas in contrast to the nsidc seasonal averages in fig 10e and i the satellite observations tend towards a concentration of 1 in similar regions that retain high concentration in jfm fig 10a however the typical concentration is around 0 75 rather than the 1 of the nemo models this does not impact the sea ice extent comparison in fig 9 because the satellite observations and models both have large areas with sea ice concentration 0 15 over the course of the ond averaging period the sea ice melts and the sea ice edge retreats towards the antarctic continent there is not a big discrepancy between the nsidc fig 10m and jra55iaf jra55abs fig 10n o the model ond seasonal averages do tend towards more complete coverage as in the jas average in addition the regions that retain high ice concentration or broader coverage at lower concentration than nsidc in jfm also tend to high concentration in this season taking the difference between the jra55iaf and jra55abs shows where the use of relative wind stress acts to increase ice cover as per fig 10d h l and p for the four seasons across the four seasons we find that absolute wind acts to decrease sea ice concentration in a broad circumpolar way the largest differences are at the edge of the ice pack and there are only very small areas where absolute wind stress increases sea ice cover the decrease in sea ice is not concentrated at specific bathymetric features such as kerguelen plateau or the southeast indian ridge this indicates that if the increased eddy heat transport under absolute wind stress does take preferred routes in localised regions the additional heat is spread throughout the southern ocean by the rest of the circulation it is in jas and ond when the ice extent is large and ice concentration is typically 75 that the extra sea ice in jra55iaf with respect to jra55abs is most concentrated in jfm and amj the extra sea ice is more diffusely spread out particularly in the weddell sea this may reflect the local circulation redistributing ice concentrations as the ice pack breaks up forms in summary we note that the ice extent and ice area for jra55abs is always lower than that of jra55iaf the difference is relatively small but systematic and does not appear to be tied to a specific region of the southern ocean the reduced ice cover of jra55abs is consistent with the larger convergence of heat into the seasonal ice zone seen in section 6 not only does this lead to higher sst and higher net heat loss the additional heat acts to reduce sea ice cover in all seasons 8 summary and discussion relative wind stress acts as a form of friction at the sea surface that torques down every single eddy dewar and flierl 1987 and equatorial wave pacanowski 1987 in our model this leads to a loss of power 30 gw from the geostrophic eddy field once the high power input areas on the shelf are ignored this power sink is small but has a disproportionate impact upon the surface eke leading to an 50 increase under absolute wind stress which is consistent with other major current systems renault et al 2016a b 2017 2019 seo et al 2016 seo 2017 seo et al 2019 this impacts the heat transport of the eddy field such that under absolute wind stress the polewards heat transport is increased in magnitude at all latitudes due to the meridional structure there is then a stronger convergence of heat into the seasonal ice zone which is accompanied by higher sst greater heat loss to the atmosphere and reduced ice cover throughout the year the surface wind stress is a transfer of momentum between atmosphere and ocean in a coupled model the reduction in ocean currents due to relative wind stress reduces the momentum transfer from the atmosphere relative to an equivalent ocean only experiment this leads to a slightly stronger wind stress although still less than an absolute wind case this increased wind stress then leads to a partial re energisation of the ocean eke with respect to the same ocean only experiment the result being that in a coupled system the eke difference between absolute and relative wind experiments is lower than found here at about 35 e g renault et al 2016b we would therefore expect the impact on the heat transport and the ice cover to similarly be ameliorated however we would also expect the coupled system to less vigorously damp the sst anomalies associated with long lived mesoscale features see appendix b this may partly offset the amelioration of the eke change and offset any impact on the meridional heat transport however we do not see a significant impact of absolute vs relative wind stress on the temperature variance air sea heat flux feedback and so it is difficult to speculate how these would be impacted in a coupled model with certainty note that the impact of ocean velocity acts on every aspect of the bulk formulae where it would normally apply not just the wind stress calculation and so even a coupled model s heat fluxes etc would experience both direct and indirect impacts from relative wind stress a remaining question is how differing resolution in coupled models impact the difference between relative and absolute wind stress for example if the wind stress is calculated on the atmospheric grid which is significantly coarser than the ocean one how much does this influence the damping due to relative wind stress would we see the same increase in eke polewards ocean heat transport as under absolute wind stress seen here how different resolutions of coupled model both atmosphere and ocean components might impact the strength of air sea heat flux feedbacks is also currently unknown the total heat transport in a coupled model is largely fixed primarily set by the geometry of the planet in question and the amount of in coming solar radiation stone 1978 we would therefore expect a coupled model to compensate the changes in the ocean by reducing the heat transport in its atmosphere in idealised coupled models relatively minor seeming changes in the heat transport partitioning can lead to large changes in global climate marshall et al 2007 ferreira et al 2010 2011 as a result even if the reduction in planetary albedo due to reduced ice cover under absolute wind stress did not lead to significantly more absorbed solar radiation such a repartitioning

about weddell sea polynyas appendix a weddell sea polynya formation in this appendix we take a brief look at the development of the weddell sea polynya found in initial tests and suppressed by the addition of extra freshwater we identify the core2 normal year forced run that produced the weddell sea polynya as polynya this description is intended to illustrate the development of the polynya allowing it to be traced backwards in time to its initiation in fig a 1a the black line shows the evolution of the total ice area for polynya over the full length of its model run juxtaposed with the first 20 years of core2nyf s total ice area the seasonal cycle of core2nyf is very regular there is little interannual variation in either the maximum or minimum ice area this remains true over the full 40 years of the core2nyf control in contrast polynya s maximum ice area is markedly reduced by the end of its tenth year nominally 1957 and the decrease subsequently becomes precipitous by the winter of 1966 polynya s maximum ice area is under 60 of core2nyf s at the same point in time ice thickness is also about 60 of core2nyf with the volume being about 56 shortly before reaching the expected peak ice concentration in 1966 polynya becomes numerically unstable and the model run comes to an abrupt end this numerical instability is caused by an increasing density difference across the model s acc which leads to a 25 increase in the drake passage transport over the second half of polynya as shown in fig a 1b polynya s issues begin in the central weddell sea as a thinning of the sea ice that results in an open polynya in winter see fig a 2a the polynya consistently reopens in the western weddell sea whilst extending eastwards towards maud rise as shown in fig a 2b the polynya also extends northwards until it reaches the ice edge at which point it resembles a bite taken out of the ice rather than a polynya compared to the 1965 ice cover of core2nyf in fig a 2c the reduction in ice area extent is clear the development of the polynya can be traced backwards in time via the model s surface age tracer as described in section 2 this ideal age tracer is set to zero within 10 m of the surface and 2 of the northern boundary low age at depth i e dark blue in fig a 3 indicates that water has been recently ventilated via contact with the surface through deep convection as is typical with models that produce weddell sea polynyas deep convection occurs throughout the water column in polynya when the model run experiences numerical instability this convection is over a large fraction of the weddell sea and is able to bring warm circumpolar deep water cdw to the surface and melt large amounts of the seasonal sea ice fig a 3b by looking back through earlier years we are able to track the evolution of the deep convection and the polynya as shown in fig a 3a five years previous to the numerical instability the deep convection is at the northern edge of the continental slope in fact the convection originates over the shelf and marches out over the continental shelf as each winter season occurs this is due to the successive years of winter cooling weakening the near surface stratification which allows the next year s heat loss to generate convection slightly further out from the coast the polynya only forms when the edge of the convection reaches the warm cdw and brings sufficient heat to the surface so as to melt any sea ice in contrast fig a 3c shows that in core2nyf convection never reaches the edge of the continental slope and is always confined to the top few hundred metres the additional freshwater prevents surface water from becoming dense enough to reach the bottom of the weddell sea and so the warm cdw remains isolated from the surface appendix b temperature variance and air sea heat flux feedbacks in addition to eke another measure of eddy activity is the temperature variance which is a partial measure of eddy potential energy and links to section 6 s discussion of meridional heat transport a full measure of eddy potential energy would examine density variance and or include salinity variance however anecdotally we find salinity variance to be very low in each of the models and choose to neglect it here in this appendix we discuss how the temperature variance varies across our model experiments and use covariance of sea surface temperature sst and net surface heat flux to discuss how this might be related to air sea flux feedbacks we use a number of data sources to construct estimates of sea surface temperature sst variance and the covariance of sst with net surface heat flux we rely upon a range of other data sources available as high resolution gridded products as an observational record of sst and its variance we use v2 1 of the level 4 analysis climate data record cdr from the european space agency s climate change initiative esa cci merchant et al 2019 good et al 2019 these data are a globally complete daily analysis of sst on a 0 05 grid and combine data from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and along track scanning radiometer atsr satellites where there are gaps in the measurements data assimilation is used to provide sst we use data from 1 1 2003 to 31 12 2007 corresponding to the analysis period of jra55iaf and jra55abs rather than the full length of the esa cci record as an optimal combination of observations and model we also make use of the southern ocean state estimate sose mazloff et al 2010 sose uses a 1 6 ocean model and the adjoint method to construct a continuous trajectory through the model s phase space that is an optimal fit to many thousands of observations in a least squares sense the initial conditions and surface forcing fields are subject to adjoint based modification to facilitate the optimal fit sose spans calendar years 2005 2010 although we discard the first year as model spinup net surface heat flux observations are sparse over the southern ocean as a result when considering the covariance of sst and surface heat flux we use the ncep climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010a b as a proxy for a purely observational data set cfsr is a next generation reanalysis using global high resolution coupled atmosphere ocean sea ice land surface components the atmospheric component has a resolution of 38 km t382 with 64 levels and assimilates satellite radiances it is coupled to a global ocean every 6 h at the equator the ocean component has a grid spacing of 1 4 which extends to 1 2 outside of the tropics and has 40 levels cfsr spans calendar years 1979 to 2010 and we make use of the full reanalysis to provide a high resolution model estimate of sst variance and the covariance of sst and net heat flux we use a version of the community earth system model with a 1 10 ocean component cesm small et al 2014 this coupled model has an atmosphere with a 1 4 grid spacing and an ocean with a 1 10 grid spacing this high resolution coupled model was run for a total of 100 model years although we only use the last 5 15 years due to model spinup the atmosphere communicates with the coupler every 10 min and the ocean communicates with the coupler every 6 h to compute sst variance we use daily mean values of sst from esa cci sose and cesm to construct 5 year time averages of sst and the square of sst these are then reynolds averaged to produce the variance of sst t t for each nemo experiment the square of sst is obtained directly from nemo and so includes higher frequencies than the three comparators this might be expected to elevate the t t of the nemo experiments although recalculation using a series of one day means of sst indicates a difference of 0 5 the spatial maps of surface temperature variance in fig b 1a c show little qualitative difference between the three nemo experiments which broadly agree with the esa cci estimate of fig b 1d high values of temperature variance are found where the western boundary currents i e the brazil current agulhas current and east australia current bring warm subtropical water southwards potentially interacting with the acc the high values associated with the agulhas current persist for thousands of kilometres downstream of the agulhas retroflection there is a minimum in temperature variance within the core of the acc which is clearer and deeper in the nemo experiments than in the esa cci estimate south of these minima values are elevated in a roughly pentagonal shape characteristic of the winter sea ice edge very low values are then found close to antarctica where the temperature would be close to the freezing point for much of the year in general the esa cci estimate has higher values of temperature variance than all three nemo experiments throughout the model domain this is particularly noticeable north of the acc for core2nyf there are notably higher variances in the weddell and ross gyres with respect to jra55iaf and jra55iaf which we attribute to the lower sea ice cover in summer allowing for more warming near the surface see section 7 the temperature variance estimates from sose and cesm in fig b 1e and f show areas of much higher values than the nemo models and esa cci the regions of higher temperature variance are located in similar geographical areas such as east of the kerguelen plateau and south east of new zealand the high variance at the edge of the seasonal ice zone stands out as being both broader in area and higher in value although very low variance is still found at the heart of the weddell and ross seas the minimum in the core of the acc is however still present because of the generally higher values the minimum is obscured over much of the atlantic and indian sectors with the most prominent region standing out between drake passage and new zealand however as seen in the zonal average of b 2a there is still a distinct minimum between 50 s and 60 s which is visually more prominent than in the other estimates due to the higher values to the south of 60 s the zonal average also makes it clear that all three nemo models have low temperature variance with respect to their comparators why are all three nemo models temperature variances systematically lower than the other estimates it seems unlikely that it is a matter of model resolution the grid spacing of sose is coarser than that of the cesm and nemo configuration used here the difference between the 1 10 of cesm and the 1 12 of our nemo configuration is probably marginal if the reason for the lower temperature variance in the nemo experiments was a systematic under representation of the ocean s eddy potential energy field then it would be reasonable to expect sose to have lower variance than cesm and nemo it seems far more likely that some other systematic difference between the models is the reason for the variation in their temperature variance estimates the forcing sets for the nemo experiments use a prescribed atmospheric temperature in this sense the atmospheric temperature is fixed and a key feedback between ocean and atmosphere is missing since any heat flux anomalies due to sst anomalies cannot change the atmospheric temperature in contrast cesm is a coupled model and the presence of this feedback allows sst and atmospheric temperature to covary and influence each other s evolution through time the lack of this feedback in ocean only experiments is expected to result in overly strong damping of the sst towards the atmospheric temperature imposed by the forcing set as a result of this anomalies of sst are more rapidly eroded than would be the case in reality or in a coupled climate model sose is a six year long state estimate although we have restricted our analysis to the last five years to allow for spinup of the forward model s eddy field by adjusting its forcing and initial conditions sose provides a dynamically consistent trajectory through phase space which is an optimal fit to the contributing observations in a least squares sense in this regard sose might be expected to give the optimal estimate of many of the ocean s properties although it does so in part by adjusting the atmospheric temperature of its forcing a side effect of this is to ensure that sst anomalies can persist in a similar manner to that of cesm the rate at which sst anomalies are damped by air sea interaction α n e t in w m 2 k 1 with positive value indicating damping of sst anomalies is an important parameter of the climate system observations indicate that α n e t varies in space and time frankignoul 1985 frankignoul and kestenare 2002 park et al 2005 and depends on the scale of the sst anomalies themselves for midlatitudes α n e t is typically 20 w m 2 k 1 frankignoul 1985 frankignoul et al 1998 and recent southern ocean estimates hausmann et al 2016a b suggest lower values over the acc this suggests weaker damping of sst anomalies over much of the southern ocean with respect to the midlatitudes based on the estimates of temperature variance in figs b 1 and b 2a and the above argument we expect our nemo experiments to exhibit higher values of α n e t than in the results of hausmann et al 2016a b sose and cesm as a starting point we would expect α n e t for our nemo models to be at least the upper bound obtained from the bulk formula which is 20 40 w m 2 k 1 for the so hausmann et al 2016b to estimate α n e t we adopt the method of hausmann et al 2016a as established by frankignoul et al 1998 and rooted in the theoretical framework of frankignoul and hasselmann 1977 based on stochastic climate models this method uses lagged covariances to separate the key role of air sea heat fluxes in generating sst anomalies from the damping feedback our estimate is given by b 1 α n e t 1 n i 1 n t t q t i δ t t t t t i δ t where t and q are monthly sst and net surface heat flux anomalies respectively an overbar is a time average over the full length of the time series and δ t is one month we construct a time series for each data source of monthly anomalies from a time average of sst and net surface heat flux over the length of that time series in contrast to hausmann et al 2016a we set n 2 as we find that using n 3 leads to noisy estimates of α n e t due to low statistical significance of t t t t i δ t at a lag of 3 months this may reflect the finite length of our timeseries in locations where student s t test indicates that the t autocorrelation is statistically insignificant at a lag of two months we revert to a n 1 estimate for α n e t we mask regions with sea ice concentration 0 15 in calculating α n e t regardless of the statistical significance of the t autocorrelation for core2nyf jra55iaf and jra55abs we use a 15 year long time series since we found the five years used for our other analyses to lead to lower statistical significance in the required co variances we take the last 15 years of core2nyf from 1973 to 1987 inclusive and the last 15 years of jra55abs from 1993 to 2007 inclusive using this same period for jra55iaf this maximises the spinup time of jra55iaf after the change from core2 to jra55 do forcing whilst also giving jra55abs five years to spinup its stronger eddy field after the start of the experiment for similar reasons we use the last 15 years of the same cesm experiments as used above in lieu of an observational estimate we use data from the climate forecast system reanalysis cfsr saha et al 2010a b which uses an ocean component with a 0 25 grid spacing at the equator extending to 0 5 globally outside of the tropics we use the full length of the cfsr record which begins in 1979 and ends in 2010 for our anomaly time series maps of our α n e t estimate for core2nyf jra55iaf and jra55abs are shown in figs b 3a c all three models have large areas of α n e t in excess of 85 w m 2 k 1 extending circumpolarly around the southern ocean the values are broadly four times the observational estimates of hausmann et al 2016a b for similar regions even close to antarctica and under the seasonal sea ice as indicated by the white shading the nemo experiment estimates remain large and mostly positive this indicates that damping of sst anomalies by net air sea heat flux in the models is much stronger than we would expect from observations core2nyf has the largest values of α n e t particularly over the indo pacific sector given the otherwise similar model configuration this must reflect some difference between the core2 and jra55 do forcing sets such as the longer time period between successive atmospheric fields the other three α n e t estimates in fig b 3d f correspond to cfsr sose and cesm they are all notably lower then for the nemo experiments as the longest time series the cfsr estimate is probably the most statistically valid hence its smoother spatial patterns which its lower resolution may also contribute to whilst α n e t remains large 60 w m 2 k 1 over much of the atlantic and indian sectors low values 20 w m 2 k 1 are found in the core of the acc over the pacific sector these values are more in line with the observation estimates of hausmann et al 2016a b that they are clearly an imprint of the dynamically distinct acc on this quantitative estimate of the heat flux feedback on sst anomalies is extremely intriguing it could be related to the strong currents tending to advect mesoscale eddies with their small scale anomaly pattern largely eastward rather than allowing clear migration north or south where their temperature would be more anomalous we leave understanding this to future work with its shortest time series the sose estimate of α n e t in fig b 3e is the noisiest with a lot of small scale structure and frequent sign changes broadly speaking and without drawing overly strong conclusions based on the short length of the time series there is good agreement with the cfsr estimate large positive values are found in the atlantic and indian sectors and most importantly this is the only other estimate that shows low values of α n e t in the core of the acc over the pacific sector as the only coupled high resolution coupled model we could reasonably expect cesm s α n e t to be somewhere between that of cfsr and the nemo experiments accordingly fig b 3f shows considerably lower values than for all the nemo experiments compared to cfsr and sose the peak values of α n e t are lower but spread over a broader area this is borne out by the zonal mean of fig b 2b which shows that the zonal mean values for cfsr sose and cesm are all very similar the general pattern of a peak at 50 60 s and lower values towards the pole where the estimate is seasonally masked due to ice cover is very similar the zonal averages for the nemo experiments are all considerably higher particularly for core2nyf however they continue to show the peak in α n e t between 50 60 s which is the general location of the minima in temperature variance as shown in fig b 2a this supports our hypothesis that the temperature variance is lower in the nemo experiment because they are overly strongly restoring the sst to the prescribed atmospheric temperature which results in overly strong damping of sst anomalies they also support the minima in temperature variance being due to where the strongest damping is present in all data sources whilst this argument is consistent with our arguments there are clearly subtleties cesm has more temperature variance and a stronger α n e t estimate than sose whilst zonal asymmetry is most distinct in the cfsr estimate there may be other effects coming into play here such as the resolution of the ocean the details of the bulk formulae in use and the formulation of the model state estimate vs coupled climate we leave a full exploration of such effects to a future publication 
23868,earlier studies suggest that the mixed layer ml temperature or sea surface temperature sst of the bay of bengal during the summer monsoon is determined primarily by air sea fluxes we use an oceanic general circulation model ogcm to show that oceanic processes also play a significant role model heat budget computations show that horizontal and vertical advection constituting the direct role of dynamics contribute significantly to the sst tendency in the western bay the eastern limit of this direct role regime is determined by downwelling rossby waves which are forced largely from the equatorial indian ocean but are modified by alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and ekman pumping along their westward path across the bay the current and as a result advection weaken behind the rossby waves to the east of the rossby wavefront the thermocline is deep permitting a deeper ml but the actual ml depth mld depends on the wind speed with salinity also playing a role in the northern bay yet there is negligible change in the sst even when mld changes significantly because the deep thermocline decouples the changes in mld and sst in contrast the shallower thermocline in the western bay limits the potential mld leading to larger changes in sst the upwelling downwelling rossby wave essentially conditions the upper ocean by decreasing increasing the potential depth of the mixed layer sst variation weakens only when the thermocline deepens during downwelling events which occur later in the western bay because rossby waves propagate westward the significant but subtle role of the rossby waves in decoupling the changes in mld and sst via downwelling is indirect unlike the direct role of advection estimated in a standard heat budget computation and has been largely ignored in earlier studies keywords sea surface temperature air sea interaction ocean atmosphere interaction rossby wave mixed layer monsoon indian ocean heat budget 1 introduction 1 1 context the indian subcontinent heats up in may following the northward movement of the sun across the equator and a heat low is established over northwest india and pakistan rao 1976 riehl 1979 the trough associated with this heat low extends across northern india into the northern bay of bengal hereafter usually referred to as the bay following the onset of the summer or southwest monsoon in june rao 1976 low pressure systems form in the northern bay during the summer monsoon and the rainfall during this season is associated with these low pressure systems that move westward or northwestward across the subcontinent rao 1976 mooley and shukla 1989 goswami 1987 what makes the development of these systems possible in the northern bay is the high sea surface temperature sst that prevails in the region shenoi et al 2002 gadgil 2003 observations suggest that sst has to exceed 28 c for convection to occur over the tropical oceans sst exceeding the threshold is a necessary condition for convection but it is not a sufficient condition gadgil et al 1984 the threshold may be lower in the atlantic ocean graham and barnett 1987 but convection does not occur in the tropical atmosphere overlying the oceans if the sst is below a certain threshold some studies also suggest that the meridional gradient of sst in the bay plays a role in the onset of convection over the central bay shankar et al 2007 this relation of the summer monsoon rainfall to the sst in the bay of bengal see for example a recent coupled model analysis by samanta et al 2018 has led to several studies analysing the processes affecting sst 1 2 earlier heat budget studies an analysis of the processes determining sst is typically done through an estimate of the heat budget of the surface mixed layer ml or the upper few tens of metres of the ocean shenoi et al 2002 showed that the climatological sst in the bay north of 6 n fig 1 remains higher than the 28 c convection threshold throughout the summer monsoon their analysis showed that the bay remains warmer than the arabian sea during the summer monsoon in spite of the bay receiving lower shortwave flux because its circulation is relatively weaker or sluggish compared to that of the arabian sea the weaker western boundary current of the bay the east india coastal current eicc shetye et al 1991 1993 1996 is unable to remove the heat from the bay while the strong somali current and the stronger meridional overturning associated with it are able to cool the arabian sea these results were confirmed by de boyer montégut et al 2007 using an oceanic general circulation model ogcm the weaker oceanic circulation leads to air sea fluxes dominating the heat budget of the top 50 m shenoi et al 2002 or the surface ml de boyer montégut et al 2007 in the bay though both these studies shenoi et al 2002 de boyer montégut et al 2007 estimated a basin averaged heat budget for the bay north of 6 n they noted an asymmetry between the northern and southern bay due to the high freshwater inflow into the northern bay a consequence of both high rainfall fig 2bb and river discharge fig 2ba the freshwater whether from the river discharge into the northern bay shetye 1993 vörösmarty et al 1998 papa et al 2012 or from the high rainfall over the northeastern bay xie et al 2006 is restricted north of 15 n fig 2bc by the prevailing circulation along the western boundary the eicc flows poleward fig 2ad during may september shetye et al 1991 1993 shankar et al 1996 mccreary et al 1993 1996 vinayachandran et al 1996 shetye and gouveia 1998 schott and mccreary 2001 mukherjee et al 2014 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2020 precluding equatorward advection of the freshwater along the indian east coast till october shankar 1998 2000 han and mccreary 2001 jensen 2001 durand et al 2007 behara and vinayachandran 2016 along the eastern boundary the current is much weaker and the equatorward advection of freshwater is therefore weak during the summer monsoon leading to the freshwater export from the bay occurring after the summer monsoon shetye et al 1996 jensen 2001 behara and vinayachandran 2016 the sea surface salinity sss tends to be higher in the southern bay fig 2bc owing to evaporation exceeding precipitation and the inflow of the saltier arabian sea high salinity water ashsw from the arabian sea murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 jensen 2001 han and mccreary 2001 han et al 2001 jain et al 2017 a recent modelling study suggests however that the source of this high salinity water entering the bay is the western equatorial indian ocean sanchez franks et al 2019 this meridional asymmetry of sss is evident in a climatology fig 2bc chatterjee et al 2012 and subsequent heat budget studies tended to account for it by using 15 n as a divider and not averaging over a domain spread across both northern and southern bay of bengal yet duncan and han 2009 who estimated the budget over 80 90 e 4 15 n vialard et al 2012 who averaged over 80 95 e 15 23 n and behara and vinayachandran 2016 who averaged over 80 89 e 15 20 n and 90 96 e 15 22 n reached the same conclusion it is the air sea fluxes that determine the variability of sst in the bay with oceanic processes playing a minor role the averaging domain used in these studies is marked in fig 1 behara and vinayachandran 2016 did however point to a zonal asymmetry in the northern bay noting that horizontal and vertical advection contribute significantly to the sst in the northwestern bay 80 89 e 15 20 n but not in the northeastern bay 90 96 e 15 22 n though li et al 2017b averaged across 15 n 83 95 e 10 20 n and studied the composites of intraseasonal events during the summer monsoon over the central bay they too concluded that the air sea fluxes constitute the dominant process in determining the sst other regional studies also tend to reach the same conclusion oceanic processes play a minor role in determining the sst in the bay schiller and godfrey 2003 waliser et al 2004 parampil et al 2010 another approach to estimating the heat budget has been based on data from moorings sengupta and ravichandran 2001 thangaprakash et al 2016 and they too conclude dominance of air sea fluxes in the heat budget such one dimensional analyses offer the advantage of higher vertical resolution and incorporation of sophisticated turbulent mixing schemes but this improvement in the simulation of vertical processes is gained at the cost of ignoring the large scale dynamics for instance these one dimensional models fail to simulate the mixed layer in the northern bay in spite of accurate forcing of freshwater and air sea fluxes because they ignore the role of horizontal advection and thermocline movement weller et al 2016 buckley et al 2020 kantha et al 2019 only a few studies show a significant role of horizontal advection in the bay vijith et al 2020 and george et al 2019 in the southeastern bay behara and vinayachandran 2016 and buckley et al 2020 in the northwestern bay and jayakumar et al 2013 in a region lying southwest of the bay 75 80 e 5 8 n rao et al 2011 and kantha et al 2019 also show the role of advection but for the transport of freshwater from its source locations across the northern bay because the in situ rainfall cannot account for the observed salinity variability at 89 e 19 n and 89 5 e 18 n respectively fewer studies have highlighted the role of thermocline movement one of them shows the role of intraseasonal rossby waves in modulating the barrier layer in the southeastern bay girishkumar et al 2011 another analyses the impact of the pacific decadal oscillation on the barrier layer in the bay at decadal time scales pang et al 2019 averages the data over 86 94 e 5 12 n and 82 94 e 16 22 n and shows that local negative or cyclonic positive or anticyclonic ekman pumping or wind stress curl deepens shallows the barrier layer in the northern southern bay observed temperature and salinity profiles in the northern bay show significant vertical movement of the thermocline thangaprakash et al 2016 but the possible role of this vertical process has been ignored in most of the literature and emphasis is given to air sea fluxes owing to the thin mixed layers thangaprakash et al 2016 do however invoke the vertical mixing noted earlier by prasad 2004 and kantha et al 2019 point to the inability of one dimensional models to simulate the vertical profile of temperature or salinity owing to their neglect of upwelling and downwelling 1 3 zonal asymmetry the high rainfall is not only restricted north of 15 n but is also much higher in the eastern bay particularly off the west coast of myanmar xie et al 2006 compared to the western bay fig 2bb an implication of the heaviest rainfall occurring over the northeastern bay the poleward eicc during the summer monsoon and the intrusion of ashsw from the arabian sea into the southwestern bay via the summer monsoon current smc shankar et al 2002 vinayachandran et al 2018 is the existence of a zonal asymmetry in the sss the sss during the summer monsoon is lower in the eastern bay compared to the western bay fig 2bc the role of the smc is evident in the sss difference between july and may which shows a high salinity tongue with the maximum salinity occurring south and east of sri lanka where the smc intrudes into the southwestern bay fig 2cd murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 1999 jensen 2001 han et al 2001 shankar et al 2002 rao et al 2006b vinayachandran et al 2013 2018 webber et al 2018 sanchez franks et al 2019 the mixed layer depth mld however is deeper during july in the eastern bay to the west of the andaman and nicobar islands compared to the western bay fig 2bd and the intrusion of ashsw does not lead to a much deeper ml in the southwestern bay during july compared to may fig 2ce suggesting that the mld in the bay is not determined by salinity alone indeed another well known zonal asymmetry in the bay arises as a consequence of dynamics westward propagation of rossby waves masked to an extent by the averaging inherent in a climatology of altimeter sea level anomalies slas fig s3aa ac ae is striking when one plots the slas for a given year say 2005 fig s3ba bc be these rossby waves propagate slowly across the bay of bengal with the speed decreasing poleward as 1 y 2 where y is the distance from the equator this decrease in speed with increasing distance from the equator implies a longer time is taken to propagate a given zonal distance indicated by the higher tilt with respect to the abscissa in the northern bay 18 n fig s3be compared to the southern bay 7 n fig s3ba the speed of the rossby wave as estimated from the tilt decreases from 20 cm s 1 at 7 n to 5 cm s 1 at 18 n these speeds match theoretical estimates see table s1 in sec s3 the slow speed of the rossby waves implies that they take a few months to cross the basin these rossby waves are forced by three mechanisms two of which ekman pumping and the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary are local to the bay the third mechanism is forcing from the equatorial indian ocean eio potemra et al 1991 yu et al 1991 mccreary et al 1993 1996 vinayachandran et al 1996 chatterjee et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 the variation of slas in the bay and the associated variation of the depth of the 25 c isotherm hereafter called d25 is therefore determined by the combined effect of these three mechanisms which we discuss in more detail in section 3 1 the rossby waves associated with these mechanisms particularly equatorial forcing deepen the thermocline in the eastern bay during the summer monsoon mccreary et al 1993 1996 shankar et al 2002 d25 is deeper during july in the eastern bay compared to the western bay and the rossby wave restricts the eastward extent of the smc the slow propagation of the rossby waves across the bay is also evident in the difference of slas and d25 between july and may with the front of the rossby wave marked roughly by the positive values of the difference for both slas fig 2cb and d25 fig 2cc 1 4 present research that the difference figure between july and may for the mld matches those for slas and d25 more than it matches that for the sss suggests that the rossby waves may play a role in determining the mld and sst in the bay we use an ogcm simulation to show that ocean dynamics plays a significant role in determining the sst in the bay of bengal this role of ocean dynamics is of two kinds first ocean dynamics directly affects sst through horizontal and vertical advection and entrainment mixing driven by the winds this direct role is captured in a standard heat budget analysis and has been shown to be important in the southeastern bay george et al 2019 vijith et al 2020 and northern bay behara and vinayachandran 2016 buckley et al 2020 kantha et al 2019 second ocean dynamics plays an indirect role by constraining the vertical space available for the development of the ml this manipulation of the vertical space is affected by rossby waves this indirect role may seem obvious but is more subtle and is not as apparent as the direct role in heat budget analyses this indirect role is more prominent in the eastern bay where the thermocline is deeper but it is seen farther westward through the summer monsoon owing to the rossby waves the rest of this paper is organised as follows we describe the data sets and model used in the paper in section 2 and the evolution of sst in the southern northern and central bay in section 3 this section also deals with the zonal asymmetry introduced by ocean dynamics via rossby waves section 4 concludes the paper 2 data and model in this section we describe the data sets and the model used in this paper the model description is followed by a formal statement of our approach the method used to estimate the heat and salt budgets and model validation 2 1 data sets the data sets used are listed in table 1 along with their sources and acronym expansions for the climatological variables plotted in fig 2 we used data for 2003 2012 when multi year records were available temperature and salinity data are from argo floats gaillard et al 2016 and the climatology of chatterjee et al 2012 sst data are from ghrsst sla data from aviso currents from oscar net heat flux from tropflux kumar et al 2012 precipitation from trmm wind speed and direction from quikscat and river runoff from sage vörösmarty et al 1998 the mld is defined as the depth at which the density increase from the surface corresponds to a 0 5 c decrease in temperature shenoi et al 2004 shankar et al 2016 and the isothermal layer depth ild is defined as the depth at which temperature is 0 5 c lower than the sst the barrier layer thickness blt is the difference of the ild and mld 2 2 model we use the modular ocean model mom griffies 2009 the version used is mom4p1 the model has a free surface and is hydrostatic and volume conserving the model set up used in this paper is from mukherjee et al 2018 which builds on earlier work kurian and vinayachandran 2007 chatterjee et al 2013 2017 shankar et al 2016 and has been used to study the circulation of the andaman sea and its role in linking the eio to the bay of bengal chatterjee et al 2017 and the eicc mukherjee et al 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 the model domain has a horizontal resolution of 0 1 0 1 and it extends from 30 120 e and from 30 s 30 n the model has 40 vertical levels with 25 levels in the top 200 m and a vertical resolution of 5 m in the top 60 m the bottom topography is based on the modified 2 bathymetry of sindhu et al 2007 the narrow channel between india and sri lanka remains closed in the model the channels connecting the red sea and persian gulf with the arabian sea are broadened and deepened to allow flow through them and the south china sea is masked out of the model domain the minimum ocean depth is set to 15 m and single isolated land points are removed the no slip boundary condition is applied along the continental land boundaries along the open boundaries in the south and east a sponge layer of 3 5 is applied following chatterjee et al 2013 sss is relaxed to climatological values from chatterjee et al 2012 with a time scale of 30 days to avoid salinity drift a summary of model physical processes is given in table 2 and data sources used to force the model are listed in table 3 the value of smagorinsky mixing coefficient for laplacian biharmonic viscosity is 0 06 0 002 with velocity scale 0 04 0 005 m s 1 to avoid extra mixing within the stratified water column local mixing due to double diffusion is not included a five point filter is used to smooth the boundary layer diffusivity in order to remove grid cell noise a consequence of the high temporal frequency of the forcing from sst and mld the model mld is defined as the depth at which the buoyancy difference with respect to the surface is equal to 0 0003 m s 2 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 the definition of ild and blt are as for the observations the ild is the depth at which temperature is 0 5 c lower than the sst and the model blt is the difference between the model ild and mld the model is spun up for 10 years from a state of rest with climatological temperature and salinity fields from chatterjee et al 2012 and daily climatological forcing fields for 2000 2008 following this 10 year climatological spin up the model is integrated using interannual winds it is forced by quikscat winds from january 2000 to december 2008 and a switch is made to ascat winds from january 2009 we use the model results from 2003 onwards i e after 13 years of spin up 2 3 our approach though the climatology observations and model does show the westward propagating rossby wave fig s3 a the rossby waves are more clear when the slas are plotted for a specific year fig s3b we pick 2005 because it was a normal or neutral year with respect to the large scale climate modes like el niño or la niña or the indian ocean dipole iod saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 the sources of information on these events are the websites of the bureau of meteorology australia http www bom gov au climate iod and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd enso past events html the same behaviour is seen in other years but with some differences owing to the impact of these major climate modes on the zonal winds over the eio and the bay gadgil et al 2004 further analysis is carried out for a specific year 2005 instead of the climatology in order to unravel the effect of the slow westward propagation of rossby waves on the variation of sst we avoid averaging over large areas we estimate the heat budget for three zonal sections figs 1 2 one each representing the southern bay 7 n central bay 12 n and northern bay 18 n in addition we quantify the contribution of different processes to the heat budget at seven locations spread over the bay of bengal fig 1 table 4 to show how the sst varies in different parts of the basin and analyse the role of ocean dynamics in determining the variability we refer to these seven locations as model moorings because we obtain a vertical profile at each of these locations as shown in table 4 these model mooring locations mm locations are numbered mm1 mm7 and they are located on the zonal sections mm1 mm2 and mm3 are located on the 7 n section mm4 and mm5 on the 12 n section and mm6 and mm7 on the 18 n section that these locations are spread over the basin and not localised to the eastern bay like the rama moorings mcphaden et al 2009 allows us to distinguish not only between the northern mm6 mm7 central mm4 mm5 and southern mm1 mm3 bay but also between the eastern mm3 mm5 and mm7 and western mm1 mm2 mm4 and mm6 bay 2 4 estimation of heat and salt budgets to analyse the role of different processes in the heat budget of the surface mixed layer we use the method of vialard and delecluse 1998 and kurian and vinayachandran 2007 the model mld is extended to the base of respective grid cell for estimating the heat budget the tendency of the vertically averaged ml temperature t ml is given by kurian and vinayachandran 2007 1 t t ml q loss h 0 q abs ρ 0 c p h atmospheric forcing 1 h h 0 u x t d z h 0 v y t d z horizontal advection 1 h w h t h t ml vertical advection 1 h h t h t h t ml k z t h ρ 0 c p entrainment with 2 h 0 if t h 0 1 if t h 0 in eq 1 t h u v w k ρ 0 and c p are the potential temperature mld zonal velocity meridional velocity vertical velocity coefficient of vertical diffusion density and the specific heat capacity respectively q loss is the heat loss from the surface as turbulent and longwave fluxes and q abs is the shortwave radiation absorbed by seawater we use k 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 but a sensitivity test that varied k over two orders of magnitude in the range 10 6 10 4 m 2 s 1 shows only changes in the magnitude of the entrainment term but these changes have no impact on the results the horizontal diffusion makes a comparatively minor contribution to the heat budget and is therefore neglected following vialard and delecluse 1998 the entrainment consists of two terms the first entrainment term in eq 1 is the entrainment from below the ml and it is non zero only when the ml deepens eq 2 the second entrainment term is the vertical diffusion at the base of the ml and it is independent of whether the ml deepens or shallows the tendency term on the left hand side of eq 1 is estimated as the sum of the contributing process terms on the right hand side the salt budget is estimated in a similar manner the tendency of the vertically averaged ml salinity s ml is given by 3 t s ml s 0 e p h atmospheric forcing 1 h h 0 u x s d z h 0 v y s d z horizontal advection 1 h w h s h s ml vertical advection 1 h h t h s h s ml k z s h entrainment r residual where h is given by eq 2 s s 0 e and p are the salinity surface salinity evaporation and precipitation respectively as noted earlier the surface salinity in the model is relaxed to the monthly climatology of chatterjee et al 2012 sss relaxation provides an internal freshwater source in the model simulation and accounts for the absence of river discharge in the model forcing an interannual simulation with river discharge is difficult owing to the unavailability of accurate river discharge data the residual term r in eq 3 calculated as the difference between the salt tendency and sum of contributions of atmospheric forcing advection and entrainment terms gives an estimate of the effect of sss relaxation hereafter the ml temperature t ml and salinity s ml are referred to as sst and sss respectively 2 5 model validation the residual r is significant and the salinity difference between model and observations is high only in the northern bay where the river discharge is high fig 2ba and the shelf is broad briefly the main reasons for the larger model observation difference in sss are the short scale both spatial and temporal changes in salinity in the northern bay hormann et al 2016 mackinnon et al 2016 lucas et al 2016 sarkar et al 2016 shroyer et al 2016 jampana et al 2019 and the coarse sampling which implies considerable extrapolation in the preparation of the gridded data sets and therefore a high standard deviation associated with the observed sss whether in a climatology chatterjee et al 2012 or in argo based maps for a given year benshila et al 2014 a more detailed discussion of the sss relaxation and the simulation of sss is given in sec s2 though mom has been used and validated extensively for earlier indian ocean studies including for the bay of bengal kurian and vinayachandran 2007 behara and vinayachandran 2016 chatterjee et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 we validate the model performance in sec s1 by comparing the evolution of the relevant model variables over the basin and at the seven mm locations during the summer monsoon to the observations the model observation differences are similar to those seen in the literature and the simulation errors for sla cheng et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2017 sst behara and vinayachandran 2016 li et al 2017b samanta et al 2018 sss vinayachandran et al 2012 behara and vinayachandran 2016 akhil et al 2016 chowdary et al 2016 jensen et al 2016 sandeep and pant 2019 and mld vialard et al 2012 li et al 2017a are comparable therefore the observation model differences do not preclude the use of the model to analyse the processes affecting sst and the model simulation is good enough for the purpose of showing the role of the westward propagating rossby waves and to throw light on the indirect role of ocean dynamics in determining sst 3 role of oceanic processes in the mixed layer heat budget in this section we apply the above method for estimating heat and salt budgets to the three zonal sections and the seven mm locations we begin with the analysis for the southern bay where the role of salinity is limited and therefore that of dynamics is more direct and evident the role of salinity is strongest in the northern bay which is discussed next we conclude the section with a brief description of the results for the central bay the key physical process involved in the indirect role of ocean dynamics is the rossby wave which affects the depth of the thermocline therefore before presenting the heat budget analysis we provide a brief description of the rossby waves as simulated by the model during april october 2005 at 7 n 12 n and 18 n 3 1 rossby wave events as noted earlier in section 1 3 the rossby waves in the bay are forced by three mechanisms one of which is not local to the bay this remote mechanism involves equatorial kelvin waves forced by zonal winds in the eio mccreary et al 1996 two strong downwelling sla events associated with eastward jets have been shown to occur during may and november in the eio wyrtki 1973 o brien and hurlburt 1974 mccreary et al 1993 1996 han et al 1999 chatterjee et al 2017 owing to a dominant semi annual cycle luyten and roemmich 1982 jensen 1993 han et al 2011 the equatorial kelvin waves reflect off the west coast of sumatra leading to the propagation of energy along the eastern boundary and the radiation of rossby waves moore 1968 into the bay mccreary et al 1993 1996 analysis of the downwelling sla peak associated with the eastward jet during april july fig 3aa shows however that the broad semi annual peak fig 3ab includes two upwelling bursts with a period of 30 days fig 3ac that lower the slas between three downwelling peaks hence periodicities shorter than 30 days often contribute almost as much to the slas in the eastern eio fig 3ac as does the semi annual cycle fig 3ab documented in the literature jensen 1993 han et al 2011 counting such upwelling and downwelling bursts separately leads to 11 equatorial kelvin wave events during april october 2005 fig 3a these 11 equatorial kelvin events can be tracked along the eastern boundary of the bay as well but some of the weaker events do not extend all the way to 18 n fig 3b the slower speed of the rossby waves implies however that we have to consider six earlier equatorial kelvin waves k01 k06 forced during october 2004 to march 2005 fig s8 and their propagation along the eastern boundary fig s9 to complete the set of 17 rossby waves seen during april october 2005 along the three zonal sections fig s10 the equatorially forced slas propagate into the bay each of the 14 rossby events during april october 2005 at 7 n is denoted by an event marker a slanted dashed line in the sla hovmöller plot fig 4a these event markers also overlaid on the current fig 4aa and ekman pumping fig 4bb bc are used in the rest of this paper to indicate the time of arrival of a rossby wave at a given location all these events are numbered in sequence according to the time of origin table 5 the six character event name includes the latitude first two characters 07 for 7 n r third character signifying rossby wave and separating the latitude and the sequence the sequence number fourth and fifth characters 03 for the third event and u or d last character depending on whether the event favours upwelling or downwelling respectively to avoid clutter only the last three characters are used in fig 4a the westward propagation of the equatorially forced rossby waves from the eastern boundary is also seen at 12 n fig s7 table 6 and 18 n fig 5a table 7 the impact of these equatorially forced rossby waves is therefore felt all over the bay and model studies show that it has a stronger impact on the circulation in the andaman sea and the bay than do the winds along the eastern boundary mccreary et al 1996 chatterjee et al 2017 the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary do however force coastal kelvin waves that radiate westward into the bay as rossby waves fig 4ba mccreary et al 1993 1996 which complement the equatorially forced rossby waves at 7 n fig 4 table 5 12 n fig s7 table 6 and 18 n fig 5 table 7 for the bay the rossby waves forced from the eio and by the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary are free waves but these free rossby waves are modified by the rossby waves forced by ekman pumping this superposition of free and forced rossby waves along a zonal section can change the phase speed and therefore the tilt of the event markers along the section a change in the slope of the event marker is also seen on occasions in the western bay at 7 n fig 4ab because the eastward smc fig 4aa opposes the rossby wave slowing it down greatbatch 1985 vinayachandran et al 1999 cyclonic anticyclonic ekman pumping favours upwelling downwelling and tends to shallow deepen the thermocline this effect is carried westward by rossby waves implying that the ekman pumping at a given location has an impact on the slas to its west later in the season according to the literature ekman pumping is largely cyclonic positive over the bay during the summer monsoon but with the magnitude varying across the basin mccreary et al 1993 1996 the cyclonic ekman pumping is stronger in the western bay particularly in the southwestern bay to the east of sri lanka vinayachandran et al 1999 and it gives way to anticyclonic negative ekman pumping east of 90 e fig 2ac sil and chakraborty 2015 analysis shows however considerable patchiness in the ekman pumping field in both space and time along the zonal section at 7 n fig 4bb this patchiness is largely due to a significant contribution to the ekman pumping from periods shorter than 30 days fig 4bd but zonal variation is also seen at higher periods fig 4bc the patchiness in ekman pumping is also seen at 12 n fig s7b the spatial patchiness is less at 18 n where the ekman pumping tends to have the same sign along the zonal section but it still shows short period bursts in time fig 5b this patchy ekman pumping field is part of the wind field used to force the model therefore it is not surprising that the resulting short scale features in the slas can be associated with the patches in ekman pumping along all three zonal sections figs 4 s7 5 and tables 5 6 7 the sla signal at a given location at say 7 n is therefore due to the combined effect of all three forcing mechanisms the slas due to alongshore winds add to the equatorial slas at the eastern boundary at 7 n and the resultant slas that propagate westward into the bay are modified by the local ekman pumping all along the zonal section for example in a constructive superposition at 7 n downwelling favourable alongshore winds at the eastern boundary enhance the downwelling slas associated with the equatorial kelvin wave k09 event 07r09d fig 3 in the first half of may as these downwelling slas propagate into the bay they are further enhanced by downwelling favourable ekman pumping at 87 e in the first half of july case c09a in fig 4ab bb table 5 examples in which the forcing mechanisms superimpose destructively include the upwelling kelvin waves k06 and k12 fig 3 for k06 the alongshore winds in the first half of march favour upwelling and enhance the upwelling slas but the ekman pumping along 7 n favours downwelling fig 4bb and the upwelling slas associated with rossby wave 07r06u are weakened till early may case c06a in fig 4bb later the upwelling slas are enhanced fig 4a by upwelling favourable ekman pumping just west of 86 e case c06b in fig 4bb for k12 the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary fig 4ba and ekman pumping fig 4bb favour downwelling which overwhelms the equatorially forced upwelling leading to the event 07r12u propagating initially as a weak downwelling wave along 7 n fig 4a the slas associated with 07r12u change sign only when ekman pumping becomes upwelling favourable at 92 e in july case c12a in figs 4ab bb table 5 a similar destructive superposition occurs for the downwelling kelvin wave k07 along 12 n fig 3 the alongshore winds and ekman pumping near the eastern boundary favour upwelling fig s7 and therefore lower the downwelling slas forced from the equator in the second half of april subsequently however as this weakened downwelling rossby wave 12r07d propagates westward the downwelling slas are strengthened by ekman pumping at 93 e in the second half of may and at 87 e in the second half of july case c07a in fig s7 table 6 examples at 18 n include k05 and k06 the upwelling wave k05 figs s8 s9 s10 is enhanced by alongshore winds but weakened by downwelling favourable ekman pumping case c05a in fig 5ba as it propagates along 18 n figs 5ab s10c and the slas are positive from early april to early august fig 5ab for k06 the equatorially forced upwelling fig 5ab is enhanced by alongshore winds fig 5ba and subsequently weakened by downwelling favourable ekman pumping from the eastern boundary in mid march till 90 e in early june case c06a in fig 5bb before upwelling favourable ekman pumping farther west 87 e fig 5bb strengthens the upwelling slas in august case c06b in fig 5a table 7 tables 5 7 document more such cases for the 17 events at 7 n 12 n and 18 n respectively the corresponding figures for the slas alongshore winds and ekman pumping are fig 4 fig s7 and fig 5 respectively since rossby waves are usually considered to have long wavelengths and low frequencies their existence at the seasonal time scales has been extensively studied see for example mccreary et al 1993 1996 shankar et al 2002 but their existence at intraseasonal periods including the periods less than 30 days merits a discussion as shown above equatorial kelvin waves and associated rossby waves are evident at these high frequencies in the model slas and the spatial scale of these rossby waves is much less than the large scale usually associated with rossby waves at these high frequencies energy tends to bend down in the form of beams that owe their existence to the excitation of high order baroclinic vertical normal modes mccreary 1980 1984 1985 nethery and shankar 2007 mukherjee et al 2018 these high order modes are important for the current but not for the sea level which is determined primarily by the first two baroclinic modes mukherjee et al 2018 therefore the slas are seen to propagate eastward along the equator poleward along the eastern boundary and then westward into the bay even at these short periods the horizontal length scale associated with these short period sla features is also small westward propagation of equatorially forced slas into the bay in the 55 110 day band has been documented in altimeter data from the north indian ocean vialard et al 2009 girishkumar et al 2011 but these data do not have the temporal resolution to map as well the variability at periods shorter than 30 days downward bending of energy is suggested by the observed impact of the madden julian oscillation madden and julian 1971 1972 in argo data from the deep waters of the equatorial pacific ocean matthews et al 2007 in moored acoustic doppler current profilers adcps data in the equatorial indian ocean pujiana and mcphaden 2020 and the existence of isolated sub surface current cores in vertical profiles from adcps off the indian west amol et al 2012 2014 and east mukherjee et al 2014 coasts the association of the high sla patches in fig 4 fig s7 and fig 5 with the short scale bursts in ekman pumping are simulated well by the model because it involves only the two gravest baroclinic modes mukherjee et al 2018 in the rest of this section we show the effect of these rossby waves on the heat budget and sst in the bay 3 2 southern bay 3 2 1 zonal section at 7 n the westward propagation of rossby waves is striking in the heat budget hovmöller diagrams for the zonal section at 7 n fig 6a during april the sun warms the southern bay and the net air sea flux is into the ocean fig 6ab because the net shortwave flux is high fig 6ba and the latent heat flux is low fig 6bb owing to weak winds fig 6bc yet even in april when the dominance of air sea fluxes fig 6ab is evident horizontal advection fig 6ad makes an important contribution to the sst tendency fig 6aa near the eastern boundary and to the west of the event marker for event 07r06u an upwelling rossby wave fig 4 table 5 the horizontal advection of heat tends to occur in bursts that transport eastward warm or cold water this eastward transport by the smc is evident in the orientation of these red warming and blue cooling bands fig 6ad these bursts tend to terminate roughly at some event markers the significant contribution of horizontal advection in april is limited to the west of the rossby events 07r06u and 07r07d fig 6ad this weakening of horizontal advection east of the event marker is seen again later during the summer monsoon to the east of the strong rossby events 07r09d and 07r11d the high frequency upwelling events fig 4ad superimposed on the low frequency downwelling fig 4ac weaken the seasonal downwelling fig 4ab between the high frequency downwelling events 07r07d 07r09d and 07r11d which tend to enhance the seasonal downwelling the heat budget analysis shows that the contribution of horizontal advection weakens significantly to the east of the event marker for 07r09d in may june and 07r11d in august september fig 6ad a similar weakening east of these event markers is also seen for vertical advection fig 6ae and entrainment fig 6af as a result the direct contribution of oceanic processes to the sst tendency tends to terminate at the event markers for the strong downwelling rossby events and is weaker to their east fig 6ac since the rossby waves propagate westward the contribution of oceanic processes tends to be restricted farther and farther west as the season progresses for example this eastern limit is 97 e during the second half of may event 07r09d and shifts from 93 e at the end of may 07r09d to 84 e by mid september 07r12u because of the westward propagation of multiple rossby wave events the contribution of air sea fluxes fig 6ab is weaker than that of oceanic processes fig 6bc after april but these fluxes still warm the ml to the west of the events markers for 07r11d and 07r12u during august fig 6ab as with oceanic processes the contribution of even air sea fluxes to the sst tendency is weak in the eastern bay fig 6ab therefore the eastern limit of the regime of high sst variation shifts farther west as the season progresses fig 6aa though the salt budget in the southern bay is dominated by oceanic processes there is a similar westward shift in the strong advective contribution to the sss tendency fig s11 a since these oceanic processes horizontal and vertical advection and entrainment are explicitly accounted for in eqs 1 and 3 their contribution to the sst and sss tendencies is captured in these budget estimates figs 6 s11 we refer to this contribution of oceanic processes as the direct role of dynamics in the heat budget this direct contribution of oceanic processes is significant to the west of the rossby wave events because of the large contribution they make to the sst and sss tendencies and it is this direct role that is referred to in the earlier heat budget studies behara and vinayachandran 2016 rao et al 2011 thangaprakash et al 2016 pang et al 2019 buckley et al 2020 this direct contribution shows up in the warming and cooling bursts evident to the east of the event markers for the strong downwelling events a careful examination of the advection components shows that a combination of both zonal and meridional advection contributes to these bursts east of the event markers i e behind the rossby waves this direct contribution of horizontal advection is weak figs 6ad s11ad because the zonal current is weak behind the rossby wave fig 4aa mccreary et al 1993 1996 and the strong advection of heat therefore tends to terminate roughly at the event markers fig 6ad a similar weakening east of the event markers occurs for the air sea fluxes fig 6ab vertical advection fig 6ae and entrainment fig 6af leading to a weak variation of sst fig 6aa bd we show below however that ocean dynamics plays a subtler indirect role to the east of these event markers and it is this indirect role of dynamics that leads to the weak variation of sst in the eastern bay where the downwelling effect of the rossby waves is first felt 3 2 2 model moorings at 7 n to bring out this indirect role of ocean dynamics we analyse the processes at three mm locations on the zonal section at 7 n we start with mm3 the easternmost location fig 2 because rossby waves propagate westward sla at mm3 tends to increase from april following the passage of event 07r06u till early july owing to the downwelling associated with event 07r07d and 07r09d figs 4ab 7bb the small decrease in early april is due to upwelling favourable ekman pumping weakening the downwelling due to 07r07d case c07a in fig 4b and the flattening of the sla curve in the first half of june fig 7bb is due to event 07r08u the thermocline s movement mirrors this change in sla the correlation between sla and d25 is 0 9 which is significant at the 99 level d25 at mm3 deepens from 60 m at the beginning of april to over 100 m by the mid june fig 7ba subsequently sla and d25 oscillate as alternating upwelling and downwelling rossby waves pass through mm3 in the first half of july sla falls d25 shallows to 90 m owing to event 07r10u then rises d25 deepens from mid july till mid august owing to event 07r11d then falls d25 shallows in the second half of august owing to event 07r12u then rises d25 deepens through september owing to event 07r15d before falling d25 shallowing again in october owing to event 07r16u the magnitude of these deepening and shallowing events depends on the strength of the rossby wave but each such wave leaves its mark on the sla fig 7bb and d25 fig 7ba at mm3 the thermocline remains deep however with d25 shallowing above its depth level of 1 april only briefly in the first half of september and in mid october the mld does not necessarily follow the movement of d25 for example it alternately shallows deepens and shallows in april even as d25 deepens fig 7ba a barrier layer 10 25 m thick forms during april figs 7ba s11bc when the ml shallows and d25 deepens but it is eroded in may when the ml deepens even as d25 shallows a thicker bl 40 m forms again in mid july when the ml shallows rapidly by over 40 m from 80 m to 40 m the corresponding decrease in d25 is 20 m from 110 m to 90 m half the change in the mld these large changes in mld are not reflected in the sst at mm3 fig 7bc which increases owing to a positive net air sea flux fig 7bc and a heating burst due to horizontal advection fig 7bf in april but decreases during may july before the sst curve flattens out from mid july to october the weak variation in sst during this period is mirrored by weak contributions to the sst tendency fig 7bd from air sea fluxes fig 7bd horizontal and vertical advection fig 7bf and entrainment fig 7be the three sharp cooling bursts in the sst tendency during this period fig 7bd are driven by horizontal 31 may 3 june and 7 13 july and vertical 30 july 3 august advection fig 7bf entrainment tends to be weak at mm3 in spite of strong wind bursts fig 7be to which the ml responds fig 7ba this relation between the mld and wind speed is apparent in the high wavelet coherence between them fig 7bg this weak entrainment is due to the deep thermocline the mld can change by a few tens of metres owing to a weakening of the wind as it does in mid july fig 7ba without a corresponding change in sst fig 7bd because the deep thermocline implies that a thick barrier layer forms as the ml shallows fig 7ba when the wind strengthens again after 18 july implying an increase in the turbulent kinetic energy input to the ml it deepens and the barrier layer erodes but this shallowing and deepening of the ml is accompanied by but a small change in sst fig 7c the deep ml also implies a weak sst response to air sea fluxes because the heat flux into the ocean has to be distributed over a thicker ml the deep thermocline that enables this decoupling between mld and sst is due to rossby waves whose westward propagation implies that the equatorially forced downwelling is felt later in the season in the western bay mm2 87 e lies close to the eastern limit of the strong smc fig 4aa shankar et al 2002 2007 therefore the intraseasonal bursts associated with the horizontal advection of heat rao et al 2006a are felt more strongly there figs 6ad 7af compared to mm3 figs 6ad 7bf but not as strongly as farther west at mm1 figs 6ad s12f the upwelling rossby event 07r06u and ekman pumping shallow the thermocline at mm2 till mid may following which the thermocline then alternately deepens and shallows owing to events 07r07d 07r08u 07r09d 07r10u and 07r11d figs 4ab bb 7aa the sst tendency and the contributions of air sea fluxes fig 7ad and advection fig 7af weaken when the thermocline deepens during 07r11d and strengthen when the thermocline shallows 07r08u and 07r10u but a persistent near zero sst tendency is seen only from 25 august to the end of september fig 7ad when the deep thermocline fig 7aa and high slas fig 7ab forced by event 07r11d persist for over a month during the other two downwelling events the deepening of the thermocline is short lived and it shallows rapidly owing to the upwelling events that follow them yet as noted above the significant shallowing and deepening of the thermocline due to these short period rossby events is reflected in the strengthening and weakening of the horizontal advection of heat farther west at mm1 the smc fig 4aa and the bursts in horizontal advection of heat are stronger figs 6 s12f therefore the sst tendency at mm1 is stronger during the downwelling events 07r07d and 07r09d fig s12d compared to mm2 fig 7ad it is only after 15 september when event 07r11d fig 4ab forces a deepening of the thermocline that lasts till mid october fig s12a that the sst tendency and the contribution of air sea fluxes fig s12d and advection weaken fig s12f thus in addition to its direct role via advection ocean dynamics plays an indirect role in determining the sst via the shallowing and deepening of the thermocline associated with rossby waves in this indirect role as discussed above the ocean essentially takes itself out of the heat budget equation the terms on the right hand side rhs of eq 1 are nearly zero when the thermocline is deep leading to a near zero sst tendency horizontal advection of heat weakens significantly behind the rossby wave figs 6ad 7bf owing to the weakening of the zonal current behind it fig 4aa while vertical advection figs 6ae 7bf and entrainment figs 6af 7be weaken owing to the deep thermocline fig 7ba the deep thermocline by permitting the existence of deep mls fig 7ba also leads to a significant weakening of the contribution of air sea fluxes fig 6ab 7bd to the sst tendency figs 6aa 7bd this indirect role is therefore felt more strongly in the eastern bay because the thermocline is deeper there in contrast the direct role of advection is more strongly manifest in the western bay owing to the strong smc fig 6ad and the shallower thermocline figs 7aa s12a it is only during the downwelling rossby wave events that the thermocline in the western bay deepens enough for the indirect role to be seen and a near zero sst tendency therefore occurs for shorter durations figs 7ad s12d during these downwelling pulses 3 3 northern bay 3 3 1 zonal section at 18 n the northern bay is narrower than the southern bay the basin width is 11 at 18 n compared to 15 at 7 n figs 1 2 5 another major difference is the freshwater inflow into the northern bay fig 2ba bb and observations show that this high freshwater inflow exercises a significant control on the mld and leads to the formation of a barrier layer vinayachandran et al 2002 thadathil et al 2007 sengupta et al 2016 this freshwater inflow is not uniform however and the sss can change by 1 psu over just a few km and within a few hours in the northern bay hormann et al 2016 mackinnon et al 2016 lucas et al 2016 sarkar et al 2016 shroyer et al 2016 jampana et al 2019 with instabilities and turbulent fluxes driving the mixing in these dynamically rich salinity fronts that have a high salinity gradient sarkar et al 2016 it is not surprising that the vertical turbulent fluxes can vary by an order of magnitude over a few km in the northern bay adams et al 2019 owing to their emphasis on the high variability observed in the salinity at short spatial and temporal scales these studies emphasise the dominance of freshwater influence in the northern bay and the role of thermocline movement is ignored yet the mooring data whether at 90 e 18 n thangaprakash et al 2016 or 89 5 e 18 n kantha et al 2019 show a significant vertical movement of the thermocline and simulations with a one dimensional model cannot reproduce the observed vertical profile owing to its inability to account for the upwelling and downwelling kantha et al 2019 we show below that downwelling forced by dynamical processes also plays an important role in determining the evolution of the mixed layer and barrier layer and therefore of sst as in the southern bay this downwelling is forced not just by local ekman pumping as suggested by pang et al 2019 but also remotely from the eio the rossby waves at 18 n fig 5aa restrict the contribution of horizontal advection to the northwestern bay from 27 april to 25 july the rossby wave associated with event 18r03u propagates from 90 e to 87 e table 7 and the strong cooling and warming by horizontal advection are confined to the west of this wave and terminate roughly at the event markers fig 8ad later in the season the eastern limit of the effect of oceanic processes is constrained by event 18r06u figs 5aa 8ad table 7 this bounding role of the rossby waves is striking even in the sss field which shows a higher lower salinity to the west east of the marker for event 18r06u fig 8be yet since the freshwater inflow into the northern bay is biased towards the east irrespective of whether the source is rainfall fig 2bb or river discharge fig 2ba horizontal advection contributes significantly to the salt budget even in the northeastern bay fig 9a 3 3 2 model moorings at 18 n that the rossby waves limit the effect of horizontal advection on the sst tendency to their west fig 8ad suggests that the indirect role of ocean dynamics should be evident at mm7 in the northeastern bay the current is weak at mm7 table 4 which lies on the slope at the eastern boundary of the northern bay fig 1 at mm7 d25 deepens from less than 30 m on 1 april to over 90 m on 30 june fig 10ba owing to downwelling driven partly from the eio kelvin waves k07 k11 and partly by downwelling favourable alongshore winds at the eastern boundary figs 5aa 10be d25 remains deeper than 75 m till the end of october fig 10ba the deep thermocline permits the existence of a deep ml but the ml shallows because sss decreases through april october as a consequence of horizontal advection of freshwater during april may fig 9ad and rainfall thereafter figs 9ab bb hence a thick barrier layer is seen at mm7 fig 9ba c yet as is evident from the high coherence between the mld and wind speed during july september fig 10bg the local winds play an important role in determining the mld even after the lowering of sss at mm7 the thick barrier layer and deep thermocline imply negligible contributions from vertical advection figs 8ae 10bf and entrainment figs 8af 10be to the sst tendency the weakening of the zonal current behind the rossby waves also implies weak horizontal advection to the east of the event markers fig 8ad 10bf therefore the sst responds directly to the air sea fluxes during july october fig 10ad but the sst changes little during this period even though the net flux changes as much as or more than it does during may june fig 10ac the indirect role of ocean dynamics is therefore evident in the northeastern bay just as it was in the southeastern bay but with the inflow of freshwater from rainfall and rivers providing an additional mechanism for shallowing the ml this subtle indirect role is seen in the observations as well at a nearby location 90 e 18 n fig 4 of thangaprakash et al 2016 but thangaprakash et al 2016 do not invoke vertical processes other than mixing prasad 2004 the role of upwelling and downwelling in determining the vertical profile of temperature is however noted by kantha et al 2019 at mm6 in the northwestern bay horizontal advection makes a significant contribution to the sst tendency figs 8ad 10af behara and vinayachandran 2016 and the shallower thermocline leads to a thinner barrier layer even when the ml shallows considerably in response to a decrease in salinity or a weakening of the winds fig 10a thus as in the southwestern bay the direct role of advection is prominent in the northwestern bay fig 8ad e 3 4 central bay the central bay differs from the southern bay because the strong zonal current at 7 n fig 4aa is absent at 12 n fig s7aa it also differs from the northern bay because the freshwater inflow is much lower at 12 n compared to 18 n fig 2ba b yet the central bay also shows the same difference in the higher contribution of oceanic processes to the sst tendency in the western bay compared to the eastern bay fig 11a the thermocline is deeper at mm5 in the east central bay fig s14ba compared to mm4 in the west central bay fig s14aa and the indirect role of ocean dynamics is therefore evident in the weak sst tendency at mm5 and its match with the air sea fluxes fig s14bd for completeness the salinity budget is also presented in fig s15 4 discussion before presenting the summary and conclusions section 4 2 we distinguish the westward propagations identified as rossby waves in section 3 1 from eddies section 4 1 this distinction is made to show that rossby waves contribute even at the short spatial and temporal scales period less than 30 days usually associated with eddies in the literature 4 1 rossby waves and eddies the indirect role of dynamics in the heat budget via modulation of the thermocline depth and the restriction of the direct role to the western bay during the summer monsoon is primarily due to the seasonal downwelling associated with large scale rossby waves figs 4ac s7ac 5ac the equatorially forced kelvin waves can be tracked along the eio fig 3a and the eastern boundary fig 3b adding to this effect of equatorial forcing at the eastern boundary fig 3b is the forcing by alongshore winds at 7 n fig 4ba 12 n fig s7ba and 18 n fig 5ba the sla response to the combined forcing by equatorial waves and alongshore winds propagates westward into the bay figs 4a s7 a 5a we have identified the westward propagations from the eastern boundary as free rossby waves which are modified by ekman pumping figs 4bb s7bb 5bb as they propagate westward into the bay figs 4ab s7ab 5ab what is striking however is that the equatorial forcing includes not only the low frequency component associated often with the dominant semi annual cycle figs 4ac s7ac 5ac jensen 1993 han et al 2011 but also a high frequency component with period less than 30 days figs 4ad s7ad 5ad likewise the high frequency component is comparable to the low frequency component for the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and for ekman pumping figs 4b s7b 5b this significant forcing at periods much shorter than the seasonal cycle leads not only to short temporal scales in the response but also to short spatial scales these short scale rossby waves play a significant role in modulating the thermocline depth in the bay with alternating downwelling and upwelling bursts evident even at periods shorter than 30 days figs 4ad s7ad 5ad it is easy to mistake these short spatial scales for eddies but the events identified in section 3 1 are clearly rossby waves for the following three reasons first the westward propagation associated with these short period and short spatial scale features occurs at the same speed as the rossby waves figs 3a 4a s7 a 5a such a uniform propagation speed is not characteristic of eddies cheng et al 2018 state that eddies with a periodicity ranging from 30 120 days are generated in the central bay and then propagate southwestward another detailed study of eddies in the bay is by chen et al 2012 who estimate speed ranges of 2 5 cm s 1 2 9 cm s 1 and 2 11 cm s 1 for eddies in the northern north of 15 n central 10 15 n and southern south of 10 n respectively these speed ranges do not match the speeds estimated from the hovmöller diagrams of slas at 7 n fig 4a 12 n fig s7 a and 18 n fig 5a and chen et al 2012 concluded that the eddy speeds estimated by them are much less than the speed associated with rossby waves therefore it seems reasonable to interpret even the high frequency westward propagations seen in the bay as rossby waves because they can be traced back to the eio second the striking collapse of the zonal current behind the rossby waves figs 4aa s7aa 5aa mccreary et al 1993 1996 is a characteristic feature of these waves as shown by mccreary 1977 a rossby wave propagating into a uniform ekman drift forced by meridional winds would leave behind it a balance between the meridional pressure gradient and the wind stress in the inviscid system there will be no current behind the wave inclusion of friction weakly modifies the solution but the current still weakens significantly behind the wave eddies do not interact with an opposing zonal flow in a similar manner suggesting again that the westward propagation seen in the hovmöller diagrams figs 4a s7a 5a is due to rossby waves with a much weaker contribution from eddies which are expected to be advected at least partly by the mean flow that said a clarification is required because mccreary 1977 derived the above solution for a wind forcing that was switched on and then kept constant it is known that the response to a switched on wind forcing differs from the response to a periodic wind forcing because the latter solution has a critical latitude with only rossby waves existing equatorward of this latitude and poleward propagating kelvin waves poleward of it moore 1968 mccreary 1977 1980 1985 we argue that this distinction must however be applied with caution because a purely periodic forcing and the associated periodic response are not seen in the real ocean as is evident from a time longitude plot of the semi annual wavelet power of the model sla field in the eio fig s16 the strength of the semi annual harmonic the strongest of the seasonal periodicities noted in the eio jensen 1993 han et al 2011 varies over time during the period of interest the wavelet power in this band drops sharply during 2006 2007 and 2010 this significant modulation of the wavelet power in the dominant seasonal band implies that the wind forcing is a mixture of the switched on and periodic functions the signal is switched on at some time oscillates for say 2 3 years before it is switched off for a year or two then it is switched on again the duration of the oscillatory part extends over but a few semi annual cycles not sufficient for the periodic nature to manifest before the switch is turned off a similar behaviour is seen in the altimeter slas for the semi annual band it is not surprising therefore that this intermittency is more striking at the intraseasonal periods this intermittency implies that neither the forcing nor the response is purely periodic because a periodic function by definition extends from to in time which is not the case in fig s16 in summary therefore though the solution of mccreary 1977 was derived for a switched on not periodic forcing the intermittent nature of the forcing and response implies that it is applicable to the real ocean or to the oceanic response in an ogcm forced by realistic winds hence while the analytic solutions provide insight into the dynamics of the real ocean or an ogcm simulation they must be used and interpreted with caution third as discussed in section 3 1 there is evidence in altimeter data for rossby waves propagating into the bay at periods roughly associated with the madden julian oscillation vialard et al 2009 girishkumar et al 2011 the slas at these and shorter periods are determined essentially by the first two baroclinic modes and the model is therefore able to simulate them well mukherjee et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 showed however that it is more difficult to simulate the current because of the significant contribution from high order baroclinic modes mccreary 1980 1985 which lead to a downward bending of energy in the form of beams mccreary 1984 nethery and shankar 2007 matthews et al 2007 amol et al 2012 2014 mukherjee et al 2014 the above analysis is qualitative and based on association both temporal and spatial of forcing mechanisms and the response a quantitative separation of the sla response to each forcing mechanism will demand the use of a linear model shankar et al 1996 mccreary et al 1996 shankar et al 2002 mukherjee et al 2018 we refrain from carrying out this analysis as our purpose is limited to showing that a sequence of downwelling and upwelling rossby waves can be identified in the model slas along the three zonal sections these waves can be associated with the three forcing mechanisms identified in the literature and they can be associated with periods much shorter than the seasonal cycle 4 2 summary and conclusions most of the earlier heat budget studies of the bay of bengal have concluded that the sst in the bay is controlled by the air sea fluxes see for example sengupta and ravichandran 2001 shenoi et al 2002 schiller and godfrey 2003 waliser et al 2004 de boyer montégut et al 2007 duncan and han 2009 vialard et al 2012 behara and vinayachandran 2016 li et al 2017b thangaprakash et al 2016 our model results based on zonal sections and a spread of model mooring or mm locations across the basin show that horizontal advection and to a somewhat lesser extent vertical advection make a significant and direct contribution to the heat budget of the western bay because their contribution to the sst tendency is at least comparable to that due to air sea fluxes figs 6 7 s12 8 10 11 s14 in the eastern bay downwelling rossby waves forced largely from the eio but significantly modified by alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and ekman pumping all over the basin control the dynamics because the current tends to weaken behind the wavefront mccreary et al 1993 1996 the weakening of the horizontal current implies a weak contribution of horizontal advection in the eastern bay and the strong horizontal advection tends to terminate at the event markers that denote the stronger downwelling rossby wavefronts figs 6ad 8ad the rossby waves also deepen the thermocline d25 or d20 implying downwelling and a weak role for vertical advection the deepening of the thermocline leads to the net flux into the ocean being distributed over a larger depth range implying a weak contribution of air sea fluxes to the budget therefore sst changes much less during the summer monsoon in the eastern bay compared to the western bay figs 6 7 s12 8 10 11 s14 the downwelling associated with this rossby wave makes possible the existence of a deeper ml the actual depth of the ml in this deep thermocline regime depends however on the turbulent kinetic energy input by the local winds because a higher momentum flux is required to maintain a deep ml therefore there is a strong relation between the local winds and the ml in the eastern bay figs 7 s12 10 s14 the rossby wave essentially conditions the upper ocean say above d25 by limiting the potential depth of the mixed layer upwelling downwelling rossby waves decrease increase this potential depth in the northern bay the inflow of freshwater from rainfall and rivers provides an additional mechanism for shallowing the ml fig 12 summarises the processes controlling the evolution of the mixed layer and sst stratification due to air sea fluxes and horizontal advection turbulent mixing by winds and vertical movement of the thermocline our results emphasise the role of the thermocline movement driven by the passage of both remotely and locally forced rossby waves in the bay since the rossby waves move westward slowly across the bay this effect of downwelling on the heat budget is seen later during the summer monsoon in the southwestern bay what is striking is the series of equatorial kelvin waves that can be tracked along the eastern boundary fig 3 and westward into the bay fig 4 s7 5 the significant contribution of all three forcing mechanisms equatorial kelvin waves alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and ekman pumping even at periods shorter than 30 days implies that we can track 17 upwelling and downwelling favourable rossby waves during april october 2005 figs 4 s7 5 therefore earlier during the summer monsoon d25 oscillates much more in the western bay figs 7 s12 s14 10 where the upwelling forced by ekman pumping figs 4 s7 5 is strong and overwhelms the downwelling forced largely from the eio but supplemented by alongshore winds and downwelling favourable ekman pumping in the eastern bay it is this difference between a shallow and deep thermocline that makes the indirect effect of ocean dynamics important for a heat budget analysis when the thermocline is deep the mld can vary owing to changes in the wind speed without it affecting the sst when the thermocline is shallow however an increase in mld is accompanied by a decrease in sst in both cases however the analysis will show that the mld responds to the local winds suggesting that the air sea flux of momentum controls the mld what is often missed in such an analysis is that the rossby waves exercise a control on the potential vertical extent of the ml when the ocean s dynamical processes deepen the thermocline via rossby waves the ocean tends to take itself out of the heat budget equation because all terms on the rhs of eq 1 tend to vanish leading to the apparent dominance of air sea fluxes because the net flux tends to be correlated with the sst this correlation is misleading however because the variation of sst tends to be weak when the thermocline is deep this indirect role of dynamics is clearly seen even in the northern bay in the model fig 10 and in mooring data shown in thangaprakash et al 2016 and kantha et al 2019 at 18 n but has not been given its due importance high resolution one dimensional models forced with accurate freshwater fluxes and air sea fluxes fail to simulate the ml variability because they ignore this indirect role of thermocline movement kantha et al 2019 thus both approaches one dimensional models and ogcms have their respective strengths and limitations the insights gained from the ogcms are useful for understanding how the ml responds to the passage of the rossby waves which make an important contribution in determining the large scale spatio temporal variability of the ml in the bay better parameterisation of the effect of short scale salinity changes on the scale of the model grid would be a welcome improvement but achieving this ability will demand a quantum leap in our ability to observe the ocean and in our understanding of how the near surface ocean couples to the atmosphere averaging zonally across the bay obviously obscures the direct role of ocean dynamics in driving sst changes via horizontal and vertical advection leading to the misleading inference of air sea fluxes controlling the sst in the bay the averaging also obscures the more subtle indirect role played by ocean dynamics via its control on the depth of the thermocline say d25 therefore studies of intraseasonal sst variability that use such zonal averages tend to emphasise the role of wind driven mixing and air sea fluxes over dynamical processes like advection fig 13 duncan and han 2009 vialard et al 2012 li et al 2017b the zonal asymmetry also leads mooring based analyses to the same conclusion thangaprakash et al 2016 owing to the skewed distribution of moorings in the bay nevertheless while pointing to the drawback of zonal averaging in estimating the heat budget we note that there will be situations in which such zonal averaging may be useful an example is the southern bay box used by shankar et al 2007 they showed that averaging over 82 88 e and 4 8 n allowed an estimate of the meridional sst gradient that led the rainfall over the central bay but extending the eastern limit of the box by just 2 to 90 e led to a significant decrease in the number of such related events whether it is appropriate to use zonal averages or not will depend on the goal of the analysis the inference drawn must be carefully weighed to factor in the possible indirect role of the ocean in determining mld and sst our results are based on an ogcm simulation implications in a coupled system are of interest because the rossby wave takes 2 3 months comparable to the duration of the summer monsoon to traverse the basin though we picked one year 2005 to analyse the impact of dynamics on the sst as it was a neutral year with respect to the large scale climate modes this effect of dynamics is seen in other years as well but the intensity of the rossby waves varies from year to year in spite of these year to year differences however the basic conclusion of this paper that ocean dynamics affects the sst in the bay both directly and indirectly is evident in all years a detailed study on the implications of these climate modes on the rossby waves in the bay and the corresponding effect on the mixed layer processes is therefore of interest as it may provide insights into the ocean s role in modulating the interannual variability associated with the indian summer monsoon the significance of our result lies in the slow westward propagating rossby wave being perhaps the most predictable feature of the ocean s large scale circulation credit authorship contribution statement

23868,earlier studies suggest that the mixed layer ml temperature or sea surface temperature sst of the bay of bengal during the summer monsoon is determined primarily by air sea fluxes we use an oceanic general circulation model ogcm to show that oceanic processes also play a significant role model heat budget computations show that horizontal and vertical advection constituting the direct role of dynamics contribute significantly to the sst tendency in the western bay the eastern limit of this direct role regime is determined by downwelling rossby waves which are forced largely from the equatorial indian ocean but are modified by alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and ekman pumping along their westward path across the bay the current and as a result advection weaken behind the rossby waves to the east of the rossby wavefront the thermocline is deep permitting a deeper ml but the actual ml depth mld depends on the wind speed with salinity also playing a role in the northern bay yet there is negligible change in the sst even when mld changes significantly because the deep thermocline decouples the changes in mld and sst in contrast the shallower thermocline in the western bay limits the potential mld leading to larger changes in sst the upwelling downwelling rossby wave essentially conditions the upper ocean by decreasing increasing the potential depth of the mixed layer sst variation weakens only when the thermocline deepens during downwelling events which occur later in the western bay because rossby waves propagate westward the significant but subtle role of the rossby waves in decoupling the changes in mld and sst via downwelling is indirect unlike the direct role of advection estimated in a standard heat budget computation and has been largely ignored in earlier studies keywords sea surface temperature air sea interaction ocean atmosphere interaction rossby wave mixed layer monsoon indian ocean heat budget 1 introduction 1 1 context the indian subcontinent heats up in may following the northward movement of the sun across the equator and a heat low is established over northwest india and pakistan rao 1976 riehl 1979 the trough associated with this heat low extends across northern india into the northern bay of bengal hereafter usually referred to as the bay following the onset of the summer or southwest monsoon in june rao 1976 low pressure systems form in the northern bay during the summer monsoon and the rainfall during this season is associated with these low pressure systems that move westward or northwestward across the subcontinent rao 1976 mooley and shukla 1989 goswami 1987 what makes the development of these systems possible in the northern bay is the high sea surface temperature sst that prevails in the region shenoi et al 2002 gadgil 2003 observations suggest that sst has to exceed 28 c for convection to occur over the tropical oceans sst exceeding the threshold is a necessary condition for convection but it is not a sufficient condition gadgil et al 1984 the threshold may be lower in the atlantic ocean graham and barnett 1987 but convection does not occur in the tropical atmosphere overlying the oceans if the sst is below a certain threshold some studies also suggest that the meridional gradient of sst in the bay plays a role in the onset of convection over the central bay shankar et al 2007 this relation of the summer monsoon rainfall to the sst in the bay of bengal see for example a recent coupled model analysis by samanta et al 2018 has led to several studies analysing the processes affecting sst 1 2 earlier heat budget studies an analysis of the processes determining sst is typically done through an estimate of the heat budget of the surface mixed layer ml or the upper few tens of metres of the ocean shenoi et al 2002 showed that the climatological sst in the bay north of 6 n fig 1 remains higher than the 28 c convection threshold throughout the summer monsoon their analysis showed that the bay remains warmer than the arabian sea during the summer monsoon in spite of the bay receiving lower shortwave flux because its circulation is relatively weaker or sluggish compared to that of the arabian sea the weaker western boundary current of the bay the east india coastal current eicc shetye et al 1991 1993 1996 is unable to remove the heat from the bay while the strong somali current and the stronger meridional overturning associated with it are able to cool the arabian sea these results were confirmed by de boyer montégut et al 2007 using an oceanic general circulation model ogcm the weaker oceanic circulation leads to air sea fluxes dominating the heat budget of the top 50 m shenoi et al 2002 or the surface ml de boyer montégut et al 2007 in the bay though both these studies shenoi et al 2002 de boyer montégut et al 2007 estimated a basin averaged heat budget for the bay north of 6 n they noted an asymmetry between the northern and southern bay due to the high freshwater inflow into the northern bay a consequence of both high rainfall fig 2bb and river discharge fig 2ba the freshwater whether from the river discharge into the northern bay shetye 1993 vörösmarty et al 1998 papa et al 2012 or from the high rainfall over the northeastern bay xie et al 2006 is restricted north of 15 n fig 2bc by the prevailing circulation along the western boundary the eicc flows poleward fig 2ad during may september shetye et al 1991 1993 shankar et al 1996 mccreary et al 1993 1996 vinayachandran et al 1996 shetye and gouveia 1998 schott and mccreary 2001 mukherjee et al 2014 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2020 precluding equatorward advection of the freshwater along the indian east coast till october shankar 1998 2000 han and mccreary 2001 jensen 2001 durand et al 2007 behara and vinayachandran 2016 along the eastern boundary the current is much weaker and the equatorward advection of freshwater is therefore weak during the summer monsoon leading to the freshwater export from the bay occurring after the summer monsoon shetye et al 1996 jensen 2001 behara and vinayachandran 2016 the sea surface salinity sss tends to be higher in the southern bay fig 2bc owing to evaporation exceeding precipitation and the inflow of the saltier arabian sea high salinity water ashsw from the arabian sea murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 1999 2013 jensen 2001 han and mccreary 2001 han et al 2001 jain et al 2017 a recent modelling study suggests however that the source of this high salinity water entering the bay is the western equatorial indian ocean sanchez franks et al 2019 this meridional asymmetry of sss is evident in a climatology fig 2bc chatterjee et al 2012 and subsequent heat budget studies tended to account for it by using 15 n as a divider and not averaging over a domain spread across both northern and southern bay of bengal yet duncan and han 2009 who estimated the budget over 80 90 e 4 15 n vialard et al 2012 who averaged over 80 95 e 15 23 n and behara and vinayachandran 2016 who averaged over 80 89 e 15 20 n and 90 96 e 15 22 n reached the same conclusion it is the air sea fluxes that determine the variability of sst in the bay with oceanic processes playing a minor role the averaging domain used in these studies is marked in fig 1 behara and vinayachandran 2016 did however point to a zonal asymmetry in the northern bay noting that horizontal and vertical advection contribute significantly to the sst in the northwestern bay 80 89 e 15 20 n but not in the northeastern bay 90 96 e 15 22 n though li et al 2017b averaged across 15 n 83 95 e 10 20 n and studied the composites of intraseasonal events during the summer monsoon over the central bay they too concluded that the air sea fluxes constitute the dominant process in determining the sst other regional studies also tend to reach the same conclusion oceanic processes play a minor role in determining the sst in the bay schiller and godfrey 2003 waliser et al 2004 parampil et al 2010 another approach to estimating the heat budget has been based on data from moorings sengupta and ravichandran 2001 thangaprakash et al 2016 and they too conclude dominance of air sea fluxes in the heat budget such one dimensional analyses offer the advantage of higher vertical resolution and incorporation of sophisticated turbulent mixing schemes but this improvement in the simulation of vertical processes is gained at the cost of ignoring the large scale dynamics for instance these one dimensional models fail to simulate the mixed layer in the northern bay in spite of accurate forcing of freshwater and air sea fluxes because they ignore the role of horizontal advection and thermocline movement weller et al 2016 buckley et al 2020 kantha et al 2019 only a few studies show a significant role of horizontal advection in the bay vijith et al 2020 and george et al 2019 in the southeastern bay behara and vinayachandran 2016 and buckley et al 2020 in the northwestern bay and jayakumar et al 2013 in a region lying southwest of the bay 75 80 e 5 8 n rao et al 2011 and kantha et al 2019 also show the role of advection but for the transport of freshwater from its source locations across the northern bay because the in situ rainfall cannot account for the observed salinity variability at 89 e 19 n and 89 5 e 18 n respectively fewer studies have highlighted the role of thermocline movement one of them shows the role of intraseasonal rossby waves in modulating the barrier layer in the southeastern bay girishkumar et al 2011 another analyses the impact of the pacific decadal oscillation on the barrier layer in the bay at decadal time scales pang et al 2019 averages the data over 86 94 e 5 12 n and 82 94 e 16 22 n and shows that local negative or cyclonic positive or anticyclonic ekman pumping or wind stress curl deepens shallows the barrier layer in the northern southern bay observed temperature and salinity profiles in the northern bay show significant vertical movement of the thermocline thangaprakash et al 2016 but the possible role of this vertical process has been ignored in most of the literature and emphasis is given to air sea fluxes owing to the thin mixed layers thangaprakash et al 2016 do however invoke the vertical mixing noted earlier by prasad 2004 and kantha et al 2019 point to the inability of one dimensional models to simulate the vertical profile of temperature or salinity owing to their neglect of upwelling and downwelling 1 3 zonal asymmetry the high rainfall is not only restricted north of 15 n but is also much higher in the eastern bay particularly off the west coast of myanmar xie et al 2006 compared to the western bay fig 2bb an implication of the heaviest rainfall occurring over the northeastern bay the poleward eicc during the summer monsoon and the intrusion of ashsw from the arabian sea into the southwestern bay via the summer monsoon current smc shankar et al 2002 vinayachandran et al 2018 is the existence of a zonal asymmetry in the sss the sss during the summer monsoon is lower in the eastern bay compared to the western bay fig 2bc the role of the smc is evident in the sss difference between july and may which shows a high salinity tongue with the maximum salinity occurring south and east of sri lanka where the smc intrudes into the southwestern bay fig 2cd murty et al 1992 vinayachandran et al 1999 jensen 2001 han et al 2001 shankar et al 2002 rao et al 2006b vinayachandran et al 2013 2018 webber et al 2018 sanchez franks et al 2019 the mixed layer depth mld however is deeper during july in the eastern bay to the west of the andaman and nicobar islands compared to the western bay fig 2bd and the intrusion of ashsw does not lead to a much deeper ml in the southwestern bay during july compared to may fig 2ce suggesting that the mld in the bay is not determined by salinity alone indeed another well known zonal asymmetry in the bay arises as a consequence of dynamics westward propagation of rossby waves masked to an extent by the averaging inherent in a climatology of altimeter sea level anomalies slas fig s3aa ac ae is striking when one plots the slas for a given year say 2005 fig s3ba bc be these rossby waves propagate slowly across the bay of bengal with the speed decreasing poleward as 1 y 2 where y is the distance from the equator this decrease in speed with increasing distance from the equator implies a longer time is taken to propagate a given zonal distance indicated by the higher tilt with respect to the abscissa in the northern bay 18 n fig s3be compared to the southern bay 7 n fig s3ba the speed of the rossby wave as estimated from the tilt decreases from 20 cm s 1 at 7 n to 5 cm s 1 at 18 n these speeds match theoretical estimates see table s1 in sec s3 the slow speed of the rossby waves implies that they take a few months to cross the basin these rossby waves are forced by three mechanisms two of which ekman pumping and the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary are local to the bay the third mechanism is forcing from the equatorial indian ocean eio potemra et al 1991 yu et al 1991 mccreary et al 1993 1996 vinayachandran et al 1996 chatterjee et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 the variation of slas in the bay and the associated variation of the depth of the 25 c isotherm hereafter called d25 is therefore determined by the combined effect of these three mechanisms which we discuss in more detail in section 3 1 the rossby waves associated with these mechanisms particularly equatorial forcing deepen the thermocline in the eastern bay during the summer monsoon mccreary et al 1993 1996 shankar et al 2002 d25 is deeper during july in the eastern bay compared to the western bay and the rossby wave restricts the eastward extent of the smc the slow propagation of the rossby waves across the bay is also evident in the difference of slas and d25 between july and may with the front of the rossby wave marked roughly by the positive values of the difference for both slas fig 2cb and d25 fig 2cc 1 4 present research that the difference figure between july and may for the mld matches those for slas and d25 more than it matches that for the sss suggests that the rossby waves may play a role in determining the mld and sst in the bay we use an ogcm simulation to show that ocean dynamics plays a significant role in determining the sst in the bay of bengal this role of ocean dynamics is of two kinds first ocean dynamics directly affects sst through horizontal and vertical advection and entrainment mixing driven by the winds this direct role is captured in a standard heat budget analysis and has been shown to be important in the southeastern bay george et al 2019 vijith et al 2020 and northern bay behara and vinayachandran 2016 buckley et al 2020 kantha et al 2019 second ocean dynamics plays an indirect role by constraining the vertical space available for the development of the ml this manipulation of the vertical space is affected by rossby waves this indirect role may seem obvious but is more subtle and is not as apparent as the direct role in heat budget analyses this indirect role is more prominent in the eastern bay where the thermocline is deeper but it is seen farther westward through the summer monsoon owing to the rossby waves the rest of this paper is organised as follows we describe the data sets and model used in the paper in section 2 and the evolution of sst in the southern northern and central bay in section 3 this section also deals with the zonal asymmetry introduced by ocean dynamics via rossby waves section 4 concludes the paper 2 data and model in this section we describe the data sets and the model used in this paper the model description is followed by a formal statement of our approach the method used to estimate the heat and salt budgets and model validation 2 1 data sets the data sets used are listed in table 1 along with their sources and acronym expansions for the climatological variables plotted in fig 2 we used data for 2003 2012 when multi year records were available temperature and salinity data are from argo floats gaillard et al 2016 and the climatology of chatterjee et al 2012 sst data are from ghrsst sla data from aviso currents from oscar net heat flux from tropflux kumar et al 2012 precipitation from trmm wind speed and direction from quikscat and river runoff from sage vörösmarty et al 1998 the mld is defined as the depth at which the density increase from the surface corresponds to a 0 5 c decrease in temperature shenoi et al 2004 shankar et al 2016 and the isothermal layer depth ild is defined as the depth at which temperature is 0 5 c lower than the sst the barrier layer thickness blt is the difference of the ild and mld 2 2 model we use the modular ocean model mom griffies 2009 the version used is mom4p1 the model has a free surface and is hydrostatic and volume conserving the model set up used in this paper is from mukherjee et al 2018 which builds on earlier work kurian and vinayachandran 2007 chatterjee et al 2013 2017 shankar et al 2016 and has been used to study the circulation of the andaman sea and its role in linking the eio to the bay of bengal chatterjee et al 2017 and the eicc mukherjee et al 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 the model domain has a horizontal resolution of 0 1 0 1 and it extends from 30 120 e and from 30 s 30 n the model has 40 vertical levels with 25 levels in the top 200 m and a vertical resolution of 5 m in the top 60 m the bottom topography is based on the modified 2 bathymetry of sindhu et al 2007 the narrow channel between india and sri lanka remains closed in the model the channels connecting the red sea and persian gulf with the arabian sea are broadened and deepened to allow flow through them and the south china sea is masked out of the model domain the minimum ocean depth is set to 15 m and single isolated land points are removed the no slip boundary condition is applied along the continental land boundaries along the open boundaries in the south and east a sponge layer of 3 5 is applied following chatterjee et al 2013 sss is relaxed to climatological values from chatterjee et al 2012 with a time scale of 30 days to avoid salinity drift a summary of model physical processes is given in table 2 and data sources used to force the model are listed in table 3 the value of smagorinsky mixing coefficient for laplacian biharmonic viscosity is 0 06 0 002 with velocity scale 0 04 0 005 m s 1 to avoid extra mixing within the stratified water column local mixing due to double diffusion is not included a five point filter is used to smooth the boundary layer diffusivity in order to remove grid cell noise a consequence of the high temporal frequency of the forcing from sst and mld the model mld is defined as the depth at which the buoyancy difference with respect to the surface is equal to 0 0003 m s 2 kurian and vinayachandran 2007 the definition of ild and blt are as for the observations the ild is the depth at which temperature is 0 5 c lower than the sst and the model blt is the difference between the model ild and mld the model is spun up for 10 years from a state of rest with climatological temperature and salinity fields from chatterjee et al 2012 and daily climatological forcing fields for 2000 2008 following this 10 year climatological spin up the model is integrated using interannual winds it is forced by quikscat winds from january 2000 to december 2008 and a switch is made to ascat winds from january 2009 we use the model results from 2003 onwards i e after 13 years of spin up 2 3 our approach though the climatology observations and model does show the westward propagating rossby wave fig s3 a the rossby waves are more clear when the slas are plotted for a specific year fig s3b we pick 2005 because it was a normal or neutral year with respect to the large scale climate modes like el niño or la niña or the indian ocean dipole iod saji et al 1999 webster et al 1999 the sources of information on these events are the websites of the bureau of meteorology australia http www bom gov au climate iod and the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa https www esrl noaa gov psd enso past events html the same behaviour is seen in other years but with some differences owing to the impact of these major climate modes on the zonal winds over the eio and the bay gadgil et al 2004 further analysis is carried out for a specific year 2005 instead of the climatology in order to unravel the effect of the slow westward propagation of rossby waves on the variation of sst we avoid averaging over large areas we estimate the heat budget for three zonal sections figs 1 2 one each representing the southern bay 7 n central bay 12 n and northern bay 18 n in addition we quantify the contribution of different processes to the heat budget at seven locations spread over the bay of bengal fig 1 table 4 to show how the sst varies in different parts of the basin and analyse the role of ocean dynamics in determining the variability we refer to these seven locations as model moorings because we obtain a vertical profile at each of these locations as shown in table 4 these model mooring locations mm locations are numbered mm1 mm7 and they are located on the zonal sections mm1 mm2 and mm3 are located on the 7 n section mm4 and mm5 on the 12 n section and mm6 and mm7 on the 18 n section that these locations are spread over the basin and not localised to the eastern bay like the rama moorings mcphaden et al 2009 allows us to distinguish not only between the northern mm6 mm7 central mm4 mm5 and southern mm1 mm3 bay but also between the eastern mm3 mm5 and mm7 and western mm1 mm2 mm4 and mm6 bay 2 4 estimation of heat and salt budgets to analyse the role of different processes in the heat budget of the surface mixed layer we use the method of vialard and delecluse 1998 and kurian and vinayachandran 2007 the model mld is extended to the base of respective grid cell for estimating the heat budget the tendency of the vertically averaged ml temperature t ml is given by kurian and vinayachandran 2007 1 t t ml q loss h 0 q abs ρ 0 c p h atmospheric forcing 1 h h 0 u x t d z h 0 v y t d z horizontal advection 1 h w h t h t ml vertical advection 1 h h t h t h t ml k z t h ρ 0 c p entrainment with 2 h 0 if t h 0 1 if t h 0 in eq 1 t h u v w k ρ 0 and c p are the potential temperature mld zonal velocity meridional velocity vertical velocity coefficient of vertical diffusion density and the specific heat capacity respectively q loss is the heat loss from the surface as turbulent and longwave fluxes and q abs is the shortwave radiation absorbed by seawater we use k 1 0 5 m 2 s 1 but a sensitivity test that varied k over two orders of magnitude in the range 10 6 10 4 m 2 s 1 shows only changes in the magnitude of the entrainment term but these changes have no impact on the results the horizontal diffusion makes a comparatively minor contribution to the heat budget and is therefore neglected following vialard and delecluse 1998 the entrainment consists of two terms the first entrainment term in eq 1 is the entrainment from below the ml and it is non zero only when the ml deepens eq 2 the second entrainment term is the vertical diffusion at the base of the ml and it is independent of whether the ml deepens or shallows the tendency term on the left hand side of eq 1 is estimated as the sum of the contributing process terms on the right hand side the salt budget is estimated in a similar manner the tendency of the vertically averaged ml salinity s ml is given by 3 t s ml s 0 e p h atmospheric forcing 1 h h 0 u x s d z h 0 v y s d z horizontal advection 1 h w h s h s ml vertical advection 1 h h t h s h s ml k z s h entrainment r residual where h is given by eq 2 s s 0 e and p are the salinity surface salinity evaporation and precipitation respectively as noted earlier the surface salinity in the model is relaxed to the monthly climatology of chatterjee et al 2012 sss relaxation provides an internal freshwater source in the model simulation and accounts for the absence of river discharge in the model forcing an interannual simulation with river discharge is difficult owing to the unavailability of accurate river discharge data the residual term r in eq 3 calculated as the difference between the salt tendency and sum of contributions of atmospheric forcing advection and entrainment terms gives an estimate of the effect of sss relaxation hereafter the ml temperature t ml and salinity s ml are referred to as sst and sss respectively 2 5 model validation the residual r is significant and the salinity difference between model and observations is high only in the northern bay where the river discharge is high fig 2ba and the shelf is broad briefly the main reasons for the larger model observation difference in sss are the short scale both spatial and temporal changes in salinity in the northern bay hormann et al 2016 mackinnon et al 2016 lucas et al 2016 sarkar et al 2016 shroyer et al 2016 jampana et al 2019 and the coarse sampling which implies considerable extrapolation in the preparation of the gridded data sets and therefore a high standard deviation associated with the observed sss whether in a climatology chatterjee et al 2012 or in argo based maps for a given year benshila et al 2014 a more detailed discussion of the sss relaxation and the simulation of sss is given in sec s2 though mom has been used and validated extensively for earlier indian ocean studies including for the bay of bengal kurian and vinayachandran 2007 behara and vinayachandran 2016 chatterjee et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2018 mukhopadhyay et al 2017 we validate the model performance in sec s1 by comparing the evolution of the relevant model variables over the basin and at the seven mm locations during the summer monsoon to the observations the model observation differences are similar to those seen in the literature and the simulation errors for sla cheng et al 2013 chatterjee et al 2017 sst behara and vinayachandran 2016 li et al 2017b samanta et al 2018 sss vinayachandran et al 2012 behara and vinayachandran 2016 akhil et al 2016 chowdary et al 2016 jensen et al 2016 sandeep and pant 2019 and mld vialard et al 2012 li et al 2017a are comparable therefore the observation model differences do not preclude the use of the model to analyse the processes affecting sst and the model simulation is good enough for the purpose of showing the role of the westward propagating rossby waves and to throw light on the indirect role of ocean dynamics in determining sst 3 role of oceanic processes in the mixed layer heat budget in this section we apply the above method for estimating heat and salt budgets to the three zonal sections and the seven mm locations we begin with the analysis for the southern bay where the role of salinity is limited and therefore that of dynamics is more direct and evident the role of salinity is strongest in the northern bay which is discussed next we conclude the section with a brief description of the results for the central bay the key physical process involved in the indirect role of ocean dynamics is the rossby wave which affects the depth of the thermocline therefore before presenting the heat budget analysis we provide a brief description of the rossby waves as simulated by the model during april october 2005 at 7 n 12 n and 18 n 3 1 rossby wave events as noted earlier in section 1 3 the rossby waves in the bay are forced by three mechanisms one of which is not local to the bay this remote mechanism involves equatorial kelvin waves forced by zonal winds in the eio mccreary et al 1996 two strong downwelling sla events associated with eastward jets have been shown to occur during may and november in the eio wyrtki 1973 o brien and hurlburt 1974 mccreary et al 1993 1996 han et al 1999 chatterjee et al 2017 owing to a dominant semi annual cycle luyten and roemmich 1982 jensen 1993 han et al 2011 the equatorial kelvin waves reflect off the west coast of sumatra leading to the propagation of energy along the eastern boundary and the radiation of rossby waves moore 1968 into the bay mccreary et al 1993 1996 analysis of the downwelling sla peak associated with the eastward jet during april july fig 3aa shows however that the broad semi annual peak fig 3ab includes two upwelling bursts with a period of 30 days fig 3ac that lower the slas between three downwelling peaks hence periodicities shorter than 30 days often contribute almost as much to the slas in the eastern eio fig 3ac as does the semi annual cycle fig 3ab documented in the literature jensen 1993 han et al 2011 counting such upwelling and downwelling bursts separately leads to 11 equatorial kelvin wave events during april october 2005 fig 3a these 11 equatorial kelvin events can be tracked along the eastern boundary of the bay as well but some of the weaker events do not extend all the way to 18 n fig 3b the slower speed of the rossby waves implies however that we have to consider six earlier equatorial kelvin waves k01 k06 forced during october 2004 to march 2005 fig s8 and their propagation along the eastern boundary fig s9 to complete the set of 17 rossby waves seen during april october 2005 along the three zonal sections fig s10 the equatorially forced slas propagate into the bay each of the 14 rossby events during april october 2005 at 7 n is denoted by an event marker a slanted dashed line in the sla hovmöller plot fig 4a these event markers also overlaid on the current fig 4aa and ekman pumping fig 4bb bc are used in the rest of this paper to indicate the time of arrival of a rossby wave at a given location all these events are numbered in sequence according to the time of origin table 5 the six character event name includes the latitude first two characters 07 for 7 n r third character signifying rossby wave and separating the latitude and the sequence the sequence number fourth and fifth characters 03 for the third event and u or d last character depending on whether the event favours upwelling or downwelling respectively to avoid clutter only the last three characters are used in fig 4a the westward propagation of the equatorially forced rossby waves from the eastern boundary is also seen at 12 n fig s7 table 6 and 18 n fig 5a table 7 the impact of these equatorially forced rossby waves is therefore felt all over the bay and model studies show that it has a stronger impact on the circulation in the andaman sea and the bay than do the winds along the eastern boundary mccreary et al 1996 chatterjee et al 2017 the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary do however force coastal kelvin waves that radiate westward into the bay as rossby waves fig 4ba mccreary et al 1993 1996 which complement the equatorially forced rossby waves at 7 n fig 4 table 5 12 n fig s7 table 6 and 18 n fig 5 table 7 for the bay the rossby waves forced from the eio and by the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary are free waves but these free rossby waves are modified by the rossby waves forced by ekman pumping this superposition of free and forced rossby waves along a zonal section can change the phase speed and therefore the tilt of the event markers along the section a change in the slope of the event marker is also seen on occasions in the western bay at 7 n fig 4ab because the eastward smc fig 4aa opposes the rossby wave slowing it down greatbatch 1985 vinayachandran et al 1999 cyclonic anticyclonic ekman pumping favours upwelling downwelling and tends to shallow deepen the thermocline this effect is carried westward by rossby waves implying that the ekman pumping at a given location has an impact on the slas to its west later in the season according to the literature ekman pumping is largely cyclonic positive over the bay during the summer monsoon but with the magnitude varying across the basin mccreary et al 1993 1996 the cyclonic ekman pumping is stronger in the western bay particularly in the southwestern bay to the east of sri lanka vinayachandran et al 1999 and it gives way to anticyclonic negative ekman pumping east of 90 e fig 2ac sil and chakraborty 2015 analysis shows however considerable patchiness in the ekman pumping field in both space and time along the zonal section at 7 n fig 4bb this patchiness is largely due to a significant contribution to the ekman pumping from periods shorter than 30 days fig 4bd but zonal variation is also seen at higher periods fig 4bc the patchiness in ekman pumping is also seen at 12 n fig s7b the spatial patchiness is less at 18 n where the ekman pumping tends to have the same sign along the zonal section but it still shows short period bursts in time fig 5b this patchy ekman pumping field is part of the wind field used to force the model therefore it is not surprising that the resulting short scale features in the slas can be associated with the patches in ekman pumping along all three zonal sections figs 4 s7 5 and tables 5 6 7 the sla signal at a given location at say 7 n is therefore due to the combined effect of all three forcing mechanisms the slas due to alongshore winds add to the equatorial slas at the eastern boundary at 7 n and the resultant slas that propagate westward into the bay are modified by the local ekman pumping all along the zonal section for example in a constructive superposition at 7 n downwelling favourable alongshore winds at the eastern boundary enhance the downwelling slas associated with the equatorial kelvin wave k09 event 07r09d fig 3 in the first half of may as these downwelling slas propagate into the bay they are further enhanced by downwelling favourable ekman pumping at 87 e in the first half of july case c09a in fig 4ab bb table 5 examples in which the forcing mechanisms superimpose destructively include the upwelling kelvin waves k06 and k12 fig 3 for k06 the alongshore winds in the first half of march favour upwelling and enhance the upwelling slas but the ekman pumping along 7 n favours downwelling fig 4bb and the upwelling slas associated with rossby wave 07r06u are weakened till early may case c06a in fig 4bb later the upwelling slas are enhanced fig 4a by upwelling favourable ekman pumping just west of 86 e case c06b in fig 4bb for k12 the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary fig 4ba and ekman pumping fig 4bb favour downwelling which overwhelms the equatorially forced upwelling leading to the event 07r12u propagating initially as a weak downwelling wave along 7 n fig 4a the slas associated with 07r12u change sign only when ekman pumping becomes upwelling favourable at 92 e in july case c12a in figs 4ab bb table 5 a similar destructive superposition occurs for the downwelling kelvin wave k07 along 12 n fig 3 the alongshore winds and ekman pumping near the eastern boundary favour upwelling fig s7 and therefore lower the downwelling slas forced from the equator in the second half of april subsequently however as this weakened downwelling rossby wave 12r07d propagates westward the downwelling slas are strengthened by ekman pumping at 93 e in the second half of may and at 87 e in the second half of july case c07a in fig s7 table 6 examples at 18 n include k05 and k06 the upwelling wave k05 figs s8 s9 s10 is enhanced by alongshore winds but weakened by downwelling favourable ekman pumping case c05a in fig 5ba as it propagates along 18 n figs 5ab s10c and the slas are positive from early april to early august fig 5ab for k06 the equatorially forced upwelling fig 5ab is enhanced by alongshore winds fig 5ba and subsequently weakened by downwelling favourable ekman pumping from the eastern boundary in mid march till 90 e in early june case c06a in fig 5bb before upwelling favourable ekman pumping farther west 87 e fig 5bb strengthens the upwelling slas in august case c06b in fig 5a table 7 tables 5 7 document more such cases for the 17 events at 7 n 12 n and 18 n respectively the corresponding figures for the slas alongshore winds and ekman pumping are fig 4 fig s7 and fig 5 respectively since rossby waves are usually considered to have long wavelengths and low frequencies their existence at the seasonal time scales has been extensively studied see for example mccreary et al 1993 1996 shankar et al 2002 but their existence at intraseasonal periods including the periods less than 30 days merits a discussion as shown above equatorial kelvin waves and associated rossby waves are evident at these high frequencies in the model slas and the spatial scale of these rossby waves is much less than the large scale usually associated with rossby waves at these high frequencies energy tends to bend down in the form of beams that owe their existence to the excitation of high order baroclinic vertical normal modes mccreary 1980 1984 1985 nethery and shankar 2007 mukherjee et al 2018 these high order modes are important for the current but not for the sea level which is determined primarily by the first two baroclinic modes mukherjee et al 2018 therefore the slas are seen to propagate eastward along the equator poleward along the eastern boundary and then westward into the bay even at these short periods the horizontal length scale associated with these short period sla features is also small westward propagation of equatorially forced slas into the bay in the 55 110 day band has been documented in altimeter data from the north indian ocean vialard et al 2009 girishkumar et al 2011 but these data do not have the temporal resolution to map as well the variability at periods shorter than 30 days downward bending of energy is suggested by the observed impact of the madden julian oscillation madden and julian 1971 1972 in argo data from the deep waters of the equatorial pacific ocean matthews et al 2007 in moored acoustic doppler current profilers adcps data in the equatorial indian ocean pujiana and mcphaden 2020 and the existence of isolated sub surface current cores in vertical profiles from adcps off the indian west amol et al 2012 2014 and east mukherjee et al 2014 coasts the association of the high sla patches in fig 4 fig s7 and fig 5 with the short scale bursts in ekman pumping are simulated well by the model because it involves only the two gravest baroclinic modes mukherjee et al 2018 in the rest of this section we show the effect of these rossby waves on the heat budget and sst in the bay 3 2 southern bay 3 2 1 zonal section at 7 n the westward propagation of rossby waves is striking in the heat budget hovmöller diagrams for the zonal section at 7 n fig 6a during april the sun warms the southern bay and the net air sea flux is into the ocean fig 6ab because the net shortwave flux is high fig 6ba and the latent heat flux is low fig 6bb owing to weak winds fig 6bc yet even in april when the dominance of air sea fluxes fig 6ab is evident horizontal advection fig 6ad makes an important contribution to the sst tendency fig 6aa near the eastern boundary and to the west of the event marker for event 07r06u an upwelling rossby wave fig 4 table 5 the horizontal advection of heat tends to occur in bursts that transport eastward warm or cold water this eastward transport by the smc is evident in the orientation of these red warming and blue cooling bands fig 6ad these bursts tend to terminate roughly at some event markers the significant contribution of horizontal advection in april is limited to the west of the rossby events 07r06u and 07r07d fig 6ad this weakening of horizontal advection east of the event marker is seen again later during the summer monsoon to the east of the strong rossby events 07r09d and 07r11d the high frequency upwelling events fig 4ad superimposed on the low frequency downwelling fig 4ac weaken the seasonal downwelling fig 4ab between the high frequency downwelling events 07r07d 07r09d and 07r11d which tend to enhance the seasonal downwelling the heat budget analysis shows that the contribution of horizontal advection weakens significantly to the east of the event marker for 07r09d in may june and 07r11d in august september fig 6ad a similar weakening east of these event markers is also seen for vertical advection fig 6ae and entrainment fig 6af as a result the direct contribution of oceanic processes to the sst tendency tends to terminate at the event markers for the strong downwelling rossby events and is weaker to their east fig 6ac since the rossby waves propagate westward the contribution of oceanic processes tends to be restricted farther and farther west as the season progresses for example this eastern limit is 97 e during the second half of may event 07r09d and shifts from 93 e at the end of may 07r09d to 84 e by mid september 07r12u because of the westward propagation of multiple rossby wave events the contribution of air sea fluxes fig 6ab is weaker than that of oceanic processes fig 6bc after april but these fluxes still warm the ml to the west of the events markers for 07r11d and 07r12u during august fig 6ab as with oceanic processes the contribution of even air sea fluxes to the sst tendency is weak in the eastern bay fig 6ab therefore the eastern limit of the regime of high sst variation shifts farther west as the season progresses fig 6aa though the salt budget in the southern bay is dominated by oceanic processes there is a similar westward shift in the strong advective contribution to the sss tendency fig s11 a since these oceanic processes horizontal and vertical advection and entrainment are explicitly accounted for in eqs 1 and 3 their contribution to the sst and sss tendencies is captured in these budget estimates figs 6 s11 we refer to this contribution of oceanic processes as the direct role of dynamics in the heat budget this direct contribution of oceanic processes is significant to the west of the rossby wave events because of the large contribution they make to the sst and sss tendencies and it is this direct role that is referred to in the earlier heat budget studies behara and vinayachandran 2016 rao et al 2011 thangaprakash et al 2016 pang et al 2019 buckley et al 2020 this direct contribution shows up in the warming and cooling bursts evident to the east of the event markers for the strong downwelling events a careful examination of the advection components shows that a combination of both zonal and meridional advection contributes to these bursts east of the event markers i e behind the rossby waves this direct contribution of horizontal advection is weak figs 6ad s11ad because the zonal current is weak behind the rossby wave fig 4aa mccreary et al 1993 1996 and the strong advection of heat therefore tends to terminate roughly at the event markers fig 6ad a similar weakening east of the event markers occurs for the air sea fluxes fig 6ab vertical advection fig 6ae and entrainment fig 6af leading to a weak variation of sst fig 6aa bd we show below however that ocean dynamics plays a subtler indirect role to the east of these event markers and it is this indirect role of dynamics that leads to the weak variation of sst in the eastern bay where the downwelling effect of the rossby waves is first felt 3 2 2 model moorings at 7 n to bring out this indirect role of ocean dynamics we analyse the processes at three mm locations on the zonal section at 7 n we start with mm3 the easternmost location fig 2 because rossby waves propagate westward sla at mm3 tends to increase from april following the passage of event 07r06u till early july owing to the downwelling associated with event 07r07d and 07r09d figs 4ab 7bb the small decrease in early april is due to upwelling favourable ekman pumping weakening the downwelling due to 07r07d case c07a in fig 4b and the flattening of the sla curve in the first half of june fig 7bb is due to event 07r08u the thermocline s movement mirrors this change in sla the correlation between sla and d25 is 0 9 which is significant at the 99 level d25 at mm3 deepens from 60 m at the beginning of april to over 100 m by the mid june fig 7ba subsequently sla and d25 oscillate as alternating upwelling and downwelling rossby waves pass through mm3 in the first half of july sla falls d25 shallows to 90 m owing to event 07r10u then rises d25 deepens from mid july till mid august owing to event 07r11d then falls d25 shallows in the second half of august owing to event 07r12u then rises d25 deepens through september owing to event 07r15d before falling d25 shallowing again in october owing to event 07r16u the magnitude of these deepening and shallowing events depends on the strength of the rossby wave but each such wave leaves its mark on the sla fig 7bb and d25 fig 7ba at mm3 the thermocline remains deep however with d25 shallowing above its depth level of 1 april only briefly in the first half of september and in mid october the mld does not necessarily follow the movement of d25 for example it alternately shallows deepens and shallows in april even as d25 deepens fig 7ba a barrier layer 10 25 m thick forms during april figs 7ba s11bc when the ml shallows and d25 deepens but it is eroded in may when the ml deepens even as d25 shallows a thicker bl 40 m forms again in mid july when the ml shallows rapidly by over 40 m from 80 m to 40 m the corresponding decrease in d25 is 20 m from 110 m to 90 m half the change in the mld these large changes in mld are not reflected in the sst at mm3 fig 7bc which increases owing to a positive net air sea flux fig 7bc and a heating burst due to horizontal advection fig 7bf in april but decreases during may july before the sst curve flattens out from mid july to october the weak variation in sst during this period is mirrored by weak contributions to the sst tendency fig 7bd from air sea fluxes fig 7bd horizontal and vertical advection fig 7bf and entrainment fig 7be the three sharp cooling bursts in the sst tendency during this period fig 7bd are driven by horizontal 31 may 3 june and 7 13 july and vertical 30 july 3 august advection fig 7bf entrainment tends to be weak at mm3 in spite of strong wind bursts fig 7be to which the ml responds fig 7ba this relation between the mld and wind speed is apparent in the high wavelet coherence between them fig 7bg this weak entrainment is due to the deep thermocline the mld can change by a few tens of metres owing to a weakening of the wind as it does in mid july fig 7ba without a corresponding change in sst fig 7bd because the deep thermocline implies that a thick barrier layer forms as the ml shallows fig 7ba when the wind strengthens again after 18 july implying an increase in the turbulent kinetic energy input to the ml it deepens and the barrier layer erodes but this shallowing and deepening of the ml is accompanied by but a small change in sst fig 7c the deep ml also implies a weak sst response to air sea fluxes because the heat flux into the ocean has to be distributed over a thicker ml the deep thermocline that enables this decoupling between mld and sst is due to rossby waves whose westward propagation implies that the equatorially forced downwelling is felt later in the season in the western bay mm2 87 e lies close to the eastern limit of the strong smc fig 4aa shankar et al 2002 2007 therefore the intraseasonal bursts associated with the horizontal advection of heat rao et al 2006a are felt more strongly there figs 6ad 7af compared to mm3 figs 6ad 7bf but not as strongly as farther west at mm1 figs 6ad s12f the upwelling rossby event 07r06u and ekman pumping shallow the thermocline at mm2 till mid may following which the thermocline then alternately deepens and shallows owing to events 07r07d 07r08u 07r09d 07r10u and 07r11d figs 4ab bb 7aa the sst tendency and the contributions of air sea fluxes fig 7ad and advection fig 7af weaken when the thermocline deepens during 07r11d and strengthen when the thermocline shallows 07r08u and 07r10u but a persistent near zero sst tendency is seen only from 25 august to the end of september fig 7ad when the deep thermocline fig 7aa and high slas fig 7ab forced by event 07r11d persist for over a month during the other two downwelling events the deepening of the thermocline is short lived and it shallows rapidly owing to the upwelling events that follow them yet as noted above the significant shallowing and deepening of the thermocline due to these short period rossby events is reflected in the strengthening and weakening of the horizontal advection of heat farther west at mm1 the smc fig 4aa and the bursts in horizontal advection of heat are stronger figs 6 s12f therefore the sst tendency at mm1 is stronger during the downwelling events 07r07d and 07r09d fig s12d compared to mm2 fig 7ad it is only after 15 september when event 07r11d fig 4ab forces a deepening of the thermocline that lasts till mid october fig s12a that the sst tendency and the contribution of air sea fluxes fig s12d and advection weaken fig s12f thus in addition to its direct role via advection ocean dynamics plays an indirect role in determining the sst via the shallowing and deepening of the thermocline associated with rossby waves in this indirect role as discussed above the ocean essentially takes itself out of the heat budget equation the terms on the right hand side rhs of eq 1 are nearly zero when the thermocline is deep leading to a near zero sst tendency horizontal advection of heat weakens significantly behind the rossby wave figs 6ad 7bf owing to the weakening of the zonal current behind it fig 4aa while vertical advection figs 6ae 7bf and entrainment figs 6af 7be weaken owing to the deep thermocline fig 7ba the deep thermocline by permitting the existence of deep mls fig 7ba also leads to a significant weakening of the contribution of air sea fluxes fig 6ab 7bd to the sst tendency figs 6aa 7bd this indirect role is therefore felt more strongly in the eastern bay because the thermocline is deeper there in contrast the direct role of advection is more strongly manifest in the western bay owing to the strong smc fig 6ad and the shallower thermocline figs 7aa s12a it is only during the downwelling rossby wave events that the thermocline in the western bay deepens enough for the indirect role to be seen and a near zero sst tendency therefore occurs for shorter durations figs 7ad s12d during these downwelling pulses 3 3 northern bay 3 3 1 zonal section at 18 n the northern bay is narrower than the southern bay the basin width is 11 at 18 n compared to 15 at 7 n figs 1 2 5 another major difference is the freshwater inflow into the northern bay fig 2ba bb and observations show that this high freshwater inflow exercises a significant control on the mld and leads to the formation of a barrier layer vinayachandran et al 2002 thadathil et al 2007 sengupta et al 2016 this freshwater inflow is not uniform however and the sss can change by 1 psu over just a few km and within a few hours in the northern bay hormann et al 2016 mackinnon et al 2016 lucas et al 2016 sarkar et al 2016 shroyer et al 2016 jampana et al 2019 with instabilities and turbulent fluxes driving the mixing in these dynamically rich salinity fronts that have a high salinity gradient sarkar et al 2016 it is not surprising that the vertical turbulent fluxes can vary by an order of magnitude over a few km in the northern bay adams et al 2019 owing to their emphasis on the high variability observed in the salinity at short spatial and temporal scales these studies emphasise the dominance of freshwater influence in the northern bay and the role of thermocline movement is ignored yet the mooring data whether at 90 e 18 n thangaprakash et al 2016 or 89 5 e 18 n kantha et al 2019 show a significant vertical movement of the thermocline and simulations with a one dimensional model cannot reproduce the observed vertical profile owing to its inability to account for the upwelling and downwelling kantha et al 2019 we show below that downwelling forced by dynamical processes also plays an important role in determining the evolution of the mixed layer and barrier layer and therefore of sst as in the southern bay this downwelling is forced not just by local ekman pumping as suggested by pang et al 2019 but also remotely from the eio the rossby waves at 18 n fig 5aa restrict the contribution of horizontal advection to the northwestern bay from 27 april to 25 july the rossby wave associated with event 18r03u propagates from 90 e to 87 e table 7 and the strong cooling and warming by horizontal advection are confined to the west of this wave and terminate roughly at the event markers fig 8ad later in the season the eastern limit of the effect of oceanic processes is constrained by event 18r06u figs 5aa 8ad table 7 this bounding role of the rossby waves is striking even in the sss field which shows a higher lower salinity to the west east of the marker for event 18r06u fig 8be yet since the freshwater inflow into the northern bay is biased towards the east irrespective of whether the source is rainfall fig 2bb or river discharge fig 2ba horizontal advection contributes significantly to the salt budget even in the northeastern bay fig 9a 3 3 2 model moorings at 18 n that the rossby waves limit the effect of horizontal advection on the sst tendency to their west fig 8ad suggests that the indirect role of ocean dynamics should be evident at mm7 in the northeastern bay the current is weak at mm7 table 4 which lies on the slope at the eastern boundary of the northern bay fig 1 at mm7 d25 deepens from less than 30 m on 1 april to over 90 m on 30 june fig 10ba owing to downwelling driven partly from the eio kelvin waves k07 k11 and partly by downwelling favourable alongshore winds at the eastern boundary figs 5aa 10be d25 remains deeper than 75 m till the end of october fig 10ba the deep thermocline permits the existence of a deep ml but the ml shallows because sss decreases through april october as a consequence of horizontal advection of freshwater during april may fig 9ad and rainfall thereafter figs 9ab bb hence a thick barrier layer is seen at mm7 fig 9ba c yet as is evident from the high coherence between the mld and wind speed during july september fig 10bg the local winds play an important role in determining the mld even after the lowering of sss at mm7 the thick barrier layer and deep thermocline imply negligible contributions from vertical advection figs 8ae 10bf and entrainment figs 8af 10be to the sst tendency the weakening of the zonal current behind the rossby waves also implies weak horizontal advection to the east of the event markers fig 8ad 10bf therefore the sst responds directly to the air sea fluxes during july october fig 10ad but the sst changes little during this period even though the net flux changes as much as or more than it does during may june fig 10ac the indirect role of ocean dynamics is therefore evident in the northeastern bay just as it was in the southeastern bay but with the inflow of freshwater from rainfall and rivers providing an additional mechanism for shallowing the ml this subtle indirect role is seen in the observations as well at a nearby location 90 e 18 n fig 4 of thangaprakash et al 2016 but thangaprakash et al 2016 do not invoke vertical processes other than mixing prasad 2004 the role of upwelling and downwelling in determining the vertical profile of temperature is however noted by kantha et al 2019 at mm6 in the northwestern bay horizontal advection makes a significant contribution to the sst tendency figs 8ad 10af behara and vinayachandran 2016 and the shallower thermocline leads to a thinner barrier layer even when the ml shallows considerably in response to a decrease in salinity or a weakening of the winds fig 10a thus as in the southwestern bay the direct role of advection is prominent in the northwestern bay fig 8ad e 3 4 central bay the central bay differs from the southern bay because the strong zonal current at 7 n fig 4aa is absent at 12 n fig s7aa it also differs from the northern bay because the freshwater inflow is much lower at 12 n compared to 18 n fig 2ba b yet the central bay also shows the same difference in the higher contribution of oceanic processes to the sst tendency in the western bay compared to the eastern bay fig 11a the thermocline is deeper at mm5 in the east central bay fig s14ba compared to mm4 in the west central bay fig s14aa and the indirect role of ocean dynamics is therefore evident in the weak sst tendency at mm5 and its match with the air sea fluxes fig s14bd for completeness the salinity budget is also presented in fig s15 4 discussion before presenting the summary and conclusions section 4 2 we distinguish the westward propagations identified as rossby waves in section 3 1 from eddies section 4 1 this distinction is made to show that rossby waves contribute even at the short spatial and temporal scales period less than 30 days usually associated with eddies in the literature 4 1 rossby waves and eddies the indirect role of dynamics in the heat budget via modulation of the thermocline depth and the restriction of the direct role to the western bay during the summer monsoon is primarily due to the seasonal downwelling associated with large scale rossby waves figs 4ac s7ac 5ac the equatorially forced kelvin waves can be tracked along the eio fig 3a and the eastern boundary fig 3b adding to this effect of equatorial forcing at the eastern boundary fig 3b is the forcing by alongshore winds at 7 n fig 4ba 12 n fig s7ba and 18 n fig 5ba the sla response to the combined forcing by equatorial waves and alongshore winds propagates westward into the bay figs 4a s7 a 5a we have identified the westward propagations from the eastern boundary as free rossby waves which are modified by ekman pumping figs 4bb s7bb 5bb as they propagate westward into the bay figs 4ab s7ab 5ab what is striking however is that the equatorial forcing includes not only the low frequency component associated often with the dominant semi annual cycle figs 4ac s7ac 5ac jensen 1993 han et al 2011 but also a high frequency component with period less than 30 days figs 4ad s7ad 5ad likewise the high frequency component is comparable to the low frequency component for the alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and for ekman pumping figs 4b s7b 5b this significant forcing at periods much shorter than the seasonal cycle leads not only to short temporal scales in the response but also to short spatial scales these short scale rossby waves play a significant role in modulating the thermocline depth in the bay with alternating downwelling and upwelling bursts evident even at periods shorter than 30 days figs 4ad s7ad 5ad it is easy to mistake these short spatial scales for eddies but the events identified in section 3 1 are clearly rossby waves for the following three reasons first the westward propagation associated with these short period and short spatial scale features occurs at the same speed as the rossby waves figs 3a 4a s7 a 5a such a uniform propagation speed is not characteristic of eddies cheng et al 2018 state that eddies with a periodicity ranging from 30 120 days are generated in the central bay and then propagate southwestward another detailed study of eddies in the bay is by chen et al 2012 who estimate speed ranges of 2 5 cm s 1 2 9 cm s 1 and 2 11 cm s 1 for eddies in the northern north of 15 n central 10 15 n and southern south of 10 n respectively these speed ranges do not match the speeds estimated from the hovmöller diagrams of slas at 7 n fig 4a 12 n fig s7 a and 18 n fig 5a and chen et al 2012 concluded that the eddy speeds estimated by them are much less than the speed associated with rossby waves therefore it seems reasonable to interpret even the high frequency westward propagations seen in the bay as rossby waves because they can be traced back to the eio second the striking collapse of the zonal current behind the rossby waves figs 4aa s7aa 5aa mccreary et al 1993 1996 is a characteristic feature of these waves as shown by mccreary 1977 a rossby wave propagating into a uniform ekman drift forced by meridional winds would leave behind it a balance between the meridional pressure gradient and the wind stress in the inviscid system there will be no current behind the wave inclusion of friction weakly modifies the solution but the current still weakens significantly behind the wave eddies do not interact with an opposing zonal flow in a similar manner suggesting again that the westward propagation seen in the hovmöller diagrams figs 4a s7a 5a is due to rossby waves with a much weaker contribution from eddies which are expected to be advected at least partly by the mean flow that said a clarification is required because mccreary 1977 derived the above solution for a wind forcing that was switched on and then kept constant it is known that the response to a switched on wind forcing differs from the response to a periodic wind forcing because the latter solution has a critical latitude with only rossby waves existing equatorward of this latitude and poleward propagating kelvin waves poleward of it moore 1968 mccreary 1977 1980 1985 we argue that this distinction must however be applied with caution because a purely periodic forcing and the associated periodic response are not seen in the real ocean as is evident from a time longitude plot of the semi annual wavelet power of the model sla field in the eio fig s16 the strength of the semi annual harmonic the strongest of the seasonal periodicities noted in the eio jensen 1993 han et al 2011 varies over time during the period of interest the wavelet power in this band drops sharply during 2006 2007 and 2010 this significant modulation of the wavelet power in the dominant seasonal band implies that the wind forcing is a mixture of the switched on and periodic functions the signal is switched on at some time oscillates for say 2 3 years before it is switched off for a year or two then it is switched on again the duration of the oscillatory part extends over but a few semi annual cycles not sufficient for the periodic nature to manifest before the switch is turned off a similar behaviour is seen in the altimeter slas for the semi annual band it is not surprising therefore that this intermittency is more striking at the intraseasonal periods this intermittency implies that neither the forcing nor the response is purely periodic because a periodic function by definition extends from to in time which is not the case in fig s16 in summary therefore though the solution of mccreary 1977 was derived for a switched on not periodic forcing the intermittent nature of the forcing and response implies that it is applicable to the real ocean or to the oceanic response in an ogcm forced by realistic winds hence while the analytic solutions provide insight into the dynamics of the real ocean or an ogcm simulation they must be used and interpreted with caution third as discussed in section 3 1 there is evidence in altimeter data for rossby waves propagating into the bay at periods roughly associated with the madden julian oscillation vialard et al 2009 girishkumar et al 2011 the slas at these and shorter periods are determined essentially by the first two baroclinic modes and the model is therefore able to simulate them well mukherjee et al 2018 mukherjee et al 2018 showed however that it is more difficult to simulate the current because of the significant contribution from high order baroclinic modes mccreary 1980 1985 which lead to a downward bending of energy in the form of beams mccreary 1984 nethery and shankar 2007 matthews et al 2007 amol et al 2012 2014 mukherjee et al 2014 the above analysis is qualitative and based on association both temporal and spatial of forcing mechanisms and the response a quantitative separation of the sla response to each forcing mechanism will demand the use of a linear model shankar et al 1996 mccreary et al 1996 shankar et al 2002 mukherjee et al 2018 we refrain from carrying out this analysis as our purpose is limited to showing that a sequence of downwelling and upwelling rossby waves can be identified in the model slas along the three zonal sections these waves can be associated with the three forcing mechanisms identified in the literature and they can be associated with periods much shorter than the seasonal cycle 4 2 summary and conclusions most of the earlier heat budget studies of the bay of bengal have concluded that the sst in the bay is controlled by the air sea fluxes see for example sengupta and ravichandran 2001 shenoi et al 2002 schiller and godfrey 2003 waliser et al 2004 de boyer montégut et al 2007 duncan and han 2009 vialard et al 2012 behara and vinayachandran 2016 li et al 2017b thangaprakash et al 2016 our model results based on zonal sections and a spread of model mooring or mm locations across the basin show that horizontal advection and to a somewhat lesser extent vertical advection make a significant and direct contribution to the heat budget of the western bay because their contribution to the sst tendency is at least comparable to that due to air sea fluxes figs 6 7 s12 8 10 11 s14 in the eastern bay downwelling rossby waves forced largely from the eio but significantly modified by alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and ekman pumping all over the basin control the dynamics because the current tends to weaken behind the wavefront mccreary et al 1993 1996 the weakening of the horizontal current implies a weak contribution of horizontal advection in the eastern bay and the strong horizontal advection tends to terminate at the event markers that denote the stronger downwelling rossby wavefronts figs 6ad 8ad the rossby waves also deepen the thermocline d25 or d20 implying downwelling and a weak role for vertical advection the deepening of the thermocline leads to the net flux into the ocean being distributed over a larger depth range implying a weak contribution of air sea fluxes to the budget therefore sst changes much less during the summer monsoon in the eastern bay compared to the western bay figs 6 7 s12 8 10 11 s14 the downwelling associated with this rossby wave makes possible the existence of a deeper ml the actual depth of the ml in this deep thermocline regime depends however on the turbulent kinetic energy input by the local winds because a higher momentum flux is required to maintain a deep ml therefore there is a strong relation between the local winds and the ml in the eastern bay figs 7 s12 10 s14 the rossby wave essentially conditions the upper ocean say above d25 by limiting the potential depth of the mixed layer upwelling downwelling rossby waves decrease increase this potential depth in the northern bay the inflow of freshwater from rainfall and rivers provides an additional mechanism for shallowing the ml fig 12 summarises the processes controlling the evolution of the mixed layer and sst stratification due to air sea fluxes and horizontal advection turbulent mixing by winds and vertical movement of the thermocline our results emphasise the role of the thermocline movement driven by the passage of both remotely and locally forced rossby waves in the bay since the rossby waves move westward slowly across the bay this effect of downwelling on the heat budget is seen later during the summer monsoon in the southwestern bay what is striking is the series of equatorial kelvin waves that can be tracked along the eastern boundary fig 3 and westward into the bay fig 4 s7 5 the significant contribution of all three forcing mechanisms equatorial kelvin waves alongshore winds at the eastern boundary and ekman pumping even at periods shorter than 30 days implies that we can track 17 upwelling and downwelling favourable rossby waves during april october 2005 figs 4 s7 5 therefore earlier during the summer monsoon d25 oscillates much more in the western bay figs 7 s12 s14 10 where the upwelling forced by ekman pumping figs 4 s7 5 is strong and overwhelms the downwelling forced largely from the eio but supplemented by alongshore winds and downwelling favourable ekman pumping in the eastern bay it is this difference between a shallow and deep thermocline that makes the indirect effect of ocean dynamics important for a heat budget analysis when the thermocline is deep the mld can vary owing to changes in the wind speed without it affecting the sst when the thermocline is shallow however an increase in mld is accompanied by a decrease in sst in both cases however the analysis will show that the mld responds to the local winds suggesting that the air sea flux of momentum controls the mld what is often missed in such an analysis is that the rossby waves exercise a control on the potential vertical extent of the ml when the ocean s dynamical processes deepen the thermocline via rossby waves the ocean tends to take itself out of the heat budget equation because all terms on the rhs of eq 1 tend to vanish leading to the apparent dominance of air sea fluxes because the net flux tends to be correlated with the sst this correlation is misleading however because the variation of sst tends to be weak when the thermocline is deep this indirect role of dynamics is clearly seen even in the northern bay in the model fig 10 and in mooring data shown in thangaprakash et al 2016 and kantha et al 2019 at 18 n but has not been given its due importance high resolution one dimensional models forced with accurate freshwater fluxes and air sea fluxes fail to simulate the ml variability because they ignore this indirect role of thermocline movement kantha et al 2019 thus both approaches one dimensional models and ogcms have their respective strengths and limitations the insights gained from the ogcms are useful for understanding how the ml responds to the passage of the rossby waves which make an important contribution in determining the large scale spatio temporal variability of the ml in the bay better parameterisation of the effect of short scale salinity changes on the scale of the model grid would be a welcome improvement but achieving this ability will demand a quantum leap in our ability to observe the ocean and in our understanding of how the near surface ocean couples to the atmosphere averaging zonally across the bay obviously obscures the direct role of ocean dynamics in driving sst changes via horizontal and vertical advection leading to the misleading inference of air sea fluxes controlling the sst in the bay the averaging also obscures the more subtle indirect role played by ocean dynamics via its control on the depth of the thermocline say d25 therefore studies of intraseasonal sst variability that use such zonal averages tend to emphasise the role of wind driven mixing and air sea fluxes over dynamical processes like advection fig 13 duncan and han 2009 vialard et al 2012 li et al 2017b the zonal asymmetry also leads mooring based analyses to the same conclusion thangaprakash et al 2016 owing to the skewed distribution of moorings in the bay nevertheless while pointing to the drawback of zonal averaging in estimating the heat budget we note that there will be situations in which such zonal averaging may be useful an example is the southern bay box used by shankar et al 2007 they showed that averaging over 82 88 e and 4 8 n allowed an estimate of the meridional sst gradient that led the rainfall over the central bay but extending the eastern limit of the box by just 2 to 90 e led to a significant decrease in the number of such related events whether it is appropriate to use zonal averages or not will depend on the goal of the analysis the inference drawn must be carefully weighed to factor in the possible indirect role of the ocean in determining mld and sst our results are based on an ogcm simulation implications in a coupled system are of interest because the rossby wave takes 2 3 months comparable to the duration of the summer monsoon to traverse the basin though we picked one year 2005 to analyse the impact of dynamics on the sst as it was a neutral year with respect to the large scale climate modes this effect of dynamics is seen in other years as well but the intensity of the rossby waves varies from year to year in spite of these year to year differences however the basic conclusion of this paper that ocean dynamics affects the sst in the bay both directly and indirectly is evident in all years a detailed study on the implications of these climate modes on the rossby waves in the bay and the corresponding effect on the mixed layer processes is therefore of interest as it may provide insights into the ocean s role in modulating the interannual variability associated with the indian summer monsoon the significance of our result lies in the slow westward propagating rossby wave being perhaps the most predictable feature of the ocean s large scale circulation credit authorship contribution statement

23869,coordinate and resolution dependence of three second moment turbulent closure models are studied using one dimensional navy coastal ocean model ncom experiments and large eddy simulations at ocean station papa our results suggest that finer resolution near the base of the mixed layer is critical for better model performance a mixed layer enhanced vertical grid is proposed that outperforms both the uniform and the stretched grids with significantly fewer vertical layers used for the new grid the model accuracy is strongly dependent on the resolution near the base of the mixed layer and not affected much by the total number of vertical layers used however given the success of the new grid the lack of representation for the near inertial gravity waves below the mixed layer has hampered the ability of second moment turbulent closure models on accurate representation of turbulent mixing in the water column while both the langmuir circulation and the variation of surface heat fluxes are shown to be able to significantly change the strength of the near inertial waves they have negligible effect on the eddy viscosity in the transition layer keywords second moment turbulent closure models vertical coordinate vertical resolution mixed layer enhanced grid near inertial gravity waves 1 introduction turbulent mixing plays an important role in the transport of momentum heat and particles across the mixed layer and is critical to the vertical distribution of heat and salinity in the water column although the structure of turbulent eddies can be simulated by direct numerical simulations or large eddy simulations it is too expensive and unrealistic to solve for the turbulence in geophysical models for timely predictions of the flow fields over large areas such as those of metzger et al 2017 and rowley and mask 2014 thus parameterizations are required to provide an idealized description of turbulence with a reasonable compromise between cost and accuracy second moment turbulent closure smtc models are among the most popular approaches used to parameterize turbulence in the geophysical models the mellor yamadalevel 2 5 model mellor and yamada 1982 hereafter my2 5 has been used in many ocean and atmosphere models during the past several decades although there are some major shortcomings of the method that lead to smaller critical richardson number and shallower boundary layer depth canuto et al 2001 cheng et al 2002 it is still popularly used because the scheme considers the energetics of the mixing explicitly by solving diagnostic and prognostic equations respectively for the turbulent kinetic energy tke and turbulent length scale since these equations carry information about the time history of the turbulence and thus can account for both advection and diffusion of the tke as people gradually recognized the importance of surface gravity waves in upper ocean mixing through langmuir turbulence kantha and clayson 2004 hereafter kc04 added vortex forcing to the mellor yamada type smtc model to represent the effect of surface waves and their scheme has been adapted into several ocean circulation models later on harcourt 2015 hereafter h15 further improved the smtc model by incorporating the vortex forcing in the stability equations as well these three smtc models are currently implemented in the navy coastal ocean model ncom note kantha et al 2010 has pointed out that the value of closure constant e 6 was reported incorrectly in kc04 and recharacterized it to be 7 2 instead of 4 0 this correction has been adapted into ncom although the model is still labeled kc04 aside from turbulent mixing schemes the choice of vertical coordinate system is another important aspect of the ocean model s design as pointed out by griffies et al 2000 the representation and parameterization of processes not resolved by the model grid are often directly linked to the vertical coordinate choice while many ocean models have flexible choices for vertical coordinate systems and resolution it is unclear how these choices influence the representation of the boundary layer eddy effects under various turbulent closure models in this study we will address the coordinate and resolution dependence of the my2 5 kc04 and h15 schemes and explore their limitations in turbulence representations using ncom and large eddy simulation experiments the data and methods are described in section 2 results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 observational data hourly meteorological 10 m wind net surface heat flux and oceanographic temperature salinity data for this study are obtained from the moorings at ocean station papa osp operated by the ocean climate stations ocs group at pacific marine environmental laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa pmel send et al 2010 osp is a deep water station with a water depth of more than 4 km located at 144 9 w 50 1 n 850 miles off the british columbia coast the station is within the subpolar northeastern pacific gyre and thus experiences strong and frequent winter storms for this study a 15 day period starting from 14 november 2011 at 1utc was selected when osp experienced large variations in wind forcing and several cooling events the wind speed was low and mostly below 5 m s 1 during the first two days and then rapidly strengthened to more than 20 m s 1 by the end of november 16 fig 1a at the same time large sensible and latent heat fluxes at the ocean surface associated with the powerful winds led to a strong net cooling flux 450 w m 2 that closely follows the variation of the air temperature fig 1c the variation of the sea surface temperature sst on the other hand is gradual and at much lower frequency fig 1d the winds gradually weakened while fluctuating afterwards with several weak cooling events associated with short periods of wind speed increases concurrent detailed two dimensional wave spectra e σ θ were collected nearby by the applied physics laboratory at the university of washington using a 0 9 m datawell directional waverider thomson et al 2013 here σ and θ are the frequency and direction of the spectra hourly stokes drift profile time series were computed from e σ θ following kenyon 1969 1 u s z 2 σ k e σ θ e 2 k z d σ d θ where k is the wave number vector of the spectra the variation of the surface stokes drift closely follows the variation of the wind speed during most of the 15 day period fig 1b indicating wind sea dominance at the location 2 2 the navy coastal ocean model ncom experiments ncom is a hydrostatic model that solves the primitive equations it uses a staggered arakawa c grid with elevation and the main scalar temperature and salinity fields defined at the grid cell centers and velocities defined at the center of the grid cell faces turbulence fields for the mixing models and the vertical eddy coefficients are defined at the center of the top face of the grid cells where the vertical velocity points are defined aside from the two vertical grid types uniform and uniformly stretched implemented the model can also use vertical grids specified by the user through external input files more details on the model can be found in martin 2000 in this study we use one dimensional ncom to test the performance of the my2 5 kc04 and h15 schemes at osp we only simulate the top 200 m of the water column because the observations suggest that the mixed layer depth mld varied between 60 and 88 m during our simulation period for each turbulent closure model experiments are conducted for three types of vertical grids with 5 grid resolution options 30 40 50 80 and 100 layers the uniform grid ug as the name suggests uses constant spacing between model vertical grid points throughout the water column fig 2a dotted lines the uniformly stretched grid usg also known as logarithmically stretched grid is designed so that each layer is thicker than the layer above by a fixed percentage thus the grid achieves higher resolution near the water surface fig 2a dashed lines all five usg grids use 1 m resolution at the surface the stretch factor for each grid is determined based on the number of layers chosen within the 200 m vertical model domain for that particular grid which are 11 03 7 01 4 86 2 06 and 1 28 for the 30 40 50 80 and 100 layer grid respectively this study also proposes a third type of vertical coordinate system the mixed layer enhanced grid mleg which uses higher resolution both at the water surface and near bottom of the mixed layer fig 2a solid lines the detailed design of the mleg is illustrated in fig 3 the vertical model domain is separated into three regions region 1 goes from the surface to the top of the mixed layer base at 60 m depth in this study region 2 goes from top to bottom of the mixed layer base between 60 and 80 m in this study and the water column below the bottom of the mixed layer base is region 3 in region 1 the grid is first uniformly stretched from surface to the midpoint of the region the resolution in the first layer is set to be the minimum resolution of δ z m i n 2 m for the 30 40 and 50 layer cases and 1 m for the 80 and 100 layer cases in this study then the vertical grid is reversely uniform stretched from the midpoint to the bottom of region 1 top of the mixed layer base where the resolution is reduced back to δ z m i n thus in region 1 the grid points above and below the midpoint are symmetrically distributed about the midpoint in region 2 uniform grid is used with resolution δ z m i n in region 3 the grid is uniformly stretched from the bottom of the mixed layer base to the bottom of the model domain the results of the ncom simulations are presented in section 3 where all experiments are represented by the grid type and layer numbers for example experiment ug50 represents uniform grid with 50 layers 2 3 the large eddy simulation les model the ncar les solves the wave phase averaged craik leibovich equations craik and leibovich 1976 to include the effect of surface gravity waves through vortex force stokes coriolis force lagrangian mean advection associated with stokes drift and a wave averaged increment to pressure that arises through conservative wave current interactions detailed model formulations have been reported in existing publications e g mcwilliams et al 1997 sullivan et al 2007 and are not repeated here les models differ from smtc models in that the large turbulent eddies are explicitly resolved in the les down to the grid resolution and only the smaller eddies are modeled or parameterized so it can better resolve the turbulence in the water column the ncar les model has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to different meteorological forcing and oceanic conditions kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2017 fan et al 2018 2020 in the simulation at osp the observed temperature and salinity variations in the water column are also well represented by the les model during the 15 day simulation period fig 1d f since there are no observations of the turbulence structures at osp the les simulated turbulence is used to evaluate the performance of the smtc models mld defined as the depth where changes of the potential density referenced to surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 estimated by the les simulation is also used to evaluate the ncom simulated mld since the vertical resolution of the temperature and salinity measurements are coarse see black dots in fig 1e and f for measurement depth 3 results 3 1 vertical grid and resolution dependence of the smtc models the ug and usg grid options are currently implemented in ncom while the ug grid is easier to apply the usg grid is usually preferred because its finer resolution in the upper layers can better resolve the vertical structure of the flow field generated by the imposed surface forcing as expected for both grid types higher resolution more layers gives smaller mld error relative to the les result for all three turbulent closure models table 1 fig 2b d while the differences in sst errors are relatively small among different resolutions table 1 root mean square error of sea surface temperature sst relative to observations and mixed layer depth mld relative to les results for all ncom experiments include three turbulent mixing schemes my2 5 kc04 and h15 with different grid types and resolution the green and red shaded cells indicate the minimum and maximum errors for sst and mld for each scheme interestingly for low resolution 30 or 40 layers simulations larger mld errors are found in experiments using the usg grid than that using the ug grid even though the usg grid uses much higher surface resolution fig 2a especially towards the end of the simulation the mld in the ug30 experiment is 1 m deeper than that in the usg30 experiment for both the kc04 and h15 schemes fig 2c and 2d a 0 5 m deeper mld in the ug40 experiment than the usg40 experiment was also observed for the my2 5 and h15 model fig 2b and d since the ug30 40 grid provides higher resolution near the base of the mixed layer than the usg30 40 grid fig 2a it could be the reason for the better model performances while finer resolution near the surface is always attempted by ocean modelers the resolution near the base of the mixed layer is often overlooked to better understand its effect on mixed layer simulations a new type of vertical grid the mixed layer enhanced grid mleg is designed so that the same high resolution 2 m for 30 40 and 50 layers and 1 m for 80 and 100 layers is used both at the water surface and near the bottom of the mixed layer from 60 to 80 m depth fig 2a solid lines large improvements in mld simulations are observed using the mleg grid table 1 fig 2 especially for the experiments with lower number of vertical layers up to 2 3 m of deepening are found in the mleg experiments relative to the ug or usg experiments fig 2b d solid lines large reductions in root mean square errors are recorded in the mleg30 experiment relative to the ug30 usg30 experiment 1 7 m and 1 79 m error reduction respectively when the my2 5 scheme is used table 1 also notice that the model simulated sst and mld accuracy in the mleg30 experiments are as good as the ug100 and usg100 experiments for all three smtc models this suggests that using higher resolution near the base of the mixed layer can help us archive higher model accuracy with much lower number of vertical layers and thus a much lower computational cost it is interesting to find that the simulated mld in the mleg30 mleg40 and mleg50 experiments are very similar to each other for all three smtc models fig 2b d the mld in the mleg80 and mleg100 experiments are also visually identical for the my2 5 and kc04 schemes with mleg100 slightly deeper than mleg80 when the h15 scheme is used the root mean square error of mld and sst also show the same characteristics table 1 this feature suggests that resolution at the surface and near the base of the mixed layer is more important than resolution within the middle of the mixed layer simulations using the mleg grids will give very similar accuracy when the same resolution is used at the surface and the base of the mixed layer from 60 to 80 m depth in our case the number of layers used within the middle of the mixed layer has very small effect on the mld accuracy to understand the reason for mixed layer deepening using the mleg grids we diagnose the eddy viscosity k m n c o m and diffusivity k h n c o m from the ncom experiments calculated as 2 k m n c o m l q s m 3 k h n c o m l q s h here q is the square root of twice the tke 1 2 q 2 l is the turbulent length scale and s h c 1 1 c 2 g h and s m c 3 c 4 s h g h 1 c 2 g h are the stratification functions used to describe the effect of stratification on vertical mixing both k m n c o m and k h n c o m are highly dependent on the vertical gradients of current and density in the mixed layer because a l and 1 2 q 2 are solved by the prognostic equations given in appendix derived by mellor and yamada 1982 and are sensitive to the resolved vertical shear of currents and density in the mixed layer b since c 1 to c 5 in s h and s m are empirical constants given in appendix s h and s m only vary with the stratification g h m i n 0 028 l 2 g q 2 ρ 0 ρ z and thus also depend closely on the resolved vertical density ρ shear in the water column here the maximum value of g h is set to be 0 028 based on mellor 2001 in which the author found that the stability functions limit to infinity as g h approaches the value 0 0288 0 028 is used in ncom to keep s h and s m within a reasonable range we only analyze the 30 layer experiments using the my2 5 scheme here since they show the largest differences among different grid types as we can see from fig 4 for the same grid the structure and time variation of k h n c o m and k m n c o m are very similar to each other with small magnitude difference thus we will only focus on the structure of k m n c o m in this section in the ug30 and usg30 experiments the vertical grid resolution around the base of the mixed layer ranges from 7 to 10 m the coarse vertical resolution results in poor representation of the density structures and underestimation of currents in the region that leads to weaker turbulence and the eddy viscosity diminishes several meters above the base of the mixed layer fig 4a and b while in the mleg30 experiment with the much finer resolution 2 m around the base of the mixed layer the current and density gradients are adequately resolved in the region which leads to enhanced turbulence deeper eddy viscosity penetration and consequently deepening of the mixed layer fig 4c especially during the strong cooling event on november 16 a corresponding sharp deepening of 5 m is observed in experiment mleg30 while usg30 only shows a mild gradual deepening of 1 2 m as grant and belcher 2011 has pointed out the vertical gradients of the current velocity change rapidly with depth in the stratified shear layer from above the base of the mixed layer to the base of the boundary layer and thus creates a maximal shear turbulence close to the base of the mixed layer being able to better resolve the current structure there leads to a better representation of the shear turbulence in the mixed layer which is clearly associated with the exchange of heat and momentum between the mixed layer and the thermocline below since the variation of k m n c o m and k h n c o m with depth are small in the middle of the mixed layer see fig 6 for example the vertical resolution in that region has minimal effect on the modeled turbulence in the mixed layer that is why we see almost identical model solutions from experiment mleg30 mleg40 and mleg50 fig 2 note that while the mleg30 experiment gives slightly higher mixed layer integrated tke than ug30 its total tke is almost the same as usg30 fig 5 this is because most of the tke in the water column is confined in a thin layer near the surface since both mleg30 and usg30 use much finer resolution 2 m and 1 m respectively at the surface than ug30 δ z 6 7 m they can better resolve the tke input this is one of the reasons for the preference of higher resolution near surface in ocean circulation models notice that not only the experiments using the kc04 and h15 schemes produce deeper mixed layers than that using the my2 5 scheme the mld differences between the experiments using the ug usg grids and that using the mleg grids are also smaller for these two smtc models fig 2 table 1 this is because for the kc04 and h15 models there are two distinct turbulent processes in the boundary layer the shear turbulence and the langmuir turbulence while the solution of the shear turbulence is highly dependent on the vertical resolution near the base of the mixed layer as shown above the vertical profile of the stokes drift that determines the magnitude of the langmuir turbulence is derived from observations and not affected by the vertical resolution in the model thus while the added langmuir turbulence worked to further deepen the mixed layer in the kc04 and h15 models the overall effect of vertical resolution on the mixed layer turbulence is relatively smaller in these two turbulent closure models 3 2 near inertial gravity waves beneath the mixed layer although the mleg grids can help deepen the mixed layer relative to the ug and usg grids the resulted mld is still much shallower than the les result fig 1g to better understand the reason for the discrepancy we compare k m n c o m in experiments mleg100 using the three smtc models with the eddy viscosity from the les simulation k m l e s which is calculated using the reynolds stress and mean shear following mcwilliams et al 2012 4 k m l e s u w z u l here u w is the horizontal domain averaged total reynold stress and u l is the horizontal domain averaged lagrangian velocity mean current plus stokes drift as we can see in fig 6 the h15 scheme gives the largest k m n c o m in the mixed layer among the three smtc models it can provide similar magnitude of eddy viscosity as the les model within the mixed layer with even deeper depth penetration of high values fig 6c and d however the turbulence in the h15 model is much weaker lower than 10 4 beneath the mixed layer than that in the les simulations part of the reason for the weaker turbulence in these mellor yamada type models is that they assume parameters governing the degree of anisotropy are small thus the turbulence beneath the mixed layer is underestimated in stably stratified fluids another reason that is mainly responsible for the weak turbulence beneath the mixed layer is that the smtc models cannot represent the effect of the downward propagating near inertial gravity waves as demonstrated by the les in its mean flow averaged over the horizontal domain fields given in fig 7 these waves are recognizable by their characteristic circularly polarized velocities and their strong shear is a major contributor to upper ocean mixing and can affect a variety of dynamic processes jochum et al 2012 the frequency f spectrum of the x direction horizontal velocity s x x f at a depth 2 m below the deepest mld during the simulation period reveals a strong peak at 15 60 h fig 8 blue line a little shorter than the inertial period of 15 62 h at osp the shape of the velocity spectrum in our study is very similar to the observed velocity spectra by d asaro 1985 collected close to osp during the ocean storms experiment in the north pacific except the peak energy in our study is much higher due to the stronger wind forcing experience during our study period maximum wind exceeded 20 m s in our study vs less than 10 m s in their study note that our results do not show the two small peaks at the semidiurnal tidal frequency and the frequency band that is twice the inertial frequency as in d asaro 1985 the wave energy in the double inertial frequency band is generated by the interaction between mesoscale eddies and the near inertial currents filamentary structures that are characterized by negative vorticity anomaly can trap the near inertial waves and generate waves of multiples of fundamental inertial frequency danioux and klein 2008 danioux et al 2008 kawaguchi et al 2020 since our les simulations do not include the effect of mesoscale eddies and tides waves in these two frequency bands are not simulated however as suggested by d asaro 1985 the wave energies in these two frequency bands are two orders of magnitude lower than that in the near inertial band and thus has negligible effect on the turbulent mixing in the water column to understand the relative fraction of variance within this near inertial band of frequencies relative to other band of frequencies the variance preserving spectra s x x f times frequency f as a function of log f are given in fig 8b following emery and thomson 2004 the area under the spectral curve between two frequencies i e f 1 and f 2 thus gives a measure of the spectral signal variance in that frequency band 5 σ 2 f 1 f 2 f s x x f d l o g f f 1 f 2 s x x f d f we can see that the near inertial motions are the dominant energy source in the velocity field these near inertial waves have an upward phase propagation and thus a downward energy propagation as opposed to pure inertial motions that are horizontal these slightly super inertial motions have vertical displacements that can modulate the stratification via the wave strain and thus the water column stability alford et al 2016 several observational studies plueddemann and farrar 2006 johnston and rudnick 2009 dohan and davis 2011 sanford et al 2011 have found that the near inertial motions can result in shear across the transition layer that separates the mixed layer from the stratified waters below and is a major mechanism for mixing and deepening of the mixed layer following storms since the momentum and heat diffusivities below the mixed layer are treated as adjustable parameters for the smtc models discussed in this study the effect of near inertial waves is minimized and thus limited their ability to further deepen the mixed layer furthermore these smtc models neglected the material derivative and diffusion terms in the density equations in order to simplify the model mellor and yamada 1982 and thus the downgradient approximation in these models seriously underestimates the third order moments canuto et al 2001 as a result while the smtc models can be justified for stable and slightly unstable flows the scheme is more likely to promote errors in highly unstable conditions such as the deep convection induced by the strong cooling on november 16 while some studies d asaro et al 1995 alford 2003 suggested that these near inertial motions are linked to the wind stress impulses associated with midlatitude storms that typically contain strong inertially rotating components inertial currents advecting langmuir cells over the stratified interior is another suggested cause for these waves polton et al 2008 to test this theory a new les experiment without stokes drift was conducted we can see that the near inertial motions beneath the mixed layer are much weaker without the presence of langmuir turbulence fig 9 while the frequency spectrum still shows a dominant peak at 15 60 h its peak energy is much lower than the experiment with stokes drift fig 8a and the total energy within the near inertial band has been reduced by almost half fig 8b this suggests that both the wind shear and the interaction between langmuir cells and the inertial currents are important for the strength of the near inertial waves while they can be generated by the wind stress impulses alone the presence of surface gravity waves can significantly enhance the magnitude of the waves also notice that the mean currents in the mixed layer become stronger without stokes drift especially near the surface this is because the circular motion of the langmuir cells and the added anti stokes transport by the stokes coriolis force in the along wind direction work together to reduce the downwind velocity near the surface and as a result the mean currents become more uniformly distributed with depth mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 it is interesting to notice that while the eddy viscosity in the mixed layer is greatly reduced in the experiment without stokes drift the magnitude of the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer does not show significant changes fig 6e as discussed earlier there are several cooling events during our simulations period especially on november 16 a large net cooling flux of 450 w m 2 was observed primarily due to the strong sensible and latent heat fluxes at the ocean surface fig 1c since we are not aware of any research that investigates the possible effect of surface heat fluxes on the near inertial gravity waves beneath the mixed layer we will take this opportunity to study its impact here for this purpose one more les experiment is conducted that uses only the wind and stokes forcing with the net heat flux set to zero during the entire simulation period we can see that while the mean currents in the mixed layer have very similar structure and magnitude as the experiment with the heat flux the removal of the net heat flux in the simulation has led to stronger near inertial motions beneath the mixed layer fig 10 there are two possible reasons for this enhancement firstly since the mixed layer depth is shallower in the experiment without heat flux the stokes drift velocity that decays with depth is larger at the base of the mixed layer secondly as fan et al 2020 have suggested the upwelling associated with langmuir circulation at the base of the mixed layer and the downwelling associated with the deep convection triggered by the surface cooling may counteract on each other and hence the removed of the surface cooling has further enabled stronger langmuir circulation at the base of the mixed layer notice that the peak of the horizontal velocity frequency spectrum is shifted slightly towards lower frequency of 16 h instead of 15 60 h when the net heat flux is removed from the forcing fig 8a and the near inertial band is slightly wider than that in the experiment with all forcing and thus contains more kinetic energy in the wave train fig 8b while the magnitude of the eddy viscosity remains similar to the experiment with all forcing its penetration depth within the mixed layer is shallower when the surface heat flux is removed from the simulation fig 6f this is due to the absence of deep convection associated with surface cooling that has led to reduced mixing and thus shallower mixed layer however like the experiment without stokes drift the magnitude of the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer does not show significant changes either when net heat flux is removed from the simulation fig 6f this feature suggests that there is a possibility to parameterize the effect near inertial gravity waves in the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer without having to involve complicated dynamics such as the langmuir turbulence or deep convection 4 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the coordinate and resolution dependence of the mellor and yamada 1982 level 2 5 the kantha and clayson 2004 and the harcourt 2015 turbulent closure models through one dimension ncom experiments and large eddy simulation studies using observed meteorological forcing and oceanic conditions at ocean station papa osp model results suggest that finer resolution near the base of the mixed is critical for the representation of turbulence in the turbulent closure models because it can better resolve the current gradients near the mixed layer base a mixed layer enhanced vertical grid mleg is proposed which uses the same high resolution both at the water surface and near the bottom of the mixed layer from 60 to 80 m depth for the osp case ncom experiments using the new grid outperform both the uniform and stretched grids even with significantly fewer vertical layers used it is found that when using the mleg grid the model accuracy is strongly dependent on the resolution near the base of the mixed layer while the total number of vertical layers used in the mixed layer has minimum effect given the improvements in mld simulations using the mleg grids the second moment turbulent closure models still have hard time deepening the mixed layer relative to large eddy simulations although the assumption of small negligible anisotropy in these models can be partially blamed for the weaker turbulence the most likely major reason is the lack of representation for the near inertial gravity waves below the mixed layer these slightly super inertial motions have vertical displacements that can modulate the stratification via the wave strain and thus the water column stability which is very important for mixing while both the langmuir circulation and the variation of surface heat fluxes can impact the strength of these waves the magnitude of the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer does not show significant changes with either dynamical processes another weakness of the smtc models evaluated in this study is their small critical richardson number ricr that usually lead to shallower boundary layer predictions cheng et al 2002 as pointed out by canuto et al 2008 turbulent mixing exists up to richardson number ri o 100 hence there is practically no ricr new turbulent closure models were thus proposed to extend the ricr to infinity for planetary boundary layer models such as zilitinkevich and esau 2007 canuto et al 2008 and kantha and carniel 2009 but these models were more complicated than the my2 5 model and not as efficient as the galperin et al 1988 model recently cheng et al 2020 formulated a new turbulent closure model for the planetary boundary layer that extends the ricr to infinity through the derivation of a new set of heat flux equations that parameterize the length scale ratio as a function of second moments instead of a constant although the new model is developed based on the my2 5 and galperin et al 1988 models it is structurally simpler and its results are compared favorably with meteorological experimental dns and les data a generalized model from cheng et al 2020 that includes salinity will be a promising development for turbulence mixing schemes in the ocean circulation models credit authorship contribution statement yalin fan

23869,coordinate and resolution dependence of three second moment turbulent closure models are studied using one dimensional navy coastal ocean model ncom experiments and large eddy simulations at ocean station papa our results suggest that finer resolution near the base of the mixed layer is critical for better model performance a mixed layer enhanced vertical grid is proposed that outperforms both the uniform and the stretched grids with significantly fewer vertical layers used for the new grid the model accuracy is strongly dependent on the resolution near the base of the mixed layer and not affected much by the total number of vertical layers used however given the success of the new grid the lack of representation for the near inertial gravity waves below the mixed layer has hampered the ability of second moment turbulent closure models on accurate representation of turbulent mixing in the water column while both the langmuir circulation and the variation of surface heat fluxes are shown to be able to significantly change the strength of the near inertial waves they have negligible effect on the eddy viscosity in the transition layer keywords second moment turbulent closure models vertical coordinate vertical resolution mixed layer enhanced grid near inertial gravity waves 1 introduction turbulent mixing plays an important role in the transport of momentum heat and particles across the mixed layer and is critical to the vertical distribution of heat and salinity in the water column although the structure of turbulent eddies can be simulated by direct numerical simulations or large eddy simulations it is too expensive and unrealistic to solve for the turbulence in geophysical models for timely predictions of the flow fields over large areas such as those of metzger et al 2017 and rowley and mask 2014 thus parameterizations are required to provide an idealized description of turbulence with a reasonable compromise between cost and accuracy second moment turbulent closure smtc models are among the most popular approaches used to parameterize turbulence in the geophysical models the mellor yamadalevel 2 5 model mellor and yamada 1982 hereafter my2 5 has been used in many ocean and atmosphere models during the past several decades although there are some major shortcomings of the method that lead to smaller critical richardson number and shallower boundary layer depth canuto et al 2001 cheng et al 2002 it is still popularly used because the scheme considers the energetics of the mixing explicitly by solving diagnostic and prognostic equations respectively for the turbulent kinetic energy tke and turbulent length scale since these equations carry information about the time history of the turbulence and thus can account for both advection and diffusion of the tke as people gradually recognized the importance of surface gravity waves in upper ocean mixing through langmuir turbulence kantha and clayson 2004 hereafter kc04 added vortex forcing to the mellor yamada type smtc model to represent the effect of surface waves and their scheme has been adapted into several ocean circulation models later on harcourt 2015 hereafter h15 further improved the smtc model by incorporating the vortex forcing in the stability equations as well these three smtc models are currently implemented in the navy coastal ocean model ncom note kantha et al 2010 has pointed out that the value of closure constant e 6 was reported incorrectly in kc04 and recharacterized it to be 7 2 instead of 4 0 this correction has been adapted into ncom although the model is still labeled kc04 aside from turbulent mixing schemes the choice of vertical coordinate system is another important aspect of the ocean model s design as pointed out by griffies et al 2000 the representation and parameterization of processes not resolved by the model grid are often directly linked to the vertical coordinate choice while many ocean models have flexible choices for vertical coordinate systems and resolution it is unclear how these choices influence the representation of the boundary layer eddy effects under various turbulent closure models in this study we will address the coordinate and resolution dependence of the my2 5 kc04 and h15 schemes and explore their limitations in turbulence representations using ncom and large eddy simulation experiments the data and methods are described in section 2 results are analyzed in section 3 and discussion and concluding remarks are presented in section 4 2 method 2 1 observational data hourly meteorological 10 m wind net surface heat flux and oceanographic temperature salinity data for this study are obtained from the moorings at ocean station papa osp operated by the ocean climate stations ocs group at pacific marine environmental laboratory of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa pmel send et al 2010 osp is a deep water station with a water depth of more than 4 km located at 144 9 w 50 1 n 850 miles off the british columbia coast the station is within the subpolar northeastern pacific gyre and thus experiences strong and frequent winter storms for this study a 15 day period starting from 14 november 2011 at 1utc was selected when osp experienced large variations in wind forcing and several cooling events the wind speed was low and mostly below 5 m s 1 during the first two days and then rapidly strengthened to more than 20 m s 1 by the end of november 16 fig 1a at the same time large sensible and latent heat fluxes at the ocean surface associated with the powerful winds led to a strong net cooling flux 450 w m 2 that closely follows the variation of the air temperature fig 1c the variation of the sea surface temperature sst on the other hand is gradual and at much lower frequency fig 1d the winds gradually weakened while fluctuating afterwards with several weak cooling events associated with short periods of wind speed increases concurrent detailed two dimensional wave spectra e σ θ were collected nearby by the applied physics laboratory at the university of washington using a 0 9 m datawell directional waverider thomson et al 2013 here σ and θ are the frequency and direction of the spectra hourly stokes drift profile time series were computed from e σ θ following kenyon 1969 1 u s z 2 σ k e σ θ e 2 k z d σ d θ where k is the wave number vector of the spectra the variation of the surface stokes drift closely follows the variation of the wind speed during most of the 15 day period fig 1b indicating wind sea dominance at the location 2 2 the navy coastal ocean model ncom experiments ncom is a hydrostatic model that solves the primitive equations it uses a staggered arakawa c grid with elevation and the main scalar temperature and salinity fields defined at the grid cell centers and velocities defined at the center of the grid cell faces turbulence fields for the mixing models and the vertical eddy coefficients are defined at the center of the top face of the grid cells where the vertical velocity points are defined aside from the two vertical grid types uniform and uniformly stretched implemented the model can also use vertical grids specified by the user through external input files more details on the model can be found in martin 2000 in this study we use one dimensional ncom to test the performance of the my2 5 kc04 and h15 schemes at osp we only simulate the top 200 m of the water column because the observations suggest that the mixed layer depth mld varied between 60 and 88 m during our simulation period for each turbulent closure model experiments are conducted for three types of vertical grids with 5 grid resolution options 30 40 50 80 and 100 layers the uniform grid ug as the name suggests uses constant spacing between model vertical grid points throughout the water column fig 2a dotted lines the uniformly stretched grid usg also known as logarithmically stretched grid is designed so that each layer is thicker than the layer above by a fixed percentage thus the grid achieves higher resolution near the water surface fig 2a dashed lines all five usg grids use 1 m resolution at the surface the stretch factor for each grid is determined based on the number of layers chosen within the 200 m vertical model domain for that particular grid which are 11 03 7 01 4 86 2 06 and 1 28 for the 30 40 50 80 and 100 layer grid respectively this study also proposes a third type of vertical coordinate system the mixed layer enhanced grid mleg which uses higher resolution both at the water surface and near bottom of the mixed layer fig 2a solid lines the detailed design of the mleg is illustrated in fig 3 the vertical model domain is separated into three regions region 1 goes from the surface to the top of the mixed layer base at 60 m depth in this study region 2 goes from top to bottom of the mixed layer base between 60 and 80 m in this study and the water column below the bottom of the mixed layer base is region 3 in region 1 the grid is first uniformly stretched from surface to the midpoint of the region the resolution in the first layer is set to be the minimum resolution of δ z m i n 2 m for the 30 40 and 50 layer cases and 1 m for the 80 and 100 layer cases in this study then the vertical grid is reversely uniform stretched from the midpoint to the bottom of region 1 top of the mixed layer base where the resolution is reduced back to δ z m i n thus in region 1 the grid points above and below the midpoint are symmetrically distributed about the midpoint in region 2 uniform grid is used with resolution δ z m i n in region 3 the grid is uniformly stretched from the bottom of the mixed layer base to the bottom of the model domain the results of the ncom simulations are presented in section 3 where all experiments are represented by the grid type and layer numbers for example experiment ug50 represents uniform grid with 50 layers 2 3 the large eddy simulation les model the ncar les solves the wave phase averaged craik leibovich equations craik and leibovich 1976 to include the effect of surface gravity waves through vortex force stokes coriolis force lagrangian mean advection associated with stokes drift and a wave averaged increment to pressure that arises through conservative wave current interactions detailed model formulations have been reported in existing publications e g mcwilliams et al 1997 sullivan et al 2007 and are not repeated here les models differ from smtc models in that the large turbulent eddies are explicitly resolved in the les down to the grid resolution and only the smaller eddies are modeled or parameterized so it can better resolve the turbulence in the water column the ncar les model has been shown to accurately reproduce observed upper ocean responses to different meteorological forcing and oceanic conditions kukulka et al 2009 liang et al 2013 2017 fan et al 2018 2020 in the simulation at osp the observed temperature and salinity variations in the water column are also well represented by the les model during the 15 day simulation period fig 1d f since there are no observations of the turbulence structures at osp the les simulated turbulence is used to evaluate the performance of the smtc models mld defined as the depth where changes of the potential density referenced to surface are less than 0 1 kg m3 estimated by the les simulation is also used to evaluate the ncom simulated mld since the vertical resolution of the temperature and salinity measurements are coarse see black dots in fig 1e and f for measurement depth 3 results 3 1 vertical grid and resolution dependence of the smtc models the ug and usg grid options are currently implemented in ncom while the ug grid is easier to apply the usg grid is usually preferred because its finer resolution in the upper layers can better resolve the vertical structure of the flow field generated by the imposed surface forcing as expected for both grid types higher resolution more layers gives smaller mld error relative to the les result for all three turbulent closure models table 1 fig 2b d while the differences in sst errors are relatively small among different resolutions table 1 root mean square error of sea surface temperature sst relative to observations and mixed layer depth mld relative to les results for all ncom experiments include three turbulent mixing schemes my2 5 kc04 and h15 with different grid types and resolution the green and red shaded cells indicate the minimum and maximum errors for sst and mld for each scheme interestingly for low resolution 30 or 40 layers simulations larger mld errors are found in experiments using the usg grid than that using the ug grid even though the usg grid uses much higher surface resolution fig 2a especially towards the end of the simulation the mld in the ug30 experiment is 1 m deeper than that in the usg30 experiment for both the kc04 and h15 schemes fig 2c and 2d a 0 5 m deeper mld in the ug40 experiment than the usg40 experiment was also observed for the my2 5 and h15 model fig 2b and d since the ug30 40 grid provides higher resolution near the base of the mixed layer than the usg30 40 grid fig 2a it could be the reason for the better model performances while finer resolution near the surface is always attempted by ocean modelers the resolution near the base of the mixed layer is often overlooked to better understand its effect on mixed layer simulations a new type of vertical grid the mixed layer enhanced grid mleg is designed so that the same high resolution 2 m for 30 40 and 50 layers and 1 m for 80 and 100 layers is used both at the water surface and near the bottom of the mixed layer from 60 to 80 m depth fig 2a solid lines large improvements in mld simulations are observed using the mleg grid table 1 fig 2 especially for the experiments with lower number of vertical layers up to 2 3 m of deepening are found in the mleg experiments relative to the ug or usg experiments fig 2b d solid lines large reductions in root mean square errors are recorded in the mleg30 experiment relative to the ug30 usg30 experiment 1 7 m and 1 79 m error reduction respectively when the my2 5 scheme is used table 1 also notice that the model simulated sst and mld accuracy in the mleg30 experiments are as good as the ug100 and usg100 experiments for all three smtc models this suggests that using higher resolution near the base of the mixed layer can help us archive higher model accuracy with much lower number of vertical layers and thus a much lower computational cost it is interesting to find that the simulated mld in the mleg30 mleg40 and mleg50 experiments are very similar to each other for all three smtc models fig 2b d the mld in the mleg80 and mleg100 experiments are also visually identical for the my2 5 and kc04 schemes with mleg100 slightly deeper than mleg80 when the h15 scheme is used the root mean square error of mld and sst also show the same characteristics table 1 this feature suggests that resolution at the surface and near the base of the mixed layer is more important than resolution within the middle of the mixed layer simulations using the mleg grids will give very similar accuracy when the same resolution is used at the surface and the base of the mixed layer from 60 to 80 m depth in our case the number of layers used within the middle of the mixed layer has very small effect on the mld accuracy to understand the reason for mixed layer deepening using the mleg grids we diagnose the eddy viscosity k m n c o m and diffusivity k h n c o m from the ncom experiments calculated as 2 k m n c o m l q s m 3 k h n c o m l q s h here q is the square root of twice the tke 1 2 q 2 l is the turbulent length scale and s h c 1 1 c 2 g h and s m c 3 c 4 s h g h 1 c 2 g h are the stratification functions used to describe the effect of stratification on vertical mixing both k m n c o m and k h n c o m are highly dependent on the vertical gradients of current and density in the mixed layer because a l and 1 2 q 2 are solved by the prognostic equations given in appendix derived by mellor and yamada 1982 and are sensitive to the resolved vertical shear of currents and density in the mixed layer b since c 1 to c 5 in s h and s m are empirical constants given in appendix s h and s m only vary with the stratification g h m i n 0 028 l 2 g q 2 ρ 0 ρ z and thus also depend closely on the resolved vertical density ρ shear in the water column here the maximum value of g h is set to be 0 028 based on mellor 2001 in which the author found that the stability functions limit to infinity as g h approaches the value 0 0288 0 028 is used in ncom to keep s h and s m within a reasonable range we only analyze the 30 layer experiments using the my2 5 scheme here since they show the largest differences among different grid types as we can see from fig 4 for the same grid the structure and time variation of k h n c o m and k m n c o m are very similar to each other with small magnitude difference thus we will only focus on the structure of k m n c o m in this section in the ug30 and usg30 experiments the vertical grid resolution around the base of the mixed layer ranges from 7 to 10 m the coarse vertical resolution results in poor representation of the density structures and underestimation of currents in the region that leads to weaker turbulence and the eddy viscosity diminishes several meters above the base of the mixed layer fig 4a and b while in the mleg30 experiment with the much finer resolution 2 m around the base of the mixed layer the current and density gradients are adequately resolved in the region which leads to enhanced turbulence deeper eddy viscosity penetration and consequently deepening of the mixed layer fig 4c especially during the strong cooling event on november 16 a corresponding sharp deepening of 5 m is observed in experiment mleg30 while usg30 only shows a mild gradual deepening of 1 2 m as grant and belcher 2011 has pointed out the vertical gradients of the current velocity change rapidly with depth in the stratified shear layer from above the base of the mixed layer to the base of the boundary layer and thus creates a maximal shear turbulence close to the base of the mixed layer being able to better resolve the current structure there leads to a better representation of the shear turbulence in the mixed layer which is clearly associated with the exchange of heat and momentum between the mixed layer and the thermocline below since the variation of k m n c o m and k h n c o m with depth are small in the middle of the mixed layer see fig 6 for example the vertical resolution in that region has minimal effect on the modeled turbulence in the mixed layer that is why we see almost identical model solutions from experiment mleg30 mleg40 and mleg50 fig 2 note that while the mleg30 experiment gives slightly higher mixed layer integrated tke than ug30 its total tke is almost the same as usg30 fig 5 this is because most of the tke in the water column is confined in a thin layer near the surface since both mleg30 and usg30 use much finer resolution 2 m and 1 m respectively at the surface than ug30 δ z 6 7 m they can better resolve the tke input this is one of the reasons for the preference of higher resolution near surface in ocean circulation models notice that not only the experiments using the kc04 and h15 schemes produce deeper mixed layers than that using the my2 5 scheme the mld differences between the experiments using the ug usg grids and that using the mleg grids are also smaller for these two smtc models fig 2 table 1 this is because for the kc04 and h15 models there are two distinct turbulent processes in the boundary layer the shear turbulence and the langmuir turbulence while the solution of the shear turbulence is highly dependent on the vertical resolution near the base of the mixed layer as shown above the vertical profile of the stokes drift that determines the magnitude of the langmuir turbulence is derived from observations and not affected by the vertical resolution in the model thus while the added langmuir turbulence worked to further deepen the mixed layer in the kc04 and h15 models the overall effect of vertical resolution on the mixed layer turbulence is relatively smaller in these two turbulent closure models 3 2 near inertial gravity waves beneath the mixed layer although the mleg grids can help deepen the mixed layer relative to the ug and usg grids the resulted mld is still much shallower than the les result fig 1g to better understand the reason for the discrepancy we compare k m n c o m in experiments mleg100 using the three smtc models with the eddy viscosity from the les simulation k m l e s which is calculated using the reynolds stress and mean shear following mcwilliams et al 2012 4 k m l e s u w z u l here u w is the horizontal domain averaged total reynold stress and u l is the horizontal domain averaged lagrangian velocity mean current plus stokes drift as we can see in fig 6 the h15 scheme gives the largest k m n c o m in the mixed layer among the three smtc models it can provide similar magnitude of eddy viscosity as the les model within the mixed layer with even deeper depth penetration of high values fig 6c and d however the turbulence in the h15 model is much weaker lower than 10 4 beneath the mixed layer than that in the les simulations part of the reason for the weaker turbulence in these mellor yamada type models is that they assume parameters governing the degree of anisotropy are small thus the turbulence beneath the mixed layer is underestimated in stably stratified fluids another reason that is mainly responsible for the weak turbulence beneath the mixed layer is that the smtc models cannot represent the effect of the downward propagating near inertial gravity waves as demonstrated by the les in its mean flow averaged over the horizontal domain fields given in fig 7 these waves are recognizable by their characteristic circularly polarized velocities and their strong shear is a major contributor to upper ocean mixing and can affect a variety of dynamic processes jochum et al 2012 the frequency f spectrum of the x direction horizontal velocity s x x f at a depth 2 m below the deepest mld during the simulation period reveals a strong peak at 15 60 h fig 8 blue line a little shorter than the inertial period of 15 62 h at osp the shape of the velocity spectrum in our study is very similar to the observed velocity spectra by d asaro 1985 collected close to osp during the ocean storms experiment in the north pacific except the peak energy in our study is much higher due to the stronger wind forcing experience during our study period maximum wind exceeded 20 m s in our study vs less than 10 m s in their study note that our results do not show the two small peaks at the semidiurnal tidal frequency and the frequency band that is twice the inertial frequency as in d asaro 1985 the wave energy in the double inertial frequency band is generated by the interaction between mesoscale eddies and the near inertial currents filamentary structures that are characterized by negative vorticity anomaly can trap the near inertial waves and generate waves of multiples of fundamental inertial frequency danioux and klein 2008 danioux et al 2008 kawaguchi et al 2020 since our les simulations do not include the effect of mesoscale eddies and tides waves in these two frequency bands are not simulated however as suggested by d asaro 1985 the wave energies in these two frequency bands are two orders of magnitude lower than that in the near inertial band and thus has negligible effect on the turbulent mixing in the water column to understand the relative fraction of variance within this near inertial band of frequencies relative to other band of frequencies the variance preserving spectra s x x f times frequency f as a function of log f are given in fig 8b following emery and thomson 2004 the area under the spectral curve between two frequencies i e f 1 and f 2 thus gives a measure of the spectral signal variance in that frequency band 5 σ 2 f 1 f 2 f s x x f d l o g f f 1 f 2 s x x f d f we can see that the near inertial motions are the dominant energy source in the velocity field these near inertial waves have an upward phase propagation and thus a downward energy propagation as opposed to pure inertial motions that are horizontal these slightly super inertial motions have vertical displacements that can modulate the stratification via the wave strain and thus the water column stability alford et al 2016 several observational studies plueddemann and farrar 2006 johnston and rudnick 2009 dohan and davis 2011 sanford et al 2011 have found that the near inertial motions can result in shear across the transition layer that separates the mixed layer from the stratified waters below and is a major mechanism for mixing and deepening of the mixed layer following storms since the momentum and heat diffusivities below the mixed layer are treated as adjustable parameters for the smtc models discussed in this study the effect of near inertial waves is minimized and thus limited their ability to further deepen the mixed layer furthermore these smtc models neglected the material derivative and diffusion terms in the density equations in order to simplify the model mellor and yamada 1982 and thus the downgradient approximation in these models seriously underestimates the third order moments canuto et al 2001 as a result while the smtc models can be justified for stable and slightly unstable flows the scheme is more likely to promote errors in highly unstable conditions such as the deep convection induced by the strong cooling on november 16 while some studies d asaro et al 1995 alford 2003 suggested that these near inertial motions are linked to the wind stress impulses associated with midlatitude storms that typically contain strong inertially rotating components inertial currents advecting langmuir cells over the stratified interior is another suggested cause for these waves polton et al 2008 to test this theory a new les experiment without stokes drift was conducted we can see that the near inertial motions beneath the mixed layer are much weaker without the presence of langmuir turbulence fig 9 while the frequency spectrum still shows a dominant peak at 15 60 h its peak energy is much lower than the experiment with stokes drift fig 8a and the total energy within the near inertial band has been reduced by almost half fig 8b this suggests that both the wind shear and the interaction between langmuir cells and the inertial currents are important for the strength of the near inertial waves while they can be generated by the wind stress impulses alone the presence of surface gravity waves can significantly enhance the magnitude of the waves also notice that the mean currents in the mixed layer become stronger without stokes drift especially near the surface this is because the circular motion of the langmuir cells and the added anti stokes transport by the stokes coriolis force in the along wind direction work together to reduce the downwind velocity near the surface and as a result the mean currents become more uniformly distributed with depth mcwilliams et al 1997 2012 it is interesting to notice that while the eddy viscosity in the mixed layer is greatly reduced in the experiment without stokes drift the magnitude of the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer does not show significant changes fig 6e as discussed earlier there are several cooling events during our simulations period especially on november 16 a large net cooling flux of 450 w m 2 was observed primarily due to the strong sensible and latent heat fluxes at the ocean surface fig 1c since we are not aware of any research that investigates the possible effect of surface heat fluxes on the near inertial gravity waves beneath the mixed layer we will take this opportunity to study its impact here for this purpose one more les experiment is conducted that uses only the wind and stokes forcing with the net heat flux set to zero during the entire simulation period we can see that while the mean currents in the mixed layer have very similar structure and magnitude as the experiment with the heat flux the removal of the net heat flux in the simulation has led to stronger near inertial motions beneath the mixed layer fig 10 there are two possible reasons for this enhancement firstly since the mixed layer depth is shallower in the experiment without heat flux the stokes drift velocity that decays with depth is larger at the base of the mixed layer secondly as fan et al 2020 have suggested the upwelling associated with langmuir circulation at the base of the mixed layer and the downwelling associated with the deep convection triggered by the surface cooling may counteract on each other and hence the removed of the surface cooling has further enabled stronger langmuir circulation at the base of the mixed layer notice that the peak of the horizontal velocity frequency spectrum is shifted slightly towards lower frequency of 16 h instead of 15 60 h when the net heat flux is removed from the forcing fig 8a and the near inertial band is slightly wider than that in the experiment with all forcing and thus contains more kinetic energy in the wave train fig 8b while the magnitude of the eddy viscosity remains similar to the experiment with all forcing its penetration depth within the mixed layer is shallower when the surface heat flux is removed from the simulation fig 6f this is due to the absence of deep convection associated with surface cooling that has led to reduced mixing and thus shallower mixed layer however like the experiment without stokes drift the magnitude of the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer does not show significant changes either when net heat flux is removed from the simulation fig 6f this feature suggests that there is a possibility to parameterize the effect near inertial gravity waves in the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer without having to involve complicated dynamics such as the langmuir turbulence or deep convection 4 discussion and conclusions this study investigated the coordinate and resolution dependence of the mellor and yamada 1982 level 2 5 the kantha and clayson 2004 and the harcourt 2015 turbulent closure models through one dimension ncom experiments and large eddy simulation studies using observed meteorological forcing and oceanic conditions at ocean station papa osp model results suggest that finer resolution near the base of the mixed is critical for the representation of turbulence in the turbulent closure models because it can better resolve the current gradients near the mixed layer base a mixed layer enhanced vertical grid mleg is proposed which uses the same high resolution both at the water surface and near the bottom of the mixed layer from 60 to 80 m depth for the osp case ncom experiments using the new grid outperform both the uniform and stretched grids even with significantly fewer vertical layers used it is found that when using the mleg grid the model accuracy is strongly dependent on the resolution near the base of the mixed layer while the total number of vertical layers used in the mixed layer has minimum effect given the improvements in mld simulations using the mleg grids the second moment turbulent closure models still have hard time deepening the mixed layer relative to large eddy simulations although the assumption of small negligible anisotropy in these models can be partially blamed for the weaker turbulence the most likely major reason is the lack of representation for the near inertial gravity waves below the mixed layer these slightly super inertial motions have vertical displacements that can modulate the stratification via the wave strain and thus the water column stability which is very important for mixing while both the langmuir circulation and the variation of surface heat fluxes can impact the strength of these waves the magnitude of the eddy viscosity beneath the mixed layer does not show significant changes with either dynamical processes another weakness of the smtc models evaluated in this study is their small critical richardson number ricr that usually lead to shallower boundary layer predictions cheng et al 2002 as pointed out by canuto et al 2008 turbulent mixing exists up to richardson number ri o 100 hence there is practically no ricr new turbulent closure models were thus proposed to extend the ricr to infinity for planetary boundary layer models such as zilitinkevich and esau 2007 canuto et al 2008 and kantha and carniel 2009 but these models were more complicated than the my2 5 model and not as efficient as the galperin et al 1988 model recently cheng et al 2020 formulated a new turbulent closure model for the planetary boundary layer that extends the ricr to infinity through the derivation of a new set of heat flux equations that parameterize the length scale ratio as a function of second moments instead of a constant although the new model is developed based on the my2 5 and galperin et al 1988 models it is structurally simpler and its results are compared favorably with meteorological experimental dns and les data a generalized model from cheng et al 2020 that includes salinity will be a promising development for turbulence mixing schemes in the ocean circulation models credit authorship contribution statement yalin fan
