3400,agro hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts mainly include precipitation water diversion irrigation drainage evapotranspiration et and soil water and groundwater flow which interact with each other and are controlled by complex natural and anthropogenic drivers to better understand the agro hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table we developed a novel monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation districts dahmid based on the concepts of canal command area cca and sub drainage command area sdca the dahmid model is driven by meteorology irrigation and evapotranspiration et estimated by remote sensing based et model and considers soil water and groundwater balances in both irrigated and non irrigated lands and interior drainage between them the model was applied to hetao irrigation district hid the largest irrigation district in arid region of china with a total irrigated area of 0 68 million ha the dahmid model was calibrated with groundwater table depth measurements in 13 ccas of hid from 2008 to 2010 and validated from 2012 to 2013 results depicted that the root mean square errors rmses normalized rmses nrmses nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nses and coefficients of determination r2 of groundwater table depth in both irrigated and non irrigated lands for all ccas were in the ranges of 0 19 0 34 m 0 10 0 25 0 30 0 82 and 0 68 0 91 respectively the simulation results from 2008 to 2014 indicated that interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land is an important approach of drainage in hid which is about 14 3 of total irrigation water diversion and 34 9 more than the drainage through ditches the interior drainage process is basically similar to irrigation and ditch drainage processes all reaching their peaks in may and october et is the major water consumption in hid which is about 95 of total irrigation water diversion and precipitation in average the net capillary rise of irrigated land is significantly less than that of non irrigated land due to the impact of irrigation infiltration the dahmid model has less parameters and requires less inputs and can be better applied to continuous simulation of agro hydrological processes in irrigation districts in medium and long periods with satisfactory simulation accuracy keywords agro hydrological model evapotranspiration ditch drainage interior drainage water balance irrigation district 1 introduction irrigation plays an essential role for food production in arid and semi arid regions wen et al 2020 intense evapotranspiration potential and scarce precipitation usually lead to severe water scarcity and fragile ecosystems in these regions pereira et al 2002 kahil et al 2015 therefore agricultural production relies heavily on the irrigation water diverted from river and or pumped from groundwater in irrigation districts of arid regions hassan esfahani et al 2015 ren et al 2016 agriculture consumes about 70 of global fresh water and approximately 90 of it is used for irrigation purpose gao et al 2017 however improper irrigation and drainage practices usually result in groundwater table rising which then induces waterlogging and salinity problems that threaten crop growth wichelns and qadir 2015 ren et al 2017 singh 2019a consequently it is crucial to have a proper and profound understanding of agro hydrological and related salt transport processes for the sustainable development of irrigation districts in arid regions jiang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 unlike the traditional hydrological processes in natural watersheds that are mainly controlled by natural factors agro hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts are also greatly influenced by anthropogenic factors such as crop planting water diversion for irrigation and drainage hu et al 2004 li et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 in arid irrigation districts characterized with less precipitation and local runoff irrigation and drainage dominate other agro hydrological processes e g evapotranspiration et soil water and groundwater flow solute transport and vegetation growth especially in the arid regions with shallow groundwater table the drainage process is critical for controlling waterlogging and salinization problems in irrigation district singh 2019a wen et al 2020 there are usually two types of drainage in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table one is the drainage through ditch system into rivers or lakes as drainage receiver while the other is interior drainage through lateral groundwater flow from irrigated land to non irrigated land due to groundwater table gradient after irrigation lei et al 1998 konukcu et al 2006 the interior drainage is mainly influenced by the distribution and ratio of irrigated and non irrigated lands and the groundwater table gradient between them the interior drainage and accompanied salt transport called dry drainage are crucial for soil salinization control in cropland of arid irrigation districts without sufficient drainage capacity lei et al 1998 wu et al 2009 secondary soil salinization caused by improper irrigation and drainage management in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table can result in severer environmental and geological problems such as reduction of crop yield degradation of natural ecosystem and damage of roads and built infrastructure however most of available models simplify drainage process and ditch systems and are usually lumped water balance model that cannot describe the spatial variability of drainage process especially the interior drainage nousiainen et al 2015 yu et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to develop a distributed agro hydrological model for arid irrigation districts that considers irrigation drainage both ditch drainage and interior drainage et and other agro hydrological processes comprehensively different from hydrological response units hrus in natural watersheds that are mainly controlled by topography and can be divided through digital elevation model dem hrus or simulation units in irrigation districts are also determined by anthropogenic factors like irrigation and drainage systems and crop planting pattern molina navarro et al 2016 li and ren 2019 therefore traditional watershed hydrological models need to be modified to account for the processes related with irrigation and drainage when applied in irrigation districts in recent years agro hydrological models at the irrigation district scale have been gaining more and more attention due to the requirements of increasing agricultural water use efficiency and preventing waterlogging and salinization jiang et al 2015 wen et al 2020 currently a wide variety of hydrological models have been developed and modified to describe the agro hydrological processes at a regional scale siad et al 2019 commonly used physically or process based hydrological models include swat soil and water assessment tool aliyari et al 2019 vic variable infiltration capacity andreadis et al 2017 mike she boegh et al 2004 drainmod youssef et al 2018 tnt2 topography based nitrogen transfer and transformations ferrant et al 2016 flush nousiainen et al 2015 and modflow mirlas 2013 some other water balance based conceptual models have also been applied in different regions hassan esfahani et al 2015 peña arancibia et al 2016 li et al 2017 due to their simplicity applicability and good performances at different spatial and temporal scales some of these models are also coupled with other required modules to enhance their applicability in agricultural regions such as crop growth model siad et al 2019 and groundwater model aliyari et al 2019 however there are several limitations in these available agro hydrological models siad et al 2019 singh 2019b especially when applied to irrigation district with shallow groundwater table depth first lateral groundwater flow and salt transport between different landscapes especially those between irrigated and non irrigated lands are generally ignored in most of the models not coupled with a regional groundwater model van gaelen et al 2017 xu et al 2019 these models are applicable to irrigation districts with deep groundwater table but not reliable in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table where both vertical and horizontal groundwater flow plays an important role in the regional hydrological cycle second et is usually estimated at hru or simulation unit scale without considering the spatial variability of natural and anthropogenic factors including land use cropping pattern irrigation soil and meteorology droogers 2000 ren et al 2016 chang et al 2019 third irrigation and drainage systems are generally simplified because of the system complexity and data availability poch massegú et al 2014 xue and ren 2017 fourth hydrological processes in the freezing and thawing periods are not considered simultaneously with crop growth period in some models peña arancibia et al 2016 ren et al 2016 xue et al 2018 fifth data availability and some other factors also limit their application at regional scale because available distributed agro hydrological models used in large scale and short time step simulations generally require enormous data as model parameters and inputs that are not easily available the main objectives of this study are to develop a monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation district dahmid in arid region with shallow groundwater and apply it to a large irrigation district in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the hetao irrigation district hid 40 1 41 4 n 106 1 109 4 e located in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region fig 1 is the largest irrigation district in the arid regions of china the hid covers approximately 1 2 million ha and is composed of five main sub irrigation districts from west upstream to east downstream wulanbuhe wlbh jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and wulate wlt the topography is very flat with a gentle slope of about 0 2 from the southwest to the northeast of hid xu et al 2010 three main soil textures are distributed regionally in hid i e sand in the desert and gobi of the western part silty clay mainly in the southern and eastern regions near the yellow river and wuliangsuhai lake and sandy loam in the rest of the regions xue and ren 2017 yu and shang 2017 the hid lies in a typically arid continental climate zone the mean annual pan evaporation 20 cm pan and precipitation from 1981 to 2009 are about 2240 mm and 160 mm respectively ren et al 2016 wen et al 2019 the average sunshine duration and temperature vary from 3100 to 3300 h and from 7 5 to 9 1 c respectively feng et al 2005 wen et al 2020 the relative low temperature in winter causes a long freezing and thawing period from the mid november to the next april with a duration of about 180 days li et al 2012 total areas of irrigated cropland and grassland are about 0 68 million ha accounting for 66 1 of the whole hid dominant crops in hid are sunflower spring maize and spring wheat which cover more than 80 of cropland from 2012 to 2016 wen et al 2019 the hid have a very complex irrigation canal and drainage ditch systems comprised of seven levels of irrigation canals and drainage ditches with total lengths of 50400 km and 14000 km respectively wen et al 2020 due to the intense et potential and scarce precipitation irrigation water diverted from the yellow river is essential for agricultural production in hid which ranges 3 83 5 10 billion m3 from 2008 to 2014 however the drainage flowing out of hid only accounts for 5 15 of the total irrigation from 2005 to 2015 excessive irrigation and poor drainage lead to shallow groundwater table and severe soil salinity problems in some parts of hid groundwater table depth varies between 0 5 and 3 0 m and the total dissolved solid varies in a wide range of 351 6734 mg l with major ions of na cl so4 2 and hco3 jia et al 2014 the saline soil covers about 75 of the whole hid li et al 2012 ren et al 2018 consequently large amount of groundwater flows through interior drainage and salt transports through dry drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land due to the gradient of groundwater level between these two types of land after irrigation yu et al 2016 found the mean annual interior drainage and dry drainage were 0 36 billion m3 and 1 52 million tons in the four counties of western and middle hid which results in salt accumulation in non irrigated grassland and wetland therefore the sustainability of agriculture and natural ecosystems in hid is severely threatened by salinization problems 2 2 data collection table 1 shows main data required for the model development including meteorology irrigation and drainage remote sensing groundwater table depth canal and ditch systems land use dem and soil texture the meteorological data were collected from two sources for different purposes the daily meteorological dataset including average maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed atmospheric pressure and sunshine hours at linhe station was downloaded from china meteorological data service center https data cma cn and provided inputs for remote sensing based et module while the monthly precipitation in five sub irrigation districts was downloaded from the general administration of hetao irrigation district gahid and used for generating maps of regional precipitation monthly irrigation and drainage data from 2008 to 2014 for main canals and sub irrigation districts were obtained from gahid where the irrigation data was used as model input and the drainage data for calibrating and validating the drainage module of the model the irrigation and drainage systems including 267 branch canals and 264 branch ditches were provided by gahid and used to generate the simulation units with independent agro hydrological processes moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products from 2008 to 2014 including daily surface reflectance products with a resolution of 250 m for bands 1 2 mod09gq and 500 m for bands 1 7 mod09ga and daily land surface temperature product with a resolution of 1000 m mod11a1 were downloaded from national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the united states of america https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov to estimate et using a remote sensing based et model land use map is downloaded from the department of earth system science tsinghua university china https data ess tsinghua edu cn groundwater table depth was measured at 224 wells in every 5 days during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 the measurement results are interpolated using ordinary kriging method cressie 1988 to obtain their spatial distribution maps in hid with 250 m spatial resolution in addition the annual groundwater extraction data was provided by gahid which was assumed to be uniform in 12 months because groundwater was mainly for domestic and industrial uses 2 3 division of simulation units spatial distribution maps of irrigation and drainage systems sub irrigation districts land use and soil texture were first all reshaped as raster with 250 m spatial resolution then they were aggregated to generate the simulation units in hid for the dahmid model fig 2 2 3 1 canal command areas the canal system is the base for water diversion and allocation in irrigation districts and different irrigation strategies are generally adopted in different command areas in order to distinguish the irrigation practices applied in different regions wen et al 2020 defined the canal command areas ccas as the basic units of irrigation application ccas of main canals are divided based on several factors including the distribution of lower level canals and surrounding ditch system boundaries of sub irrigation districts surface return flow direction determined from dem and cropland boundaries from land use map following principles are considered in dividing the ccas wen et al 2020 a lower level canals of a main canal should be divided into the corresponding cca b the boundaries of a cca are composed of irrigation canals and drainage ditches of the tertiary or higher levels and boundaries of sub irrigation districts around the main canal c when the boundaries divided above are not closed dem land use map and administrative boundaries are considered where the dem and land use map are used to identify the surface return flow and cropland boundaries respectively eventually 13 ccas are divided based on 21 main and secondary irrigation canals in hid fig 2 a compared to wen et al 2020 five small ccas in the south are combined into adjacent command areas 2 3 2 drainage command areas different from ccas the drainage is collected and concentrated by ditch system in irrigation districts and the basic units of drainage concentration are defined as sub drainage command areas sdcas wen et al 2020 sdcas of main ditches are divided considering several related factors including the distribution of lower level ditches and surrounding canal system boundaries of sub irrigation districts groundwater flow direction determined from groundwater level observations and intersection of extended lower level ditches of different main ditches following principles are considered in dividing the scdas wen et al 2020 a lower level secondary and tertiary ditches of a main ditch should be divided into the same sdca b from groundwater flow direction raster layer fig 3 b pixels with groundwater flowing into the same ditch are classified into one sdca c intersection of the extended secondary and tertiary ditches of different main ditches should be considered as a boundary if the boundaries mentioned above are not closed eventually 19 sdcas are divided by 17 main and secondary ditches where the north hid controlled by the general drainage ditch is divided into three sdcas in jfz yj and yc sub irrigation districts respectively fig 2 b 2 3 3 land use map the hid covers several land use types including cropland grassland forest shrub wetland water body impervious surface and bare land yu et al 2013 in current study the land use map was resampled to 250 m spatial resolution and reclassified into irrigated and non irrigated lands to meet the requirement of the model fig 2 c the irrigated land includes all cropland and a very small proportion of grassland considering that the area of irrigated grassland is very small 2 8 of total irrigated land in western and middle hid yu et al 2016 and irrigated grassland was not identified in the land use map of yu et al 2013 cropland was reclassified into irrigated land and other land use types into non irrigated land 2 3 4 sub irrigation district map five sub irrigation districts in fig 2 d are divided by gahid based on irrigation and drainage systems and cultivated land distribution in the hid i e wlbh jfz yj yc and wlt sub irrigation districts they show significant difference in land use and crop planting pattern for example about 62 of wlbh is covered by desert grassland and bare land jfz is the main zone for maize and wheat planting and yc is the most typical zone for sunflower planting yu and shang 2017 wen et al 2019 2 3 5 soil texture map the soil texture map in the hid is processed by arcgis 10 2 based on harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 which is available on national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn the map was resampled to 250 m spatial resolution from the original 1000 m fig 2 e three dominated soil texture types including sand sandy loam and silty clay cover 10 8 59 5 and 29 7 of hid respectively sandy soil is mainly distributed in wlbh while loamy soil and silty clay soil are in an interlaced distribution in other sub irrigation districts 2 3 6 simulation units based on above mentioned 5 maps 306 simulation units are divided by overlaying these maps into one final map fig 4 f different units show different characteristics in meteorology hydrology agricultural practice underlying surface and soil property their areas range from 0 1 to 1066 6 km2 and larger units are mainly in wlbh with large areas of homogeneous desert 2 4 monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation district dahmid with shallow groundwater table fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the dahmid model which was developed based on total water balance groundwater balance and soil water balance of irrigated and non irrigated lands of each cca in both non freezing and freezing periods it is composed of several modules including remote sensing based et module semi distributed drainage module variable specific yield sy module for long term groundwater table fluctuation prediction groundwater table simulation module in freezing period and interior drainage module 2 4 1 remote sensing based et model yang and shang 2013 developed a hybrid dual source scheme and trapezoid framework based evapotranspiration model htem based on satellite remote sensing data it used a hybrid scheme of layer and patch approaches for energy allocation guan and wilson 2009 and a trapezoid vegetation index land surface temperature space to decompose the land surface temperature into canopy and soil temperatures long et al 2012 the htem model was proved to be applicable and accurate to estimate et and partition evaporation and transpiration effectively for different ecosystems yang and shang 2013 yang et al 2013 it has also been evaluated to estimate et in the hid yu and shang 2020 shang et al 2021 in current study the modis data was used as data source of the htem from april to october including surface reflectance and land surface temperature products table 1 these modis products were carefully selected and processed by arcgis 10 2 software more details of the htem model can refer to yang and shang 2013 during the freezing period from november to next march et is small due to low temperature and soil freezing an empirical formula was used to estimate monthly et from november to next march yu et al 2016 1 et i k et o i where et i is the actual et in the ith month eto i is the reference et in the ith month calculated from meteorological factors using the penman moteith equation allen et al 1998 and k is an empirical parameter from the results of kaneko et al 2006 k is determined to be about 0 36 for freezing period in hid yu et al 2016 2 4 2 semi distributed drainage model a semi distributed drainage model developed by wen et al 2020 was used to estimate surface return flow and groundwater drainage to the ditch system due to its good applicability simple calculation flexible structure and distributed consideration the drainage model requires monthly groundwater table depth and salinity as inputs which can be provided by other modules of the dahmid model therefore applicability of the semi distributed drainage model is enhanced by coupling with the dahmid model the surface return flow is calculated from a proportion of excess irrigation over a threshold and groundwater drainage is estimated by the difference of water levels in groundwater and ditches according to darcy s law which are wen et al 2020 2 d t i max d g i d s i 0 3 d s i max a i j 1 n i ij i c i a ij 10 3 0 4 d g i k gd i h d i h w i gh i 5 h w i b i d t i c i where d t i d s i and d g i are total drainage surface return flow and groundwater drainage in the ith sdca 104 m3 respectively iij and aij are average irrigation depth of irrigated land in the jth cca mm and the corresponding area hm2 in the ith sdca ici is the threshold above which surface return flow occurs mm ai is the ratio of d s to excess irrigation k gd i is the drainage efficiency coefficient 104 m2 h d i is the equivalent depth of ditches from average land surface to the average ditch bed m h w i is the equivalent water depth of ditches m gh i is average groundwater table depth from average land surface m bi and ci are the parameters for water depth calculation in ditches based on a simplified chézy formula braca 2008 ici ai k gd i h d i bi and ci are model sdca dependent parameters to be calibrated more detailed description of the drainage model can refer to wen et al 2020 in this drainage model the surface return flow is calculated in irrigated land while groundwater drainage is calculated in both irrigated and non irrigated lands based on different groundwater table depths respectively in order to be coupled with dahmid model conveniently the surface return flow and groundwater drainage are allocated to corresponding simulation units which are then summed up to get total drainage in each cca 2 4 3 interior drainage module interior drainage is the process of horizontal groundwater flow from irrigated land to non irrigated land which usually occurs in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table because of groundwater level gradient after irrigation interior drainage is an important supplement to the drainage system in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table which is essential in keeping salt balance in cropland through dry drainage or salt transport associated with interior drainage konukcu et al 2006 yu et al 2016 generally from water balance analysis between irrigated and non irrigated lands total interior drainage of the whole irrigation district can be calculated on an annual or monthly scale lei et al 1998 hu et al 2004 yu et al 2016 these studies generally estimated the interior drainage directly from irrigation drainage meteorological data and groundwater table depth through water balance analysis however distribution of irrigation and drainage systems and the processes of et capillary rise and groundwater fluctuations were usually simplified which made it difficult for the distributed simulation of interior drainage the monthly scale dahmid model is driven by irrigation meteorological data and remote sensing based et and simulate the agro hydrological processes in a distributed manner including drainage interior drainage groundwater fluctuations and capillary rise groundwater table depth gh is the core iterative variable in the model which is closely connected with the interior drainage process from darcy s law for groundwater flow interior drainage is driven by the difference in groundwater levels between irrigated and non irrigated lands therefore the interior drainage in a cca can be calculated by the darcy s law similar to hu et al 2004 6 gt k k gt el a gh a k gh a k 1 2 el na gh na k gh na k 1 2 a s where subscript a and na indicate the irrigated and non irrigated lands respectively gt k is the interior drainage between irrigated and non irrigated lands in the kth month 104 m3 and the positive value indicates the groundwater flow from irrigated land to non irrigated land k gt is the efficiency coefficient of groundwater flow between irrigated and non irrigated lands per unit area el is the average elevation of ground surface m gh k is groundwater table depth at the beginning of the kth month m a s is the area of the simulation unit hm2 in addition to the hydraulic property and difference in groundwater table interior drainage is also related to the thickness of shallow groundwater aquifer and length of boundaries between irrigated and non irrigated lands in different ccas that determine the cross section of groundwater flow 2 4 4 variable specific yield method for long term groundwater fluctuation due to large amount of irrigation from late april to early october in a year the groundwater table depth in hid is generally shallower fluctuating from 0 5 m to 3 0 m during the year which also causes the salinity problems therefore it is of great significance to study the relationship between groundwater fluctuation and irrigation on a monthly scale for the water and salt regulation of irrigation lands and the sustainable development of agriculture in previous studies groundwater fluctuation theories for estimating groundwater recharge and discharge were usually based on a single precipitation or irrigation event with a short time scale crosbie et al 2005 pointed out that the relationship between groundwater recharge and groundwater table was very sensitive to the time step in the dahmid model with a monthly scale groundwater fluctuations are generally caused by multiple precipitation and irrigation events within the month meanwhile the specific yield is not a constant due to the shallow and varying groundwater table therefore we adopt the long term groundwater fluctuation theory proposed by crosbie et al 2005 to describe the water volume and table changes of the unit soil layer and groundwater layer on a long term scale this theory is based on the van genuchten vg 1980 model for soil moisture characteristic curve which can better explain the lisse effect for groundwater fluctuations the variable specific yield is related to the groundwater table depth and calculated by eq 7 and 8 for irrigated and non irrigated lands crosbie et al 2005 respectively 7 s y a s y u s y u 1 α gh a k 1 gh a k 2 100 2 β 1 1 β 8 s y na s y u s y u 1 α gh na k 1 gh na k 2 100 2 β 1 1 β where sy is the apparent specific yield in a long period which changes with the groundwater table depth sy u is the ideal ultimate specific yield close to the difference between saturated and residual water contents crosbie et al 2005 gh k 1 and gh k 2 are the average groundwater table depth of the simulation unit in the k 1th beginning and k 2th end months respectively m α cm 1 and β are soil specific parameters of the vg model van genuchten 1980 where α is the scale parameter inversely proportional to mean pore diameter and β is the shape parameter sy approaches to 0 when the groundwater table depth is close to 0 and approaches to sy u when the groundwater table is deep 2 4 5 water balance model considering the effects of land use and climate on agro hydrological processes the water balance model was developed for both irrigated and non irrigated lands in both non freezing and freezing periods respectively some studies developed the water balance model in soil and groundwater layers based on division of different zones such as root zone transitional zone and saturated zone wen et al 2017 li et al 2017 xue et al 2018 given that the possible great fluctuation of groundwater table that may even be close to land surface in shallow groundwater regions total water balance of soil and shallow groundwater layers is firstly analyzed in non freezing period from april to november eqs 9 and 10 describe total water balance in irrigated and non irrigated lands of each simulation unit respectively following the annul water balance equations of yu et al 2016 and considering changes in water storage due to groundwater table fluctuations and eqs 11 to 14 are the calculations of water balance components 9 p a k i k

lengths of canal system in irrigated land non irrigated land and the whole unit respectively η c is the canal efficiency γ is the ratio of canal seepage to the total canal loss lcs is allocated based on the lengths of canals in irrigated and non irrigated lands gi is calculated in eq 14 based on the assumption that the water consumption and supplement are balanced in annual scale yu et al 2016 and the positive and negative values indicate net groundwater inflow and outflow respectively in the above equations six parameters i e k gt sy u α β η c and γ need to be calibrated in different ccas during the freezing period from december to next march irrigation stops in hid and there is no drainage from field observation from meteorological observation data and previous studies total precipitation and et are both about 20 mm during december to march in the hid li et al 2012 which are very small compared with those in non freezing months therefore water balance during freezing period from december to march was analyzed together with that of april consequently eqs 15 and 16 are obtained based on total water balance in irrigated and non irrigated lands in freezing period and

respectively to estimate groundwater table depth in the freezing period an empirical model of groundwater table fluctuation proposed by liu et al 2017 was adopted shown in eq 17 the empirical model was developed based on the relationship between temperature and groundwater table changes during freezing period and has successfully applied in hid 17 gh k 1 gh k 0 0433 t k 1 t k 2 0 0043 where tk 1 and tk 2 are temperatures of the k 1 th and k 2 th months respectively from the total water balance of the soil and shallow groundwater layers groundwater table depth can be simulated continuously furthermore water exchange between the soil layer and groundwater layer can be estimated by eq 18 to 21 18 ps a k η p p k η i i k d s k a sa 10 3 η l lcs a k 19 ps na k η p p k η l lcs na k 20 ge a k

yu et al 2016 xue et al 2017 ge k is the groundwater evaporation of the kth month i e capillary rise from groundwater table which can be calculated based on water balance in the fluctuation region of groundwater table sy g is the specific yield of the fluctuation region of groundwater table and was set as 0 07 following xue et al 2017 in addition the monthly dahmid model runs based on each cca where the differences among 306 simulation units are reflected by inputs and parameters related with cca sdca land use soil texture and sub irrigation district for example the irrigation depth canal seepage et and groundwater table depth were averaged and allocated to the irrigated land and non irrigated land of each cca based on the combination of cca and land use map drainage was calculated based on the combination of ccas sdcas and land use map parameters related with soil water characteristics changed with the combination of cca land use map and soil texture map precipitation and thickness of shallow groundwater aquifer were allocated to five sub irrigation districts fig 2 d 2 5 model evaluation and sensitivity analysis the drainage module is relatively independent with other modules which has six parameters in each sdca ai and ici in eq 3 k gd i and h d i in eq 4 and bi and ci in eq 6 these parameters were calibrated with the genetic algorithm holland 1973 by minimizing the root mean squared error rmse between simulated and observed monthly drainage during 2008 2010 and the model was further validated with drainage data from 2012 to 2013 wen et al 2020 other parameters of the dahmid model can be classified into 3 categories including specific yield canal water loss and seepage and groundwater flow parameters related with the specific yield sy u α and β vary with soil texture types fig 2 e and their values in each cca were determined from the corresponding dominant soil texture except for cca 1 the other three parameters η c γ and k gt are cca dependent and need to be calibrated for each cca the model was calibrated similar to the drainage model by minimizing the rmse between observed and simulated groundwater table depth in each cca during 2008 2010 and validated with data during 2012 2013 moreover 4 wildly used indicators were selected to evaluate the model performance for groundwater table depth eq 22 to 25 including rmse willmott 1982 normalized rmse nrmse jamieson et al 1991 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 nagelkerke 1991 22 rmse 1 n k 1 n obs k sim k 2 23 nrmse rmse max obs min obs 24 nse 1 k 1 n sim k obs k 2 k 1 n obs k obs 2 25 r 2 k 1 n obs k obs sim k sim 2 k 1 n obs k obs 2 k 1 n sim k sim 2 where obs and sim are observations and simulations respectively and obs and sim are the averages of observations and simulations respectively generally a model performs better when rmse and nrmse are close to 0 and nse and r 2 are close to 1 to find the sensitivity of model parameters sensitivity analysis was conducted in 13 ccas for irrigated and non irrigated lands the commonly used one factor at a time oat method was adopted to evaluate the effects of model parameters on the groundwater table depth at a time we set a variation range of 5 to 5 for one parameter while leaving the rest parameters unchanged and the sensitivity can be calculated as follows gedeon and mallants 2012 26 s n δ gh gh δ p v n p v n where sn is the sensitivity of the nth parameter and parameters of the drainage module were not considered n 1 2 6 δ gh is the variation of simulated gh δ p v n represents the change of the nth parameter and p v n is the value of the nth parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation details of the calibration and validation results of the drainage module can refer to wen et al 2020 the calibrated results of other model parameters are shown in table 2 the soil texture dependent parameters of specific yield sy u α and β are in the ranges of 0 12 0 20 0 02 0 05 cm 1 and 1 5 2 0 respectively generally coarse soil has greater sy u and β and smaller α and greater sy u indicate poorer water holding capacity the values of η c and γ in different ccas vary in the ranges of 0 40 0 65 and 0 84 0 96 respectively xue et al 2018 simulated the water balance of jfz sub irrigation district of hid and obtained an average η c of 0 51 during 2000 2009 which is in the range of 0 45 0 55 for ccas c2 c6 in the jfz sub irrigation district table 2 the minimum value of γ appears in wlbh sub irrigation district which is caused by the large proportion of desert and dry climate in this area the value of k gt is between 0 10 and 0 40 which determines the transmission efficiency of interior drainage per unit area in each cca and the maximum value appears in yc sub irrigation district we evaluated the model performance in simulating groundwater table depth by comparing simulated with observed groundwater table depths during the calibration period 2008 2010 and validation period 2012 2013 in irrigated and non irrigated lands within each cca fig 4 the rmse values of groundwater table depth in irrigated and non irrigated lands are less than 0 30 m in both periods nrmse values within 12 nse values greater than 0 94 and r2 values greater than 0 84 during the freezing period the rmses are less than 0 19 m the nrmses less than 6 the nses greater than 0 86 and r2 greater than 0 93 therefore the empirical method of groundwater table depth simulation during the freezing period provides a stable foundation for the inter annual continuous simulation of hydrological processes in the irrigation district moreover the model performance for irrigated land is slightly better than non irrigated land in the study region observation wells are mainly distributed in or around the irrigated cropland therefore average groundwater table depth in the irrigated land estimated through kriging interpolation may be more accurate than that in the non irrigated land which may be a possible reason for slightly better performance of groundwater table depth simulation in irrigated land besides it is natural that the accuracy of calibration period is slightly better than the validation period in summary the model performs well in the simulation of groundwater table depth in hid the simulated and observed processes of groundwater table depth are compared for different ccas figs 5 and 6 the rmse nrmse nse and r2 values of irrigated and non irrigated lands in different ccas are in the ranges of 0 19 0 34 m 0 10 0 25 0 30 0 82 and 0 68 0 91 respectively the simulation accuracy of the model is acceptable and the changing trend and process of groundwater table depth can be simulated reasonably well 3 2 sensitivity of model parameters to understand the influences of model parameters on the simulation results sensitivity of the six calibrated model parameters η c γ sy u α β and k gt on groundwater table depth was analyzed fig 7 shows the sensitivity values normalized linearly to the range of 0 for the least sensitive parameter to 1 for the most sensitive parameter and rankings of different parameters in irrigated and non irrigated lands of different ccas the greater the sensitivity or the smaller the ranking the more sensitive the parameter in irrigated land the groundwater table depth is most sensitive to γ and β followed by sy u and η c while α and k gt are less sensitive because the canal seepage is one of the main recharge sources for groundwater γ has a direct impact on the groundwater table depth which results in the high sensitivity of γ k gt represents the horizontal flow of groundwater with weaker effect on the change of groundwater table and therefore is the least sensitive for non irrigated land the sensitivity values of most parameters are close to those of irrigated land however it is worth noting that k gt of non irrigated land shows higher sensitivity than irrigated land mainly because interior drainage is the one of the main recharge sources for non irrigated land meanwhile groundwater table depth in non irrigated land is generally less sensitive to η c than irrigated land 3 3 main agro hydrological processes in hid main agro hydrological processes in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table such as hid include irrigation et drainage through ditches interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land through lateral groundwater flow and groundwater evaporation capillary rise in hid soil salinization control is crucial which generally depends on the control of groundwater table depth to an appropriate range by reducing irrigation water diversion and increasing water consumption and drainage since the implementation of water saving reconstruction in hid from 1998 the amount of annual water diversion in hid has dropped from about 5 0 billion m3 to about 4 5 billion m3 which caused a slight decline in the groundwater level however some parts of the hid especially the lower parts still face severe salinity problems understanding the patterns of agro hydrological processes and their changes with water saving measures is key for the agricultural development of the study region 3 3 1 evapotranspiration et the et is the major water consumption component in the arid irrigation district which changes in both space and time the spatial distributions of annual et in hid from 2008 to 2014 are shown in fig 8 for different land use types the wetland and water body have the largest mean annual et of 631 704 mm followed by crop land 440 545 mm forest 395 498 mm and irrigated grass 390 492 mm construction land 333 438 mm non irrigated grassland 190 299 mm and desert 142 249 mm in general wuliangsuhai lake in the east hid has a peak annual et of about 1000 mm while the desert and gobi regions of the wulanbuhe sub irrigation district in the west has the lowest annual et of about 200 mm the yellow river along the south of the hid also has a higher annual et close to 1000 mm it also interesting to see that the general main canal has a higher et than the surrounding regions which is the result of longer water diversion duration continuously from april to november and the general main canal width of over 100 m besides the ratios of plant transpiration to total et in plant growing period from april to october differ with plant types and are mainly influenced by their growth regime and water availability which are around 70 67 66 and 61 for crops forests irrigated grass and non irrigated grass respectively the inter annual variations of annual et are mainly controlled by both irrigation water diversion and precipitation the average annual et in the whole hid is the largest in 2012 about 550 mm while the smallest in 2011 about 458 mm total irrigation water diversion in 2012 was 3 84 billion m3 which was significantly less than that in 2011 4 77 billion m3 however annual precipitation in 2012 208 mm was significantly more than that in 2011 47 mm which resulted higher et in 2012 taking 2009 as an example fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of monthly et during the vegetation growth period april to october the monthly et in the western part of hid is relatively small due to the large proportion of desert and gobi which is basically about 20 40 mm month in the central region of hid mainly covered by crops et changes significantly with crop growth in different months with the variation range of 40 150 mm month in the wuliangsuhai lake of the eastern hid et is significantly higher than other areas even reaching a peak value of about 300 mm month in summer due to high temperature long daytime and strong radiation within a year the change of et in cropland is basically corresponding to different crop growth stages the cropland et in april is relatively low of around 40 mm month because most of the crops maize and sunflower are still not sown in may cropland et rises to around 90 mm month which is significantly more than april due to the temperature rise and the spring irrigation in the cropland of the central part in june cropland et in hangjinhouqi and linhe is higher than wuyuan and wulateqianqi which is mainly caused by crop planting pattern in hangjinhouqi and linhe more maize is planted in early may which enters to fast growing stage in june with higher et while in wuyuan and wulateqianqi more sunflower is planted in early june which has lower et in the early growing stage of june from june to august the cropland et increases with the fast growth of crops ranging from 110 to 150 mm month however cropland et declines from september to october due to crop mature and temperature decreasing 3 3 2 water exchange between groundwater and unsaturated soil layer water exchange between groundwater and unsaturated soil layer is an important component of both soil water and groundwater balances in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table groundwater usually receives the recharge from canal seepage irrigated land percolation and occasionally heavy precipitation infiltration while in periods between two irrigation or heavy precipitation events groundwater recharges to the upper unsaturated soil layer which is called capillary rise or groundwater evaporation fig 10 shows the processes of monthly water exchange between groundwater and unsaturated soil layer net capillary rise in irrigated and non irrigated lands of hid irrigation water diversion and groundwater table depth from 2008 to 2014 the annual net capillary rise of irrigated land is 250 610 million m3 33 3 81 2 mm during the non freezing period and accounts for 5 6 14 1 of the irrigation water amount while it is about 590 820 million m3 161 8 224 9 mm for the non irrigated land the irrigated land has far less net capillary rise as compared with non irrigated land mainly because of the suppression of irrigation to capillary rise meanwhile the net capillary rise during the freezing period are 580 840 million m3 77 3 111 9 mm and 320 450 million m3 87 7 123 3 mm in the irrigated and non irrigated lands respectively within a year the monthly net capillary rise of irrigated land shows a greater fluctuation from 320 to 350 million m3 42 7 to 46 7 mm negative values generally appear in may and october due to great infiltration recharge to groundwater caused by great amount of spring and autumn irrigations the valley and peak values of net capillary rise appear in the autumn irrigation period of october and the following freezing period which correspond to the autumn irrigation recharge to groundwater and the drop of groundwater table due to soil freezing respectively obviously changes of net capillary rise in the irrigated land is inconsistent with the change of groundwater table because of the influence of irrigation on capillary rise for non irrigated land monthly net capillary rise has a less fluctuation between 10 and 190 million m3 2 7 to 52 1 mm which is relatively consistent with the change of the groundwater table therefore empirical formulas for capillary rise estimation under the steady evaporation condition are not applicable to irrigated land in irrigation district of the arid region with shallow groundwater table and the influence of irrigation on capillary rise should be considered 3 3 3 drainage through ditches based on the simulation results of drainage by the dahmid model the surface return flow ds and groundwater drainage dg processes from 2008 to 2014 are presented in fig 11 the results depicts that monthly ds and dg range from 2 346 to 67 807 million m3 and from 20 267 to 115 293 million m3 in seven years respectively the average annual total drainage dt the sum of ds and dg in hid is 476 676 million m3 accounting for 10 6 of the irrigation water amount the ds and dg occupy 40 7 and 59 3 of total drainage through ditches respectively which are consistent with the processes of irrigation and groundwater table depth the dt usually reaches the peak in may and october every year because of spring and autumn irrigation applications however the peak values of dg and groundwater table depth are usually observed in june and november about one month lagging behind irrigation peaks more details about drainage simulation results can refer to wen et al 2020 3 3 4 interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land available studies showed that drainage through ditches is not enough to control groundwater table depth and keep salt balance in the whole hid wen et al 2020 and interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land through lateral groundwater flow plays an important role in these aspects wu et al 2009 yu et al 2016 interior drainage is an important type of drainage in irrigated land and also a critical link in agro hydrological processes between the irrigated and non irrigated lands based on the model simulation results monthly interior drainage process in hid during 2008 2014 is shown in fig 12 the annual amounts of interior drainage for hid range from 559 to 713 million m3 from 2008 to 2014 which accounts for 14 3 of irrigation water amount and is 34 9 more than the drainage through ditches in average the change trend of interior drainage is basically similar to those of irrigation and ditch drainage wen et al 2020 reaching its peak in may and october each year due to large amount of spring autumn irrigation applications similar results were also obtained for the qingtongxia irrigation district in the upstream of hid which had an interior drainage amount of 680 million m3 in 2000 and accounted for 11 3 of the irrigation amount han 2009 for irrigated land in different ccas the annual average interior drainage is between 46 1 and 215 7 mm fig 13 the amount of interior drainage is obviously large in wlbh and yc sub irrigation districts due to the large area of non irrigated land accounting for 67 1 in wlbh more groundwater flows from the irrigated land to non irrigated land which results in a greater interior drainage depth per unit irrigated land of about 154 2 215 7 mm on the other hand more irrigation water is needed in yc to leach out the salt in cropland every year because of severe salinity problems which leads to a relatively greater interior drainage depth of 121 3 mm monthly interior drainage amounts from april to november is shown in fig 14 the monthly interior drainages of different ccas range from 7 3 to 43 3 mm reaching peaks in may and october due to spring irrigation and autumn irrigation and the minimum in april because of less irrigation it is worthy to note that some of the ccas have minor negative interior drainage occasionally meaning that groundwater flows reversely from non irrigated land to irrigated land such as the c10 in some months c10 is located in the lower reaches of hid with relatively small irrigation water depth which leads to a large drop of groundwater table in irrgated land when strong evapotranspiration occurs meanwhile groundwater table keeps relatively stable because of less water consumption in non irrigated land covered with sparse vegetation consequently groundwater may flow from non irrigated land to irrigated land in some months in addition there is a large area of desert in wlbh leading to a high level of interior drainage 25 8 38 8 mm per month throughout the year except for september the peak of interior drainage in jfz and yj mainly appears in october when the autumn irrigation applies because spring irrigation amount is small due to the less saline alkaline land here on the contrary there is severe soil salinization in yc with the main crop of sunflower therefore a large amount of spring irrigation is needed in may each year resulting in an interior drainage of 17 6 30 0 mm which is close to that of 15 5 35 7 mm in the period of autumn irrigation consequently the interior drainage process in yc has two peaks in may and october because wlt is located in the lowest reach of hid irrigation water from the yellow river is not enough and groundwater is used as a supplement for irrigation which leads to a lower level of interior drainage of about 2 1 16 4 mm month throughout the year the interior drainage and ditch drainage are important for controlling groundwater table depth in the hid as a whole however insufficient ditch drainage and large amount of interior drainage result in salt accumulation in the whole hid wen et al 2020 especially in non irrigated land the role of interior drainage can be better evaluated by considering the associated dry drainage process and the rationality for the spatial distribution of irrigated and non irrigated lands can be assessed by integrating the present simulation results with further salt water balance analysis which will be done in our future research 3 4 water balance analysis for the whole hid table 3 shows the annual changes of the main water balance components in the whole hid during 2008 2014 the annual average amount of water diversion id is about 4 53 billion m3 which has a slight decrease from 2008 to 2014 the precipitation p is around 1 90 billion m3 about 42 of id mean annual et is 6 09 billion m3 or 95 of id p and et reach its peak of 6 77 billion m3 in 2008 compared with et the ditch drainage d is relatively small with an annual average of only 0 49 billion m3 or 10 7 of id the residual term w id p et d represents the change of soil water and groundwater storages and the effects of other minor water balance components and generally has a negative value which indicates that water recharge is not enough for water consumption and therefore results in the slight decline of groundwater level water balance in an irrigation district is the base for agricultural water management in general precipitation and irrigation are the main water sources for irrigation districts however precipitation is scarce in hid and therefore irrigation is particularly important for crop growth et and ditch drainage are the main components of water consumption the greater et in the hid is resulted from the high temperature and dry climate although drainage is far less than et it has a significant effect on draining salt out of the irrigation district to improve the salt balance other water balance components including lateral recharge of groundwater or rivers around the irrigation district and pumping of groundwater are relatively small compared with those listed in table 3 in addition the control of groundwater table is also the key to regulate water and salt regimes of cropland in the irrigation district in hid the current irrigation amount can keep a relatively stable groundwater table with a slight decreasing trend the decreasing rate of groundwater table of irrigated land is approximately 12 9 mm a while that of non irrigated land is only about 5 5 mm a therefore the reduced irrigation volume from the yellow river after water saving reconstruction has a positive effect on the control of the groundwater table which is favorable to solve the soil salinization problem in cropland 3 5 comparison of different agro hydrological models applied in hid in present study a novel distributed agro hydrological model dahmid is developed which has less parameters requires less data and can realize distributed hydrological simulation in large irrigation districts by dividing simulation units with different inputs and parameters the dahmid model can simulate typical hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table such as groundwater table fluctuation capillary rise and interior drainage in the whole irrigation district or each cca the study region of hid is characterized with different land use types soil textures and crop planting pattern for example the western wlbh sub irrigation district is largely deserted land followed by grassland and cropland mainly maize and sunflower while the eastern yc sub irrigation districts are mainly covered by cropland sunflower and grassland wen et al 2019 the simulation results show that the dahmid model is applicable to different underlying surfaces currently a large number of distributed agro hydrological models have been applied to irrigation district of arid region with shallow groundwater table xu et al 2010 ren et al 2017 xue and ren 2017 xue et al 2018 wu et al 2009 xue and ren 2017 used swap wofost to simulate the hydrological processes and crop growth in hid with nrmses of 8 1 25 2 for groundwater table depth simulation while nrmses between 9 5 and 11 9 is obtained in this study xue et al 2018 established a water productivity model of irrigation district and applied it to jfz sub irrigation district in hid which resulted in rmse nse and r2 of the simulated groundwater table depth of 0 78 m 0 43 and 0 52 in calibration period and 0 67 m 0 64 and 0 50 in validation period respectively while in this study rmse is below 0 30 m and nse and r2 are above 0 94 and 0 84 for both two periods respectively ren et al 2016 established a one dimensional hydrus dualkc model and realized distributed simulation using arcgis however the model lacked consideration of groundwater table fluctuation when simulating the change process of soil water content and et for different crops and vegetation the previous models have their own characteristics and also have some limitations and their simulation accuracy is generally lower than or close to the dahmid model in this study there are also some other problems for previously developed distributed agro hydrological models when applied to irrigation district of arid region with shallow groundwater table first of all some of these models generally consider only the hydrological processes in the vertical direction and ignore lateral interior drainage process in current study we find that the interior drainage in hid accounts for 12 87 14 98 of the total irrigation amount which is higher than the drainage through ditches 10 6 of total irrigation amount in average indicating the importance of interior drainage in the hid and other similar irrigation districts secondly these models are often limited by traditional calculation methods of field scale et and simplify the calculation of regional et in simulation units with heterogeneous land surfaces in this study the remote sensing based htem model was used to estimate pixel scale et that has proven to be more applicable to heterogeneous land surfaces yang and shang 2013 finally the previous models often lack the consideration of the freezing period and cannot achieve continuous simulation in multi years in seasonal frost areas which limits their application on a long term scale in addition capillary rise or groundwater evaporation is generally calculated by empirical formulas from water surface evaporation and groundwater table depth in water balance analysis of irrigation districts hu et al 2004 yue et al 2008 xu et al 2010 xue et al 2017 ren et al 2018 which is more applicable for natural vegetation with less precipitation and no irrigation yu et al 2016 found that capillary rise is also closely related with the infiltration processes of precipitation and irrigation under the state of unsteady et where irrigation or precipitation and evapotranspiration occur alternatively in present study groundwater evaporation can be estimated by eqs 18 to 21 directly based on the groundwater balance showing good performance and applicability overall the dahmid model developed in this study has strong applicability in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table and requires less data as input and therefore it can be better applied to continuous simulation of large irrigation districts in medium and long periods and the simulation accuracy is generally higher than or close to other related models there are also some limitations of the dahmid model that need further improvement first the land use was only simplified to two types irrigated land and non irrigated land however different types of non irrigated land such as grassland shrub lake and wetland and bare land have different behaviors in water balance which should be considered in further studies second although remote sensing based et model gives actual et estimates with satisfactory precision and finer spatial and temporal resolutions it depends on historical data and is not applicable for future scenario analysis appropriate et model applicable for scenario analysis can be considered in future studies third groundwater variation in the freezing and thawing period was simplified and described by an empirical formula which can be further improved by considering the impact of soil freezing and thawing on groundwater 4 conclusions in the current study we developed a novel monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation districts dahmid with shallow groundwater table based on the concepts of canal command area cca and sub drainage command area sdca the dahmid model is applied across the hetao irrigation district hid situated in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region of china the main findings from this study are as follows 1 the dahmid model is driven by meteorology irrigation and remote sensing based et estimations and considers soil and groundwater balances in both irrigated and non irrigated lands and the lateral interior drainage between them the model has the characteristics of fewer parameters and inputs convenient application and long period continuous simulation in freezing and non freezing periods 2 for model simulated groundwater table depth in irrigated and non irrigated lands within different ccas of the hid rmses and nrmses in the calibration and validation periods are both lower than 0 30 m and 11 9 and nses and r2 are both higher than 0 94 and 0 84 respectively indicating the strong applicability of this model in the hid 3 the annual interior drainage of the whole irrigation district is 559 713 million m3 which is 34 9 more than the drainage through ditches and accounts for 12 87 14 98 of the irrigation water amount the interior drainage process is similar to irrigation and ditch drainage processes all reaching their peaks in may and october spatially interior drainage is more effective in wlbh and the middle and southern yc and less effective in the northern wlt which is directly related to the area ratio of irrigated land to non irrigated land 4 total et is the major water consumption in hid which is about 95 of total irrigation water diversion and precipitation in average annual et is mainly controlled by irrigation and precipitation and varies significantly with land use types from about 200 mm in desert and 1000 mm in water bodies meanwhile monthly et changes with meteorological factors land use types and crop growth period in cropland 5 the annual net capillary rise of irrigated land 33 81 mm is significantly lower than that of non irrigated land 162 225 mm due to the impact of irrigation infiltration the process of capillary rise in irrigated land is inconsistent with that of groundwater table because of the suppression of irrigation while these two processes are basically the same for non irrigated land credit authorship contribution statement yeqiang wen methodology software formal analysis investigation data curation visualization writing original draft

3400,agro hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts mainly include precipitation water diversion irrigation drainage evapotranspiration et and soil water and groundwater flow which interact with each other and are controlled by complex natural and anthropogenic drivers to better understand the agro hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table we developed a novel monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation districts dahmid based on the concepts of canal command area cca and sub drainage command area sdca the dahmid model is driven by meteorology irrigation and evapotranspiration et estimated by remote sensing based et model and considers soil water and groundwater balances in both irrigated and non irrigated lands and interior drainage between them the model was applied to hetao irrigation district hid the largest irrigation district in arid region of china with a total irrigated area of 0 68 million ha the dahmid model was calibrated with groundwater table depth measurements in 13 ccas of hid from 2008 to 2010 and validated from 2012 to 2013 results depicted that the root mean square errors rmses normalized rmses nrmses nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients nses and coefficients of determination r2 of groundwater table depth in both irrigated and non irrigated lands for all ccas were in the ranges of 0 19 0 34 m 0 10 0 25 0 30 0 82 and 0 68 0 91 respectively the simulation results from 2008 to 2014 indicated that interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land is an important approach of drainage in hid which is about 14 3 of total irrigation water diversion and 34 9 more than the drainage through ditches the interior drainage process is basically similar to irrigation and ditch drainage processes all reaching their peaks in may and october et is the major water consumption in hid which is about 95 of total irrigation water diversion and precipitation in average the net capillary rise of irrigated land is significantly less than that of non irrigated land due to the impact of irrigation infiltration the dahmid model has less parameters and requires less inputs and can be better applied to continuous simulation of agro hydrological processes in irrigation districts in medium and long periods with satisfactory simulation accuracy keywords agro hydrological model evapotranspiration ditch drainage interior drainage water balance irrigation district 1 introduction irrigation plays an essential role for food production in arid and semi arid regions wen et al 2020 intense evapotranspiration potential and scarce precipitation usually lead to severe water scarcity and fragile ecosystems in these regions pereira et al 2002 kahil et al 2015 therefore agricultural production relies heavily on the irrigation water diverted from river and or pumped from groundwater in irrigation districts of arid regions hassan esfahani et al 2015 ren et al 2016 agriculture consumes about 70 of global fresh water and approximately 90 of it is used for irrigation purpose gao et al 2017 however improper irrigation and drainage practices usually result in groundwater table rising which then induces waterlogging and salinity problems that threaten crop growth wichelns and qadir 2015 ren et al 2017 singh 2019a consequently it is crucial to have a proper and profound understanding of agro hydrological and related salt transport processes for the sustainable development of irrigation districts in arid regions jiang et al 2015 ren et al 2016 xiong et al 2019 unlike the traditional hydrological processes in natural watersheds that are mainly controlled by natural factors agro hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts are also greatly influenced by anthropogenic factors such as crop planting water diversion for irrigation and drainage hu et al 2004 li et al 2017 xiong et al 2019 in arid irrigation districts characterized with less precipitation and local runoff irrigation and drainage dominate other agro hydrological processes e g evapotranspiration et soil water and groundwater flow solute transport and vegetation growth especially in the arid regions with shallow groundwater table the drainage process is critical for controlling waterlogging and salinization problems in irrigation district singh 2019a wen et al 2020 there are usually two types of drainage in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table one is the drainage through ditch system into rivers or lakes as drainage receiver while the other is interior drainage through lateral groundwater flow from irrigated land to non irrigated land due to groundwater table gradient after irrigation lei et al 1998 konukcu et al 2006 the interior drainage is mainly influenced by the distribution and ratio of irrigated and non irrigated lands and the groundwater table gradient between them the interior drainage and accompanied salt transport called dry drainage are crucial for soil salinization control in cropland of arid irrigation districts without sufficient drainage capacity lei et al 1998 wu et al 2009 secondary soil salinization caused by improper irrigation and drainage management in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table can result in severer environmental and geological problems such as reduction of crop yield degradation of natural ecosystem and damage of roads and built infrastructure however most of available models simplify drainage process and ditch systems and are usually lumped water balance model that cannot describe the spatial variability of drainage process especially the interior drainage nousiainen et al 2015 yu et al 2016 youssef et al 2018 therefore it is necessary to develop a distributed agro hydrological model for arid irrigation districts that considers irrigation drainage both ditch drainage and interior drainage et and other agro hydrological processes comprehensively different from hydrological response units hrus in natural watersheds that are mainly controlled by topography and can be divided through digital elevation model dem hrus or simulation units in irrigation districts are also determined by anthropogenic factors like irrigation and drainage systems and crop planting pattern molina navarro et al 2016 li and ren 2019 therefore traditional watershed hydrological models need to be modified to account for the processes related with irrigation and drainage when applied in irrigation districts in recent years agro hydrological models at the irrigation district scale have been gaining more and more attention due to the requirements of increasing agricultural water use efficiency and preventing waterlogging and salinization jiang et al 2015 wen et al 2020 currently a wide variety of hydrological models have been developed and modified to describe the agro hydrological processes at a regional scale siad et al 2019 commonly used physically or process based hydrological models include swat soil and water assessment tool aliyari et al 2019 vic variable infiltration capacity andreadis et al 2017 mike she boegh et al 2004 drainmod youssef et al 2018 tnt2 topography based nitrogen transfer and transformations ferrant et al 2016 flush nousiainen et al 2015 and modflow mirlas 2013 some other water balance based conceptual models have also been applied in different regions hassan esfahani et al 2015 peña arancibia et al 2016 li et al 2017 due to their simplicity applicability and good performances at different spatial and temporal scales some of these models are also coupled with other required modules to enhance their applicability in agricultural regions such as crop growth model siad et al 2019 and groundwater model aliyari et al 2019 however there are several limitations in these available agro hydrological models siad et al 2019 singh 2019b especially when applied to irrigation district with shallow groundwater table depth first lateral groundwater flow and salt transport between different landscapes especially those between irrigated and non irrigated lands are generally ignored in most of the models not coupled with a regional groundwater model van gaelen et al 2017 xu et al 2019 these models are applicable to irrigation districts with deep groundwater table but not reliable in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table where both vertical and horizontal groundwater flow plays an important role in the regional hydrological cycle second et is usually estimated at hru or simulation unit scale without considering the spatial variability of natural and anthropogenic factors including land use cropping pattern irrigation soil and meteorology droogers 2000 ren et al 2016 chang et al 2019 third irrigation and drainage systems are generally simplified because of the system complexity and data availability poch massegú et al 2014 xue and ren 2017 fourth hydrological processes in the freezing and thawing periods are not considered simultaneously with crop growth period in some models peña arancibia et al 2016 ren et al 2016 xue et al 2018 fifth data availability and some other factors also limit their application at regional scale because available distributed agro hydrological models used in large scale and short time step simulations generally require enormous data as model parameters and inputs that are not easily available the main objectives of this study are to develop a monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation district dahmid in arid region with shallow groundwater and apply it to a large irrigation district in northwest china 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the hetao irrigation district hid 40 1 41 4 n 106 1 109 4 e located in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region fig 1 is the largest irrigation district in the arid regions of china the hid covers approximately 1 2 million ha and is composed of five main sub irrigation districts from west upstream to east downstream wulanbuhe wlbh jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and wulate wlt the topography is very flat with a gentle slope of about 0 2 from the southwest to the northeast of hid xu et al 2010 three main soil textures are distributed regionally in hid i e sand in the desert and gobi of the western part silty clay mainly in the southern and eastern regions near the yellow river and wuliangsuhai lake and sandy loam in the rest of the regions xue and ren 2017 yu and shang 2017 the hid lies in a typically arid continental climate zone the mean annual pan evaporation 20 cm pan and precipitation from 1981 to 2009 are about 2240 mm and 160 mm respectively ren et al 2016 wen et al 2019 the average sunshine duration and temperature vary from 3100 to 3300 h and from 7 5 to 9 1 c respectively feng et al 2005 wen et al 2020 the relative low temperature in winter causes a long freezing and thawing period from the mid november to the next april with a duration of about 180 days li et al 2012 total areas of irrigated cropland and grassland are about 0 68 million ha accounting for 66 1 of the whole hid dominant crops in hid are sunflower spring maize and spring wheat which cover more than 80 of cropland from 2012 to 2016 wen et al 2019 the hid have a very complex irrigation canal and drainage ditch systems comprised of seven levels of irrigation canals and drainage ditches with total lengths of 50400 km and 14000 km respectively wen et al 2020 due to the intense et potential and scarce precipitation irrigation water diverted from the yellow river is essential for agricultural production in hid which ranges 3 83 5 10 billion m3 from 2008 to 2014 however the drainage flowing out of hid only accounts for 5 15 of the total irrigation from 2005 to 2015 excessive irrigation and poor drainage lead to shallow groundwater table and severe soil salinity problems in some parts of hid groundwater table depth varies between 0 5 and 3 0 m and the total dissolved solid varies in a wide range of 351 6734 mg l with major ions of na cl so4 2 and hco3 jia et al 2014 the saline soil covers about 75 of the whole hid li et al 2012 ren et al 2018 consequently large amount of groundwater flows through interior drainage and salt transports through dry drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land due to the gradient of groundwater level between these two types of land after irrigation yu et al 2016 found the mean annual interior drainage and dry drainage were 0 36 billion m3 and 1 52 million tons in the four counties of western and middle hid which results in salt accumulation in non irrigated grassland and wetland therefore the sustainability of agriculture and natural ecosystems in hid is severely threatened by salinization problems 2 2 data collection table 1 shows main data required for the model development including meteorology irrigation and drainage remote sensing groundwater table depth canal and ditch systems land use dem and soil texture the meteorological data were collected from two sources for different purposes the daily meteorological dataset including average maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity precipitation wind speed atmospheric pressure and sunshine hours at linhe station was downloaded from china meteorological data service center https data cma cn and provided inputs for remote sensing based et module while the monthly precipitation in five sub irrigation districts was downloaded from the general administration of hetao irrigation district gahid and used for generating maps of regional precipitation monthly irrigation and drainage data from 2008 to 2014 for main canals and sub irrigation districts were obtained from gahid where the irrigation data was used as model input and the drainage data for calibrating and validating the drainage module of the model the irrigation and drainage systems including 267 branch canals and 264 branch ditches were provided by gahid and used to generate the simulation units with independent agro hydrological processes moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis products from 2008 to 2014 including daily surface reflectance products with a resolution of 250 m for bands 1 2 mod09gq and 500 m for bands 1 7 mod09ga and daily land surface temperature product with a resolution of 1000 m mod11a1 were downloaded from national aeronautics and space administration nasa of the united states of america https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov to estimate et using a remote sensing based et model land use map is downloaded from the department of earth system science tsinghua university china https data ess tsinghua edu cn groundwater table depth was measured at 224 wells in every 5 days during 2008 2010 and 2012 2013 the measurement results are interpolated using ordinary kriging method cressie 1988 to obtain their spatial distribution maps in hid with 250 m spatial resolution in addition the annual groundwater extraction data was provided by gahid which was assumed to be uniform in 12 months because groundwater was mainly for domestic and industrial uses 2 3 division of simulation units spatial distribution maps of irrigation and drainage systems sub irrigation districts land use and soil texture were first all reshaped as raster with 250 m spatial resolution then they were aggregated to generate the simulation units in hid for the dahmid model fig 2 2 3 1 canal command areas the canal system is the base for water diversion and allocation in irrigation districts and different irrigation strategies are generally adopted in different command areas in order to distinguish the irrigation practices applied in different regions wen et al 2020 defined the canal command areas ccas as the basic units of irrigation application ccas of main canals are divided based on several factors including the distribution of lower level canals and surrounding ditch system boundaries of sub irrigation districts surface return flow direction determined from dem and cropland boundaries from land use map following principles are considered in dividing the ccas wen et al 2020 a lower level canals of a main canal should be divided into the corresponding cca b the boundaries of a cca are composed of irrigation canals and drainage ditches of the tertiary or higher levels and boundaries of sub irrigation districts around the main canal c when the boundaries divided above are not closed dem land use map and administrative boundaries are considered where the dem and land use map are used to identify the surface return flow and cropland boundaries respectively eventually 13 ccas are divided based on 21 main and secondary irrigation canals in hid fig 2 a compared to wen et al 2020 five small ccas in the south are combined into adjacent command areas 2 3 2 drainage command areas different from ccas the drainage is collected and concentrated by ditch system in irrigation districts and the basic units of drainage concentration are defined as sub drainage command areas sdcas wen et al 2020 sdcas of main ditches are divided considering several related factors including the distribution of lower level ditches and surrounding canal system boundaries of sub irrigation districts groundwater flow direction determined from groundwater level observations and intersection of extended lower level ditches of different main ditches following principles are considered in dividing the scdas wen et al 2020 a lower level secondary and tertiary ditches of a main ditch should be divided into the same sdca b from groundwater flow direction raster layer fig 3 b pixels with groundwater flowing into the same ditch are classified into one sdca c intersection of the extended secondary and tertiary ditches of different main ditches should be considered as a boundary if the boundaries mentioned above are not closed eventually 19 sdcas are divided by 17 main and secondary ditches where the north hid controlled by the general drainage ditch is divided into three sdcas in jfz yj and yc sub irrigation districts respectively fig 2 b 2 3 3 land use map the hid covers several land use types including cropland grassland forest shrub wetland water body impervious surface and bare land yu et al 2013 in current study the land use map was resampled to 250 m spatial resolution and reclassified into irrigated and non irrigated lands to meet the requirement of the model fig 2 c the irrigated land includes all cropland and a very small proportion of grassland considering that the area of irrigated grassland is very small 2 8 of total irrigated land in western and middle hid yu et al 2016 and irrigated grassland was not identified in the land use map of yu et al 2013 cropland was reclassified into irrigated land and other land use types into non irrigated land 2 3 4 sub irrigation district map five sub irrigation districts in fig 2 d are divided by gahid based on irrigation and drainage systems and cultivated land distribution in the hid i e wlbh jfz yj yc and wlt sub irrigation districts they show significant difference in land use and crop planting pattern for example about 62 of wlbh is covered by desert grassland and bare land jfz is the main zone for maize and wheat planting and yc is the most typical zone for sunflower planting yu and shang 2017 wen et al 2019 2 3 5 soil texture map the soil texture map in the hid is processed by arcgis 10 2 based on harmonized world soil database fischer et al 2008 which is available on national tibetan plateau data center https data tpdc ac cn the map was resampled to 250 m spatial resolution from the original 1000 m fig 2 e three dominated soil texture types including sand sandy loam and silty clay cover 10 8 59 5 and 29 7 of hid respectively sandy soil is mainly distributed in wlbh while loamy soil and silty clay soil are in an interlaced distribution in other sub irrigation districts 2 3 6 simulation units based on above mentioned 5 maps 306 simulation units are divided by overlaying these maps into one final map fig 4 f different units show different characteristics in meteorology hydrology agricultural practice underlying surface and soil property their areas range from 0 1 to 1066 6 km2 and larger units are mainly in wlbh with large areas of homogeneous desert 2 4 monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation district dahmid with shallow groundwater table fig 3 shows the schematic diagram of the dahmid model which was developed based on total water balance groundwater balance and soil water balance of irrigated and non irrigated lands of each cca in both non freezing and freezing periods it is composed of several modules including remote sensing based et module semi distributed drainage module variable specific yield sy module for long term groundwater table fluctuation prediction groundwater table simulation module in freezing period and interior drainage module 2 4 1 remote sensing based et model yang and shang 2013 developed a hybrid dual source scheme and trapezoid framework based evapotranspiration model htem based on satellite remote sensing data it used a hybrid scheme of layer and patch approaches for energy allocation guan and wilson 2009 and a trapezoid vegetation index land surface temperature space to decompose the land surface temperature into canopy and soil temperatures long et al 2012 the htem model was proved to be applicable and accurate to estimate et and partition evaporation and transpiration effectively for different ecosystems yang and shang 2013 yang et al 2013 it has also been evaluated to estimate et in the hid yu and shang 2020 shang et al 2021 in current study the modis data was used as data source of the htem from april to october including surface reflectance and land surface temperature products table 1 these modis products were carefully selected and processed by arcgis 10 2 software more details of the htem model can refer to yang and shang 2013 during the freezing period from november to next march et is small due to low temperature and soil freezing an empirical formula was used to estimate monthly et from november to next march yu et al 2016 1 et i k et o i where et i is the actual et in the ith month eto i is the reference et in the ith month calculated from meteorological factors using the penman moteith equation allen et al 1998 and k is an empirical parameter from the results of kaneko et al 2006 k is determined to be about 0 36 for freezing period in hid yu et al 2016 2 4 2 semi distributed drainage model a semi distributed drainage model developed by wen et al 2020 was used to estimate surface return flow and groundwater drainage to the ditch system due to its good applicability simple calculation flexible structure and distributed consideration the drainage model requires monthly groundwater table depth and salinity as inputs which can be provided by other modules of the dahmid model therefore applicability of the semi distributed drainage model is enhanced by coupling with the dahmid model the surface return flow is calculated from a proportion of excess irrigation over a threshold and groundwater drainage is estimated by the difference of water levels in groundwater and ditches according to darcy s law which are wen et al 2020 2 d t i max d g i d s i 0 3 d s i max a i j 1 n i ij i c i a ij 10 3 0 4 d g i k gd i h d i h w i gh i 5 h w i b i d t i c i where d t i d s i and d g i are total drainage surface return flow and groundwater drainage in the ith sdca 104 m3 respectively iij and aij are average irrigation depth of irrigated land in the jth cca mm and the corresponding area hm2 in the ith sdca ici is the threshold above which surface return flow occurs mm ai is the ratio of d s to excess irrigation k gd i is the drainage efficiency coefficient 104 m2 h d i is the equivalent depth of ditches from average land surface to the average ditch bed m h w i is the equivalent water depth of ditches m gh i is average groundwater table depth from average land surface m bi and ci are the parameters for water depth calculation in ditches based on a simplified chézy formula braca 2008 ici ai k gd i h d i bi and ci are model sdca dependent parameters to be calibrated more detailed description of the drainage model can refer to wen et al 2020 in this drainage model the surface return flow is calculated in irrigated land while groundwater drainage is calculated in both irrigated and non irrigated lands based on different groundwater table depths respectively in order to be coupled with dahmid model conveniently the surface return flow and groundwater drainage are allocated to corresponding simulation units which are then summed up to get total drainage in each cca 2 4 3 interior drainage module interior drainage is the process of horizontal groundwater flow from irrigated land to non irrigated land which usually occurs in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table because of groundwater level gradient after irrigation interior drainage is an important supplement to the drainage system in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table which is essential in keeping salt balance in cropland through dry drainage or salt transport associated with interior drainage konukcu et al 2006 yu et al 2016 generally from water balance analysis between irrigated and non irrigated lands total interior drainage of the whole irrigation district can be calculated on an annual or monthly scale lei et al 1998 hu et al 2004 yu et al 2016 these studies generally estimated the interior drainage directly from irrigation drainage meteorological data and groundwater table depth through water balance analysis however distribution of irrigation and drainage systems and the processes of et capillary rise and groundwater fluctuations were usually simplified which made it difficult for the distributed simulation of interior drainage the monthly scale dahmid model is driven by irrigation meteorological data and remote sensing based et and simulate the agro hydrological processes in a distributed manner including drainage interior drainage groundwater fluctuations and capillary rise groundwater table depth gh is the core iterative variable in the model which is closely connected with the interior drainage process from darcy s law for groundwater flow interior drainage is driven by the difference in groundwater levels between irrigated and non irrigated lands therefore the interior drainage in a cca can be calculated by the darcy s law similar to hu et al 2004 6 gt k k gt el a gh a k gh a k 1 2 el na gh na k gh na k 1 2 a s where subscript a and na indicate the irrigated and non irrigated lands respectively gt k is the interior drainage between irrigated and non irrigated lands in the kth month 104 m3 and the positive value indicates the groundwater flow from irrigated land to non irrigated land k gt is the efficiency coefficient of groundwater flow between irrigated and non irrigated lands per unit area el is the average elevation of ground surface m gh k is groundwater table depth at the beginning of the kth month m a s is the area of the simulation unit hm2 in addition to the hydraulic property and difference in groundwater table interior drainage is also related to the thickness of shallow groundwater aquifer and length of boundaries between irrigated and non irrigated lands in different ccas that determine the cross section of groundwater flow 2 4 4 variable specific yield method for long term groundwater fluctuation due to large amount of irrigation from late april to early october in a year the groundwater table depth in hid is generally shallower fluctuating from 0 5 m to 3 0 m during the year which also causes the salinity problems therefore it is of great significance to study the relationship between groundwater fluctuation and irrigation on a monthly scale for the water and salt regulation of irrigation lands and the sustainable development of agriculture in previous studies groundwater fluctuation theories for estimating groundwater recharge and discharge were usually based on a single precipitation or irrigation event with a short time scale crosbie et al 2005 pointed out that the relationship between groundwater recharge and groundwater table was very sensitive to the time step in the dahmid model with a monthly scale groundwater fluctuations are generally caused by multiple precipitation and irrigation events within the month meanwhile the specific yield is not a constant due to the shallow and varying groundwater table therefore we adopt the long term groundwater fluctuation theory proposed by crosbie et al 2005 to describe the water volume and table changes of the unit soil layer and groundwater layer on a long term scale this theory is based on the van genuchten vg 1980 model for soil moisture characteristic curve which can better explain the lisse effect for groundwater fluctuations the variable specific yield is related to the groundwater table depth and calculated by eq 7 and 8 for irrigated and non irrigated lands crosbie et al 2005 respectively 7 s y a s y u s y u 1 α gh a k 1 gh a k 2 100 2 β 1 1 β 8 s y na s y u s y u 1 α gh na k 1 gh na k 2 100 2 β 1 1 β where sy is the apparent specific yield in a long period which changes with the groundwater table depth sy u is the ideal ultimate specific yield close to the difference between saturated and residual water contents crosbie et al 2005 gh k 1 and gh k 2 are the average groundwater table depth of the simulation unit in the k 1th beginning and k 2th end months respectively m α cm 1 and β are soil specific parameters of the vg model van genuchten 1980 where α is the scale parameter inversely proportional to mean pore diameter and β is the shape parameter sy approaches to 0 when the groundwater table depth is close to 0 and approaches to sy u when the groundwater table is deep 2 4 5 water balance model considering the effects of land use and climate on agro hydrological processes the water balance model was developed for both irrigated and non irrigated lands in both non freezing and freezing periods respectively some studies developed the water balance model in soil and groundwater layers based on division of different zones such as root zone transitional zone and saturated zone wen et al 2017 li et al 2017 xue et al 2018 given that the possible great fluctuation of groundwater table that may even be close to land surface in shallow groundwater regions total water balance of soil and shallow groundwater layers is firstly analyzed in non freezing period from april to november eqs 9 and 10 describe total water balance in irrigated and non irrigated lands of each simulation unit respectively following the annul water balance equations of yu et al 2016 and considering changes in water storage due to groundwater table fluctuations and eqs 11 to 14 are the calculations of water balance components 9 p a k i k

canal seepage evapotranspiration groundwater inflow groundwater outflow and groundwater extraction for urban use in the kth month mm respectively d s k and d g k are surface return flow and groundwater drainage in eqs 3 and 4 104 m3 gt k is the amount of interior drainage in eq 6 104 m3 gh k and gh k 1 are groundwater table depth in the kth and k 1 th month m syk is the apparent specific yield in kth month calculated using eqs 7 and 8 by replacing k 1 with k and k 2 with k 1 id k is total irrigation water allocated to a simulation unit in the kth month 104 m3 l a l na and l are the lengths of canal system in irrigated land non irrigated land and the whole unit respectively η c is the canal efficiency γ is the ratio of canal seepage to the total canal loss lcs is allocated based on the lengths of canals in irrigated and non irrigated lands gi is calculated in eq 14 based on the assumption that the water consumption and supplement are balanced in annual scale yu et al 2016 and the positive and negative values indicate net groundwater inflow and outflow respectively in the above equations six parameters i e k gt sy u α β η c and γ need to be calibrated in different ccas during the freezing period from december to next march irrigation stops in hid and there is no drainage from field observation from meteorological observation data and previous studies total precipitation and et are both about 20 mm during december to march in the hid li et al 2012 which are very small compared with those in non freezing months therefore water balance during freezing period from december to march was analyzed together with that of april consequently eqs 15 and 16 are obtained based on total water balance in irrigated and non irrigated lands in freezing period and

respectively to estimate groundwater table depth in the freezing period an empirical model of groundwater table fluctuation proposed by liu et al 2017 was adopted shown in eq 17 the empirical model was developed based on the relationship between temperature and groundwater table changes during freezing period and has successfully applied in hid 17 gh k 1 gh k 0 0433 t k 1 t k 2 0 0043 where tk 1 and tk 2 are temperatures of the k 1 th and k 2 th months respectively from the total water balance of the soil and shallow groundwater layers groundwater table depth can be simulated continuously furthermore water exchange between the soil layer and groundwater layer can be estimated by eq 18 to 21 18 ps a k η p p k η i i k d s k a sa 10 3 η l lcs a k 19 ps na k η p p k η l lcs na k 20 ge a k

month mm η p η i and η l are infiltration recharge coefficients of precipitation field irrigation and canal seepage and were set as 0 10 0 30 and 0 15 respectively according to previous studies in hid yu et al 2016 xue et al 2017 ge k is the groundwater evaporation of the kth month i e capillary rise from groundwater table which can be calculated based on water balance in the fluctuation region of groundwater table sy g is the specific yield of the fluctuation region of groundwater table and was set as 0 07 following xue et al 2017 in addition the monthly dahmid model runs based on each cca where the differences among 306 simulation units are reflected by inputs and parameters related with cca sdca land use soil texture and sub irrigation district for example the irrigation depth canal seepage et and groundwater table depth were averaged and allocated to the irrigated land and non irrigated land of each cca based on the combination of cca and land use map drainage was calculated based on the combination of ccas sdcas and land use map parameters related with soil water characteristics changed with the combination of cca land use map and soil texture map precipitation and thickness of shallow groundwater aquifer were allocated to five sub irrigation districts fig 2 d 2 5 model evaluation and sensitivity analysis the drainage module is relatively independent with other modules which has six parameters in each sdca ai and ici in eq 3 k gd i and h d i in eq 4 and bi and ci in eq 6 these parameters were calibrated with the genetic algorithm holland 1973 by minimizing the root mean squared error rmse between simulated and observed monthly drainage during 2008 2010 and the model was further validated with drainage data from 2012 to 2013 wen et al 2020 other parameters of the dahmid model can be classified into 3 categories including specific yield canal water loss and seepage and groundwater flow parameters related with the specific yield sy u α and β vary with soil texture types fig 2 e and their values in each cca were determined from the corresponding dominant soil texture except for cca 1 the other three parameters η c γ and k gt are cca dependent and need to be calibrated for each cca the model was calibrated similar to the drainage model by minimizing the rmse between observed and simulated groundwater table depth in each cca during 2008 2010 and validated with data during 2012 2013 moreover 4 wildly used indicators were selected to evaluate the model performance for groundwater table depth eq 22 to 25 including rmse willmott 1982 normalized rmse nrmse jamieson et al 1991 nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and coefficient of determination r 2 nagelkerke 1991 22 rmse 1 n k 1 n obs k sim k 2 23 nrmse rmse max obs min obs 24 nse 1 k 1 n sim k obs k 2 k 1 n obs k obs 2 25 r 2 k 1 n obs k obs sim k sim 2 k 1 n obs k obs 2 k 1 n sim k sim 2 where obs and sim are observations and simulations respectively and obs and sim are the averages of observations and simulations respectively generally a model performs better when rmse and nrmse are close to 0 and nse and r 2 are close to 1 to find the sensitivity of model parameters sensitivity analysis was conducted in 13 ccas for irrigated and non irrigated lands the commonly used one factor at a time oat method was adopted to evaluate the effects of model parameters on the groundwater table depth at a time we set a variation range of 5 to 5 for one parameter while leaving the rest parameters unchanged and the sensitivity can be calculated as follows gedeon and mallants 2012 26 s n δ gh gh δ p v n p v n where sn is the sensitivity of the nth parameter and parameters of the drainage module were not considered n 1 2 6 δ gh is the variation of simulated gh δ p v n represents the change of the nth parameter and p v n is the value of the nth parameter 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation details of the calibration and validation results of the drainage module can refer to wen et al 2020 the calibrated results of other model parameters are shown in table 2 the soil texture dependent parameters of specific yield sy u α and β are in the ranges of 0 12 0 20 0 02 0 05 cm 1 and 1 5 2 0 respectively generally coarse soil has greater sy u and β and smaller α and greater sy u indicate poorer water holding capacity the values of η c and γ in different ccas vary in the ranges of 0 40 0 65 and 0 84 0 96 respectively xue et al 2018 simulated the water balance of jfz sub irrigation district of hid and obtained an average η c of 0 51 during 2000 2009 which is in the range of 0 45 0 55 for ccas c2 c6 in the jfz sub irrigation district table 2 the minimum value of γ appears in wlbh sub irrigation district which is caused by the large proportion of desert and dry climate in this area the value of k gt is between 0 10 and 0 40 which determines the transmission efficiency of interior drainage per unit area in each cca and the maximum value appears in yc sub irrigation district we evaluated the model performance in simulating groundwater table depth by comparing simulated with observed groundwater table depths during the calibration period 2008 2010 and validation period 2012 2013 in irrigated and non irrigated lands within each cca fig 4 the rmse values of groundwater table depth in irrigated and non irrigated lands are less than 0 30 m in both periods nrmse values within 12 nse values greater than 0 94 and r2 values greater than 0 84 during the freezing period the rmses are less than 0 19 m the nrmses less than 6 the nses greater than 0 86 and r2 greater than 0 93 therefore the empirical method of groundwater table depth simulation during the freezing period provides a stable foundation for the inter annual continuous simulation of hydrological processes in the irrigation district moreover the model performance for irrigated land is slightly better than non irrigated land in the study region observation wells are mainly distributed in or around the irrigated cropland therefore average groundwater table depth in the irrigated land estimated through kriging interpolation may be more accurate than that in the non irrigated land which may be a possible reason for slightly better performance of groundwater table depth simulation in irrigated land besides it is natural that the accuracy of calibration period is slightly better than the validation period in summary the model performs well in the simulation of groundwater table depth in hid the simulated and observed processes of groundwater table depth are compared for different ccas figs 5 and 6 the rmse nrmse nse and r2 values of irrigated and non irrigated lands in different ccas are in the ranges of 0 19 0 34 m 0 10 0 25 0 30 0 82 and 0 68 0 91 respectively the simulation accuracy of the model is acceptable and the changing trend and process of groundwater table depth can be simulated reasonably well 3 2 sensitivity of model parameters to understand the influences of model parameters on the simulation results sensitivity of the six calibrated model parameters η c γ sy u α β and k gt on groundwater table depth was analyzed fig 7 shows the sensitivity values normalized linearly to the range of 0 for the least sensitive parameter to 1 for the most sensitive parameter and rankings of different parameters in irrigated and non irrigated lands of different ccas the greater the sensitivity or the smaller the ranking the more sensitive the parameter in irrigated land the groundwater table depth is most sensitive to γ and β followed by sy u and η c while α and k gt are less sensitive because the canal seepage is one of the main recharge sources for groundwater γ has a direct impact on the groundwater table depth which results in the high sensitivity of γ k gt represents the horizontal flow of groundwater with weaker effect on the change of groundwater table and therefore is the least sensitive for non irrigated land the sensitivity values of most parameters are close to those of irrigated land however it is worth noting that k gt of non irrigated land shows higher sensitivity than irrigated land mainly because interior drainage is the one of the main recharge sources for non irrigated land meanwhile groundwater table depth in non irrigated land is generally less sensitive to η c than irrigated land 3 3 main agro hydrological processes in hid main agro hydrological processes in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table such as hid include irrigation et drainage through ditches interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land through lateral groundwater flow and groundwater evaporation capillary rise in hid soil salinization control is crucial which generally depends on the control of groundwater table depth to an appropriate range by reducing irrigation water diversion and increasing water consumption and drainage since the implementation of water saving reconstruction in hid from 1998 the amount of annual water diversion in hid has dropped from about 5 0 billion m3 to about 4 5 billion m3 which caused a slight decline in the groundwater level however some parts of the hid especially the lower parts still face severe salinity problems understanding the patterns of agro hydrological processes and their changes with water saving measures is key for the agricultural development of the study region 3 3 1 evapotranspiration et the et is the major water consumption component in the arid irrigation district which changes in both space and time the spatial distributions of annual et in hid from 2008 to 2014 are shown in fig 8 for different land use types the wetland and water body have the largest mean annual et of 631 704 mm followed by crop land 440 545 mm forest 395 498 mm and irrigated grass 390 492 mm construction land 333 438 mm non irrigated grassland 190 299 mm and desert 142 249 mm in general wuliangsuhai lake in the east hid has a peak annual et of about 1000 mm while the desert and gobi regions of the wulanbuhe sub irrigation district in the west has the lowest annual et of about 200 mm the yellow river along the south of the hid also has a higher annual et close to 1000 mm it also interesting to see that the general main canal has a higher et than the surrounding regions which is the result of longer water diversion duration continuously from april to november and the general main canal width of over 100 m besides the ratios of plant transpiration to total et in plant growing period from april to october differ with plant types and are mainly influenced by their growth regime and water availability which are around 70 67 66 and 61 for crops forests irrigated grass and non irrigated grass respectively the inter annual variations of annual et are mainly controlled by both irrigation water diversion and precipitation the average annual et in the whole hid is the largest in 2012 about 550 mm while the smallest in 2011 about 458 mm total irrigation water diversion in 2012 was 3 84 billion m3 which was significantly less than that in 2011 4 77 billion m3 however annual precipitation in 2012 208 mm was significantly more than that in 2011 47 mm which resulted higher et in 2012 taking 2009 as an example fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of monthly et during the vegetation growth period april to october the monthly et in the western part of hid is relatively small due to the large proportion of desert and gobi which is basically about 20 40 mm month in the central region of hid mainly covered by crops et changes significantly with crop growth in different months with the variation range of 40 150 mm month in the wuliangsuhai lake of the eastern hid et is significantly higher than other areas even reaching a peak value of about 300 mm month in summer due to high temperature long daytime and strong radiation within a year the change of et in cropland is basically corresponding to different crop growth stages the cropland et in april is relatively low of around 40 mm month because most of the crops maize and sunflower are still not sown in may cropland et rises to around 90 mm month which is significantly more than april due to the temperature rise and the spring irrigation in the cropland of the central part in june cropland et in hangjinhouqi and linhe is higher than wuyuan and wulateqianqi which is mainly caused by crop planting pattern in hangjinhouqi and linhe more maize is planted in early may which enters to fast growing stage in june with higher et while in wuyuan and wulateqianqi more sunflower is planted in early june which has lower et in the early growing stage of june from june to august the cropland et increases with the fast growth of crops ranging from 110 to 150 mm month however cropland et declines from september to october due to crop mature and temperature decreasing 3 3 2 water exchange between groundwater and unsaturated soil layer water exchange between groundwater and unsaturated soil layer is an important component of both soil water and groundwater balances in irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table groundwater usually receives the recharge from canal seepage irrigated land percolation and occasionally heavy precipitation infiltration while in periods between two irrigation or heavy precipitation events groundwater recharges to the upper unsaturated soil layer which is called capillary rise or groundwater evaporation fig 10 shows the processes of monthly water exchange between groundwater and unsaturated soil layer net capillary rise in irrigated and non irrigated lands of hid irrigation water diversion and groundwater table depth from 2008 to 2014 the annual net capillary rise of irrigated land is 250 610 million m3 33 3 81 2 mm during the non freezing period and accounts for 5 6 14 1 of the irrigation water amount while it is about 590 820 million m3 161 8 224 9 mm for the non irrigated land the irrigated land has far less net capillary rise as compared with non irrigated land mainly because of the suppression of irrigation to capillary rise meanwhile the net capillary rise during the freezing period are 580 840 million m3 77 3 111 9 mm and 320 450 million m3 87 7 123 3 mm in the irrigated and non irrigated lands respectively within a year the monthly net capillary rise of irrigated land shows a greater fluctuation from 320 to 350 million m3 42 7 to 46 7 mm negative values generally appear in may and october due to great infiltration recharge to groundwater caused by great amount of spring and autumn irrigations the valley and peak values of net capillary rise appear in the autumn irrigation period of october and the following freezing period which correspond to the autumn irrigation recharge to groundwater and the drop of groundwater table due to soil freezing respectively obviously changes of net capillary rise in the irrigated land is inconsistent with the change of groundwater table because of the influence of irrigation on capillary rise for non irrigated land monthly net capillary rise has a less fluctuation between 10 and 190 million m3 2 7 to 52 1 mm which is relatively consistent with the change of the groundwater table therefore empirical formulas for capillary rise estimation under the steady evaporation condition are not applicable to irrigated land in irrigation district of the arid region with shallow groundwater table and the influence of irrigation on capillary rise should be considered 3 3 3 drainage through ditches based on the simulation results of drainage by the dahmid model the surface return flow ds and groundwater drainage dg processes from 2008 to 2014 are presented in fig 11 the results depicts that monthly ds and dg range from 2 346 to 67 807 million m3 and from 20 267 to 115 293 million m3 in seven years respectively the average annual total drainage dt the sum of ds and dg in hid is 476 676 million m3 accounting for 10 6 of the irrigation water amount the ds and dg occupy 40 7 and 59 3 of total drainage through ditches respectively which are consistent with the processes of irrigation and groundwater table depth the dt usually reaches the peak in may and october every year because of spring and autumn irrigation applications however the peak values of dg and groundwater table depth are usually observed in june and november about one month lagging behind irrigation peaks more details about drainage simulation results can refer to wen et al 2020 3 3 4 interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land available studies showed that drainage through ditches is not enough to control groundwater table depth and keep salt balance in the whole hid wen et al 2020 and interior drainage from irrigated land to non irrigated land through lateral groundwater flow plays an important role in these aspects wu et al 2009 yu et al 2016 interior drainage is an important type of drainage in irrigated land and also a critical link in agro hydrological processes between the irrigated and non irrigated lands based on the model simulation results monthly interior drainage process in hid during 2008 2014 is shown in fig 12 the annual amounts of interior drainage for hid range from 559 to 713 million m3 from 2008 to 2014 which accounts for 14 3 of irrigation water amount and is 34 9 more than the drainage through ditches in average the change trend of interior drainage is basically similar to those of irrigation and ditch drainage wen et al 2020 reaching its peak in may and october each year due to large amount of spring autumn irrigation applications similar results were also obtained for the qingtongxia irrigation district in the upstream of hid which had an interior drainage amount of 680 million m3 in 2000 and accounted for 11 3 of the irrigation amount han 2009 for irrigated land in different ccas the annual average interior drainage is between 46 1 and 215 7 mm fig 13 the amount of interior drainage is obviously large in wlbh and yc sub irrigation districts due to the large area of non irrigated land accounting for 67 1 in wlbh more groundwater flows from the irrigated land to non irrigated land which results in a greater interior drainage depth per unit irrigated land of about 154 2 215 7 mm on the other hand more irrigation water is needed in yc to leach out the salt in cropland every year because of severe salinity problems which leads to a relatively greater interior drainage depth of 121 3 mm monthly interior drainage amounts from april to november is shown in fig 14 the monthly interior drainages of different ccas range from 7 3 to 43 3 mm reaching peaks in may and october due to spring irrigation and autumn irrigation and the minimum in april because of less irrigation it is worthy to note that some of the ccas have minor negative interior drainage occasionally meaning that groundwater flows reversely from non irrigated land to irrigated land such as the c10 in some months c10 is located in the lower reaches of hid with relatively small irrigation water depth which leads to a large drop of groundwater table in irrgated land when strong evapotranspiration occurs meanwhile groundwater table keeps relatively stable because of less water consumption in non irrigated land covered with sparse vegetation consequently groundwater may flow from non irrigated land to irrigated land in some months in addition there is a large area of desert in wlbh leading to a high level of interior drainage 25 8 38 8 mm per month throughout the year except for september the peak of interior drainage in jfz and yj mainly appears in october when the autumn irrigation applies because spring irrigation amount is small due to the less saline alkaline land here on the contrary there is severe soil salinization in yc with the main crop of sunflower therefore a large amount of spring irrigation is needed in may each year resulting in an interior drainage of 17 6 30 0 mm which is close to that of 15 5 35 7 mm in the period of autumn irrigation consequently the interior drainage process in yc has two peaks in may and october because wlt is located in the lowest reach of hid irrigation water from the yellow river is not enough and groundwater is used as a supplement for irrigation which leads to a lower level of interior drainage of about 2 1 16 4 mm month throughout the year the interior drainage and ditch drainage are important for controlling groundwater table depth in the hid as a whole however insufficient ditch drainage and large amount of interior drainage result in salt accumulation in the whole hid wen et al 2020 especially in non irrigated land the role of interior drainage can be better evaluated by considering the associated dry drainage process and the rationality for the spatial distribution of irrigated and non irrigated lands can be assessed by integrating the present simulation results with further salt water balance analysis which will be done in our future research 3 4 water balance analysis for the whole hid table 3 shows the annual changes of the main water balance components in the whole hid during 2008 2014 the annual average amount of water diversion id is about 4 53 billion m3 which has a slight decrease from 2008 to 2014 the precipitation p is around 1 90 billion m3 about 42 of id mean annual et is 6 09 billion m3 or 95 of id p and et reach its peak of 6 77 billion m3 in 2008 compared with et the ditch drainage d is relatively small with an annual average of only 0 49 billion m3 or 10 7 of id the residual term w id p et d represents the change of soil water and groundwater storages and the effects of other minor water balance components and generally has a negative value which indicates that water recharge is not enough for water consumption and therefore results in the slight decline of groundwater level water balance in an irrigation district is the base for agricultural water management in general precipitation and irrigation are the main water sources for irrigation districts however precipitation is scarce in hid and therefore irrigation is particularly important for crop growth et and ditch drainage are the main components of water consumption the greater et in the hid is resulted from the high temperature and dry climate although drainage is far less than et it has a significant effect on draining salt out of the irrigation district to improve the salt balance other water balance components including lateral recharge of groundwater or rivers around the irrigation district and pumping of groundwater are relatively small compared with those listed in table 3 in addition the control of groundwater table is also the key to regulate water and salt regimes of cropland in the irrigation district in hid the current irrigation amount can keep a relatively stable groundwater table with a slight decreasing trend the decreasing rate of groundwater table of irrigated land is approximately 12 9 mm a while that of non irrigated land is only about 5 5 mm a therefore the reduced irrigation volume from the yellow river after water saving reconstruction has a positive effect on the control of the groundwater table which is favorable to solve the soil salinization problem in cropland 3 5 comparison of different agro hydrological models applied in hid in present study a novel distributed agro hydrological model dahmid is developed which has less parameters requires less data and can realize distributed hydrological simulation in large irrigation districts by dividing simulation units with different inputs and parameters the dahmid model can simulate typical hydrological processes in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table such as groundwater table fluctuation capillary rise and interior drainage in the whole irrigation district or each cca the study region of hid is characterized with different land use types soil textures and crop planting pattern for example the western wlbh sub irrigation district is largely deserted land followed by grassland and cropland mainly maize and sunflower while the eastern yc sub irrigation districts are mainly covered by cropland sunflower and grassland wen et al 2019 the simulation results show that the dahmid model is applicable to different underlying surfaces currently a large number of distributed agro hydrological models have been applied to irrigation district of arid region with shallow groundwater table xu et al 2010 ren et al 2017 xue and ren 2017 xue et al 2018 wu et al 2009 xue and ren 2017 used swap wofost to simulate the hydrological processes and crop growth in hid with nrmses of 8 1 25 2 for groundwater table depth simulation while nrmses between 9 5 and 11 9 is obtained in this study xue et al 2018 established a water productivity model of irrigation district and applied it to jfz sub irrigation district in hid which resulted in rmse nse and r2 of the simulated groundwater table depth of 0 78 m 0 43 and 0 52 in calibration period and 0 67 m 0 64 and 0 50 in validation period respectively while in this study rmse is below 0 30 m and nse and r2 are above 0 94 and 0 84 for both two periods respectively ren et al 2016 established a one dimensional hydrus dualkc model and realized distributed simulation using arcgis however the model lacked consideration of groundwater table fluctuation when simulating the change process of soil water content and et for different crops and vegetation the previous models have their own characteristics and also have some limitations and their simulation accuracy is generally lower than or close to the dahmid model in this study there are also some other problems for previously developed distributed agro hydrological models when applied to irrigation district of arid region with shallow groundwater table first of all some of these models generally consider only the hydrological processes in the vertical direction and ignore lateral interior drainage process in current study we find that the interior drainage in hid accounts for 12 87 14 98 of the total irrigation amount which is higher than the drainage through ditches 10 6 of total irrigation amount in average indicating the importance of interior drainage in the hid and other similar irrigation districts secondly these models are often limited by traditional calculation methods of field scale et and simplify the calculation of regional et in simulation units with heterogeneous land surfaces in this study the remote sensing based htem model was used to estimate pixel scale et that has proven to be more applicable to heterogeneous land surfaces yang and shang 2013 finally the previous models often lack the consideration of the freezing period and cannot achieve continuous simulation in multi years in seasonal frost areas which limits their application on a long term scale in addition capillary rise or groundwater evaporation is generally calculated by empirical formulas from water surface evaporation and groundwater table depth in water balance analysis of irrigation districts hu et al 2004 yue et al 2008 xu et al 2010 xue et al 2017 ren et al 2018 which is more applicable for natural vegetation with less precipitation and no irrigation yu et al 2016 found that capillary rise is also closely related with the infiltration processes of precipitation and irrigation under the state of unsteady et where irrigation or precipitation and evapotranspiration occur alternatively in present study groundwater evaporation can be estimated by eqs 18 to 21 directly based on the groundwater balance showing good performance and applicability overall the dahmid model developed in this study has strong applicability in arid irrigation districts with shallow groundwater table and requires less data as input and therefore it can be better applied to continuous simulation of large irrigation districts in medium and long periods and the simulation accuracy is generally higher than or close to other related models there are also some limitations of the dahmid model that need further improvement first the land use was only simplified to two types irrigated land and non irrigated land however different types of non irrigated land such as grassland shrub lake and wetland and bare land have different behaviors in water balance which should be considered in further studies second although remote sensing based et model gives actual et estimates with satisfactory precision and finer spatial and temporal resolutions it depends on historical data and is not applicable for future scenario analysis appropriate et model applicable for scenario analysis can be considered in future studies third groundwater variation in the freezing and thawing period was simplified and described by an empirical formula which can be further improved by considering the impact of soil freezing and thawing on groundwater 4 conclusions in the current study we developed a novel monthly distributed agro hydrological model for irrigation districts dahmid with shallow groundwater table based on the concepts of canal command area cca and sub drainage command area sdca the dahmid model is applied across the hetao irrigation district hid situated in the west of inner mongolia autonomous region of china the main findings from this study are as follows 1 the dahmid model is driven by meteorology irrigation and remote sensing based et estimations and considers soil and groundwater balances in both irrigated and non irrigated lands and the lateral interior drainage between them the model has the characteristics of fewer parameters and inputs convenient application and long period continuous simulation in freezing and non freezing periods 2 for model simulated groundwater table depth in irrigated and non irrigated lands within different ccas of the hid rmses and nrmses in the calibration and validation periods are both lower than 0 30 m and 11 9 and nses and r2 are both higher than 0 94 and 0 84 respectively indicating the strong applicability of this model in the hid 3 the annual interior drainage of the whole irrigation district is 559 713 million m3 which is 34 9 more than the drainage through ditches and accounts for 12 87 14 98 of the irrigation water amount the interior drainage process is similar to irrigation and ditch drainage processes all reaching their peaks in may and october spatially interior drainage is more effective in wlbh and the middle and southern yc and less effective in the northern wlt which is directly related to the area ratio of irrigated land to non irrigated land 4 total et is the major water consumption in hid which is about 95 of total irrigation water diversion and precipitation in average annual et is mainly controlled by irrigation and precipitation and varies significantly with land use types from about 200 mm in desert and 1000 mm in water bodies meanwhile monthly et changes with meteorological factors land use types and crop growth period in cropland 5 the annual net capillary rise of irrigated land 33 81 mm is significantly lower than that of non irrigated land 162 225 mm due to the impact of irrigation infiltration the process of capillary rise in irrigated land is inconsistent with that of groundwater table because of the suppression of irrigation while these two processes are basically the same for non irrigated land credit authorship contribution statement yeqiang wen methodology software formal analysis investigation data curation visualization writing original draft

3401,outflow forecasting of upstream large hydropower stations is essential for dispatching of cascade hydropower system in this study seven outflow forecasting methods were proposed from aspects of optimizing power generation streamflow water energy conversion characteristics and data mining and were applied to the actual dispatching of the three gorges gezhouba cascade hydropower system in china results show that the data mining method for tail water level is recommended to replace empirical formula for its insensitivity with outflow deviations in rolling forecast due to the complex hydrological characteristics the data mining method is the only recommended method to forecast outflow in the flood season while in the non flood season the variable comprehensive efficiency and water consumption rate methods are also workable these three recommended outflow forecasting methods can reduce the accumulative deviation of tail and forebay water level and improve the operation safety of cascade hydropower system significantly keywords upstream large hydropower stations outflow forecasting methods tail water level forecasting short term dispatching rules hydraulic connections 1 introduction upstream large hydropower stations are usually equipped with immediate downstream hydropower stations to reregulate sharp fluctuations in outflow caused by peak load regulation this results in the formation of cascade hydropower system henceforth system with tight hydraulic connections lu et al 2018 su et al 2020 firstly if the local inflow between system is negligible the inflow of the downstream hydropower station is basically determined by the outflow of the upstream hydropower station secondly the forebay water level of the downstream hydropower station can raise the tail water level of the upstream hydropower station i e jacking effects resulting in a decrease in head for power generation the three gorges gezhouba cascade hydropower system henceforth three gorges system in china represents a good example of this arrangement chen et al 2014 during the part of a year when all river flow is used for power generation henceforth non abandoning season dispatchers in the three gorges cascade dispatch communication center henceforth dispatch center first determine the final upstream water level of the next day according to the mid term water level target and inflow forecast then they formulate the output scheme of the three gorges hydropower station henceforth three gorges considering constraints of the power grid and operation conditions of units shang et al 2019 finally the grid will verify the submitted output scheme and send it to dispatch center in the form of instructions based on the output scheme outflow of three gorges and gezhouba hydropower station henceforth gezhouba can be estimated unfortunately as gezhouba is a run of river hydropower station ma et al 2013 if the outflow forecasting deviations of three gorges are large then the forebay water level of gezhouba will deviate greatly from the planned level or even violate the water limit boundary when the output scheme is determined the selection of solution methods and determination of head for power generation deeply affect the accuracy of forecasting outflow for the former at present the following two types of classical methods can be applied to forecast outflow for the upstream large hydropower station in the actual dispatching 1 outflow forecasting methods ofm based on optimizing power generation streamflow osw of the whole plant 2 outflow forecasting methods based on water energy conversion characteristics wecc of the whole plant chen et al 2020b in general hydropower stations expect to generate the given output with minimum or approximate minimum power generation streamflow many mathematical programming techniques have been used to achieve this goal taktak and d ambrosio 2017 while the dynamic programming grygier and stedinger 1985 method is the most classical and reliable choice however for large hydropower stations with more than 10 units the computational efficiency of dynamic programming is insufficient to meet requirements of the short term dispatching cheng et al 2009 therefore dynamic programming algorithm is often used to formulate an optimal load allocation table olat to realize rapid calculations mainly due to the large number of units and complex constraints other mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming mixed integer linear programming decomposition methods and lagrangian relaxation are not widely used in large hydropower stations ji et al 2017 taktak and d ambrosio 2017 besides many heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm shang et al 2017 particle swarm optimization cheng et al 2009 chuanwen and bompard 2005 evolutionary programming sinha et al 2003 somasundaram et al 2004 have been utilized to forecast outflow but their distributing output and outflow of each unit are unsteady water energy conversion characteristics wecc characterize the overall operation performances of hydropower stations its water energy conversion efficiency can be expressed by comprehensive efficiency coefficient k and water consumption rate r the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f carvajal et al 2017 he et al 2019a zhong et al 2020 the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v and the water consumption rate method ofm wecc r chen et al 2020b are the most common choices these methods based on water energy conversion characteristics solve the outflow forecasting problem by analyzing historical operation data of hydropower stations and fitting the relationship curves with head as parameters they all ignore the efficiency difference of units and own high calculation timeliness however complex hydrological characteristics caused by peak load regulation result in significant nonlinearity onto fitted relationship curves especially during the flood season it will reduce the accuracy of forecasting tail water level and outflow chen et al 2020a shang et al 2019 as for head it is determined by forebay and tail water level when the upstream large hydropower station conducts peak load regulation tasks its forebay water level between periods not changes greatly which benefiting from its large reservoir capacity but its tail water level is easily affected by early output and tail water level i e aftereffects shang et al 2019 most scholars and site dispatchers often utilize the static three dimensional curve whose parameters are outflow and tail water level of the upstream hydropower station and forebay water level of the downstream hydropower station respectively to forecast the tail water level abril and knight 2004 basso and botter 2012 cordova et al 2014 shang et al 2019 pointed out that this static three dimensional curve could not reflect aftereffects of tail water level when output of hydropower stations was fluctuating quickly and established an artificial neural network ann besaw et al 2010 model for tail water level by the historical monitoring data however this study primarily focused on the forecasting accuracy of tail water level and did not explicitly address how to combine the ann tail water level model with classical outflow forecasting methods crucial hydropower stations generally attach great importance to the collection of operation data these data contain crucial dispatching information such as explicit and implicit hydrological characteristics the dispatching rules of hydropower stations and artificial experiences chen et al 2007 feng et al 2019 suiadee and tingsanchali 2007 in recent years extensive studies have been conducted to abstract dispatching rules from data mining feng et al 2019 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b compared with long term dispatching he et al 2019b short term dispatching features shorter time scales more historical data sets and a higher model complexity at the same time disturbances from loads and other factors are stronger chan et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is hard to establish the short term dispatching rules from data mining and there are only a few relevant studies even less research has been done on short term dispatching rules involving forecasting accuracy for example ma et al 2013 only tried to extract the short term dispatching rules of hydropower stations from the perspective of optimization there are many cascade hydropower systems kosterev 2004 liang et al 2021 rosen et al 2010 with similar engineering arrangements and hydraulic connections like three gorges system in the world therefore in addition to improving the outflow forecasting accuracy for the upstream large hydropower stations another motivation of this study is to supply fairly applicable and practical modeling ideas the remainder is organized as follows section 2 introduces study area and data section 3 first introduces methodology and then lists accuracy evaluation indices comparative tests and analyses are shown in section 4 following which section 5 explains the authors understanding of outflow forecast and discusses the practicability and the potential in improving accuracy section 6 summarizes the study 2 study area and data the three gorges gezhouba cascade water conservancy project is located on the main stream of yangtze river china its joint dispatching plays an irreplaceable role in flood control power generation and so on in the yangtze region ren et al 2021 sha et al 2015 three gorges has the largest installed capacity of any hydropower station in the world up to 22500 mw and the expected streamflow for power generation is approximately 31 000 m3s 1 the period of time allocated to discarding water has generally comprised no more than 2 of the annual operating period of three gorges in recent years gezhouba is located 38 km downstream from the dam site of three gorges the lag time between them is approximately 30 min and local inflow is almost negligible the location and engineering layout of three gorges system are shown in fig 1 wherein that the fenghuangshan and sandouping hydrological stations monitor forebay and tail water level of three gorges respectively while hydrological station 5 monitors forebay water level of gezhouba which exerts jacking effects on sandouping water level the feasible forebay water level range of gezhouba is only 3 m 63 5 66 5 m shang et al 2019 the expected power generation streamflow of gezhouba is only approximately 17 000 m3s 1 while the focus of this study is to forecast outflow for the upstream large hydropower station therefore the non abandoning season was only considered in relation to three gorges numerous operation scenarios of three gorges with outflow varying between 17 000 m3s 1 and 31 000 m3s 1 could be included and explored simultaneously the outflow of gezhouba was set as actual values this setting is not only in line with the actual dispatching of cascade hydropower system equipped with similar arrangements like three gorges system but also can directly show the influence of outflow forecasting deviation of three gorges on station 5 water level as streamflow is calculated once every two hours in dispatch center the period interval here was determined as two hours shang et al 2019 besides considering integrity and the difficulty of data collection actual data during 2014 2016 training data was utilized to calibrate parameters of relevant models and curves and data in 2017 testing data was selected to carry out comparative experiments all data belong to the non abandoning season 3 methodology during the non abandoning season outflow of the upstream hydropower station is forecast as follows 1 q t q t gen q t sup t 1 2 t 2 q t gen i 1 i q i t where t is the identifier of periods t is the total number of periods for outflow rolling forecasting q t is the outflow at period t of the upstream hydropower station q t gen is the power generation streamflow of the whole plant q t sup is the supply streamflow including the streamflow though ship locks and so on i is the total number of units q i t is the power generation streamflow of unit i it should be emphasized that to exclude the influence of supply streamflow on outflow forecasting actual values were used for the supply streamflow q t sup all outflow forecasting methods forecast power generation streamflow q t gen first then added the supply streamflow q t sup to it besides for clarity and simplicity all subsequent variables method introductions and analyses refer to the upstream hydropower station unless otherwise stated the nomenclature of this study can be viewed in appendix a 3 1 outflow forecasting methods based on optimizing power generation streamflow of the whole plant in order to achieve the goal of minimizing power generation streamflow the optimal load allocation table olat of the whole plant should be prepared first following which iterative calculations of output can be conducted by looking up olat so as to forecast outflow 3 1 1 formulating the optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters the objective function of formulating olat is listed as follows 3 q gen m i n i 1 i q i where q gen is the power generation streamflow of the whole plant q i is the power generation streamflow of unit i here the establishment of olat is independent of periods therefore formulas in this section are expressed without time dimension besides other relevant curves formulas and

feasible output set of unit i q 0 n 0 is the boundary condition most of the previous studies on olat have two obvious defects 1 the head loss of unit i h i loss q i was set as a fixed value or zero for simplicity cheng et al 2009 2 olat mostly took the mean net head h net as parameters or confused the whole plant gross head and net head according to formula 6 8 11 unit commitment u and output of units n i should be known at the same time to determine the mean net head h net while this condition is not met in most hydropower stations guo et al 2013 santra et al 2016 shang et al 2019 if the head parameter of olat is changed to the gross head h gross which is directly related to the forebay and tail water level and the head loss per unit h i loss q i is taken into account simultaneously these two defects can be solved therefore a method is proposed herein for formulating the optimal load allocation table with gross head h gross as parameters olat gh the formulation steps are shown in appendix b 1 the flowchart of formulating olat gh is shown in fig 2 specially when gross head h gross and output per unit n i are known the power generation streamflow q i n i in formula 17 should be obtained by iteration this iteration process is named as the output iteration calculation and the detailed steps are listed in appendix b 2 the flowchart is shown in fig 3 3 1 2 forecasting outflow by the optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters utilizing the prepared olat gh outflow at period t can be forecasted the detailed steps are listed in appendix b 3 the flowchart is shown in fig 4 here this method is named as the outflow forecasting method with olat gh and marked as ofm osw gh 3 1 3 improvement for the outflow forecasting method by the optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters in this section an artificial neural network ann forecasting model for tail water level is introduced to replace the empirical formula i e the step 5 in ofm osw gh the improving method is referred to herein as ofm osw gh ann shang et al 2019 pointed out that tail water level was directly related to monitoring data including the total output sequence the substation output sequence the forebay water level sequence and tail water level sequence itself in this study considering jacking effects of station 5 water level onto sandouping water level and the substation output at period t is not known when forecasting outflow two sets of features were set the model with the optimal feature will be embedded into ofm osw gh ann and subsequent outflow forecasting methods 18 z jac tail a n n jac tail n z fhs z sdp z s 5 19 z n j a c tail a n n n j a c tail n z fhs z sdp where n is the output sequence z fhs z sdp and z s 5 are the water level sequences of fenghuangshan sandouping and station 5 hydrological stations respectively an n jac tail is the artificial neural network model for tail water level considering jacking effects while an n n j a c tail ignores jacking effects z jac tail and z n j a c tail are the forecasted tail water level sequences all of the above sequences can be expressed as follows 20 n n t α n t α 1 n t 21 z fhs z t α fhs z t α 1 fhs z t 1 fhs 22 z sdp z t α sdp z t α 1 sdp z t 1 sdp 23 z s 5 z t α s 5 z t α 1 s 5 z t 1 s 5 24 z jac tail z t jac z t 1 jac z t β jac 25 z n j a c tail z t n j a c z t 1 n j a c z t β n j a c where α is the period number affected by early operation it is utilized to characterize aftereffects of tail water level β 1 is the period number when conducting tail water level forecasting once z t jac and z t n j a c are the forecasted tail water level at period t seen from formula 20 23 different from the empirical formula the input feature is not related to outflow q t and forebay water level z t s 5 at period t the improving method ofm osw gh ann absorbs the latest research idea about tail water level moreover on the basis of avoiding the forecasting deviation of mean head loss formula h loss it can directly reflect the advantages of the data mining model over the empirical formula for tail water level 3 2 outflow forecasting methods based on water energy conversion characteristics the artificial neural network model for tail water level can also be embedded into the classical water energy conversion characteristics methods based on the ofm osw gh ann the mode of forecasting outflow i e the step 7 in ofm osw gh ann is changed specifically for the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f and the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v outflow can be calculated as follows 26 q t n t k h t gross q t sup where k is a fixed value in the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method it is usually set to the average for many years in the actual dispatching in the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method k follows the changes in gross head namely 27 k k h t gross as for the water consumption rate r its definition is shown in formula 28 it is also related to gross head outflow forecasted by the water consumption rate method ofm wecc r can be calculated by formula 30 28 r q t gen n t 29 r r h t gross 30 q t r h t gross n t q t sup 3 3 outflow forecasting methods from data mining seen from section 3 1 many empirical formulas and methods have been used by site dispatchers to guide the actual dispatching such as the empirical formula for tail water level and the convert coefficient method for inflow some complex and implicit dispatching rules or experiences may be contained in historical data in view of this here the outflow forecasting methods from data mining is proposed for the first time outflow forecasting is also directly related to output forebay and tail water level thus the features of data mining methods are the same as that of formula 18 similarly to investigate jacking effects of station 5 onto outflow two sets of features were set namely 31 q jac a n n jac q n z fhs z sdp z s 5 q sup 32 q n j a c a n n n j a c q n z fhs z sdp q sup 33 q jac q t jac q t 1 jac q t γ jac 34 q n j a c q t n j a c q t 1 n j a c q t γ n j a c 35 q sup q t sup q t 1 sup q t γ sup where q t jac and q t n j a c are the forecasted outflow at period t q jac and q n j a c are the outflow sequences γ 1 is the period number when forecasting outflow once q sup is the sequences of the supply streamflow an n jac q is the artificial neural network forecasting model for outflow considering jacking effects while an n n j a c q ignores jacking effects the outflow forecasting methods by an n n j a c q and an n jac q models are referred to herein as ofm dm n and ofm dm j respectively different from the previous five outflow forecasting methods in section 3 1 and 3 2 the features of them are already known at period t therefore the specific steps at period t are shown in appendix b 4 the flowchart is shown in fig 5 3 4 rolling forecasting of outflow and comparison of methods in the actual dispatching outflow of the upstream hydropower station needs to be forecasted for multiple periods to foresee potential dispatching risks of cascade hydropower system this goal can be achieved by rolling forecasting i e the forecasting results of the last period are used as the initial conditions of the next period specifically the optimizing power generation streamflow and water energy conversion characteristics methods can all invoke the solving steps at period t shown in appendix b 3 repeatedly as for the data mining methods they should invoke the solving steps at period t shown in appendix b 4 so far seven outflow forecasting methods for single period and rolling tests have been introduced relations and differences among them are listed in table 1 3 5 performance evaluation in this study the difference between forecasted and actual value was defined as deviations in the single period tests four types of indices were introduced to evaluate the accuracy of tail water level and outflow including the root mean square deviation rmsd gao et al 2019 the relative mean absolute deviation rmad chen et al 2020a the coefficient of determination r 2 yaseen et al 2019 and the threshold statistic na li et al 2016 these indices are defined as follows 36 rmsd 1 t test t 1 t test v t fore v t act 2 37 rmad 1 t test t 1 t test v t fore v t act v t ref 38 r 2 t 1 t test v t act v act v t fore v fore t 1 t test v t act v act 2 t 1 t test v t f o r e v fore 2 2 39 v act 1 t test t 1 t test v t act 40 v fore 1 t test t 1 t test v t fore 41 n a t 1 t test c t 42 c t 1 v t fore v t act v t act a 0 otherwise where t test is the total period number for single period tests v t fore is the forecasted value of outflow or tail water level at period t by different methods v t act is the corresponding actual value v t ref is a reference quantity in rmad for outflow it equals to the actual outflow for tail water level it equals to the actual gross head of hydropower stations na is the period number related to the relative deviation less than a c t is a binary variable overall the root mean square deviation rmsd and the relative mean absolute deviation rmad describe the absolute and relative size of deviations respectively the coefficient of determination r 2 measures the degree of correlation among the actual and forecasted values as for na it describes the distribution characteristics of deviations under the same relative deviation a larger values of na means higher accuracy specifically for the tail water level the relative deviation was calculated for ten levels from 0 1 to 1 while the relative deviation was set from 1 to 10 for outflow as for the rolling tests the forecasting performances of different methods can be directly reflected by the water level process diagrams furthermore the maximum daily absolute deviations of the forebay water level are calculated to evaluate outflow forecasting methods with similar performances 4 case study 4 1 parameter setting 4 1 1 parameters of the outflow forecasting methods based on optimizing power generation streamflow the relevant parameters can be calibrated according to the basic and historical data of three gorges system specifically when formulating olat gh by the method outlined in section 3 1 the range of gross head h gross was 73 113 m the discrete step for gross head was set as 1 m the discrete step for output n was set as 10 mw and the feasible output set of unit i r i n could be determined by formula 15 the range of power generation streamflow q gen m i n q gen m a x was 0 35000 m3s 1 the range of power generation streamflow q i m i n q i m a x for auxiliary units was 0 100 m3s 1 but 0 1500 m3s 1 for other units besides the tolerable streamflow difference of three gorges ε was set to 20 m3s 1 to guarantee the accuracy of gross head the tolerable difference of units ε i was set to 10 m3s 1 the established olat gh contains up to 86 085 rows therefore only partial results with gross head values equal to 73 m are shown in appendix c for the empirical formula about tail water level a scatter plot showing the relationship between water level difference and outflow during 2014 2016 is displayed in fig 6 the corresponding function is as follows 43 δ z 1 6 10 9 q 2 4 7 10 5 q 0 23 when determining the feature of artificial neural network models for tail water level an n jac tail and an n n j a c tail by statistics the tail water level could reach a steady state 4 6 h after a change in output shang et al 2019 thus α in formula 20 23 was set as 3 simultaneously as forecasting outflow for multiple periods can be achieved by rolling forecasting β in formula 24 and 25 was set to 0 therefore corresponding models and variables can be rewritten as follows and other details such as data preprocessing parameter setting and training of networks are available in shang et al 2019 44 z t jac a n n jac tail n z fhs z sdp z s 5 45 z t n j a c a n n n j a c tail n z fhs z sdp 46 n n t 3 n t 2 n t 1 n t 47 z fhs z t 3 fhs z t 2 fhs z t 1 fhs 48 z sdp z t 3 sdp z t 2 sdp z t 1 sdp 49 z s 5 z t 3 s 5 z t 2 s 5 z t 1 s 5 besides to guarantee the generalization capability of the artificial neural network models the training data 2014 2016 was further randomly divided into training validation and testing data with the proportions of 70 15 and 15 respectively training data was used to adjust parameters of networks during training validation data was used to measure network generalization and stop training when loss function i e mean squared error function stopped improving testing data had no influence on training and could provide an in dependent measure for networks during and after training the networks were considered excellent when the mean square error was small and the error of training data was not significantly greater than that of validation and testing data for the artificial neural network for tail water level considering jacking effects an n jac tail the mean squared errors of three data sets were 0 0024 0 0025 and 0 0024 m2 respectively for the model ignoring jacking effects an n n j a c tail the errors became 0 0067 0 0066 and 0 0065 m2 4 1 2 parameters of the outflow forecasting methods based on water energy conversion characteristics fig 7 shows a scatter plot of the relationship between the comprehensive efficiency coefficient k and gross head h gross during 2014 2016 the corresponding function is as follows while the average k during this period is 9 034 50 k 1 124 10 3 h gross 2 0 2242 h gross 2 00 fig 8 shows a scatter plot of the relationship between the water consumption rate r and gross head h gross during 2014 2016 the corresponding function is as follows 51 r 7 153 10 5 h gross 3 2 3395 10 2 h gross 2 2 6363 h gross 112 13 the curves formula 43 50 and 51 are independent of periods therefore they are expressed without time dimension in section 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 4 1 3 parameters of the outflow forecasting methods from data mining like the parameter β setting γ in formula 33 35 to 0 was enough then the data mining models for forecasting outflow can be rewritten as follows 52 q t jac a n n jac q n z fhs z sdp z s 5 q t sup 53 q t n j a c a n n n j a c q n z fhs z sdp q t sup like the data mining models for tail water level an n jac tail and an n n j a c tail the mean squared errors of the artificial neural network for outflow considering jacking effects an n jac q were 10658 10 950 and 10 975 m6s 2 respectively the errors became 13536 12 452 and 13 554 m6s 2 for the model ignoring jacking effects an n n j a c q other details of training models for outflow are the same as the introductions in section 4 1 1 4 2 results and analyses the tests were conducted by single period and rolling tests so as to compare and analyze the effects of different methods for tail water level and outflow 4 2 1 overall analysis on tail water level for single period tests the single period tests for sandouping water level are conducted it should be mentioned that considering the parameters outflow q t and station 5 water level z t s 5 at period t are not known the results of empirical formula for sandouping water level should invoke the solving steps shown in appendix b 3 the forecasting results tests are shown in table 2 and fig 9 seen from table 2 and fig 9 firstly the accuracy for sandouping water level of training and testing data are quite close in all indices therefore the ann models for tail water level an n jac tail and an n n j a c tail own good generalization performances secondly the root mean square deviation rmsd of empirical formula does not exceed 0 2 m and the relative index rmad show that the deviation with such magnitude is quite small compared with gross head of three gorges dispatchers in dispatch center accurately characterize aftereffects of sandouping water level through their analysis of historical data however the two ann models perform more competitively in every index this is because the rapid fluctuation for output of hydropower stations over a short period of time may inevitably cause an unsteady streamflow both empirical formula and common three dimensional curve for tail water level are static methods and are difficult to characterize such complex hydrological characteristics as for the ann models their features contain the operation state of hydropower stations in the early stage therefore variations of output and aftereffects of tail water level can be absorbed to improve the forecasting accuracy besides in terms of indices alone the model considering jacking effects an n jac tail is slightly better than the model ignoring jacking effects an n n j a c tail this is because the former has more features than the latter by statistics during 2016 2020 if outflow forecasting deviation of three gorges reached 500 m3s 1 which only accounts for 3 52 of the average outflow itself station 5 water level deviation would reach 1 5 m in one day the small regulation storage capacity of gezhouba results in the difficulty in controlling the station 5 water level accurately in the short term dispatching therefore the station 5 water level may easily introduce strong noise when forecasting sandouping water level the optimal feature of the artificial neural network model for tail water level is n z fhs z sdp i e the ann in column calculation methods of tail water level of table 1 is the an n n j a c tail model 4 2 2 overall analysis on outflow for single period tests the outflow forecasting results of three gorges for single period tests are shown in table 3 and fig 10 seen from table 3 and fig 10 firstly the accuracy for outflow of training and testing data shows a slight difference discussed in section discussion but the rankings among different methods are consistent in all indices and data sets the following takes the root mean square deviation rmsd index as an example for analysis secondly the two methods by optimizing power generation streamflow ofm osw gh and ofm osw gh ann perform worst their rmsd are both around 500 m3s 1 it can be found that the artificial neural network model an n n j a c tail in the latter method can improve the forecasting accuracy of outflow but comparing with the selection of outflow forecasting methods this kind of improvement by improving tail water level calculation for gross head is not significant in single period tests thirdly in the outflow forecasting methods by water energy conversion characteristics the rmsd of the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f exceeds 300 m3s 1 while the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v and water consumption rate method ofm wecc r almost halved the deviation finally two data mining methods ofm dm j and ofm dm n basically performs best in all indices in table 3 this indicates that the features of them are reasonable combining the deviation distribution characteristics displayed in fig 10 the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method water consumption rate method and two data mining methods stand out in single period tests for outflow 4 2 3 overall analysis on tail and forebay water level of cascade hydropower system for rolling tests the daily peak load regulation amplitude of three gorges during the non abandoning season in 2017 is shown in fig 11 peak load regulation lasted for 356 days with an annual average peak load regulation amplitude of 2740 mw a minimum monthly average peak load regulation amplitude of 1253 mw april and a maximum monthly average peak load regulation amplitude of 6202 mw july there were 56 days where the daily peak load amplitude exceeded 5000 mw in this study three typical operation scenarios of large medium and small peak load regulation amplitude in flood and non flood seasons i e a total of six scenarios were used to analyze the effects of rolling tests with different methods among these scenarios the large peak load regulation scenario in the flood season corresponded to the highest peaking amplitude observed in 2017 the dates shown in fig 11 are the end time of scenarios figs 12 and 13 display tail and forebay water level processes of three gorges system seen from fig 12 the differences of sandouping water level forecasted by data mining model an n n j a c tail with different outflow forecasting methods are small although an n n j a c tail can be affected by different outflow forecasting methods through input feature it is unusually robust for rolling tests while the empirical formula for tail water level is easy to result in serious cumulative deviation this can be seen obviously from b d and f in fig 12 as for the forebay water level in fig 13 firstly it is obvious that the data mining method considering jacking effects ofm dm j is easy to cause abnormal fluctuation of water level this can be seen obviously from a b d g h and j in fig 13 the mean squared error of the ann model considering jacking effects an n j a c q in section 4 1 3 indicates that the an n j a c q is not overfitted simultaneously combining the water level processes forecasted by the method ignoring jacking effects ofm dm n it can be concluded that station 5 water level is not conducive to forecast outflow for rolling tests secondly excluding the processes of ofm dm j the optimal forecasting effects are achieved in a and b in fig 13 moreover the differences in forebay water level of different methods are relatively small in this scenario the cumulative deviation of fenghuangshan water level during one day are controlled to within 0 1 m while the cumulative deviation of station 5 water level increases to 0 6 m 20 of the feasible range in other words even for the optimal scenario it is quite difficult to forecast station 5 water level accurately therefore forecasting outflow of three gorges is vital for safe operation of three gorges system thirdly the method by optimizing power generation streamflow ofm osw gh produces the largest cumulative deviations of fenghuangshan and station 5 water level in almost all scenarios in addition the amplitude of cumulative deviations gradually increases with increasing periods ofm osw gh utilizes the optimal load allocation table to forecast outflow resulting in overestimating fenghuangshan water level and underestimating station 5 water level compared to the actual process on the one hand this confirms that the formulation result of the optimal load allocation table is reasonable on the other hand it also proves that three gorges operated under suboptimal operation condition most of the time therefore the condition with minimum power generation streamflow not always holds which lead to large deviations the improving method ofm osw gh ann equipped with robust model for tail water level an n n j a c tail can revise the gross head for power generation therefore it performs better than ofm osw gh overall these two methods by optimizing power generation streamflow exhibit the worst performance fourth among the methods by water energy conversion characteristics the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f produces a larger cumulative deviation of station 5 water level than that of the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v and water consumption rate method ofm wecc r this can be seen obviously from d f and h in fig 13 the head changes rapidly when three gorges is conducting peak load regulation tasks however the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient can only reflect the average water energy conversion efficiency over a period of many years while the variable comprehensive efficiency and water consumption rate are directly related to the time varying gross head therefore the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method is the worst in outflow forecasting methods with water energy conversion characteristics fifth the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method the water consumption rate method and the data mining method ignoring jacking effects exhibit similar effects simultaneously the trends in the forebay water level processes of them are also similar overall these three methods exhibit the best performance the maximum daily absolute deviations in the forebay water level of three gorges system are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively the maximum daily absolute deviations in the flood season are generally larger than that of deviations in the non flood season simultaneously the deviations of the three methods in figs 14 and 15 show small difference in the non flood season while in the flood season the data mining method ignoring jacking effects ofm dm n stands out among them ofm dm n captures certain artificial experiences and dispatching rules of hydropower stations from data and owns the reasonable input feature therefore it has great advantages in dealing with the complex hydrological challenges caused by rapid fluctuations of output while seen from figs 7 and 8 the linearity of the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient curve in ofm wecc v and the water consumption rate curve in ofm wecc r are more significant in the non flood season the complex hydrological characteristics cannot be described effectively by the simple one to one curves this is the essential reason why the three methods perform differently finally table 4 summarizes the comprehensive ranking and the recommended methods in different seasons 5 discussion for the upstream large hydropower stations like three gorges the rapid fluctuation of output is the most fundamental reason for producing large deviation when forecasting outflow during peak load regulation hydropower stations have to switch the states of units to track load fluctuation from the power grid resulting in a stepwise change in outflow hydrological phenomena such as streamflow propagation and water level change become unstable this does increase the difficulty in forecasting the head for power generation besides the upstream large hydropower stations are equipped with many types of units each of which has different efficiency characteristics when different types of units undertake the same output their power generation streamflow varies greatly peak load regulation is closely related to power grid loads transmission lines and bus connection modes of hydropower stations and takes on strong randomness therefore the more hydropower stations are equipped with units the more difficult output schemes are specific to each unit to date in dispatch center the output scheme cannot be refined to a single unit the site dispatchers told us that there was no consensus on which method to forecast outflow of three gorges besides different methods for tail water level and outflow have been analyzed in section 4 2 1 and 4 2 3 respectively while from the aspect of practicability the empirical formula and common three dimensional curve for tail water level have two notable disadvantages 1 the outflow at period t itself is a quantity that needs to be forecasted furthermore there is a transmission of deviation when forecasting the tail water level based on outflow 2 the forebay water level of the downstream hydropower station at period t is also unknown and is hard to be forecasted accurately specifically for three gorges system station 5 water level does bring strong noise on sandouping water level while the data mining methods are not necessary to understand the characteristics or rules of the tail water level and outflow for a given hydropower station once finishing calibration their computational efficiency are high and can meet the demand of short term dispatching therefore data mining methods own high practicability and application prospects from the aspect of the potential in improving accuracy the operation rules of hydropower stations in different years are not completely the same however a summary for historical data is still necessary because it is needed to calibrate parameters of models and methods to guide actual scheduling for tail water level empirical formula and common three dimensional curve have less potential for outflow the three water energy conversion characteristics methods and the method by optimizing power generation streamflow ofm osw gh also have less potential this is because the basic and newly added operation data of hydropower stations has little influence on parameter calibration for curves and models moreover the effects of these methods are not stable among different years for example the outflow accuracy of three gorges by the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method in single period tests are better in testing data this can be seen from table 3 while the data mining methods own high potential if the characteristics implied by the actual operation data change the data mining methods can adjust parameters to achieve an accurate trace for the tail water level and outflow 6 conclusion seven outflow forecasting methods for the upstream large hydropower station during the non abandoning season were proposed in this study the three gorges gezhouba cascade hydropower system was selected as a case study to compare the proposed methods specifically this study includes three aspects first an optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters for hydropower stations was formulated second the artificial neural network models for tail water level and outflow were established and the former model was integrated into the outflow forecasting methods for the first time third two sets of solving steps for outflow rolling forecasting were proposed comparative tests were conducted for single period and rolling tests and important hydrological characteristics of cascade hydropower system were analyzed in detail the principal conclusions of this study are as follows 1 during the non abandoning season the common three dimensional curve for tail water level of the upstream hydropower station and its variant in the form of empirical formulas show poor forecasting accuracy simultaneously their practicability and potential in improving accuracy are not satisfactory the data mining model for tail water level is good at dealing with the complex hydrological challenges caused by peak load regulation and is recommended to be embedded into outflow forecasting methods it is insensitive to the deviation of outflow and can significantly improve the calculation accuracy of tail water level in rolling forecast 2 many valuable informations are contained in the historical operation data of hydropower stations utilizing these informations by data mining to guide the actual dispatching is attractive however the established data mining models should follow the operation characteristics and business processes of a given hydropower station in particular the input feature should be reasonably determined because it is quite important for accuracy and practicability specifically for three gorges its tail water level and outflow should ignore jacking effects of station 5 water level 3 in the flood season the hydrological characteristics of the upstream large hydropower stations are complex therefore the method by data mining is highly recommended to forecast outflow while the variable comprehensive efficiency method and water consumption rate method are two additional recommended methods in the non flood season by these three recommended methods the accumulative deviation of forebay and tail water level and operation safety of cascade hydropower system can be improved significantly the modeling ideas and methods for forecasting outflow of the upstream large hydropower stations has been proposed in this study however the application of data mining model requires many years of detailed operation data for the hydropower station system how to forecast outflow with a lack of such data should be further analyzed or a refined model considering output allocation strategies should be established in

3401,outflow forecasting of upstream large hydropower stations is essential for dispatching of cascade hydropower system in this study seven outflow forecasting methods were proposed from aspects of optimizing power generation streamflow water energy conversion characteristics and data mining and were applied to the actual dispatching of the three gorges gezhouba cascade hydropower system in china results show that the data mining method for tail water level is recommended to replace empirical formula for its insensitivity with outflow deviations in rolling forecast due to the complex hydrological characteristics the data mining method is the only recommended method to forecast outflow in the flood season while in the non flood season the variable comprehensive efficiency and water consumption rate methods are also workable these three recommended outflow forecasting methods can reduce the accumulative deviation of tail and forebay water level and improve the operation safety of cascade hydropower system significantly keywords upstream large hydropower stations outflow forecasting methods tail water level forecasting short term dispatching rules hydraulic connections 1 introduction upstream large hydropower stations are usually equipped with immediate downstream hydropower stations to reregulate sharp fluctuations in outflow caused by peak load regulation this results in the formation of cascade hydropower system henceforth system with tight hydraulic connections lu et al 2018 su et al 2020 firstly if the local inflow between system is negligible the inflow of the downstream hydropower station is basically determined by the outflow of the upstream hydropower station secondly the forebay water level of the downstream hydropower station can raise the tail water level of the upstream hydropower station i e jacking effects resulting in a decrease in head for power generation the three gorges gezhouba cascade hydropower system henceforth three gorges system in china represents a good example of this arrangement chen et al 2014 during the part of a year when all river flow is used for power generation henceforth non abandoning season dispatchers in the three gorges cascade dispatch communication center henceforth dispatch center first determine the final upstream water level of the next day according to the mid term water level target and inflow forecast then they formulate the output scheme of the three gorges hydropower station henceforth three gorges considering constraints of the power grid and operation conditions of units shang et al 2019 finally the grid will verify the submitted output scheme and send it to dispatch center in the form of instructions based on the output scheme outflow of three gorges and gezhouba hydropower station henceforth gezhouba can be estimated unfortunately as gezhouba is a run of river hydropower station ma et al 2013 if the outflow forecasting deviations of three gorges are large then the forebay water level of gezhouba will deviate greatly from the planned level or even violate the water limit boundary when the output scheme is determined the selection of solution methods and determination of head for power generation deeply affect the accuracy of forecasting outflow for the former at present the following two types of classical methods can be applied to forecast outflow for the upstream large hydropower station in the actual dispatching 1 outflow forecasting methods ofm based on optimizing power generation streamflow osw of the whole plant 2 outflow forecasting methods based on water energy conversion characteristics wecc of the whole plant chen et al 2020b in general hydropower stations expect to generate the given output with minimum or approximate minimum power generation streamflow many mathematical programming techniques have been used to achieve this goal taktak and d ambrosio 2017 while the dynamic programming grygier and stedinger 1985 method is the most classical and reliable choice however for large hydropower stations with more than 10 units the computational efficiency of dynamic programming is insufficient to meet requirements of the short term dispatching cheng et al 2009 therefore dynamic programming algorithm is often used to formulate an optimal load allocation table olat to realize rapid calculations mainly due to the large number of units and complex constraints other mathematical programming techniques such as linear programming mixed integer linear programming decomposition methods and lagrangian relaxation are not widely used in large hydropower stations ji et al 2017 taktak and d ambrosio 2017 besides many heuristic algorithms such as genetic algorithm shang et al 2017 particle swarm optimization cheng et al 2009 chuanwen and bompard 2005 evolutionary programming sinha et al 2003 somasundaram et al 2004 have been utilized to forecast outflow but their distributing output and outflow of each unit are unsteady water energy conversion characteristics wecc characterize the overall operation performances of hydropower stations its water energy conversion efficiency can be expressed by comprehensive efficiency coefficient k and water consumption rate r the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f carvajal et al 2017 he et al 2019a zhong et al 2020 the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v and the water consumption rate method ofm wecc r chen et al 2020b are the most common choices these methods based on water energy conversion characteristics solve the outflow forecasting problem by analyzing historical operation data of hydropower stations and fitting the relationship curves with head as parameters they all ignore the efficiency difference of units and own high calculation timeliness however complex hydrological characteristics caused by peak load regulation result in significant nonlinearity onto fitted relationship curves especially during the flood season it will reduce the accuracy of forecasting tail water level and outflow chen et al 2020a shang et al 2019 as for head it is determined by forebay and tail water level when the upstream large hydropower station conducts peak load regulation tasks its forebay water level between periods not changes greatly which benefiting from its large reservoir capacity but its tail water level is easily affected by early output and tail water level i e aftereffects shang et al 2019 most scholars and site dispatchers often utilize the static three dimensional curve whose parameters are outflow and tail water level of the upstream hydropower station and forebay water level of the downstream hydropower station respectively to forecast the tail water level abril and knight 2004 basso and botter 2012 cordova et al 2014 shang et al 2019 pointed out that this static three dimensional curve could not reflect aftereffects of tail water level when output of hydropower stations was fluctuating quickly and established an artificial neural network ann besaw et al 2010 model for tail water level by the historical monitoring data however this study primarily focused on the forecasting accuracy of tail water level and did not explicitly address how to combine the ann tail water level model with classical outflow forecasting methods crucial hydropower stations generally attach great importance to the collection of operation data these data contain crucial dispatching information such as explicit and implicit hydrological characteristics the dispatching rules of hydropower stations and artificial experiences chen et al 2007 feng et al 2019 suiadee and tingsanchali 2007 in recent years extensive studies have been conducted to abstract dispatching rules from data mining feng et al 2019 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2019b compared with long term dispatching he et al 2019b short term dispatching features shorter time scales more historical data sets and a higher model complexity at the same time disturbances from loads and other factors are stronger chan et al 2006 zhang et al 2020 therefore it is hard to establish the short term dispatching rules from data mining and there are only a few relevant studies even less research has been done on short term dispatching rules involving forecasting accuracy for example ma et al 2013 only tried to extract the short term dispatching rules of hydropower stations from the perspective of optimization there are many cascade hydropower systems kosterev 2004 liang et al 2021 rosen et al 2010 with similar engineering arrangements and hydraulic connections like three gorges system in the world therefore in addition to improving the outflow forecasting accuracy for the upstream large hydropower stations another motivation of this study is to supply fairly applicable and practical modeling ideas the remainder is organized as follows section 2 introduces study area and data section 3 first introduces methodology and then lists accuracy evaluation indices comparative tests and analyses are shown in section 4 following which section 5 explains the authors understanding of outflow forecast and discusses the practicability and the potential in improving accuracy section 6 summarizes the study 2 study area and data the three gorges gezhouba cascade water conservancy project is located on the main stream of yangtze river china its joint dispatching plays an irreplaceable role in flood control power generation and so on in the yangtze region ren et al 2021 sha et al 2015 three gorges has the largest installed capacity of any hydropower station in the world up to 22500 mw and the expected streamflow for power generation is approximately 31 000 m3s 1 the period of time allocated to discarding water has generally comprised no more than 2 of the annual operating period of three gorges in recent years gezhouba is located 38 km downstream from the dam site of three gorges the lag time between them is approximately 30 min and local inflow is almost negligible the location and engineering layout of three gorges system are shown in fig 1 wherein that the fenghuangshan and sandouping hydrological stations monitor forebay and tail water level of three gorges respectively while hydrological station 5 monitors forebay water level of gezhouba which exerts jacking effects on sandouping water level the feasible forebay water level range of gezhouba is only 3 m 63 5 66 5 m shang et al 2019 the expected power generation streamflow of gezhouba is only approximately 17 000 m3s 1 while the focus of this study is to forecast outflow for the upstream large hydropower station therefore the non abandoning season was only considered in relation to three gorges numerous operation scenarios of three gorges with outflow varying between 17 000 m3s 1 and 31 000 m3s 1 could be included and explored simultaneously the outflow of gezhouba was set as actual values this setting is not only in line with the actual dispatching of cascade hydropower system equipped with similar arrangements like three gorges system but also can directly show the influence of outflow forecasting deviation of three gorges on station 5 water level as streamflow is calculated once every two hours in dispatch center the period interval here was determined as two hours shang et al 2019 besides considering integrity and the difficulty of data collection actual data during 2014 2016 training data was utilized to calibrate parameters of relevant models and curves and data in 2017 testing data was selected to carry out comparative experiments all data belong to the non abandoning season 3 methodology during the non abandoning season outflow of the upstream hydropower station is forecast as follows 1 q t q t gen q t sup t 1 2 t 2 q t gen i 1 i q i t where t is the identifier of periods t is the total number of periods for outflow rolling forecasting q t is the outflow at period t of the upstream hydropower station q t gen is the power generation streamflow of the whole plant q t sup is the supply streamflow including the streamflow though ship locks and so on i is the total number of units q i t is the power generation streamflow of unit i it should be emphasized that to exclude the influence of supply streamflow on outflow forecasting actual values were used for the supply streamflow q t sup all outflow forecasting methods forecast power generation streamflow q t gen first then added the supply streamflow q t sup to it besides for clarity and simplicity all subsequent variables method introductions and analyses refer to the upstream hydropower station unless otherwise stated the nomenclature of this study can be viewed in appendix a 3 1 outflow forecasting methods based on optimizing power generation streamflow of the whole plant in order to achieve the goal of minimizing power generation streamflow the optimal load allocation table olat of the whole plant should be prepared first following which iterative calculations of output can be conducted by looking up olat so as to forecast outflow 3 1 1 formulating the optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters the objective function of formulating olat is listed as follows 3 q gen m i n i 1 i q i where q gen is the power generation streamflow of the whole plant q i is the power generation streamflow of unit i here the establishment of olat is independent of periods therefore formulas in this section are expressed without time dimension besides other relevant curves formulas and

where u i is a binary variable that equals 1 if unit i is in operating states but equals 0 otherwise i on is the total number of units in operating states h loss is the mean head loss u is the vector

lower and upper bounds of forebay water level respectively 9 stable operation zones constraint of units 14 l i h gross n i u i h gross where l i h gross and u i h gross are the lower and upper bounds of the stable operation zones of unit i under h gross respectively 10 output constraint of units 15 l i h gross n i n i max h gross 16 n i max h gross m i n n i rated n i exp h gross u i h gross where n i max h gross and n i rated are the maximum and rated output of unit i respectively the recursive formulas used to formulate olat with the forward dynamic programming algorithm are listed as follows 17 q i n i min n i r i n q i n i q i 1 n i 1 n i 1 n i n i i 1 2 i q 0 n 0 0 n 0 where the unit number i is the stage variable n i is the decision variable n i is the state variable and is equal to the total output from unit 1 to unit i q i n i is the optimal power generation streamflow corresponding to n i q i n i is the power generation streamflow of unit i corresponding to n i r i n is the feasible output set of unit i q 0 n 0 is the boundary condition most of the previous studies on olat have two obvious defects 1 the head loss of unit i h i loss q i was set as a fixed value or zero for simplicity cheng et al 2009 2 olat mostly took the mean net head h net as parameters or confused the whole plant gross head and net head according to formula 6 8 11 unit commitment u and output of units n i should be known at the same time to determine the mean net head h net while this condition is not met in most hydropower stations guo et al 2013 santra et al 2016 shang et al 2019 if the head parameter of olat is changed to the gross head h gross which is directly related to the forebay and tail water level and the head loss per unit h i loss q i is taken into account simultaneously these two defects can be solved therefore a method is proposed herein for formulating the optimal load allocation table with gross head h gross as parameters olat gh the formulation steps are shown in appendix b 1 the flowchart of formulating olat gh is shown in fig 2 specially when gross head h gross and output per unit n i are known the power generation streamflow q i n i in formula 17 should be obtained by iteration this iteration process is named as the output iteration calculation and the detailed steps are listed in appendix b 2 the flowchart is shown in fig 3 3 1 2 forecasting outflow by the optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters utilizing the prepared olat gh outflow at period t can be forecasted the detailed steps are listed in appendix b 3 the flowchart is shown in fig 4 here this method is named as the outflow forecasting method with olat gh and marked as ofm osw gh 3 1 3 improvement for the outflow forecasting method by the optimal load allocation

z t α fhs z t α 1 fhs z t 1 fhs 22 z sdp z t α sdp z t α 1 sdp z t 1 sdp 23 z s 5 z t α s 5 z t α 1 s 5 z t 1 s 5 24 z jac tail z t jac z t 1 jac z t β jac 25 z n j a c tail z t n j a c z t 1 n j a c z t β n j a c where α is the period number affected by early operation it is utilized to characterize aftereffects of tail water level β 1 is the period number when conducting tail water level forecasting once z t jac and z t n j a c are the forecasted tail water level at period t seen from formula 20 23 different from the empirical formula the input feature is not related to outflow q t and forebay water level z t s 5 at period t the improving method ofm osw gh ann absorbs the latest research idea about tail water level moreover on the basis of avoiding the forecasting deviation of mean head loss formula h loss it can directly reflect the advantages of the data mining model over the empirical formula for tail water level 3 2 outflow forecasting methods based on water energy conversion characteristics the artificial neural network model for tail water level can also be embedded into the classical water energy conversion characteristics methods based on the ofm osw gh ann the mode of forecasting outflow i e the step 7 in ofm osw gh ann is changed specifically for the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f and the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v outflow can be calculated as follows 26 q t n t k h t gross q t sup where k is a fixed value in the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method it is usually set to the average for many years in the actual dispatching in the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method k follows the changes in gross head namely 27 k k h t gross as for the water consumption rate r its definition is shown in formula 28 it is also related to gross head outflow forecasted by the water consumption rate method ofm wecc r can be calculated by formula 30 28 r q t gen n t 29 r r h t gross 30 q t r h t gross n t q t sup 3 3 outflow forecasting methods from data mining seen from section 3 1 many empirical formulas and methods have been used by site dispatchers to guide the actual dispatching such as the empirical formula for tail water level and the convert coefficient method for inflow some complex and implicit dispatching rules or experiences may be contained in historical data in view of this here the outflow forecasting methods from data mining is proposed for the first time outflow forecasting is also directly related to output forebay and tail water level thus the features of data mining methods are the same as that of formula 18 similarly to investigate jacking effects of station 5 onto outflow two sets of features were set namely 31 q jac a n n jac q n z fhs z sdp z s 5 q sup 32 q n j a c a n n n j a c q n z fhs z sdp q sup 33 q jac q t jac q t 1 jac q t γ jac 34 q n j a c q t n j a c q t 1 n j a c q t γ n j a c 35 q sup q t sup q t 1 sup q t γ sup where q t jac and q t n j a c are the forecasted outflow at period t q jac and q n j a c are the outflow sequences γ 1 is the period number when forecasting outflow once q sup is the sequences of the supply streamflow an n jac q is the artificial neural network forecasting model for outflow considering jacking effects while an n n j a c q ignores jacking effects the outflow forecasting methods by an n n j a c q and an n jac q models are referred to herein as ofm dm n and ofm dm j respectively different from the previous five outflow forecasting methods in section 3 1 and 3 2 the features of them are already known at period t therefore the specific steps at period t are shown in appendix b 4 the flowchart is shown in fig 5 3 4 rolling forecasting of outflow and comparison of methods in the actual dispatching outflow of the upstream hydropower station needs to be forecasted for multiple periods to foresee potential dispatching risks of cascade hydropower system this goal can be achieved by rolling forecasting i e the forecasting results of the last period are used as the initial conditions of the next period specifically the optimizing power generation streamflow and water energy conversion characteristics methods can all invoke the solving steps at period t shown in appendix b 3 repeatedly as for the data mining methods they should invoke the solving steps at period t shown in appendix b 4 so far seven outflow forecasting methods for single period and rolling tests have been introduced relations and differences among them are listed in table 1 3 5 performance evaluation in this study the difference between forecasted and actual value was defined as deviations in the single period tests four types of indices were introduced to evaluate the accuracy of tail water level and outflow including the root mean square deviation rmsd gao et al 2019 the relative mean absolute deviation rmad chen et al 2020a the coefficient of determination r 2 yaseen et al 2019 and the threshold statistic na li et al 2016 these indices are defined as follows 36 rmsd 1 t test t 1 t test v t fore v t act 2 37 rmad 1 t test t 1 t test v t fore v t act v t ref 38 r 2 t 1 t test v t act v act v t fore v fore t 1 t test v t act v act 2 t 1 t test v t f o r e v fore 2 2 39 v act 1 t test t 1 t test v t act 40 v fore 1 t test t 1 t test v t fore 41 n a t 1 t test c t 42 c t 1 v t fore v t act v t act a 0 otherwise where t test is the total period number for single period tests v t fore is the forecasted value of outflow or tail water level at period t by different methods v t act is the corresponding actual value v t ref is a reference quantity in rmad for outflow it equals to the actual outflow for tail water level it equals to the actual gross head of hydropower stations na is the period number related to the relative deviation less than a c t is a binary variable overall the root mean square deviation rmsd and the relative mean absolute deviation rmad describe the absolute and relative size of deviations respectively the coefficient of determination r 2 measures the degree of correlation among the actual and forecasted values as for na it describes the distribution characteristics of deviations under the same relative deviation a larger values of na means higher accuracy specifically for the tail water level the relative deviation was calculated for ten levels from 0 1 to 1 while the relative deviation was set from 1 to 10 for outflow as for the rolling tests the forecasting performances of different methods can be directly reflected by the water level process diagrams furthermore the maximum daily absolute deviations of the forebay water level are calculated to evaluate outflow forecasting methods with similar performances 4 case study 4 1 parameter setting 4 1 1 parameters of the outflow forecasting methods based on optimizing power generation streamflow the relevant parameters can be calibrated according to the basic and historical data of three gorges system specifically when formulating olat gh by the method outlined in section 3 1 the range of gross head h gross was 73 113 m the discrete step for gross head was set as 1 m the discrete step for output n was set as 10 mw and the feasible output set of unit i r i n could be determined by formula 15 the range of power generation streamflow q gen m i n q gen m a x was 0 35000 m3s 1 the range of power generation streamflow q i m i n q i m a x for auxiliary units was 0 100 m3s 1 but 0 1500 m3s 1 for other units besides the tolerable streamflow difference of three gorges ε was set to 20 m3s 1 to guarantee the accuracy of gross head the tolerable difference of units ε i was set to 10 m3s 1 the established olat gh contains up to 86 085 rows therefore only partial results with gross head values equal to 73 m are shown in appendix c for the empirical formula about tail water level a scatter plot showing the relationship between water level difference and outflow during 2014 2016 is displayed in fig 6 the corresponding function is as follows 43 δ z 1 6 10 9 q 2 4 7 10 5 q 0 23 when determining the feature of artificial neural network models for tail water level an n jac tail and an n n j a c tail by statistics the tail water level could reach a steady state 4 6 h after a change in output shang et al 2019 thus α in formula 20 23 was set as 3 simultaneously as forecasting outflow for multiple periods can be achieved by rolling forecasting β in formula 24 and 25 was set to 0 therefore corresponding models and variables can be rewritten as follows and other details such as data preprocessing parameter setting and training of networks are available in shang et al 2019 44 z t jac a n n jac tail n z fhs z sdp z s 5 45 z t n j a c a n n n j a c tail n z fhs z sdp 46 n n t 3 n t 2 n t 1 n t 47 z fhs z t 3 fhs z t 2 fhs z t 1 fhs 48 z sdp z t 3 sdp z t 2 sdp z t 1 sdp 49 z s 5 z t 3 s 5 z t 2 s 5 z t 1 s 5 besides to guarantee the generalization capability of the artificial neural network models the training data 2014 2016 was further randomly divided into training validation and testing data with the proportions of 70 15 and 15 respectively training data was used to adjust parameters of networks during training validation data was used to measure network generalization and stop training when loss function i e mean squared error function stopped improving testing data had no influence on training and could provide an in dependent measure for networks during and after training the networks were considered excellent when the mean square error was small and the error of training data was not significantly greater than that of validation and testing data for the artificial neural network for tail water level considering jacking effects an n jac tail the mean squared errors of three data sets were 0 0024 0 0025 and 0 0024 m2 respectively for the model ignoring jacking effects an n n j a c tail the errors became 0 0067 0 0066 and 0 0065 m2 4 1 2 parameters of the outflow forecasting methods based on water energy conversion characteristics fig 7 shows a scatter plot of the relationship between the comprehensive efficiency coefficient k and gross head h gross during 2014 2016 the corresponding function is as follows while the average k during this period is 9 034 50 k 1 124 10 3 h gross 2 0 2242 h gross 2 00 fig 8 shows a scatter plot of the relationship between the water consumption rate r and gross head h gross during 2014 2016 the corresponding function is as follows 51 r 7 153 10 5 h gross 3 2 3395 10 2 h gross 2 2 6363 h gross 112 13 the curves formula 43 50 and 51 are independent of periods therefore they are expressed without time dimension in section 4 1 1 and 4 1 2 4 1 3 parameters of the outflow forecasting methods from data mining like the parameter β setting γ in formula 33 35 to 0 was enough then the data mining models for forecasting outflow can be rewritten as follows 52 q t jac a n n jac q n z fhs z sdp z s 5 q t sup 53 q t n j a c a n n n j a c q n z fhs z sdp q t sup like the data mining models for tail water level an n jac tail and an n n j a c tail the mean squared errors of the artificial neural network for outflow considering jacking effects an n jac q were 10658 10 950 and 10 975 m6s 2 respectively the errors became 13536 12 452 and 13 554 m6s 2 for the model ignoring jacking effects an n n j a c q other details of training models for outflow are the same as the introductions in section 4 1 1 4 2 results and analyses the tests were conducted by single period and rolling tests so as to compare and analyze the effects of different methods for tail water level and outflow 4 2 1 overall analysis on tail water level for single period tests the single period tests for sandouping water level are conducted it should be mentioned that considering the parameters outflow q t and station 5 water level z t s 5 at period t are not known the results of empirical formula for sandouping water level should invoke the solving steps shown in appendix b 3 the forecasting results tests are shown in table 2 and fig 9 seen from table 2 and fig 9 firstly the accuracy for sandouping water level of training and testing data are quite close in all indices therefore the ann models for tail water level an n jac tail and an n n j a c tail own good generalization performances secondly the root mean square deviation rmsd of empirical formula does not exceed 0 2 m and the relative index rmad show that the deviation with such magnitude is quite small compared with gross head of three gorges dispatchers in dispatch center accurately characterize aftereffects of sandouping water level through their analysis of historical data however the two ann models perform more competitively in every index this is because the rapid fluctuation for output of hydropower stations over a short period of time may inevitably cause an unsteady streamflow both empirical formula and common three dimensional curve for tail water level are static methods and are difficult to characterize such complex hydrological characteristics as for the ann models their features contain the operation state of hydropower stations in the early stage therefore variations of output and aftereffects of tail water level can be absorbed to improve the forecasting accuracy besides in terms of indices alone the model considering jacking effects an n jac tail is slightly better than the model ignoring jacking effects an n n j a c tail this is because the former has more features than the latter by statistics during 2016 2020 if outflow forecasting deviation of three gorges reached 500 m3s 1 which only accounts for 3 52 of the average outflow itself station 5 water level deviation would reach 1 5 m in one day the small regulation storage capacity of gezhouba results in the difficulty in controlling the station 5 water level accurately in the short term dispatching therefore the station 5 water level may easily introduce strong noise when forecasting sandouping water level the optimal feature of the artificial neural network model for tail water level is n z fhs z sdp i e the ann in column calculation methods of tail water level of table 1 is the an n n j a c tail model 4 2 2 overall analysis on outflow for single period tests the outflow forecasting results of three gorges for single period tests are shown in table 3 and fig 10 seen from table 3 and fig 10 firstly the accuracy for outflow of training and testing data shows a slight difference discussed in section discussion but the rankings among different methods are consistent in all indices and data sets the following takes the root mean square deviation rmsd index as an example for analysis secondly the two methods by optimizing power generation streamflow ofm osw gh and ofm osw gh ann perform worst their rmsd are both around 500 m3s 1 it can be found that the artificial neural network model an n n j a c tail in the latter method can improve the forecasting accuracy of outflow but comparing with the selection of outflow forecasting methods this kind of improvement by improving tail water level calculation for gross head is not significant in single period tests thirdly in the outflow forecasting methods by water energy conversion characteristics the rmsd of the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f exceeds 300 m3s 1 while the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v and water consumption rate method ofm wecc r almost halved the deviation finally two data mining methods ofm dm j and ofm dm n basically performs best in all indices in table 3 this indicates that the features of them are reasonable combining the deviation distribution characteristics displayed in fig 10 the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method water consumption rate method and two data mining methods stand out in single period tests for outflow 4 2 3 overall analysis on tail and forebay water level of cascade hydropower system for rolling tests the daily peak load regulation amplitude of three gorges during the non abandoning season in 2017 is shown in fig 11 peak load regulation lasted for 356 days with an annual average peak load regulation amplitude of 2740 mw a minimum monthly average peak load regulation amplitude of 1253 mw april and a maximum monthly average peak load regulation amplitude of 6202 mw july there were 56 days where the daily peak load amplitude exceeded 5000 mw in this study three typical operation scenarios of large medium and small peak load regulation amplitude in flood and non flood seasons i e a total of six scenarios were used to analyze the effects of rolling tests with different methods among these scenarios the large peak load regulation scenario in the flood season corresponded to the highest peaking amplitude observed in 2017 the dates shown in fig 11 are the end time of scenarios figs 12 and 13 display tail and forebay water level processes of three gorges system seen from fig 12 the differences of sandouping water level forecasted by data mining model an n n j a c tail with different outflow forecasting methods are small although an n n j a c tail can be affected by different outflow forecasting methods through input feature it is unusually robust for rolling tests while the empirical formula for tail water level is easy to result in serious cumulative deviation this can be seen obviously from b d and f in fig 12 as for the forebay water level in fig 13 firstly it is obvious that the data mining method considering jacking effects ofm dm j is easy to cause abnormal fluctuation of water level this can be seen obviously from a b d g h and j in fig 13 the mean squared error of the ann model considering jacking effects an n j a c q in section 4 1 3 indicates that the an n j a c q is not overfitted simultaneously combining the water level processes forecasted by the method ignoring jacking effects ofm dm n it can be concluded that station 5 water level is not conducive to forecast outflow for rolling tests secondly excluding the processes of ofm dm j the optimal forecasting effects are achieved in a and b in fig 13 moreover the differences in forebay water level of different methods are relatively small in this scenario the cumulative deviation of fenghuangshan water level during one day are controlled to within 0 1 m while the cumulative deviation of station 5 water level increases to 0 6 m 20 of the feasible range in other words even for the optimal scenario it is quite difficult to forecast station 5 water level accurately therefore forecasting outflow of three gorges is vital for safe operation of three gorges system thirdly the method by optimizing power generation streamflow ofm osw gh produces the largest cumulative deviations of fenghuangshan and station 5 water level in almost all scenarios in addition the amplitude of cumulative deviations gradually increases with increasing periods ofm osw gh utilizes the optimal load allocation table to forecast outflow resulting in overestimating fenghuangshan water level and underestimating station 5 water level compared to the actual process on the one hand this confirms that the formulation result of the optimal load allocation table is reasonable on the other hand it also proves that three gorges operated under suboptimal operation condition most of the time therefore the condition with minimum power generation streamflow not always holds which lead to large deviations the improving method ofm osw gh ann equipped with robust model for tail water level an n n j a c tail can revise the gross head for power generation therefore it performs better than ofm osw gh overall these two methods by optimizing power generation streamflow exhibit the worst performance fourth among the methods by water energy conversion characteristics the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc f produces a larger cumulative deviation of station 5 water level than that of the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method ofm wecc v and water consumption rate method ofm wecc r this can be seen obviously from d f and h in fig 13 the head changes rapidly when three gorges is conducting peak load regulation tasks however the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient can only reflect the average water energy conversion efficiency over a period of many years while the variable comprehensive efficiency and water consumption rate are directly related to the time varying gross head therefore the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method is the worst in outflow forecasting methods with water energy conversion characteristics fifth the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient method the water consumption rate method and the data mining method ignoring jacking effects exhibit similar effects simultaneously the trends in the forebay water level processes of them are also similar overall these three methods exhibit the best performance the maximum daily absolute deviations in the forebay water level of three gorges system are shown in figs 14 and 15 respectively the maximum daily absolute deviations in the flood season are generally larger than that of deviations in the non flood season simultaneously the deviations of the three methods in figs 14 and 15 show small difference in the non flood season while in the flood season the data mining method ignoring jacking effects ofm dm n stands out among them ofm dm n captures certain artificial experiences and dispatching rules of hydropower stations from data and owns the reasonable input feature therefore it has great advantages in dealing with the complex hydrological challenges caused by rapid fluctuations of output while seen from figs 7 and 8 the linearity of the variable comprehensive efficiency coefficient curve in ofm wecc v and the water consumption rate curve in ofm wecc r are more significant in the non flood season the complex hydrological characteristics cannot be described effectively by the simple one to one curves this is the essential reason why the three methods perform differently finally table 4 summarizes the comprehensive ranking and the recommended methods in different seasons 5 discussion for the upstream large hydropower stations like three gorges the rapid fluctuation of output is the most fundamental reason for producing large deviation when forecasting outflow during peak load regulation hydropower stations have to switch the states of units to track load fluctuation from the power grid resulting in a stepwise change in outflow hydrological phenomena such as streamflow propagation and water level change become unstable this does increase the difficulty in forecasting the head for power generation besides the upstream large hydropower stations are equipped with many types of units each of which has different efficiency characteristics when different types of units undertake the same output their power generation streamflow varies greatly peak load regulation is closely related to power grid loads transmission lines and bus connection modes of hydropower stations and takes on strong randomness therefore the more hydropower stations are equipped with units the more difficult output schemes are specific to each unit to date in dispatch center the output scheme cannot be refined to a single unit the site dispatchers told us that there was no consensus on which method to forecast outflow of three gorges besides different methods for tail water level and outflow have been analyzed in section 4 2 1 and 4 2 3 respectively while from the aspect of practicability the empirical formula and common three dimensional curve for tail water level have two notable disadvantages 1 the outflow at period t itself is a quantity that needs to be forecasted furthermore there is a transmission of deviation when forecasting the tail water level based on outflow 2 the forebay water level of the downstream hydropower station at period t is also unknown and is hard to be forecasted accurately specifically for three gorges system station 5 water level does bring strong noise on sandouping water level while the data mining methods are not necessary to understand the characteristics or rules of the tail water level and outflow for a given hydropower station once finishing calibration their computational efficiency are high and can meet the demand of short term dispatching therefore data mining methods own high practicability and application prospects from the aspect of the potential in improving accuracy the operation rules of hydropower stations in different years are not completely the same however a summary for historical data is still necessary because it is needed to calibrate parameters of models and methods to guide actual scheduling for tail water level empirical formula and common three dimensional curve have less potential for outflow the three water energy conversion characteristics methods and the method by optimizing power generation streamflow ofm osw gh also have less potential this is because the basic and newly added operation data of hydropower stations has little influence on parameter calibration for curves and models moreover the effects of these methods are not stable among different years for example the outflow accuracy of three gorges by the fixed comprehensive efficiency coefficient method in single period tests are better in testing data this can be seen from table 3 while the data mining methods own high potential if the characteristics implied by the actual operation data change the data mining methods can adjust parameters to achieve an accurate trace for the tail water level and outflow 6 conclusion seven outflow forecasting methods for the upstream large hydropower station during the non abandoning season were proposed in this study the three gorges gezhouba cascade hydropower system was selected as a case study to compare the proposed methods specifically this study includes three aspects first an optimal load allocation table with gross head as parameters for hydropower stations was formulated second the artificial neural network models for tail water level and outflow were established and the former model was integrated into the outflow forecasting methods for the first time third two sets of solving steps for outflow rolling forecasting were proposed comparative tests were conducted for single period and rolling tests and important hydrological characteristics of cascade hydropower system were analyzed in detail the principal conclusions of this study are as follows 1 during the non abandoning season the common three dimensional curve for tail water level of the upstream hydropower station and its variant in the form of empirical formulas show poor forecasting accuracy simultaneously their practicability and potential in improving accuracy are not satisfactory the data mining model for tail water level is good at dealing with the complex hydrological challenges caused by peak load regulation and is recommended to be embedded into outflow forecasting methods it is insensitive to the deviation of outflow and can significantly improve the calculation accuracy of tail water level in rolling forecast 2 many valuable informations are contained in the historical operation data of hydropower stations utilizing these informations by data mining to guide the actual dispatching is attractive however the established data mining models should follow the operation characteristics and business processes of a given hydropower station in particular the input feature should be reasonably determined because it is quite important for accuracy and practicability specifically for three gorges its tail water level and outflow should ignore jacking effects of station 5 water level 3 in the flood season the hydrological characteristics of the upstream large hydropower stations are complex therefore the method by data mining is highly recommended to forecast outflow while the variable comprehensive efficiency method and water consumption rate method are two additional recommended methods in the non flood season by these three recommended methods the accumulative deviation of forebay and tail water level and operation safety of cascade hydropower system can be improved significantly the modeling ideas and methods for forecasting outflow of the upstream large hydropower stations has been proposed in this study however the application of data mining model requires many years of detailed operation data for the hydropower station system how to forecast outflow with a lack of such data should be further analyzed or a refined model considering output allocation strategies should be established in

3402,three widely used primary soil moisture sm data sources namely in situ measurements satellite observations and land surface models lsm possess different characteristics this study combined three sm data sources using machine learning ml random forest artificial neural networks and support vector regression and simple averaging ensemble approaches to produce improved daily sm data over the contiguous united states conus for each ml model three schemes were tested using different independent variables namely satellite derived lsm derived and both triple collocation analysis tca was adopted to address the scale mismatch problem between in situ and coarse gridded sm data the proposed approach was evaluated using the international soil moisture network ismn soil moisture active passive core validation sites smap cvs and tca in the ismn based evaluation the proposed ml based ensemble generally produced better evaluation metrics and showed robust skills over topographically complex and densely vegetated regions where existing sm products showed poor skills the smap cvs based evaluation demonstrated that the ml ensemble approach yielded a better performance than the existing sm datasets resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0 78 unbiased root mean squared difference of 0 035 m3 m3 and bias of 0 006 m3 m3 in addition the tca results additionally confirmed that the ml based ensemble had better spatiotemporal quality than the other sm products the data driven approach proposed in this study has three major novelties 1 the proposed ml based method synergistically merges various data sources to improve sm 2 the performance of the proposed ml based sm was robust to topography and vegetation and 3 the average ensemble of three ml models additionally improves performances the sm time series data generated by the proposed approach are expectedly suitable variables for environmental and climate applications over conus the research findings suggest that ml algorithms can be effectively used for modeling dynamic soil moisture keywords soil moisture machine learning triple collocation analysis ensemble abbreviations sm soil moisture ml machine learning tca triple collocation analysis ens ensemble 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an important climate variable of hydrological and meteorological processes which is designated by the world meteorological organization wmo sm has a persistence or memory of 1 2 months i e subseasonal and plays an important role in the development of extreme climatic events related to land atmosphere interactions via energy and water balance processes dirmeyer et al 2021 miralles et al 2014 seo et al 2020 daily sm data are widely used to investigate various land atmosphere interactions santanello et al 2018 realistic sm estimates covering vast areas with available long term data are needed to understand the comprehensive water energy and carbon cycles at the land surface level the three primary sources of sm data are in situ measurements satellite observations and land surface models lsm in situ measurements provide accurate sm data with a high temporal resolution the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at has provided in situ based global sm data with quality control since 2009 al yaari et al 2019 dorigo et al 2011 however in situ sm data have limitations in spatial coverage and temporal continuity because of expensive cost of installation and maintenance kerr et al 2010 mardan and ahmadi 2021 satellite observations and lsms have been widely used to obtain spatiotemporally continuous sm information satellite derived sm data have been retrieved from low frequency microwave for example l c and x band observations such as soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010a the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 the advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 1999 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 owe et al 2008 satellite based sm retrievals have been conducted using radiative transfer models or change detection algorithms from measured microwave signals contrastingly there are sm products from various lsms such as the national land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 xia et al 2012 and the national climate assessment land data assimilation system nca ldas jasinski et al 2019 these lsm based sm datasets have been generated from complex process based equations using meteorological forcing data gambill et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2010 several studies have emphasized the synergistic use of both sources because of the varying characteristics of satellite and lsm based sm estimates kim et al 2020 kolassa et al 2017b seo and dirmeyer 2022 the quality of both microwave satellite and lsm based sm data is affected by regional characteristics such as topography and vegetation commonly represented by topographic complexity tc and vegetation optical depth vod al yaari et al 2019 karthikeyan et al 2017 kolassa et al 2018 park et al 2017 for example multiple interactions volume scattering and double bounce from vegetation and topography are known sources of error in active microwave sensor data dobson and ulaby 1986 ulaby et al 1974 wagner et al 2013 passive microwave measurements are affected by satellite incidence angles and are attenuated by vegetation canopies that dampen soil emissions from the ground dobson et al 1985 pellarin et al 2016 su et al 2020 lsm also has limitations originating from uncertainties associated with model parameterization such as climatology based vegetation parameterization case et al 2014 fang et al 2018b liu et al 2011 ullah et al 2018 the simplified formulation of physical processes such as the 1 d formulation of vertical water flow can also cause errors in lsm based sm data balsamo et al 2009 bi et al 2016 chen et al 2016 these inherent uncertainties in sm datasets pose challenges for environmental applications such as drought monitoring and prediction liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2017a several studies have adopted data assimilation da and machine learning ml algorithms to make realistic sm estimates that can capture the spatiotemporal variation of sm draper et al 2012 kolassa et al 2018 2017a kumar et al 2019 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 da has been broadly conducted to improve lsm based sm estimates using satellite data in which satellite based sm retrievals are assimilated by the background error covariance diagnosed from land model simulations using their observation errors dong and crow 2018 kumar et al 2019 reichle et al 2017 seo et al 2021 however da is affected by uncertainties inherent in the original lsm and satellite data to be assimilated ml is another way of enhancing sm data quality by modeling the nonlinear relationship between sm and related factors kolassa et al 2018 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 ml has the advantage of flexibility when combining numerous data from multiple sources yuan et al 2020a to date when estimating sm using ml algorithms many studies have used satellite derived predictors to estimate lsm based sm that is reference data instead of in situ measurements kolassa et al 2018 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 the shortcoming of such an approach is that the sm estimates from ml models tend to have similar characteristics to lsm based sm data including their uncertainty one primary reason for using lsm based sm as reference data is the substantial discrepancy in the spatial scale between in situ 1 m2 and coarse scale satellite data tens of km2 aires et al 2005 yuan et al 2020a yuan et al 2020a recently attempted to estimate sm with ml algorithms over the contiguous united states conus using smap derived independent variables targeting reliable in situ sm measurements that is quality controlled using triple collocation analysis tca tca is a method that evaluates errors in geophysical variables using three different measurement systems without reference data stoffelen 1998 while yuan et al 2020a showed the feasibility of using ml for sm estimation they did not compare ml based results to widely used sm datasets such as nca ldas and nldas 2 in addition to yuan et al 2020a further experiments on sm estimation through the synergistic use of multiple ml algorithms such as random forest rf artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr are required to produce better sm data abbaszadeh et al 2019 cho et al 2020a park et al 2020 yoo et al 2018 while ensemble approaches have demonstrated their robustness in various research fields they have been minimally explored in ml based sm estimation after a review of current sm estimation studies this study aimed to achieve the following goals 1 producing high quality daily sm data with a resolution of 25 km through the synergistic use of three different data sources based on ml algorithms over the conus region 2 conducting a spatiotemporal evaluation using sparse and dense in situ sm measurements to identify the advantages of ml based sm estimation compared with existing sm datasets and 3 examining the effect of an ensemble of multiple ml based sm data using tca 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and period the study area incorporated the entire conus region in southern canada and northern mexico which is the nldas 2 domain located between latitudes 25 n and 53 n and longitudes 125 w and 67 w fig 1 we selected this study area for the following reasons first there are many in situ sm measurements with long term data availability which benefits evaluating ml algorithms that require a large sample size for training and testing purposes senyurek et al 2020 yuan et al 2020a fig 1 second the sm products from the data assimilated lsm i e nca ldas and the open loop model nldas 2 that share the same lsm are available for this area allowing the cross comparison of multiple models the study period was from april to october which is the non freezing period of the northern hemisphere between 2007 and 2019 2 2 data satellite derived data lsm based data in situ measurements and auxiliary variables which were used for ml training testing and comparison with other sm datasets independent variables that are related to sm jiang and weng 2017 lee et al 2019a mohseni and mokhtarzade 2021 seneviratne et al 2010 yuan et al 2020b zhao et al 2018 were adopted table 1 to verify the synergistic use of different sm data sources three schemes using different independent variables for each ml were tested namely satellite based variables scheme s lsm based variables scheme l and both satellite and lsm based variables scheme a 2 2 1 satellite data ascat is a c band 5 3 ghz scatterometer that has provided global sm data with a temporal resolution of 1 3 days and a spatial resolution of 25 km since 2007 this study used level 2 near real time nrt sm estimates based on the tu wien change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 2013 ascat sm was downloaded from the eumuetsat data center https navigator eumetsat int product eo eum dat metop somo25 the degree of saturation unit of ascat sm was converted to the volumetric unit m3 m3 by multiplying the soil porosity data wagner et al 2013 frozen grids were excluded using an internal flag in the ascat dataset amsr2 is a microwave radiometer that has delivered global sm data with a temporal resolution of 1 2 days and a spatial resolution of 25 km since 2012 this study adopted x band based descending orbit crossing the equator at 1 30 am sm estimates based on the lprm algorithm bindlish et al 2018 owe et al 2008 the reasons for adopting the x band descending orbit were to avoid the violation of tca assumptions with c band ascat sm and the unexpected performance degradation of c band amsr2 sm cho et al 2017 smap currently provides global sm retrieval using an l band radiometer 1 41 ghz with temporal resolution of 2 3 days and spatial resolution of 36 km from 2015 this study used the smap l3 radiometer based sm data version 7 l3 sm p v7 baseline product smap has a sun synchronous orbit that crosses the equator at 6 pm and 6 am in local time data collected as 6 am were used because of the optimal quality chan et al 2018 smap sm data within the valid range between 0 02 and 0 5 m3 m3 and only recommended values from the retrieval quality flag were used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is an instrument onboard the satellites terra and aqua of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa two modis products were used in this study one was the 16 day averaged normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in the mod13c1 dataset generated from both terra and aqua satellite measurement data huete et al 1999 and the other was the 8 day averaged land surface temperature lst in the mod11c1 dataset derived only from terra measurement data wan 1999 lst and ndvi are considered important factors for understanding sm status sandholt et al 2002 2 2 2 land surface model data nldas 2 is an open loop lsm that covers conus and adjacent regions spatial extent of 25 n to 53 n latitude and 125 w to 67 w xia et al 2012 the nldas 2 lsm was forced with north american regional reanalysis narr including bias corrected downward shortwave radiation using goes 8 satellite data cpc and narr downward shortwave radiation data were bias corrected on a monthly timescale the atmospheric forcing data were downscaled to 12 5 km with an hourly resolution therefore nldas 2 simulates land surface states and fluxes with a high spatiotemporal resolution the more accurate atmospheric forcing data made the nldas 2 sm agree better with in situ sm measurements in both spatial and temporal domains xia et al 2014 in this study the noah lsm based nldas 2 was adopted and the first layer 0 10 cm corresponding to the measurement depth of the satellite based sm data was used nca ldas is a publicly available data assimilated lsm dataset that shares basic structures and parameters with nldas 2 noah lsm jasinski et al 2019 various satellite based geophysical variables including sm snow depth snow cover and irrigation data were assimilated into nca ldas using 1 d ensemble kalman filter reichle et al 2002 nca ldas has a spatial resolution of 12 5 km and a daily temporal resolution with the same spatial extent as nldas 2 however the temporal coverage of nca ldas is shorter than that of the nldas 2 from 1979 to 2016 nca ldas based sm has shown better agreement with in situ data than its open loop model kumar et al 2019 the first layer of the nca ldas sm data 0 10 cm was used 2 2 3 in situ data ismn has provided data from sparse in situ sm measurements i e containing a small number of sm measurement stations in a microwave satellite footprint worldwide since 2009 dorigo et al 2011 gruber et al 2020 ismn measurements have been widely used as reference data to validate satellite or lsm based sm products al yaari et al 2019 beck et al 2021 dorigo et al 2011 therefore ismn was used as a dependent variable in ml modeling fig 1 a some ismn data that were not used in the ml modeling were used as reference sm data fig 1 a here the sm measurements within 0 10 cm generally considered surface sm were used albergel et al 2008 dorigo et al 2015 to ensure the quality of the ismn data several preprocessing steps were conducted in the following order 1 sm values that were not flagged as good were removed dorigo et al 2013 2 hourly sm data were averaged over a daily time scale 3 tca was applied to ensure that the ismn measurements had spatial representativeness see section 3 1 for tca details 4 when each 0 25 grid contained multiple ismn measurements they were averaged 5 when the average surface skin temperature from nldas 2 was lower than 0 c 273 15 k sm values were removed 6 smap core validation site data cvs were used for validation and therefore ismn data that overlapped with smap cvs were removed and were not used for ml training smap cvs delivers dense in situ sm networks that contain a large number of sm measurement stations within a satellite footprint colliander et al 2017a the in situ sm measurements in smap cvs were installed at a depth of 5 cm below the surface and the measured values were upscaled to a 36 km grid to represent coarse scale gridded sm by using weighted averaging when cvs contained multiple sm values per day they were averaged into daily values invalid samples were removed following the quality flag for the smap cvs data the smap cvs could be considered the best possible reference data for sm data validation gruber et al 2020 smap cvs was used as another evaluation reference sm to evaluate the present results a detailed description of the smap cvs data is provided in table s1 2 2 4 auxiliary variables in this study six auxiliary data day of year doy longitude latitude elevation tc and vod were used the doy values were converted using the sine function to reflect seasonal characteristics yoo et al 2020 longitude latitude and elevation were used to account for the spatial heterogeneity of sm lee et al 2019b yuan et al 2020a elevation was extracted from the global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 usgs 1996 and linearly aggregated 25 km these four variables were used to build the ml models tc and vod were adopted to assess the limitations of the existing sm datasets bi et al 2016 crow et al 2012 ma et al 2019 paulik et al 2014 tc was calculated as the standard deviation of elevation at a resolution of 25 km using gtopo30 draper et al 2012 paulik et al 2014 vod is a proxy for canopy structure and vegetation water content it was extracted and averaged from the amsr2 x band lprm between 2015 and 2019 3 methodology the proposed approach for producing improved 25 km daily sm data comprised three processes 1 data preprocessing that involved resampling the input data controlling the quality of the in situ sm data ismn using tca and splitting the data into training and test datasets 2 ml modeling based on three different algorithms and their ensemble and 3 evaluating the ml models using sparse and dense in situ data together with tca fig 2 3 1 data preprocessing to conduct ml modeling and comparisons from spatiotemporally fragmented data data were aggregated from modis nldas 2 and gtopo30 to obtain a 25 km spatial resolution on a daily timescale when ascat had multiple measurements in a day they were averaged for each grid to conduct a comparison between the present results and existing sm data nca ldas was also aggregated to daily and 25 km resolutions smap sm was resampled bilinearly to 25 km for the dense in situ data based evaluation the ml results and nca ldas were resampled into a 36 km smap grid to address the difference in spatial resolution and projection between smap cvs and other sm datasets tca is a technique used to evaluate the error of a geophysical variable toward an unknown truth without reference data using three collocated datasets stoffelen 1998 tca assumes 1 linearity between the estimates sm datasets and unknown truth 2 signal and error stationarity 3 independence between the true state of a target and estimation error error orthogonality and 4 error independence between three collocated datasets zero error cross correlation with the following widely used error model stoffelen 1998 1 i α i β i θ ε i where i is a dataset of a geophysical variable sm in this study θ is the unknown truth α i and β i denote the additive bias and multiplicative bias of dataset i against the unknown truth respectively and ε i is the zero mean random error of dataset i based on the four assumptions mentioned above tca makes it possible to directly estimate the sensitivity of data i using the covariance σ ij and variance σ i 2 gruber et al 2016 mccoll et al 2014 here three tca based evaluation metrics were adopted namely tca based pearson s correlation coefficient r i tca based coefficient of determination r i 2 and tca based signal to noise ratio sn r i these can be calculated using the following equations gruber et al 2020 2016 2 sn r i d b 10 log β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε i 2 3 r i σ ij σ ik σ i 2 σ jk β i 2 σ θ 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε 2 i 4 r i 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε 2 i tca based snr i values are symmetric around zero and the zero value indicates that the soil moisture signal of data i β i 2 σ θ 2 is identical to the noise σ ε i 2 when snr i increases decreases by 3 it indicates that the signal increases decreases twice half compared to the noise gruber et al 2016 to screen out data from individual ismn stations that did not follow the variations in sm in a 25 km grid scale i e to address the spatial mismatch between grid scale data and point scale data tca was conducted using the following triplet ismn ascat and nldas 2 when tca is conducted using the triplet of one point data and two grid data it produces a degraded performance if point measurements do not follow the temporal variability of the coarse gridded data chen et al 2017a gruber et al 2016 therefore the criterion of rismn 0 7 was applied to screen out ismn stations that did not follow 25 km sm variation according to the literature chen et al 2017a yuan et al 2020a to obtain a viable estimation of tca data were discarded either when the number of collocated data was less than 100 or when r i values were negative chen et al 2018 kim et al 2018b scipal et al 2008 to avoid accuracy inflation of the ml results the available data were divided spatially black dots for training and pick triangles for testing in fig 1a and temporally 2007 2014 for training and 2015 2019 for testing this made it possible to obtain spatiotemporally independent training and test datasets 3 2 machine learning modeling to improve the existing sm datasets three widely used supervised ml algorithms rf ann and svr were used kim et al 2018a kolassa et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 three schemes were designed following the independent variables used in ml training which were satellite based variables scheme s using lsm based variables scheme l and using both satellite and lsm based variables scheme a see section 2 2 random search is an algorithm that conducts parameter optimization using randomly selected parameter combinations in a hyperparameter space defined in advance bergstra and bengio 2012 to conduct hyperparameter optimization for each ml model and scheme and to avoid overfitting a model the training dataset fig 1 a was further randomly divided into 8 2 and 20 of the training dataset was used to determine the hyperparameters while minimizing overfitting the python based randomizedsearchcv in the scikit learn library to was used to implement a random search the optimized hyperparameters for each model are listed in table s2 rf is a supervised learning method that consists of numerous decision tree estimators breiman 2001 it uses the bootstrap aggregating bagging method which selects random data samples and variables that allow replacement unlike single decision tree estimators rf is robust against overfitting because of the bagging method park et al 2020 in the regression problem rf takes the average of the estimations of multiple trees researchers in the field of remote sensing have adopted rf to solve regression problems e g sm downscaling sea surface salinity estimation drought monitoring and biomass estimation because of its robust performance and ease of tuning abbaszadeh et al 2019 jang et al 2021 park et al 2019b jacon et al 2021 here rf was implemented using a python based scikit learn randomforestregressor ann is a biologically inspired ml method that consists of multiple layers of calculation units called neurons cho et al 2020a among the various types of ann algorithms a widely used multilayer feed forward backpropagation neural network was adopted here it has three types of layers namely input hidden and output in the hidden and output layers a neuron is typically processed using weight s bias and an activation function using the backpropagation algorithm the weights and biases of the neurons were iteratively optimized previous ml based sm estimation studies have widely adopted ann as an estimator kolassa et al 2018 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 santi et al 2014 in this study ann was implemented using a python based scikit learn mlpregressor svr finds an optimal hyperplane that minimizes the error by considering regularization park et al 2019a svr projects the problem into a higher dimension using a kernel function such as linear or gaussian also called radial basis function rbf to find an optimal hyperplane for a nonlinear problem many studies have adopted svr for regression tasks and achieved good performances cho et al 2020a senyurek et al 2020 pham et al 2021 however svr incurs a large computational cost when dealing with a large dataset wang et al 2005 to implement svr efficiently a python based thundersvm was adopted in this study thundersvm can use multiple cpu and gpu cores therefore minimizing calculation time when using a large dataset wen et al 2018 an ensemble strategy combines two or more estimates to obtain a further improved output goodfellow et al 2016 there are several ensemble methods such as stacking ensemble and averaging ensemble ens and here an ens method was adopted that is simpler to implement than other ensemble methods such as stacking ens has already demonstrated its ability to increase generalization performance in various fields e g climate forecast and spatial interpolation when using multiple models with different characteristics cho et al 2020b hagedorn et al 2005 narapusetty et al 2009 zhou 2012 moreover ens is also known to help to reduce an overfitting problem which typically occurs when a single model is used chen et al 2017b wang et al 2021 3 3 evaluation to evaluate the performance of each sm model and the existing sm datasets four widely used evaluation metrics were adopted the anomaly correlation coefficient rano pearson s correlation coefficient r unbiased root mean squared difference ubrmsd and bias al yaari et al 2019 colliander et al 2017b dong et al 2020 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2020 r was used to assess the short term sm variation rano was used to assess long term sm variation the sm anomaly of each dataset at time t was calculated by subtracting the average sm value of the 35 day moving window from t 17 to t 17 dorigo et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 ubrmsd was used to measure random error and is beneficial because it reduces the error originating from the bias entekhabi et al 2010b bias was used to evaluate systematic error against the reference data the formulation of the four evaluation metrics is described in the supplementary material after calculating the evaluation metrics for each in situ data location statistically insignificant values p value 0 05 were discarded to obtain robust evaluation metrics the evaluation metrics were calculated when all the data values were collocated in addition to the in situ data based evaluation sn r i was produced using tca tca can produce spatially continuous error values without in situ reference data and therefore many studies have adopted tca to evaluate sm datasets over regions with no in situ measurements scipal et al 2010 xu et al 2021 here tca triplets were created as follows smi amsr2 and smap where smi ascat nldas 2 and the ml based results that minimizes the error cross correlation assumption of tca gruber et al 2016 kim et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation based on sparse in situ data the performances of existing sm data three ml algorithms and ens by scheme using sparse in situ measurements are compared in table 3 the best performance metrics were obtained from ens a which denotes the ens of scheme a an average ensemble of three ml models rf ann and svr for scheme a except for the bias the metrics obtained from ens a were rano of 0 66 r of 0 78 ubrmsd of 0 063 and bias of 0 007 0 006 for 2015 2019 scheme a showed the synergistic use of satellite and lsm data in ml modeling and outperformed the other two schemes scheme s showed the lowest metrics with a relatively small improvement in rano from the ascat sm compared to scheme l this result may be because of the limited available data that help to reflect daily sm variation in scheme s ascat sm and doy there was a small difference in the error metrics between ens a ens l ann a and ann l table 2 ens a had slightly higher rano and r 0 01 to 0 02 or no difference than ann l ann a and ens l this small difference among the ml results may originate from the limited spatial coverage of sparse in situ data used for evaluation scipal et al 2010 among the existing sm data nca ldas rano of 0 62 r of 0 67 ubrmsd of 0 07 and bias of 0 07 and smap rano of 0 12 r of 0 71 ubrmsd of 0 07 and bias of 0 02 showed higher performances than the other sm datasets used in this study ascat sm and nldas 2 sm yielded moderate performances rano of 0 43 r of 0 58 ubrmsd of 0 092 and bias of 0 002 rano of 0 56 r of 0 68 ubrmsd of 0 075 and bias of 0 046 respectively amsr2 showed the lowest performance rano of 0 48 r of 0 55 ubrmsd of 0 123 and bias of 0 77 the synergistically merged ml based sm result ens a has a better ability to capture short term and long term sm variation through rano and r respectively with low random and systematic error through ubrmsd and bias respectively than the other sm data table 2 detailed evaluations and discussions of amsr2 sm can be found in previous studies bindlish et al 2018 karthikeyan et al 2017 kim et al 2015 to compare the temporal pattern of sm data the daily mean sm and sm anomaly time series were used fig 3 ens a smap and nca ldas showed patterns similar to the sparse in situ data fig 3 a nca ldas exhibited a good temporal agreement with the in situ measurements and was similar to the findings of kumar et al 2019 nca ldas and nldas 2 showed an overestimation that generally concords with previous studies dong et al 2020 kumar et al 2019 xia et al 2014 whereas smap resulted in a slight underestimation fan et al 2020 suggested that smap sm underestimation may originate from the vegetation climatology and surface temperature data used in the smap retrieval algorithm ens a showed a small overall bias the soil moisture anomaly time series were compared to the in situ time series to identify the extent to which each sm dataset followed the short term variability of the in situ sm measurements fig 3 b ens a nca ldas and smap yielded good performances for the sm anomaly compared with the in situ based sm anomaly ens a was comparable or slightly better than nca ldas and smap smap tended to show a larger sm anomaly than the in situ data conversely nca ldas showed a smaller sm anomaly than the in situ data ascat and nldas 2 the independent variables in the ml models showed slightly poor performances for the sm anomaly from the perspective of both long term sm time series and short term sm variation sm anomaly time series ens a generally showed better temporal agreement with the in situ sm data than with other existing sm datasets fig 3 figure 4 illustrates the spatial pattern of the evaluation metrics of each sm dataset demonstrating that nca ldas smap and ens a generally exhibited good temporal agreement with the sparse in situ data however the existing sm datasets showed spatial error patterns that originated from their algorithm and parametrization namely degraded error metrics over 1 topographically complex and 2 highly vegetated areas bi et al 2016 chen et al 2016 dobson and ulaby 1986 yin et al 2016 these performance degradations have been already discussed in previous studies al yaari et al 2019 balsamo et al 2009 bi et al 2016 dong and crow 2017 xia et al 2014 compared to nca ldas and smap ens a resulted in higher rano r and lower ubrmsd and bias than the other sm data in particular ens a showed a distinctively smaller bias and ubrmsd than its independent variables ascat and nldas 2 sm in many previous studies smap sm has shown better agreement with in situ sm measurements than other satellite derived sm products karthikeyan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b unlike the time series evaluation fig 3 the smap limitation in spatial coverage originated from the quality control qc flag mask fig 4 burgin et al 2017 the ml models effectively mitigated the systematic error patterns of the independent variables ascat and nldas 2 sm fig 4 and fig s2 ml models are calibrated toward reducing the overall error commonly mean squared error mse between the estimated and reference values therefore the systematic bias inherent in the independent variables ascat and nldas 2 in this study can be reduced in ens a jang et al 2021 the evaluation metrics for ascat nldas 2 nca ldas and ens a according to tc and vod are shown in fig 5 the criteria for dividing the tc and vod classes were adopted from previous studies with slight modifications kim et al 2018b paulik et al 2014 smap was excluded due to limited data availability the relationship between the performance of the sm datasets and the levels of tc and vod are clearly demonstrated fig 5 the larger the tc and vod the lower the performance of the sm data however the performance of ens a was less affected even when tc and vod increased the rano of ens a decreased slightly when the tc level increased however it showed the smallest range of rano variation when the level of vod increased ens a yielded a performance comparable to that of nca ldas the r of ens a was generally higher than that of the other sm data regardless of tc and vod levels in addition to rano and r the ubrmsd of ens a was small with little variability compared to other sm datasets for all levels of tc and vod the median bias value of ens a was approximately zero regardless of tc and vod levels in summary ens a has a small random and systematic error with the ability to capture short and long term sm variations particularly in mountainous and highly vegetated regions fig 5 ml algorithms can learn various nonlinear interactions among the independent variables ascat modis nldas and auxiliary variables and the dependent variable ismn which might reduce the complex effects of tc and vod on the sm estimation however to examine the nonlinear interactions in ml models additional experiments should be conducted in the future using various visualization tools such as shapley additive explanations shap jang et al 2021 lundberg and lee 2017 for ascat and nldas 2 rano and r decreased and ubrmsd and bias increased with increasing tc and vod the sensitivity of ascat and nldas 2 to tc and vod has been well documented in previous studies for example the backscatter coefficient of ascat sm is largely dependent on the local incidence angle and vegetation canopy that can cause multiple interactions volume scattering and double bounce dobson and ulaby 1986 ulaby et al 1974 the fixed climatology based vegetation parametrization case et al 2014 fang et al 2018a jiang et al 2010 and simple 1 d vertical formulation of the water balance in noah lsm may also cause a biased sm estimate bi et al 2016 chen et al 2016 pitman 2003 with the exception of bias nca ldas generally yielded better performance metrics when compared to nldas 2 which shared the same noah lsm without da even when tc and vod values were high 4 2 evaluation based on dense in situ data sm datasets that showed high performances over sparse in situ data nca ldas smap and ml results were further evaluated against the smap cvs in situ data fig 6 and table s3 scatterplots and evaluation metrics of nca ldas smap and ens a sm with the cvs measurements to compare nca ldas smap and ens a are shown in fig 6 although averaging evaluation metrics is not recommended in this study evaluation metrics were averaged following previous studies that conducted sm data evaluation using the smap cvs in situ data cui et al 2018 dong et al 2020 nca ldas and smap showed good performance with average r values of 0 73 and 0 69 respectively however ens a yielded the highest average r 0 78 similarly ens a showed the smallest average ubrmsd 0 035 m3 m3 compared to 0 036 m3 m3 and 0 042 m3 m3 from nca ldas and smap respectively the result of ens a satisfied the sm accuracy ubrmsd 0 04 required for use in various applications including drought monitoring flood prediction and weather and climate prediction entekhabi et al 2010a ens a and smap yielded small averaged biases 0 006 and 0 005 respectively and nca ldas showed a larger averaged bias 0 076 m3 m3 4 3 evaluation based on triple collocation analysis the tca based snr of each sm estimate calculated using the tca triplets sm i amsr2 and smap where sm i ascat nldas 2 ann l ens l ann a rf a svr a and ens a between 2015 and 2019 are illustrated in fig 7 nca ldas sm was excluded from the tca based evaluation because it ingests smap and amsr2 sm in the da process strongly violating tca assumptions there are distinctive spatio temporal synergies of satellite and lsm data in ml modeling higher snr i of scheme a fig 7 although there was no significant difference in the evaluation metrics between schemes l and a in the in situ data based evaluation table 2 tca clearly demonstrates improved snrens a compared to the snrens l for example the great plains and northwestern conus had high snrens a but low snrens l as discussed in previous studies an increased number of relevant independent variables can make better estimates pelletier et al 2016 wei et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 improvements in snr values from individual ensemble members ann a rf a and svr a to the ensemble estimates ens a were found ens can yield better estimates than individual members because each ensemble member has different error characteristics goodfellow et al 2016 found that a larger number of ensemble members with different error characteristics leads to ensemble results with less error different error characteristics i e the spatial pattern of tca based snr i among ann a rf a and svr a are shown in fig 7 snrs between the individual ml results and their ensemble were compared quantitatively fig s3 the median of snrrf a snrann a and snrsvr a were 4 34 4 6 4 53 db respectively while snrens a was 5 db compared with snrens a the best worst ensemble member was snrann a snrrf a snrens a achieved a significant improvement of 0 4 from snrann a 0 66 from snrrf a when smap in the tca triplet was replaced with the smos inra cesbio smos ic fernandez moran et al 2017 the results were unchanged not shown 5 lsimitations of the study this study has demonstrated improved ensemble sm estimates through the synergistic use of satellite and lsm data with ml algorithms however several limitations remain despite the good performance of ens a we found that the southwestern conus continued to show low snr which primarily originated from the error in the independent variables fig 7 using better performing satellite and lsm derived sm as independent variables in ml modeling may further improve the performance additional in situ measurement references for these regions can also help to build a more robust ml based sm estimation model while many in situ sm measurements were used to validate the proposed approaches the ml results in this study were not evaluated by climate zone cz and land cover lc because of limited in situ data availability cz or lc can affect both satellite and lsm based sm quality al yaari et al 2019 dong et al 2020 ma et al 2019 for example ascat sm can have unexpected values over dry regions wagner et al 2013 for nldas 2 lc is important because the error of the estimated sm is largely dependent on the accurate land cover type used in the modeling xia et al 2015 to obtain more robust tca based error estimates various sensor and retrieval algorithm derived sm data are required a recent study used the median of tca based error estimates from various combinations of the tca triplet to obtain a robust evaluation kim et al 2020 if new satellite based sm data such as from the copernicus imaging microwave radiometer cimr kilic et al 2018 and the soil moisture ocean salinity high resolution smos hr rodriguez fernandez et al 2020 become available the proposed tca based evaluation should be more robust to minimize the effect of cloud contamination this study used daily resampled 8 day lst and 16 day ndvi composites as independent variables recently efforts have been made to produce gap filled daily lst and ndvi data julien and sobrino 2019 yoo et al 2020 in future work obtaining better daily sm data in terms of temporal variation by adopting these gap filled variables is expected finally it should be noted that there are socio economic factors related to sm variation such as fertilizer use agricultural machinery and irrigation lawston et al 2017 malek et al 2017 this study only focused on natural factors in sm modeling without considering the combined effects of the natural and socio economic factors incorporation of such blending effects into sm modeling requires further investigation 6 conclusion in this study a novel data driven approach was proposed combining different sm dataset sources satellite lsm and in situ data using an ensemble of ml algorithms to produce high quality daily 25 km sm data over the conus region through the three evaluation methods using sparse in situ measurements ismn dense in situ measurements smap cvs data and tca the proposed ensemble approach showed better performance metrics than existing high performance sm data smap and nca ldas specifically our ml based sm data yielded robust and consistent accuracy metrics unlike other sm data that showed deteriorated accuracies over areas with high vod and tc values in particular in the smap cvs based evaluation the proposed ml based ensemble model ens a resulted in an average r ubrmsd and bias of 0 78 0 035 m3 m3 and 0 006 m3 m3 respectively they were better than those of nca ldas and smap we confirmed that the ensemble of three ml models produced a markedly better performance than the individual models through the tca based snr which was not clearly shown in the in situ based evaluation consequently our ml ensemble based daily sm can provide improved surface sm data over 13 years in the study area including complex mountainous and highly vegetated areas by adopting the framework proposed in this study we can expect an improved understanding of the land atmosphere interactions over conus and neighboring regions the outcomes of this research provide a basis for modeling dynamic soil moisture based on ml algorithms credit

3402,three widely used primary soil moisture sm data sources namely in situ measurements satellite observations and land surface models lsm possess different characteristics this study combined three sm data sources using machine learning ml random forest artificial neural networks and support vector regression and simple averaging ensemble approaches to produce improved daily sm data over the contiguous united states conus for each ml model three schemes were tested using different independent variables namely satellite derived lsm derived and both triple collocation analysis tca was adopted to address the scale mismatch problem between in situ and coarse gridded sm data the proposed approach was evaluated using the international soil moisture network ismn soil moisture active passive core validation sites smap cvs and tca in the ismn based evaluation the proposed ml based ensemble generally produced better evaluation metrics and showed robust skills over topographically complex and densely vegetated regions where existing sm products showed poor skills the smap cvs based evaluation demonstrated that the ml ensemble approach yielded a better performance than the existing sm datasets resulting in a correlation coefficient of 0 78 unbiased root mean squared difference of 0 035 m3 m3 and bias of 0 006 m3 m3 in addition the tca results additionally confirmed that the ml based ensemble had better spatiotemporal quality than the other sm products the data driven approach proposed in this study has three major novelties 1 the proposed ml based method synergistically merges various data sources to improve sm 2 the performance of the proposed ml based sm was robust to topography and vegetation and 3 the average ensemble of three ml models additionally improves performances the sm time series data generated by the proposed approach are expectedly suitable variables for environmental and climate applications over conus the research findings suggest that ml algorithms can be effectively used for modeling dynamic soil moisture keywords soil moisture machine learning triple collocation analysis ensemble abbreviations sm soil moisture ml machine learning tca triple collocation analysis ens ensemble 1 introduction soil moisture sm is an important climate variable of hydrological and meteorological processes which is designated by the world meteorological organization wmo sm has a persistence or memory of 1 2 months i e subseasonal and plays an important role in the development of extreme climatic events related to land atmosphere interactions via energy and water balance processes dirmeyer et al 2021 miralles et al 2014 seo et al 2020 daily sm data are widely used to investigate various land atmosphere interactions santanello et al 2018 realistic sm estimates covering vast areas with available long term data are needed to understand the comprehensive water energy and carbon cycles at the land surface level the three primary sources of sm data are in situ measurements satellite observations and land surface models lsm in situ measurements provide accurate sm data with a high temporal resolution the international soil moisture network ismn https ismn geo tuwien ac at has provided in situ based global sm data with quality control since 2009 al yaari et al 2019 dorigo et al 2011 however in situ sm data have limitations in spatial coverage and temporal continuity because of expensive cost of installation and maintenance kerr et al 2010 mardan and ahmadi 2021 satellite observations and lsms have been widely used to obtain spatiotemporally continuous sm information satellite derived sm data have been retrieved from low frequency microwave for example l c and x band observations such as soil moisture active passive smap entekhabi et al 2010a the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos kerr et al 2010 the advanced scatterometer ascat wagner et al 1999 and the advanced microwave scanning radiometer 2 amsr2 owe et al 2008 satellite based sm retrievals have been conducted using radiative transfer models or change detection algorithms from measured microwave signals contrastingly there are sm products from various lsms such as the national land data assimilation system phase 2 nldas 2 xia et al 2012 and the national climate assessment land data assimilation system nca ldas jasinski et al 2019 these lsm based sm datasets have been generated from complex process based equations using meteorological forcing data gambill et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2010 several studies have emphasized the synergistic use of both sources because of the varying characteristics of satellite and lsm based sm estimates kim et al 2020 kolassa et al 2017b seo and dirmeyer 2022 the quality of both microwave satellite and lsm based sm data is affected by regional characteristics such as topography and vegetation commonly represented by topographic complexity tc and vegetation optical depth vod al yaari et al 2019 karthikeyan et al 2017 kolassa et al 2018 park et al 2017 for example multiple interactions volume scattering and double bounce from vegetation and topography are known sources of error in active microwave sensor data dobson and ulaby 1986 ulaby et al 1974 wagner et al 2013 passive microwave measurements are affected by satellite incidence angles and are attenuated by vegetation canopies that dampen soil emissions from the ground dobson et al 1985 pellarin et al 2016 su et al 2020 lsm also has limitations originating from uncertainties associated with model parameterization such as climatology based vegetation parameterization case et al 2014 fang et al 2018b liu et al 2011 ullah et al 2018 the simplified formulation of physical processes such as the 1 d formulation of vertical water flow can also cause errors in lsm based sm data balsamo et al 2009 bi et al 2016 chen et al 2016 these inherent uncertainties in sm datasets pose challenges for environmental applications such as drought monitoring and prediction liu et al 2019 yuan et al 2015 zhang and jia 2013 zhang et al 2017a several studies have adopted data assimilation da and machine learning ml algorithms to make realistic sm estimates that can capture the spatiotemporal variation of sm draper et al 2012 kolassa et al 2018 2017a kumar et al 2019 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 da has been broadly conducted to improve lsm based sm estimates using satellite data in which satellite based sm retrievals are assimilated by the background error covariance diagnosed from land model simulations using their observation errors dong and crow 2018 kumar et al 2019 reichle et al 2017 seo et al 2021 however da is affected by uncertainties inherent in the original lsm and satellite data to be assimilated ml is another way of enhancing sm data quality by modeling the nonlinear relationship between sm and related factors kolassa et al 2018 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 ml has the advantage of flexibility when combining numerous data from multiple sources yuan et al 2020a to date when estimating sm using ml algorithms many studies have used satellite derived predictors to estimate lsm based sm that is reference data instead of in situ measurements kolassa et al 2018 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 the shortcoming of such an approach is that the sm estimates from ml models tend to have similar characteristics to lsm based sm data including their uncertainty one primary reason for using lsm based sm as reference data is the substantial discrepancy in the spatial scale between in situ 1 m2 and coarse scale satellite data tens of km2 aires et al 2005 yuan et al 2020a yuan et al 2020a recently attempted to estimate sm with ml algorithms over the contiguous united states conus using smap derived independent variables targeting reliable in situ sm measurements that is quality controlled using triple collocation analysis tca tca is a method that evaluates errors in geophysical variables using three different measurement systems without reference data stoffelen 1998 while yuan et al 2020a showed the feasibility of using ml for sm estimation they did not compare ml based results to widely used sm datasets such as nca ldas and nldas 2 in addition to yuan et al 2020a further experiments on sm estimation through the synergistic use of multiple ml algorithms such as random forest rf artificial neural network ann and support vector regression svr are required to produce better sm data abbaszadeh et al 2019 cho et al 2020a park et al 2020 yoo et al 2018 while ensemble approaches have demonstrated their robustness in various research fields they have been minimally explored in ml based sm estimation after a review of current sm estimation studies this study aimed to achieve the following goals 1 producing high quality daily sm data with a resolution of 25 km through the synergistic use of three different data sources based on ml algorithms over the conus region 2 conducting a spatiotemporal evaluation using sparse and dense in situ sm measurements to identify the advantages of ml based sm estimation compared with existing sm datasets and 3 examining the effect of an ensemble of multiple ml based sm data using tca 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and period the study area incorporated the entire conus region in southern canada and northern mexico which is the nldas 2 domain located between latitudes 25 n and 53 n and longitudes 125 w and 67 w fig 1 we selected this study area for the following reasons first there are many in situ sm measurements with long term data availability which benefits evaluating ml algorithms that require a large sample size for training and testing purposes senyurek et al 2020 yuan et al 2020a fig 1 second the sm products from the data assimilated lsm i e nca ldas and the open loop model nldas 2 that share the same lsm are available for this area allowing the cross comparison of multiple models the study period was from april to october which is the non freezing period of the northern hemisphere between 2007 and 2019 2 2 data satellite derived data lsm based data in situ measurements and auxiliary variables which were used for ml training testing and comparison with other sm datasets independent variables that are related to sm jiang and weng 2017 lee et al 2019a mohseni and mokhtarzade 2021 seneviratne et al 2010 yuan et al 2020b zhao et al 2018 were adopted table 1 to verify the synergistic use of different sm data sources three schemes using different independent variables for each ml were tested namely satellite based variables scheme s lsm based variables scheme l and both satellite and lsm based variables scheme a 2 2 1 satellite data ascat is a c band 5 3 ghz scatterometer that has provided global sm data with a temporal resolution of 1 3 days and a spatial resolution of 25 km since 2007 this study used level 2 near real time nrt sm estimates based on the tu wien change detection algorithm wagner et al 1999 2013 ascat sm was downloaded from the eumuetsat data center https navigator eumetsat int product eo eum dat metop somo25 the degree of saturation unit of ascat sm was converted to the volumetric unit m3 m3 by multiplying the soil porosity data wagner et al 2013 frozen grids were excluded using an internal flag in the ascat dataset amsr2 is a microwave radiometer that has delivered global sm data with a temporal resolution of 1 2 days and a spatial resolution of 25 km since 2012 this study adopted x band based descending orbit crossing the equator at 1 30 am sm estimates based on the lprm algorithm bindlish et al 2018 owe et al 2008 the reasons for adopting the x band descending orbit were to avoid the violation of tca assumptions with c band ascat sm and the unexpected performance degradation of c band amsr2 sm cho et al 2017 smap currently provides global sm retrieval using an l band radiometer 1 41 ghz with temporal resolution of 2 3 days and spatial resolution of 36 km from 2015 this study used the smap l3 radiometer based sm data version 7 l3 sm p v7 baseline product smap has a sun synchronous orbit that crosses the equator at 6 pm and 6 am in local time data collected as 6 am were used because of the optimal quality chan et al 2018 smap sm data within the valid range between 0 02 and 0 5 m3 m3 and only recommended values from the retrieval quality flag were used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis is an instrument onboard the satellites terra and aqua of the national aeronautics and space administration nasa two modis products were used in this study one was the 16 day averaged normalized difference vegetation index ndvi in the mod13c1 dataset generated from both terra and aqua satellite measurement data huete et al 1999 and the other was the 8 day averaged land surface temperature lst in the mod11c1 dataset derived only from terra measurement data wan 1999 lst and ndvi are considered important factors for understanding sm status sandholt et al 2002 2 2 2 land surface model data nldas 2 is an open loop lsm that covers conus and adjacent regions spatial extent of 25 n to 53 n latitude and 125 w to 67 w xia et al 2012 the nldas 2 lsm was forced with north american regional reanalysis narr including bias corrected downward shortwave radiation using goes 8 satellite data cpc and narr downward shortwave radiation data were bias corrected on a monthly timescale the atmospheric forcing data were downscaled to 12 5 km with an hourly resolution therefore nldas 2 simulates land surface states and fluxes with a high spatiotemporal resolution the more accurate atmospheric forcing data made the nldas 2 sm agree better with in situ sm measurements in both spatial and temporal domains xia et al 2014 in this study the noah lsm based nldas 2 was adopted and the first layer 0 10 cm corresponding to the measurement depth of the satellite based sm data was used nca ldas is a publicly available data assimilated lsm dataset that shares basic structures and parameters with nldas 2 noah lsm jasinski et al 2019 various satellite based geophysical variables including sm snow depth snow cover and irrigation data were assimilated into nca ldas using 1 d ensemble kalman filter reichle et al 2002 nca ldas has a spatial resolution of 12 5 km and a daily temporal resolution with the same spatial extent as nldas 2 however the temporal coverage of nca ldas is shorter than that of the nldas 2 from 1979 to 2016 nca ldas based sm has shown better agreement with in situ data than its open loop model kumar et al 2019 the first layer of the nca ldas sm data 0 10 cm was used 2 2 3 in situ data ismn has provided data from sparse in situ sm measurements i e containing a small number of sm measurement stations in a microwave satellite footprint worldwide since 2009 dorigo et al 2011 gruber et al 2020 ismn measurements have been widely used as reference data to validate satellite or lsm based sm products al yaari et al 2019 beck et al 2021 dorigo et al 2011 therefore ismn was used as a dependent variable in ml modeling fig 1 a some ismn data that were not used in the ml modeling were used as reference sm data fig 1 a here the sm measurements within 0 10 cm generally considered surface sm were used albergel et al 2008 dorigo et al 2015 to ensure the quality of the ismn data several preprocessing steps were conducted in the following order 1 sm values that were not flagged as good were removed dorigo et al 2013 2 hourly sm data were averaged over a daily time scale 3 tca was applied to ensure that the ismn measurements had spatial representativeness see section 3 1 for tca details 4 when each 0 25 grid contained multiple ismn measurements they were averaged 5 when the average surface skin temperature from nldas 2 was lower than 0 c 273 15 k sm values were removed 6 smap core validation site data cvs were used for validation and therefore ismn data that overlapped with smap cvs were removed and were not used for ml training smap cvs delivers dense in situ sm networks that contain a large number of sm measurement stations within a satellite footprint colliander et al 2017a the in situ sm measurements in smap cvs were installed at a depth of 5 cm below the surface and the measured values were upscaled to a 36 km grid to represent coarse scale gridded sm by using weighted averaging when cvs contained multiple sm values per day they were averaged into daily values invalid samples were removed following the quality flag for the smap cvs data the smap cvs could be considered the best possible reference data for sm data validation gruber et al 2020 smap cvs was used as another evaluation reference sm to evaluate the present results a detailed description of the smap cvs data is provided in table s1 2 2 4 auxiliary variables in this study six auxiliary data day of year doy longitude latitude elevation tc and vod were used the doy values were converted using the sine function to reflect seasonal characteristics yoo et al 2020 longitude latitude and elevation were used to account for the spatial heterogeneity of sm lee et al 2019b yuan et al 2020a elevation was extracted from the global 30 arc second elevation gtopo30 usgs 1996 and linearly aggregated 25 km these four variables were used to build the ml models tc and vod were adopted to assess the limitations of the existing sm datasets bi et al 2016 crow et al 2012 ma et al 2019 paulik et al 2014 tc was calculated as the standard deviation of elevation at a resolution of 25 km using gtopo30 draper et al 2012 paulik et al 2014 vod is a proxy for canopy structure and vegetation water content it was extracted and averaged from the amsr2 x band lprm between 2015 and 2019 3 methodology the proposed approach for producing improved 25 km daily sm data comprised three processes 1 data preprocessing that involved resampling the input data controlling the quality of the in situ sm data ismn using tca and splitting the data into training and test datasets 2 ml modeling based on three different algorithms and their ensemble and 3 evaluating the ml models using sparse and dense in situ data together with tca fig 2 3 1 data preprocessing to conduct ml modeling and comparisons from spatiotemporally fragmented data data were aggregated from modis nldas 2 and gtopo30 to obtain a 25 km spatial resolution on a daily timescale when ascat had multiple measurements in a day they were averaged for each grid to conduct a comparison between the present results and existing sm data nca ldas was also aggregated to daily and 25 km resolutions smap sm was resampled bilinearly to 25 km for the dense in situ data based evaluation the ml results and nca ldas were resampled into a 36 km smap grid to address the difference in spatial resolution and projection between smap cvs and other sm datasets tca is a technique used to evaluate the error of a geophysical variable toward an unknown truth without reference data using three collocated datasets stoffelen 1998 tca assumes 1 linearity between the estimates sm datasets and unknown truth 2 signal and error stationarity 3 independence between the true state of a target and estimation error error orthogonality and 4 error independence between three collocated datasets zero error cross correlation with the following widely used error model stoffelen 1998 1 i α i β i θ ε i where i is a dataset of a geophysical variable sm in this study θ is the unknown truth α i and β i denote the additive bias and multiplicative bias of dataset i against the unknown truth respectively and ε i is the zero mean random error of dataset i based on the four assumptions mentioned above tca makes it possible to directly estimate the sensitivity of data i using the covariance σ ij and variance σ i 2 gruber et al 2016 mccoll et al 2014 here three tca based evaluation metrics were adopted namely tca based pearson s correlation coefficient r i tca based coefficient of determination r i 2 and tca based signal to noise ratio sn r i these can be calculated using the following equations gruber et al 2020 2016 2 sn r i d b 10 log β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε i 2 3 r i σ ij σ ik σ i 2 σ jk β i 2 σ θ 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε 2 i 4 r i 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 β i 2 σ θ 2 σ ε 2 i tca based snr i values are symmetric around zero and the zero value indicates that the soil moisture signal of data i β i 2 σ θ 2 is identical to the noise σ ε i 2 when snr i increases decreases by 3 it indicates that the signal increases decreases twice half compared to the noise gruber et al 2016 to screen out data from individual ismn stations that did not follow the variations in sm in a 25 km grid scale i e to address the spatial mismatch between grid scale data and point scale data tca was conducted using the following triplet ismn ascat and nldas 2 when tca is conducted using the triplet of one point data and two grid data it produces a degraded performance if point measurements do not follow the temporal variability of the coarse gridded data chen et al 2017a gruber et al 2016 therefore the criterion of rismn 0 7 was applied to screen out ismn stations that did not follow 25 km sm variation according to the literature chen et al 2017a yuan et al 2020a to obtain a viable estimation of tca data were discarded either when the number of collocated data was less than 100 or when r i values were negative chen et al 2018 kim et al 2018b scipal et al 2008 to avoid accuracy inflation of the ml results the available data were divided spatially black dots for training and pick triangles for testing in fig 1a and temporally 2007 2014 for training and 2015 2019 for testing this made it possible to obtain spatiotemporally independent training and test datasets 3 2 machine learning modeling to improve the existing sm datasets three widely used supervised ml algorithms rf ann and svr were used kim et al 2018a kolassa et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 three schemes were designed following the independent variables used in ml training which were satellite based variables scheme s using lsm based variables scheme l and using both satellite and lsm based variables scheme a see section 2 2 random search is an algorithm that conducts parameter optimization using randomly selected parameter combinations in a hyperparameter space defined in advance bergstra and bengio 2012 to conduct hyperparameter optimization for each ml model and scheme and to avoid overfitting a model the training dataset fig 1 a was further randomly divided into 8 2 and 20 of the training dataset was used to determine the hyperparameters while minimizing overfitting the python based randomizedsearchcv in the scikit learn library to was used to implement a random search the optimized hyperparameters for each model are listed in table s2 rf is a supervised learning method that consists of numerous decision tree estimators breiman 2001 it uses the bootstrap aggregating bagging method which selects random data samples and variables that allow replacement unlike single decision tree estimators rf is robust against overfitting because of the bagging method park et al 2020 in the regression problem rf takes the average of the estimations of multiple trees researchers in the field of remote sensing have adopted rf to solve regression problems e g sm downscaling sea surface salinity estimation drought monitoring and biomass estimation because of its robust performance and ease of tuning abbaszadeh et al 2019 jang et al 2021 park et al 2019b jacon et al 2021 here rf was implemented using a python based scikit learn randomforestregressor ann is a biologically inspired ml method that consists of multiple layers of calculation units called neurons cho et al 2020a among the various types of ann algorithms a widely used multilayer feed forward backpropagation neural network was adopted here it has three types of layers namely input hidden and output in the hidden and output layers a neuron is typically processed using weight s bias and an activation function using the backpropagation algorithm the weights and biases of the neurons were iteratively optimized previous ml based sm estimation studies have widely adopted ann as an estimator kolassa et al 2018 rodríguez fernández et al 2015 santi et al 2014 in this study ann was implemented using a python based scikit learn mlpregressor svr finds an optimal hyperplane that minimizes the error by considering regularization park et al 2019a svr projects the problem into a higher dimension using a kernel function such as linear or gaussian also called radial basis function rbf to find an optimal hyperplane for a nonlinear problem many studies have adopted svr for regression tasks and achieved good performances cho et al 2020a senyurek et al 2020 pham et al 2021 however svr incurs a large computational cost when dealing with a large dataset wang et al 2005 to implement svr efficiently a python based thundersvm was adopted in this study thundersvm can use multiple cpu and gpu cores therefore minimizing calculation time when using a large dataset wen et al 2018 an ensemble strategy combines two or more estimates to obtain a further improved output goodfellow et al 2016 there are several ensemble methods such as stacking ensemble and averaging ensemble ens and here an ens method was adopted that is simpler to implement than other ensemble methods such as stacking ens has already demonstrated its ability to increase generalization performance in various fields e g climate forecast and spatial interpolation when using multiple models with different characteristics cho et al 2020b hagedorn et al 2005 narapusetty et al 2009 zhou 2012 moreover ens is also known to help to reduce an overfitting problem which typically occurs when a single model is used chen et al 2017b wang et al 2021 3 3 evaluation to evaluate the performance of each sm model and the existing sm datasets four widely used evaluation metrics were adopted the anomaly correlation coefficient rano pearson s correlation coefficient r unbiased root mean squared difference ubrmsd and bias al yaari et al 2019 colliander et al 2017b dong et al 2020 dorigo et al 2017 gruber et al 2020 r was used to assess the short term sm variation rano was used to assess long term sm variation the sm anomaly of each dataset at time t was calculated by subtracting the average sm value of the 35 day moving window from t 17 to t 17 dorigo et al 2015 gruber et al 2019 ubrmsd was used to measure random error and is beneficial because it reduces the error originating from the bias entekhabi et al 2010b bias was used to evaluate systematic error against the reference data the formulation of the four evaluation metrics is described in the supplementary material after calculating the evaluation metrics for each in situ data location statistically insignificant values p value 0 05 were discarded to obtain robust evaluation metrics the evaluation metrics were calculated when all the data values were collocated in addition to the in situ data based evaluation sn r i was produced using tca tca can produce spatially continuous error values without in situ reference data and therefore many studies have adopted tca to evaluate sm datasets over regions with no in situ measurements scipal et al 2010 xu et al 2021 here tca triplets were created as follows smi amsr2 and smap where smi ascat nldas 2 and the ml based results that minimizes the error cross correlation assumption of tca gruber et al 2016 kim et al 2020 4 results and discussion 4 1 evaluation based on sparse in situ data the performances of existing sm data three ml algorithms and ens by scheme using sparse in situ measurements are compared in table 3 the best performance metrics were obtained from ens a which denotes the ens of scheme a an average ensemble of three ml models rf ann and svr for scheme a except for the bias the metrics obtained from ens a were rano of 0 66 r of 0 78 ubrmsd of 0 063 and bias of 0 007 0 006 for 2015 2019 scheme a showed the synergistic use of satellite and lsm data in ml modeling and outperformed the other two schemes scheme s showed the lowest metrics with a relatively small improvement in rano from the ascat sm compared to scheme l this result may be because of the limited available data that help to reflect daily sm variation in scheme s ascat sm and doy there was a small difference in the error metrics between ens a ens l ann a and ann l table 2 ens a had slightly higher rano and r 0 01 to 0 02 or no difference than ann l ann a and ens l this small difference among the ml results may originate from the limited spatial coverage of sparse in situ data used for evaluation scipal et al 2010 among the existing sm data nca ldas rano of 0 62 r of 0 67 ubrmsd of 0 07 and bias of 0 07 and smap rano of 0 12 r of 0 71 ubrmsd of 0 07 and bias of 0 02 showed higher performances than the other sm datasets used in this study ascat sm and nldas 2 sm yielded moderate performances rano of 0 43 r of 0 58 ubrmsd of 0 092 and bias of 0 002 rano of 0 56 r of 0 68 ubrmsd of 0 075 and bias of 0 046 respectively amsr2 showed the lowest performance rano of 0 48 r of 0 55 ubrmsd of 0 123 and bias of 0 77 the synergistically merged ml based sm result ens a has a better ability to capture short term and long term sm variation through rano and r respectively with low random and systematic error through ubrmsd and bias respectively than the other sm data table 2 detailed evaluations and discussions of amsr2 sm can be found in previous studies bindlish et al 2018 karthikeyan et al 2017 kim et al 2015 to compare the temporal pattern of sm data the daily mean sm and sm anomaly time series were used fig 3 ens a smap and nca ldas showed patterns similar to the sparse in situ data fig 3 a nca ldas exhibited a good temporal agreement with the in situ measurements and was similar to the findings of kumar et al 2019 nca ldas and nldas 2 showed an overestimation that generally concords with previous studies dong et al 2020 kumar et al 2019 xia et al 2014 whereas smap resulted in a slight underestimation fan et al 2020 suggested that smap sm underestimation may originate from the vegetation climatology and surface temperature data used in the smap retrieval algorithm ens a showed a small overall bias the soil moisture anomaly time series were compared to the in situ time series to identify the extent to which each sm dataset followed the short term variability of the in situ sm measurements fig 3 b ens a nca ldas and smap yielded good performances for the sm anomaly compared with the in situ based sm anomaly ens a was comparable or slightly better than nca ldas and smap smap tended to show a larger sm anomaly than the in situ data conversely nca ldas showed a smaller sm anomaly than the in situ data ascat and nldas 2 the independent variables in the ml models showed slightly poor performances for the sm anomaly from the perspective of both long term sm time series and short term sm variation sm anomaly time series ens a generally showed better temporal agreement with the in situ sm data than with other existing sm datasets fig 3 figure 4 illustrates the spatial pattern of the evaluation metrics of each sm dataset demonstrating that nca ldas smap and ens a generally exhibited good temporal agreement with the sparse in situ data however the existing sm datasets showed spatial error patterns that originated from their algorithm and parametrization namely degraded error metrics over 1 topographically complex and 2 highly vegetated areas bi et al 2016 chen et al 2016 dobson and ulaby 1986 yin et al 2016 these performance degradations have been already discussed in previous studies al yaari et al 2019 balsamo et al 2009 bi et al 2016 dong and crow 2017 xia et al 2014 compared to nca ldas and smap ens a resulted in higher rano r and lower ubrmsd and bias than the other sm data in particular ens a showed a distinctively smaller bias and ubrmsd than its independent variables ascat and nldas 2 sm in many previous studies smap sm has shown better agreement with in situ sm measurements than other satellite derived sm products karthikeyan et al 2017 zhang et al 2017b unlike the time series evaluation fig 3 the smap limitation in spatial coverage originated from the quality control qc flag mask fig 4 burgin et al 2017 the ml models effectively mitigated the systematic error patterns of the independent variables ascat and nldas 2 sm fig 4 and fig s2 ml models are calibrated toward reducing the overall error commonly mean squared error mse between the estimated and reference values therefore the systematic bias inherent in the independent variables ascat and nldas 2 in this study can be reduced in ens a jang et al 2021 the evaluation metrics for ascat nldas 2 nca ldas and ens a according to tc and vod are shown in fig 5 the criteria for dividing the tc and vod classes were adopted from previous studies with slight modifications kim et al 2018b paulik et al 2014 smap was excluded due to limited data availability the relationship between the performance of the sm datasets and the levels of tc and vod are clearly demonstrated fig 5 the larger the tc and vod the lower the performance of the sm data however the performance of ens a was less affected even when tc and vod increased the rano of ens a decreased slightly when the tc level increased however it showed the smallest range of rano variation when the level of vod increased ens a yielded a performance comparable to that of nca ldas the r of ens a was generally higher than that of the other sm data regardless of tc and vod levels in addition to rano and r the ubrmsd of ens a was small with little variability compared to other sm datasets for all levels of tc and vod the median bias value of ens a was approximately zero regardless of tc and vod levels in summary ens a has a small random and systematic error with the ability to capture short and long term sm variations particularly in mountainous and highly vegetated regions fig 5 ml algorithms can learn various nonlinear interactions among the independent variables ascat modis nldas and auxiliary variables and the dependent variable ismn which might reduce the complex effects of tc and vod on the sm estimation however to examine the nonlinear interactions in ml models additional experiments should be conducted in the future using various visualization tools such as shapley additive explanations shap jang et al 2021 lundberg and lee 2017 for ascat and nldas 2 rano and r decreased and ubrmsd and bias increased with increasing tc and vod the sensitivity of ascat and nldas 2 to tc and vod has been well documented in previous studies for example the backscatter coefficient of ascat sm is largely dependent on the local incidence angle and vegetation canopy that can cause multiple interactions volume scattering and double bounce dobson and ulaby 1986 ulaby et al 1974 the fixed climatology based vegetation parametrization case et al 2014 fang et al 2018a jiang et al 2010 and simple 1 d vertical formulation of the water balance in noah lsm may also cause a biased sm estimate bi et al 2016 chen et al 2016 pitman 2003 with the exception of bias nca ldas generally yielded better performance metrics when compared to nldas 2 which shared the same noah lsm without da even when tc and vod values were high 4 2 evaluation based on dense in situ data sm datasets that showed high performances over sparse in situ data nca ldas smap and ml results were further evaluated against the smap cvs in situ data fig 6 and table s3 scatterplots and evaluation metrics of nca ldas smap and ens a sm with the cvs measurements to compare nca ldas smap and ens a are shown in fig 6 although averaging evaluation metrics is not recommended in this study evaluation metrics were averaged following previous studies that conducted sm data evaluation using the smap cvs in situ data cui et al 2018 dong et al 2020 nca ldas and smap showed good performance with average r values of 0 73 and 0 69 respectively however ens a yielded the highest average r 0 78 similarly ens a showed the smallest average ubrmsd 0 035 m3 m3 compared to 0 036 m3 m3 and 0 042 m3 m3 from nca ldas and smap respectively the result of ens a satisfied the sm accuracy ubrmsd 0 04 required for use in various applications including drought monitoring flood prediction and weather and climate prediction entekhabi et al 2010a ens a and smap yielded small averaged biases 0 006 and 0 005 respectively and nca ldas showed a larger averaged bias 0 076 m3 m3 4 3 evaluation based on triple collocation analysis the tca based snr of each sm estimate calculated using the tca triplets sm i amsr2 and smap where sm i ascat nldas 2 ann l ens l ann a rf a svr a and ens a between 2015 and 2019 are illustrated in fig 7 nca ldas sm was excluded from the tca based evaluation because it ingests smap and amsr2 sm in the da process strongly violating tca assumptions there are distinctive spatio temporal synergies of satellite and lsm data in ml modeling higher snr i of scheme a fig 7 although there was no significant difference in the evaluation metrics between schemes l and a in the in situ data based evaluation table 2 tca clearly demonstrates improved snrens a compared to the snrens l for example the great plains and northwestern conus had high snrens a but low snrens l as discussed in previous studies an increased number of relevant independent variables can make better estimates pelletier et al 2016 wei et al 2019 zhao et al 2018 improvements in snr values from individual ensemble members ann a rf a and svr a to the ensemble estimates ens a were found ens can yield better estimates than individual members because each ensemble member has different error characteristics goodfellow et al 2016 found that a larger number of ensemble members with different error characteristics leads to ensemble results with less error different error characteristics i e the spatial pattern of tca based snr i among ann a rf a and svr a are shown in fig 7 snrs between the individual ml results and their ensemble were compared quantitatively fig s3 the median of snrrf a snrann a and snrsvr a were 4 34 4 6 4 53 db respectively while snrens a was 5 db compared with snrens a the best worst ensemble member was snrann a snrrf a snrens a achieved a significant improvement of 0 4 from snrann a 0 66 from snrrf a when smap in the tca triplet was replaced with the smos inra cesbio smos ic fernandez moran et al 2017 the results were unchanged not shown 5 lsimitations of the study this study has demonstrated improved ensemble sm estimates through the synergistic use of satellite and lsm data with ml algorithms however several limitations remain despite the good performance of ens a we found that the southwestern conus continued to show low snr which primarily originated from the error in the independent variables fig 7 using better performing satellite and lsm derived sm as independent variables in ml modeling may further improve the performance additional in situ measurement references for these regions can also help to build a more robust ml based sm estimation model while many in situ sm measurements were used to validate the proposed approaches the ml results in this study were not evaluated by climate zone cz and land cover lc because of limited in situ data availability cz or lc can affect both satellite and lsm based sm quality al yaari et al 2019 dong et al 2020 ma et al 2019 for example ascat sm can have unexpected values over dry regions wagner et al 2013 for nldas 2 lc is important because the error of the estimated sm is largely dependent on the accurate land cover type used in the modeling xia et al 2015 to obtain more robust tca based error estimates various sensor and retrieval algorithm derived sm data are required a recent study used the median of tca based error estimates from various combinations of the tca triplet to obtain a robust evaluation kim et al 2020 if new satellite based sm data such as from the copernicus imaging microwave radiometer cimr kilic et al 2018 and the soil moisture ocean salinity high resolution smos hr rodriguez fernandez et al 2020 become available the proposed tca based evaluation should be more robust to minimize the effect of cloud contamination this study used daily resampled 8 day lst and 16 day ndvi composites as independent variables recently efforts have been made to produce gap filled daily lst and ndvi data julien and sobrino 2019 yoo et al 2020 in future work obtaining better daily sm data in terms of temporal variation by adopting these gap filled variables is expected finally it should be noted that there are socio economic factors related to sm variation such as fertilizer use agricultural machinery and irrigation lawston et al 2017 malek et al 2017 this study only focused on natural factors in sm modeling without considering the combined effects of the natural and socio economic factors incorporation of such blending effects into sm modeling requires further investigation 6 conclusion in this study a novel data driven approach was proposed combining different sm dataset sources satellite lsm and in situ data using an ensemble of ml algorithms to produce high quality daily 25 km sm data over the conus region through the three evaluation methods using sparse in situ measurements ismn dense in situ measurements smap cvs data and tca the proposed ensemble approach showed better performance metrics than existing high performance sm data smap and nca ldas specifically our ml based sm data yielded robust and consistent accuracy metrics unlike other sm data that showed deteriorated accuracies over areas with high vod and tc values in particular in the smap cvs based evaluation the proposed ml based ensemble model ens a resulted in an average r ubrmsd and bias of 0 78 0 035 m3 m3 and 0 006 m3 m3 respectively they were better than those of nca ldas and smap we confirmed that the ensemble of three ml models produced a markedly better performance than the individual models through the tca based snr which was not clearly shown in the in situ based evaluation consequently our ml ensemble based daily sm can provide improved surface sm data over 13 years in the study area including complex mountainous and highly vegetated areas by adopting the framework proposed in this study we can expect an improved understanding of the land atmosphere interactions over conus and neighboring regions the outcomes of this research provide a basis for modeling dynamic soil moisture based on ml algorithms credit

3403,the damages caused by the breach of landslide dams can be mitigated by making an emergency plan based on the fast and accurate forecast of the resultant outburst floods this study proposed an advanced physically based breach model which can effectively predict the breach evolution and the outflow hydrograph variations of soil erodibility along the dam depth are specially considered in this model to avoid infinite occurrence of soil erosion an arctangent erosion model is proposed to calculate the erosion rate two advantages of which against the existing erosion models are demonstrated better representation of the erosion process and simplified requirement of only one input parameter the rate of the breach lateral enlargement is considered to vary along the depth and the breach shape is regarded as a rectangle the breach model is applied in two case studies of the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam the predictions of breaching geometric parameters and the outflow hydrographic parameters agree well with the field observations comparing with the two widely used landslide dam break models the proposed numerical method predicts changes of the lake level and the breach bottom more accurately results also prove the importance and necessity of considering soil erodibility along the dam depth moreover sensitivity analysis is also conducted it can be found that the parameter related to the arctangent erosion model significantly affects the breach evolution and the associated outflow hydrograph while the influences of the broad crested weir flow formula and the lateral enlargement rate is not that obvious the numerical results are not sensitive to the velocity step adopted in the numerical scheme facilitating the application of the model in

dam breach may cause huge casualties and property losses in the downstream area for instance the failures of three landslide dams formed during the 1933 diexi earthquake in sichuan province of china caused a loss of about 2 500 lives nie et al 2004 the potential breach of the tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the 2008 wenchuan earthquake in china threatened 1 2 million people downstream and led to evacuation of 275 000 people liu et al 2010 more recently the flooding caused by the 2018 baige landslide dam in tibet of china seriously damaged infrastructures within 500 km of the downstream jinsha river such as bridges highways housing zhang et al 2020 it is extremely important to predict the potential breach of landslide dams which can provide tools for disaster management and help to make appropriate engineering risk mitigation plans the modelling of landslide dam breach has been extensively explored which can be generally divided into parametric based models e g costa 1985 costa and schuster 1988 walder and o connor 1997 peng and zhang 2012 wang et al 2016a b ruan et al 2021 and physically based models e g fread 1984 fread 1988 chang and zhang 2010 peng et al 2014 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020a b xue et al 2021 parametric based models are normally developed by statistical regression analysis based on historical data of landslide dam failures which use control variables i e dam height lake volume dam shape etc to derive the breach parameters i e breach geometry breach duration peak flow rate etc although parametric based models are a quick way to predict the breach parameters for landslide dams they are developed based on limited available historical data with characteristics of highly variable and subjective nature moreover the parametric based model cannot predict the entire process of dam breach which can only give specific values of breach parameters such as peak flow rate breach width breach time etc therefore great efforts have been made to establish physically based models which can give a better understanding of dam breach mechanisms the physically based model incorporates principles of hydraulics soil mechanics sediment transport and slope stability which can simulate the whole dam breach process and obtain the associated outflow hydrograph breach is an early proposed physically based model for homogeneous earth dams fread 1984 fread 1988 which simulated the flow into the breach channel by using the broad crested weir flow equation the evolution of breach width is modelled by slope stability analysis of the breach side slope which changed from rectangle to trapezoid however by using breach an initial value of the final breach depth should be assumed and the erosion along the sides and bottom of the breach channel is assumed to be equal more recently many new landslide dam break models have been developed most of which contributed to better quantify the breaching process of a landslide dam zhong et al 2018 proposed the db nhri landslide dam break model which can well simulate the flattening process of downstream slope however this model adopted a linear shear stress equation proposed by graf 1984 to determine the bed erosion rate which may lead to excessive incision of the breach similarly this linear shear stress equation was also used in the daba model by chang and zhang 2010 improvements were made in determining two key parameters of the linear shear stress equation i e the critical erosive stress and the coefficient of erodibility by considering additional factors influencing soil erodibility based on filed experiments such as d50 void ratio plasticity index etc shi et al 2015 modified the daba model to simulate the cascade breaching of landslide dams by setting the inflow rate as a time related variable instead of piecewise constant values since the erodibility of landslide accumulations is one of the key parameters governing the breach process chen et al 2015 developed the db iwhr landslide dam break model and proposed a hyperbolic formula for characterizing the erosion rate along the depth which can effectively avoid over erosion of the breach although physically based models have been developing rapidly there remains a recognized need to improve models particularly for landslide dams which are composed of heterogenous soils with various erodibility the breach process of landslide dams is highly affected by interactions between dam materials and inflow thus in this study an advanced physically based model is proposed which simulates the dam breach process with a special consideration of different soil erodibility along the dam depth an arctangent erosion model with an asymptote is established to describe the vertical incision of dam breach process which limits the infinite increase of erosion rate and effectively avoids overestimating soil erodibility moreover fewer input parameters for the arctangent erosion model are required which is more suitable for landslide dams with limited available information the proposed model is applied to the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam for verification and the results show that the new proposed model improved the prediction of landslide dams breaching 2 methods the breaching development of landslide dams is a soil erosion process coupled with a hydrodynamic process both of which need to be modeled 2 1 outflow hydrograph the difference between the inflow from the upstream river and the outflow through the breach equals to the change in the water volume of the barrier lake which is calculated by the surface area multiplied by the rising or descending rate of the lake level formulating the balance relationship yields 1 d w d t q in q b where w is the volume of the lake t is the time qin is the inflow rate qb is the breach flow the volume of the barrier lake can be estimated by the quadratic equation with a few measured data in the field e g chen et al 2015 2020a b 2 w a 1 z s z s r 2 b 1 z s z s r c 1 10 6 where a 1 b 1 c 1 are coefficients in the fitting formula of the lake volume which can be determined by the relation of lake surface elevation and lake capacity zs is the water level in the lake z s r is the benchmark water level the differential of w respect to zs is obtained 3 d w d z s 2 a 1 z s z s r b 1 10 6 substituting eq 3 in eq 1 yields 4 q b q in d w d z s d z s d t q in 2 a 1 z s z s r b 1 d z s d t 10 6 the outflow through the breach is considered as a broad crested weir flow that is widely used in the breach models of landslide dams e g chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 the discharge is a function of the head above the breach bottom 5 q b c b z s z d 3 2 where c is the discharge coefficient that is determined from the literatures e g singh and scarlatos 1988 chen et al 2015 or by calibrations b is the breach width z d is the elevation of breach bottom the mean flow velocity in the breach is produced as 6 v c h z s z d 3 2 the water depth in the breach can be determined by the manning s formula fread 1988 singh et al 1988 7 h n q b b j 0 5 0 6 where n is the

coefficient of the head above the breach bottom which can be defined as 9 m n 0 6 c 0 6 j 0 3 chen et al 2015 suggested a range of m between 0 8 and 0 9 substituting eq 8 in eq 6 yields 10 v c m 1 z s z d 1 2 2 2 breach geometry evolution compared with the man made homogeneous earthen dams landslide dams are composed of mixed materials with a wide range of particle sizes from large rocks mainly with its original structure to completely weathered rocks and to soils with tree roots liu et al 2010 most landslide dams have a relatively large volume of debris materials with a large ratio of length to width costa and schuster 1988 showing characteristics of spatial heterogeneous broadly gradation and low degree of compaction dunning 2006 evans et al 2007 chang et al 2011 based on the inherent characteristics of landslide dams the analysis of dam breach usually involves complicated process of soil erosion and breach geometry development the erodibility of landslide deposit is one of the dominant factors that control the erosion process of a landslide dam under the same condition high soil erodibility will yield a larger breach size a shorter breach duration and a larger peak discharge to incorporate the soil erodibility in the breach model a large number of empirical equations have been proposed to relate the erosion rate of breach bottom to the shear stress which can be approximately divided into two categories namely power law models e g roberts et al 1998 gaucher et al 2010 and hyperbolic models e g chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016a b power law models take the following form 11 d z d d t a τ b τ c b where dzd dt is the erosion rate of breach bottom a and b are coefficients regressed from experimental results τb is the breach bed shear stress and τc is the critical shear stress of soil a simplification of eq 11 i e b 1 has been used widely e g chang and zhang 2010 peng et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020a b which is also known as the linear erosion model however the power law model may yield unlimited strength against erosion thus a hyperbolic model is recently developed e g chen et al 2015 liu et al 2021 as expressed in the following form 12 d z d d t τ b τ c 0 01 c d τ b τ c where c and d are coefficients regressed from experimental results the hyperbolic model has an asymptote of 1 d as the breach bed shear stress approaches infinity avoiding unlimited erosion however the determination of the two coefficients in the hyperbolic expression is difficult especially for the predicted peak discharge which is very sensitive to the coefficient in this study an arctangent erosion model is proposed based on results of the erodibility experiment of the baige landslide dam materials from chen et al 2020a b which is presented as 13 d z d d t 1 1 9 α a r c tan τ b τ c τ 0 where α is the erodibility coefficient which indicates that the maximum erosion rate of breach bottom approaches π 3 8α and the value of α can be determined according to chen et al 2015 τ 0 is a referenced shear stress τ 0 25 pa by using the proposed arctangent erosion model only one parameter of α is needed which is particular suitable for landslide dam materials of high uncertainty and natural complexity however since the available experimental date of landslide dam erodibility is very limited more experiments on soil erodibility are supposed to be conducted in the future to calibrate the proposed arctangent erosion model though the measured value of τc is preferred it is difficult to timely obtain the critical shear stress of landslide dam materials thus empirical equations are widely used to estimate τc in this study the formula proposed by annandale 2006 is adopted to estimate soil critical shear stress e g chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 14 τ c 2 3 g d 50 ρ s ρ w tan φ where g is the gravitational acceleration ρw is the water density ρs is the density of soil particles φ is the friction angle and d 50 is the mean particle size field tests show that the soil bulk density increases with the deposition depth chang et al 2011 and coarse rocks are usually buried under the median gravels and soils hsu and hsu 2009 indicating that the critical shear stress increases along the depth the shear stress acting on the breach bed is determined from the calculated flow depth and the mean velocity by using the manning s equation 15 τ b ρ w g n 2 v 2 r 1 3 ρ w g n 2 v 2 h 1 3 where v is the mean velocity in the breach r is the hydraulic radius approximated by the water depth in the breach h the evolution of the breach geometry in a dam break includes the vertical incision characterized by eq 13 and the lateral enlargement the erosion rates along the two directions are often not uniform because the shear stress acting on the breach bottom and side slopes are different the breach shape is commonly represented by a trapezoid or quasi trapezoid e g chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 for simplicity and convenience the breach geometry is assumed as a rectangle in this study as shown in fig 1 the average breach width bi is calculated by the following expression 16 b i b 1 β z d 1 z d i where b 1 is the initial breach width β is the lateral enlargement rate that varies along different deposit layers as presented in fig 1 z d i is the breach bottom elevation at the i step z d 1 is the initial elevation of breach bottom relations for the initial velocity water depth bottom elevation and lake level are expressed as follows 17 z s 1 z d 1 m v 1 c 2 18 h 1 m z s 1 z d 1 when any two of the aforementioned parameters are known the others can be obtained this study adopted a straightforward calculation method without iteration to obtain the lake level the bottom elevation and the mean velocity in the breach chen et al 2015 the method starts from an initial velocity with an interval and then computes the increments of the aforementioned three parameters detailed calculation process is presented in appendixes a and b 3 results in order to verify the robustness of the landslide dam break model developed in this study and improvement of the presented model on the accuracy against the other widely used models i e the db iwhr model developed by chen et al 2015 2020a b and the db nhri model developed by zhong et al 2018 2020 two case studies of the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam are adopted to make a comparison in detail meanwhile advantages of the proposed arctangent erosion model are also illustrated in the case of the baige landslide dam 3 1 study sites 3 1 1 case 1 tangjiashan landslide dam the location of the tangjiashan landslide dam is shown in fig 2 a as the largest one of the 257 landslide dams cui et al 2009 formed during the wenchuan earthquake in china on 12 may 2018 tangjiashan landslide dam was made of about 24 37 million m3 rock debris with a length of 803 m along the river valley a width of 611 m across the river valley a height of 82 124 m and an actual lake volume of 238 million m3 it blocked the jianjiang river and the daily average inflow rate into the lake during the emergency mitigation period was measured to be about 80 90 m3 s from the tangjiashan gauge station liu et al 2010 more detailed information of the tangjiashan landslide dam can refer to table 1 to mitigate potential hazards to residents in the downstream cities a diversion channel was excavated with a length of 475 m fig 2 b it had an inlet bed elevation of 740 00 m with a side slope of 1 1 5 and a width of 8 m and an outlet bed elevation of 739 00 m with a side slope of 1 1 35 and a width of 10 m wang et al 2015 the erosion of the diversion channel started at 6 00 a m with a lake level of 742 16 m and virtually terminated at 20 00p m with a lake level of 719 48 m on june 10 accordingly the channel bottom elevation at the entrance is lowered from 740 00 m to about 715 m a peak outflow rate was observed as 6 500 m3 s at 12 30p m a variety of techniques was employed by the government to measure the hydraulic condition during the dam breaching the reservoir water level was obtained by an automatic hydro gauge station connected to china s beidou compass navigation satellite system the surface velocity near the entrance of the breach was monitored by using a decatur radar surface velocity radar svr laser hydrometer the width of the water surface was measured by using a nikon laser 800s range finder and the average flow depth was measured by an s48 1 ultrasonic wave depth measurement instrument fixed by a rod liu et al 2010 the outflow hydrographs the variations of lake level and mean velocity the breach depth and width with time were all reported in the literatures liu et al 2010 chen et al 2015 the profile of the landslide deposit along the breach channel showed that the dam was mainly composed of rocks with gravel and sand which were buried by silty sand gravel with cobbles chang and zhang 2010 the dam material in the top layer was relatively finer than that in the bottom layer the input parameters of the numerical simulation for the tangjiashan landslide dam are presented in table 2 according to the grain size distributions of the dam materials along the depth chang and zhang 2010 three layers of the deposit in depth are considered in the numerical model as shown in table 3 3 1 2 case 2 baige landslide dam the location of the baige landslide dam is shown in fig 2 a two landslides took place almost at the same location at baige village in tibet of china on 10 october 2018 and 3 november 2018 respectively both of which dammed the jinsha river and formed two landslide dams the second landslide debris filled the breach channel formed during the first dam failure in this study the second landslide dam is chosen to be investigated since it has a larger height and a larger lake volume which posed a greater threat to the people downstream detailed geometric and hydrologic conditions of the baige landslide dam are shown in table 1 in addition after the formation of the second baige landslide dam two water level observation stations were set 3 km upstream and downstream of the dam site by the hydrology bureau of sichuan province which cooperated with other existing hydrological stations on the jinsha river to monitor the inflow breach flow and the variations in water level in the dammed lake zhong et al 2020 adequate field monitoring data of the second baige landslide dam is beneficial to numerical simulation and make the comparison between the simulated and measured results the second landslide dam was composed of about 8 5 million m3 debris with a length of 2 1 km along the river valley a width of 700 m across the river valley a height of 96 141 m and a lake volume of 790 million m3 liu et al 2021 the average inflow rate was about 850 m3 s chen et al 2020a b similar to the emergency strategy for mitigating the potential risk of the tangjiashan landslide dam an artificial diversion channel was excavated with a length of 350 m which had a basal elevation and with of 2952 50 m and 3 m and a side slope of 1 3 liu et al 2021 fig 2 c the bottom of the diversion channel was overtopped at 04 45 a m on 12 november and the outflow rate at the dam site increased with time the outflow reached the peak as 31 000 m3 s at 18 00p m on 13 november which reverted to the base flow at 08 00 a m on 14 november the total breach duration is over 50 h the outflow and stage hydrographs were reported by zhong et al 2020 by site investigation zhang et al 2019 found that the top layer of the landslide debris was loose gravelly sand while the bottom and the majority of the dam body consisted of weathered plagioclase gneiss prone to decomposition the input parameters of the numerical simulation for the baige landslide dam are presented in table 2 according to the grain size distributions for the soils at various elevations presented by zhang et al 2019 three layers of the deposit in depth are considered in the numerical model as shown in table 3 3 2 comparison between the numerical and the measured results 3 2 1 tangjiashan landslide dam the duration of the numerical simulation of the tangjiashan landslide dam failure is 14 h with the initial time at 6 00 a m and the termination time at 20 00p m on june 10 the calculated results are compared with the measured data shown in fig 3 7 which contain changes of the outflow discharge the lake level the velocity the average width and the bottom elevation of the breach the predictions of both the average width and bottom elevation of the breach are in good agreement with the measurements as shown in fig 3 the breach bottom elevation from the numerical model gradually decreases to 719 99 m at t 7 3 h and then keeps unchanged as the bed shear stress is smaller than the critical shear stress of soil a very small erosion is observed in the field from about t 12 h resulting in a further decrease in the bottom elevation accordingly the breach width gradually increases to 144 0 m at t 7 3 h and then keeps constant fig 4 the measured value for the final breach width is 145 m with a relatively small error of 0 7 since the instability and collapse of breach two sides are not considered in the model the simulated breach width increases smoothly without any sudden changes while the increase of actual breach width may experience abrupt changes the calculated peak discharge is 6 725 m3 s while the measured peak outflow is 6 500 m3 s with a relative error of only 3 5 fig 5 the arrival of the peak discharge from the numerical model is 48 min later than that measured in the field with a relative error of 12 3 the reason for the time delay might be a slightly larger value of m the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom which lead to a smaller water head at the breach bottom and a delay in the arrival time of the peak discharge as shown in fig 6 the variation of the lake level with the time is captured well by the model except for the little deviation of the numerical result from the measurement from t 12 h due to the small erosion that was neglected in the numerical approach significant discrepancy between the calculated and measured velocities in the breach is found in the ascending branch while the difference is inapparent in the descending branch fig 7 it is indicated that the hydrodynamic process is described very well by the numerical model while the coupled solution for the process of soil erosion and hydrodynamics should be improved meanwhile the observed average flow velocity is obtained by multiplying the measured surface flow velocity by a constant correction factor of 0 73 liu et al 2010 in the velocity rising stage where the boundary of flow changes sharply it is worth discussing whether it is appropriate to establish the relationship between the observed average flow velocity and the surface flow velocity of a cross section by using the constant correction coefficient of 0 73 it is seen from fig 5 that the predicted peak outflow rate from the db nhri model is 6 737 m3 s with a relative error of only 3 6 and the db iwhr model provides a peak outflow rate of 7 640 m3 s with a relative error of 17 5 the peak outflow rates and the rising stages calculated from both models arrive earlier than the measured value fig 6 shows that the lake level produced by the db iwhr model descends faster and becomes lower than the observed values with time it may be resulted from the assumption of constant critical shear stress along the dam depth in the db iwhr model which also causes a quicker incision a deeper breach depth and a larger outflow velocity as shown in fig 3 and fig 7 3 2 2 baige landslide dam the duration of the numerical simulation of the baige landslide dam failure is 14 h which started at 12 00 a m on november 13 and ended at 2 00 a m on november 14 the comparisons are conducted between the calculated erosion rate the breach geometry the outflow discharge and the lake level with the measured results fig 8 illustrates the erodibility of baige landslide dam by using the linear erosion model the hyperbolic erosion model and the proposed arctangent erosion model respectively the coefficient for the linear erosion model is a 368 mm3 ns that was adopted by zhong et al 2020 for the back analysis of breaching process of baige landslide dam the hyperbolic model proposed by chen et al 2020a b is used with coefficients of c 1 1 and d 0 00038 the arctangent erosion model proposed in this study is used with the erodibility coefficient of α 0 0004 experimental investigations of the erosion rate with soil shear stress of the baige landslide dam materials were conducted by a cylindrical erosion test apparatus ceta chen et al 2020a b results show that the erosion rate increases rapidly for small shear stresses i e τ 45 pa and then slows down as soil shear stress increases which indicates that soil should not have unlimited strength against erosion it can be found that the erosion rate increases rapidly without a limit by using the linear erosion model however for the hyperbolic erosion model and the arctangent erosion model both of which can well predict the change of the erosion rate with the breach bed shear stress these two types of erosion models have asymptotic lines with the maximum possible erosion rate which can accurately capture the erosion rate even with large shear stresses at the breach bed and simulate the erosion process more realistically additionally since it is difficult to obtain material properties of landslide dams in time the arctangent erosion model with only one input parameter is easier and more convenient to be used the detailed process of the breach development in the field is not accessible while the top and bottom width of the final breach are observed as 264 1 m and 107 8 m with an arithmetic average value of 185 95 m and the final breach depth defined as the elevation difference between the landslide dam top and the final breach bottom is approximately 60 25 m zhong et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 the numerical result shows the breach width gradually rises to 191 48 m at t 7 39 h and then keeps constant the calculated value for the final breach width falls in the range between the top and the bottom breach width observed in the field with a relative error of 3 0 compared to the arithmetic average width the calculated breach depth increases to 56 95 m at t 7 39 h and then keeps constant a relative error of 5 5 is found between the numerical and measured values of the final breach depth fig 10 illustrates that the predicted outflow discharge agrees well with the observation in the field the calculated peak discharge is 29 209 m3 s while the measured peak flow is 31 000 m3 s and the relative error is 5 8 the arrival of the peak discharge from the numerical model is 10 min later than that measured in the field with a relative error of 2 8 from fig 11 it can be found that the simulated hydrography is in a good agreement with measured data as shown in fig 10 the db iwhr model predicts the ascending stage of the outflow rate very well with the peak flow rate of qp 31 041 m3 s and a relative error of only 0 1 however it overestimates the descending stage of outburst flow which may be caused by lack of consideration of changes in soil shear stress along the dam height for landslide dams the erosion resistance normally increases along the depth and soil strength becomes largest at the dam bottom where large rocks and gravels are deposited since soil strength is assumed to be the same for the baige landslide dam by using the db iwhr model the shear stress of the dam bottom is significantly underestimated which results in excessive incision of the breach and an obviously larger outflow discharge the results are also consistent with the stage hydrograph of the db iwhr model as shown in fig 11 the predicted stage hydrograph agrees well with the measured data in the first eight hours but significantly lower than the observation since t 8 h this may be caused by underestimating of soil shear stress at the lower part of the dam which leads to additional overcutting of the breach for the db nhri model the arrival time of outflow discharge seems delay in comparison to the measured outflow data and the predicted peak flow rate is 28 613 m3 s with a relative error of 7 7 the stage hydrograph provided by the db nhri model shows a good agreement with the measured data however the db nhri model uses a linear erosion model to describe the breach geometry process which considers the soil shear stress of the entire dam as a constant thus in order to obtain a realistic and reasonable result the final breach depth has to be predefined if the predefined breach depth differs greatly from the real breach depth the simulation results will be different 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of numerical results for homogeneous and heterogeneous dams several observations in the field prove that the property of landslide deposit varies along the depth resulting in variations in soil erodibility dunning 2006 evans et al 2007 chang et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the heterogeneousness of the deposit is considered in this presented numerical model to evaluate the impact of variation of soil erodibility on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph numerical simulations on homogeneous landslide dams are conducted to make a comparison both the tangjiashan and the baige landslide dams are simulated while only the results of the tangjiashan landslide dam are presented here since similar findings are found in both the two landslide dams for simplicity the soil property of the first layer is applied in the whole deposit of the tangjiashan landslide dam as shown in fig 12 the soil erosion continuously developed for the homogeneous dam while the erosion in the heterogeneous dam stopped as the soil anti erodibility i e critical shear stress increase along the depth for the homogeneous dam the final bottom elevation of the breach is 701 53 m at the time t 16 3 h resulting in a breach depth of 38 47 m which is about twice of the breach depth for the heterogeneous dam i e 20 00 m accordingly the breach enlargement for the homogeneous condition expands to a width of 262 2 m which is 1 8 times larger than that in the heterogeneous condition b 144 0 m the lake level descends further with the downcut of the breach bottom leading to a final drop of 40 59 m in the lake level for the homogeneous dam which is as 1 9 times as that in the heterogeneous dam the stage hydrograph of the outflow discharge becomes fatter in the homogeneous dam implying that more water is drained from the lake due to the lower breach bottom it may be concluded from the comparison with field measurements that numerical models without considering the heterogeneousness of landslide dam materials will predict the breach development and the outflow hydrograph unreasonable the proposed model in this study can effectively predict the entire breach process with a special consideration of different soil erodibility along the dam depth the model performance can be further improved with more detailed and accessible information of the landslide dam materials 4 2 sensitivity analysis the proposed model involves three parameters associated with three physical processes namely the broad crested weir flow the soil erosion and the lateral enlargement of breach respectively in this section sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the influence of the three parameters on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph by using the data of the tangjiashan landslide dam additionally a numerical scheme is used to discretize the mathematical equations contained in the proposed landslide dam break model which adopts a velocity step δv rather than the widely used time step δt in the conventional numerical methods e g fread 1988 singh et al 1988 zhong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore the calculated results with different δv are compared to verify the rigour and accuracy of the numerical solution 4 2 1 influence of the parameter related to the broad crested weir flow formula the parameter related to the broad crested weir flow formula i e m is approximately regarded as the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom which is vital for evaluating the outflow hydrograph three different values of m namely m 0 75 0 80 and 0 90 are considered to calculate the breach development and the associated outflow hydrograph the adopted value m for simulating the tangjiashan landslide dam in the previous section of results is 0 85 the variations of the breach bottom elevation with time for the tangjiashan landslide dam are presented in fig 13 a the vertical incision of the breach is faster when the value of m decreases the reason is that the drop of the potential energy is larger when the value of m is smaller resulting in larger kinetic energy of flow in the breach which has a larger scouring capability the final breach bottom elevation with m 0 80 is close to each other however when m 0 80 the final breach bottom elevation is notably sensitive to the value of m and a smaller m produces a lower final bottom elevation this is because that the bed shear stress acted by the flow for m 0 75 exceeds the critical shear stress at the breach bottom which led to a further soil erosion as a result the final breach width is not sensitive to the value of m when m 0 80 for m 0 80 the duration of breach enlargement process increases with the decrease of m leading to a larger final breach width fig 13 b the outflow hydrograph with different values of m of the tangjiashan landslide dam is shown in fig 13 c it can be found that the rising stage delays and the whole outflow hydrograph becomes slimmer when the value of m increases the peak outflow rate slightly declines while the corresponding arrival time becomes later with the increase of m the level variation of the landslide lake is presented in fig 13 d the lake level is sensitive to the value of m when m 0 80 the final lake level is notably lower when m becomes smaller due to a lower elevation of the breach bottom the results of the four key breaching parameters i e the peak outflow rate qp and its arrival time tp the final breach width bf and the final erosion depth df corresponding to different m are presented in table 4 when m 0 80 the relative differences among the results for the four key parameters are all in the range of 10 particularly for the most crucial parameter of the peak outflow rate the relative difference is even smaller than 5 indicating the model is not sensitive to m and it is beneficial for practical application 4 2 2 influence of the parameter related to the arctangent erosion model the parameter related to the arctangent erosion model i e α directly affects the vertical erosion rate of breach bottom which plays an important role in the downcutting process of the breach bottom the parameter α is multiplied by 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 to assess its influence on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph the evolution of the breach bottom elevation with different erodibility coefficients is shown in fig 14 a it is seen that the downcutting process of the breach bottom is faster with the decrease of the erodibility coefficient α the final elevation of the breach bottom is not sensitive to α as the bed shear stress does not exceed the critical value a similar condition occurs for the breach enlargement as presented in fig 14 b the breach width increases quicker when the erodibility coefficient reduces similarly the final breach width is not sensitive to the erodibility coefficients considered in the analysis as the result of a slower breach undercutting and enlargement process the ascending stage takes place later and the discharge hydrograph become fatter with an increase of the erodibility coefficient α as shown in fig 14 c the peak discharge decreases significantly and its arrival time delays with a larger erodibility coefficient fig 14 d shows that the impact of the erodibility coefficient on the lake level is similar to that on the breach bottom the lake level drops faster with a smaller erodibility coefficient and the final values of the lake level corresponding to different erodibility coefficients are close to each other it can be concluded that the erodibility coefficient significantly affects the breach development the outflow discharge and the stage hydrography which especially influences the peak outflow rate and its arrival time however the final breach geometry i e bf and df and the lake level at the final stage are not sensitive to the erodibility coefficient as shown in table 4 4 2 3 influence of the parameter related to the lateral enlargement model the parameter related to the lateral enlargement model β directly impacts the evolution of the breach width the parameter β is multiplied by 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 to assess its influence on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph the evolution of breach bottom elevation with different lateral enlargement rates is shown in fig 15 a it can be found that the downcutting of the breach bottom is almost independent on the lateral enlargement rate the breach extends faster with a larger lateral enlargement rate and has a greater final width as presented in fig 15 b the influence of lateral enlargement rate on the outflow discharge is not significant fig 15 c the discharge hydrograph only delays slightly with a smaller lateral enlargement rate while the peak discharge increases a little the impacts of the lateral enlargement rate on the stage hydrograph is not remarkable and the final lake levels are close to each other as presented in fig 15 d in general the lateral enlargement rate does not significantly influence the outflow discharge and the stage hydrography which only affects the breach width obviously table 4 4 2 4 influence of the velocity step the breach of the tangjiashan landslide dam is simulated with four different velocity steps that cross two orders of magnitude i e δv 0 01 0 005 0 001 and 0 0001 m s to verify the rigour and accuracy of the numerical solution it can be found that though the velocity steps vary in a wide range the simulated results almost coincide with each other indicting insensitivity of the proposed dam breach model more detailed information of the sensitivity analysis of the four key parameters i e qp tp bf df with different δv can be referred to table 4 since the proposed dam breach model is insensitive to the velocity step it is beneficial and convenient for predicting landslide dam overtopping 5 conclusions in this study a numerical model is established to simulate the breach process of a landslide dam and the resultant outburst flood which includes the outflow hydrograph model and the breach geometry evolution model the present study proposes an arctangent erosion model for describing the vertical incision of the breach which has an asymptote of the ultimate erosion rate for avoiding overestimation of the soil erosion from the application of baige landslide dam it can be found that both the hyperbolic and the arctangent erosion model can well predict changes of the erosion rate of the dam accumulations while the linear erosion model gives an infinitely increasing result in addition to the high accuracy the proposed arctangent erosion model has another advantage of simplicity with only one required input parameter which is particular suitable for landslide dams of high uncertainty and natural complexity moreover in this study soil characteristics of the deposit are considered individually in different layers for addressing the variations in soil erodibility along the depth the breach shape is considered as a rectangle for simplicity the numerical model was applied in the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam the simulated results were compared with the measured data in the field including the evolution of breach bottom and width the outflow hydrograph the elevation of lake level etc the simulated results are in good agreement with the observations especially for the peak discharge the relative errors between the predicted and the measured values are within 6 meanwhile the proposed numerical approach was compared with two widely used landslide dam break models i e the db nhri model and the da iwhr model the descending process of the lake level and the downcut of the breach are predicted better by the proposed approach this may be caused by the use of the arctangent erosion model and the consideration of soil property changes along the deposit depth moreover a comparison of the dam breach process for homogeneous and heterogeneous dams by using the proposed model was also conducted results show the importance of considering variations of soil properties along the depth both the erosion in the breach and the associated outflow hydrograph would be overestimated for the homogeneous dam without considering variations of soil erodibility along the depth a sensitivity analysis was further conducted for assessing the influence of four parameters on the breach evolution and the outflow hydrograph i e the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom m the erodibility coefficient α the lateral enlargement rate β and the velocity step δv results demonstrate that the downcut and the enlargement of the breach as well as the hydrographs are sensitive to m when m 0 80 a smaller value of α leads to a faster evolution of the breach geometry a quicker drop of the lake level and a larger peak outflow rate corresponded to an earlier arrival time nevertheless the final breach shape and the lake level are not remarkably sensitive to α the variation of β results in an insignificant change in the discharge the stage hydrograph and the breach bottom which only affects the breach width the numerical results are almost independent on the velocity step which varied across two orders of magnitude in this study credit authorship contribution statement bo wang

d z d 0 when the input of δ v i produces a value of δ z d i respectively it means that the increment of breach bottom elevation increases with the velocity interval the calculation process is normal when the signs of δ v i and δ z d i are opposite it is indicated that the increment of breach bottom elevation decreases with the velocity interval a negative value of δ v i should be used in the subsequent calculations when the velocity reaches the maximum as dv dzd 0 because of both the numerator and denominator approaching zero in eq a10 an abnormal value of δ z d i may be produced when the value of li falls in the range of 0 985 li 1 015 chen et al 2015 the velocity can be approximated by expansion in the power series if only first three terms remain a13 v i v max d v d z d δ z d i 1 2 d 2 v d z d 2 δ z d i 2 v max 1 2 d 2 v d z d 2 δ z d i 2 rearrangement of eq a13 yields a14 δ z d i 2 v i v max d 2 v d z d 2 2 δ v i d 2 v d z d 2 the time step is obtained by a15 δ t i δ w i δ z s

3403,the damages caused by the breach of landslide dams can be mitigated by making an emergency plan based on the fast and accurate forecast of the resultant outburst floods this study proposed an advanced physically based breach model which can effectively predict the breach evolution and the outflow hydrograph variations of soil erodibility along the dam depth are specially considered in this model to avoid infinite occurrence of soil erosion an arctangent erosion model is proposed to calculate the erosion rate two advantages of which against the existing erosion models are demonstrated better representation of the erosion process and simplified requirement of only one input parameter the rate of the breach lateral enlargement is considered to vary along the depth and the breach shape is regarded as a rectangle the breach model is applied in two case studies of the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam the predictions of breaching geometric parameters and the outflow hydrographic parameters agree well with the field observations comparing with the two widely used landslide dam break models the proposed numerical method predicts changes of the lake level and the breach bottom more accurately results also prove the importance and necessity of considering soil erodibility along the dam depth moreover sensitivity analysis is also conducted it can be found that the parameter related to the arctangent erosion model significantly affects the breach evolution and the associated outflow hydrograph while the influences of the broad crested weir flow formula and the lateral enlargement rate is not that obvious the numerical results are not sensitive to the velocity step adopted in the numerical scheme facilitating the application of the model in

dam breach may cause huge casualties and property losses in the downstream area for instance the failures of three landslide dams formed during the 1933 diexi earthquake in sichuan province of china caused a loss of about 2 500 lives nie et al 2004 the potential breach of the tangjiashan landslide dam induced by the 2008 wenchuan earthquake in china threatened 1 2 million people downstream and led to evacuation of 275 000 people liu et al 2010 more recently the flooding caused by the 2018 baige landslide dam in tibet of china seriously damaged infrastructures within 500 km of the downstream jinsha river such as bridges highways housing zhang et al 2020 it is extremely important to predict the potential breach of landslide dams which can provide tools for disaster management and help to make appropriate engineering risk mitigation plans the modelling of landslide dam breach has been extensively explored which can be generally divided into parametric based models e g costa 1985 costa and schuster 1988 walder and o connor 1997 peng and zhang 2012 wang et al 2016a b ruan et al 2021 and physically based models e g fread 1984 fread 1988 chang and zhang 2010 peng et al 2014 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020a b xue et al 2021 parametric based models are normally developed by statistical regression analysis based on historical data of landslide dam failures which use control variables i e dam height lake volume dam shape etc to derive the breach parameters i e breach geometry breach duration peak flow rate etc although parametric based models are a quick way to predict the breach parameters for landslide dams they are developed based on limited available historical data with characteristics of highly variable and subjective nature moreover the parametric based model cannot predict the entire process of dam breach which can only give specific values of breach parameters such as peak flow rate breach width breach time etc therefore great efforts have been made to establish physically based models which can give a better understanding of dam breach mechanisms the physically based model incorporates principles of hydraulics soil mechanics sediment transport and slope stability which can simulate the whole dam breach process and obtain the associated outflow hydrograph breach is an early proposed physically based model for homogeneous earth dams fread 1984 fread 1988 which simulated the flow into the breach channel by using the broad crested weir flow equation the evolution of breach width is modelled by slope stability analysis of the breach side slope which changed from rectangle to trapezoid however by using breach an initial value of the final breach depth should be assumed and the erosion along the sides and bottom of the breach channel is assumed to be equal more recently many new landslide dam break models have been developed most of which contributed to better quantify the breaching process of a landslide dam zhong et al 2018 proposed the db nhri landslide dam break model which can well simulate the flattening process of downstream slope however this model adopted a linear shear stress equation proposed by graf 1984 to determine the bed erosion rate which may lead to excessive incision of the breach similarly this linear shear stress equation was also used in the daba model by chang and zhang 2010 improvements were made in determining two key parameters of the linear shear stress equation i e the critical erosive stress and the coefficient of erodibility by considering additional factors influencing soil erodibility based on filed experiments such as d50 void ratio plasticity index etc shi et al 2015 modified the daba model to simulate the cascade breaching of landslide dams by setting the inflow rate as a time related variable instead of piecewise constant values since the erodibility of landslide accumulations is one of the key parameters governing the breach process chen et al 2015 developed the db iwhr landslide dam break model and proposed a hyperbolic formula for characterizing the erosion rate along the depth which can effectively avoid over erosion of the breach although physically based models have been developing rapidly there remains a recognized need to improve models particularly for landslide dams which are composed of heterogenous soils with various erodibility the breach process of landslide dams is highly affected by interactions between dam materials and inflow thus in this study an advanced physically based model is proposed which simulates the dam breach process with a special consideration of different soil erodibility along the dam depth an arctangent erosion model with an asymptote is established to describe the vertical incision of dam breach process which limits the infinite increase of erosion rate and effectively avoids overestimating soil erodibility moreover fewer input parameters for the arctangent erosion model are required which is more suitable for landslide dams with limited available information the proposed model is applied to the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam for verification and the results show that the new proposed model improved the prediction of landslide dams breaching 2 methods the breaching development of landslide dams is a soil erosion process coupled with a hydrodynamic process both of which need to be modeled 2 1 outflow hydrograph the difference between the inflow from the upstream river and the outflow through the breach equals to the change in the water volume of the barrier lake which is calculated by the surface area multiplied by the rising or descending rate of the lake level formulating the balance relationship yields 1 d w d t q in q b where w is the volume of the lake t is the time qin is the inflow rate qb is the breach flow the volume of the barrier lake can be estimated by the quadratic equation with a few measured data in the field e g chen et al 2015 2020a b 2 w a 1 z s z s r 2 b 1 z s z s r c 1 10 6 where a 1 b 1 c 1 are coefficients in the fitting formula of the lake volume which can be determined by the relation of lake surface elevation and lake capacity zs is the water level in the lake z s r is the benchmark water level the differential of w respect to zs is obtained 3 d w d z s 2 a 1 z s z s r b 1 10 6 substituting eq 3 in eq 1 yields 4 q b q in d w d z s d z s d t q in 2 a 1 z s z s r b 1 d z s d t 10 6 the outflow through the breach is considered as a broad crested weir flow that is widely used in the breach models of landslide dams e g chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 the discharge is a function of the head above the breach bottom 5 q b c b z s z d 3 2 where c is the discharge coefficient that is determined from the literatures e g singh and scarlatos 1988 chen et al 2015 or by calibrations b is the breach width z d is the elevation of breach bottom the mean flow velocity in the breach is produced as 6 v c h z s z d 3 2 the water depth in the breach can be determined by the manning s formula fread 1988 singh et al 1988 7 h n q b b j 0 5 0 6 where n is the manning s coefficient j is the hydraulic slope substituting eq 5 in eq 7 yields 8 h m z s z d 0 9 m z s z d in the above approximation proposed by chen et al 2015 m is the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom which can be defined as 9 m n 0 6 c 0 6 j 0 3 chen et al 2015 suggested a range of m between 0 8 and 0 9 substituting eq 8 in eq 6 yields 10 v c m 1 z s z d 1 2 2 2 breach geometry evolution compared with the man made homogeneous earthen dams landslide dams are composed of mixed materials with a wide range of particle sizes from large rocks mainly with its original structure to completely weathered rocks and to soils with tree roots liu et al 2010 most landslide dams have a relatively large volume of debris materials with a large ratio of length to width costa and schuster 1988 showing characteristics of spatial heterogeneous broadly gradation and low degree of compaction dunning 2006 evans et al 2007 chang et al 2011 based on the inherent characteristics of landslide dams the analysis of dam breach usually involves complicated process of soil erosion and breach geometry development the erodibility of landslide deposit is one of the dominant factors that control the erosion process of a landslide dam under the same condition high soil erodibility will yield a larger breach size a shorter breach duration and a larger peak discharge to incorporate the soil erodibility in the breach model a large number of empirical equations have been proposed to relate the erosion rate of breach bottom to the shear stress which can be approximately divided into two categories namely power law models e g roberts et al 1998 gaucher et al 2010 and hyperbolic models e g chen et al 2015 wang et al 2016a b power law models take the following form 11 d z d d t a τ b τ c b where dzd dt is the erosion rate of breach bottom a and b are coefficients regressed from experimental results τb is the breach bed shear stress and τc is the critical shear stress of soil a simplification of eq 11 i e b 1 has been used widely e g chang and zhang 2010 peng et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 chen et al 2020a b which is also known as the linear erosion model however the power law model may yield unlimited strength against erosion thus a hyperbolic model is recently developed e g chen et al 2015 liu et al 2021 as expressed in the following form 12 d z d d t τ b τ c 0 01 c d τ b τ c where c and d are coefficients regressed from experimental results the hyperbolic model has an asymptote of 1 d as the breach bed shear stress approaches infinity avoiding unlimited erosion however the determination of the two coefficients in the hyperbolic expression is difficult especially for the predicted peak discharge which is very sensitive to the coefficient in this study an arctangent erosion model is proposed based on results of the erodibility experiment of the baige landslide dam materials from chen et al 2020a b which is presented as 13 d z d d t 1 1 9 α a r c tan τ b τ c τ 0 where α is the erodibility coefficient which indicates that the maximum erosion rate of breach bottom approaches π 3 8α and the value of α can be determined according to chen et al 2015 τ 0 is a referenced shear stress τ 0 25 pa by using the proposed arctangent erosion model only one parameter of α is needed which is particular suitable for landslide dam materials of high uncertainty and natural complexity however since the available experimental date of landslide dam erodibility is very limited more experiments on soil erodibility are supposed to be conducted in the future to calibrate the proposed arctangent erosion model though the measured value of τc is preferred it is difficult to timely obtain the critical shear stress of landslide dam materials thus empirical equations are widely used to estimate τc in this study the formula proposed by annandale 2006 is adopted to estimate soil critical shear stress e g chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 14 τ c 2 3 g d 50 ρ s ρ w tan φ where g is the gravitational acceleration ρw is the water density ρs is the density of soil particles φ is the friction angle and d 50 is the mean particle size field tests show that the soil bulk density increases with the deposition depth chang et al 2011 and coarse rocks are usually buried under the median gravels and soils hsu and hsu 2009 indicating that the critical shear stress increases along the depth the shear stress acting on the breach bed is determined from the calculated flow depth and the mean velocity by using the manning s equation 15 τ b ρ w g n 2 v 2 r 1 3 ρ w g n 2 v 2 h 1 3 where v is the mean velocity in the breach r is the hydraulic radius approximated by the water depth in the breach h the evolution of the breach geometry in a dam break includes the vertical incision characterized by eq 13 and the lateral enlargement the erosion rates along the two directions are often not uniform because the shear stress acting on the breach bottom and side slopes are different the breach shape is commonly represented by a trapezoid or quasi trapezoid e g chang and zhang 2010 chen et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 for simplicity and convenience the breach geometry is assumed as a rectangle in this study as shown in fig 1 the average breach width bi is calculated by the following expression 16 b i b 1 β z d 1 z d i where b 1 is the initial breach width β is the lateral enlargement rate that varies along different deposit layers as presented in fig 1 z d i is the breach bottom elevation at the i step z d 1 is the initial elevation of breach bottom relations for the initial velocity water depth bottom elevation and lake level are expressed as follows 17 z s 1 z d 1 m v 1 c 2 18 h 1 m z s 1 z d 1 when any two of the aforementioned parameters are known the others can be obtained this study adopted a straightforward calculation method without iteration to obtain the lake level the bottom elevation and the mean velocity in the breach chen et al 2015 the method starts from an initial velocity with an interval and then computes the increments of the aforementioned three parameters detailed calculation process is presented in appendixes a and b 3 results in order to verify the robustness of the landslide dam break model developed in this study and improvement of the presented model on the accuracy against the other widely used models i e the db iwhr model developed by chen et al 2015 2020a b and the db nhri model developed by zhong et al 2018 2020 two case studies of the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam are adopted to make a comparison in detail meanwhile advantages of the proposed arctangent erosion model are also illustrated in the case of the baige landslide dam 3 1 study sites 3 1 1 case 1 tangjiashan landslide dam the location of the tangjiashan landslide dam is shown in fig 2 a as the largest one of the 257 landslide dams cui et al 2009 formed during the wenchuan earthquake in china on 12 may 2018 tangjiashan landslide dam was made of about 24 37 million m3 rock debris with a length of 803 m along the river valley a width of 611 m across the river valley a height of 82 124 m and an actual lake volume of 238 million m3 it blocked the jianjiang river and the daily average inflow rate into the lake during the emergency mitigation period was measured to be about 80 90 m3 s from the tangjiashan gauge station liu et al 2010 more detailed information of the tangjiashan landslide dam can refer to table 1 to mitigate potential hazards to residents in the downstream cities a diversion channel was excavated with a length of 475 m fig 2 b it had an inlet bed elevation of 740 00 m with a side slope of 1 1 5 and a width of 8 m and an outlet bed elevation of 739 00 m with a side slope of 1 1 35 and a width of 10 m wang et al 2015 the erosion of the diversion channel started at 6 00 a m with a lake level of 742 16 m and virtually terminated at 20 00p m with a lake level of 719 48 m on june 10 accordingly the channel bottom elevation at the entrance is lowered from 740 00 m to about 715 m a peak outflow rate was observed as 6 500 m3 s at 12 30p m a variety of techniques was employed by the government to measure the hydraulic condition during the dam breaching the reservoir water level was obtained by an automatic hydro gauge station connected to china s beidou compass navigation satellite system the surface velocity near the entrance of the breach was monitored by using a decatur radar surface velocity radar svr laser hydrometer the width of the water surface was measured by using a nikon laser 800s range finder and the average flow depth was measured by an s48 1 ultrasonic wave depth measurement instrument fixed by a rod liu et al 2010 the outflow hydrographs the variations of lake level and mean velocity the breach depth and width with time were all reported in the literatures liu et al 2010 chen et al 2015 the profile of the landslide deposit along the breach channel showed that the dam was mainly composed of rocks with gravel and sand which were buried by silty sand gravel with cobbles chang and zhang 2010 the dam material in the top layer was relatively finer than that in the bottom layer the input parameters of the numerical simulation for the tangjiashan landslide dam are presented in table 2 according to the grain size distributions of the dam materials along the depth chang and zhang 2010 three layers of the deposit in depth are considered in the numerical model as shown in table 3 3 1 2 case 2 baige landslide dam the location of the baige landslide dam is shown in fig 2 a two landslides took place almost at the same location at baige village in tibet of china on 10 october 2018 and 3 november 2018 respectively both of which dammed the jinsha river and formed two landslide dams the second landslide debris filled the breach channel formed during the first dam failure in this study the second landslide dam is chosen to be investigated since it has a larger height and a larger lake volume which posed a greater threat to the people downstream detailed geometric and hydrologic conditions of the baige landslide dam are shown in table 1 in addition after the formation of the second baige landslide dam two water level observation stations were set 3 km upstream and downstream of the dam site by the hydrology bureau of sichuan province which cooperated with other existing hydrological stations on the jinsha river to monitor the inflow breach flow and the variations in water level in the dammed lake zhong et al 2020 adequate field monitoring data of the second baige landslide dam is beneficial to numerical simulation and make the comparison between the simulated and measured results the second landslide dam was composed of about 8 5 million m3 debris with a length of 2 1 km along the river valley a width of 700 m across the river valley a height of 96 141 m and a lake volume of 790 million m3 liu et al 2021 the average inflow rate was about 850 m3 s chen et al 2020a b similar to the emergency strategy for mitigating the potential risk of the tangjiashan landslide dam an artificial diversion channel was excavated with a length of 350 m which had a basal elevation and with of 2952 50 m and 3 m and a side slope of 1 3 liu et al 2021 fig 2 c the bottom of the diversion channel was overtopped at 04 45 a m on 12 november and the outflow rate at the dam site increased with time the outflow reached the peak as 31 000 m3 s at 18 00p m on 13 november which reverted to the base flow at 08 00 a m on 14 november the total breach duration is over 50 h the outflow and stage hydrographs were reported by zhong et al 2020 by site investigation zhang et al 2019 found that the top layer of the landslide debris was loose gravelly sand while the bottom and the majority of the dam body consisted of weathered plagioclase gneiss prone to decomposition the input parameters of the numerical simulation for the baige landslide dam are presented in table 2 according to the grain size distributions for the soils at various elevations presented by zhang et al 2019 three layers of the deposit in depth are considered in the numerical model as shown in table 3 3 2 comparison between the numerical and the measured results 3 2 1 tangjiashan landslide dam the duration of the numerical simulation of the tangjiashan landslide dam failure is 14 h with the initial time at 6 00 a m and the termination time at 20 00p m on june 10 the calculated results are compared with the measured data shown in fig 3 7 which contain changes of the outflow discharge the lake level the velocity the average width and the bottom elevation of the breach the predictions of both the average width and bottom elevation of the breach are in good agreement with the measurements as shown in fig 3 the breach bottom elevation from the numerical model gradually decreases to 719 99 m at t 7 3 h and then keeps unchanged as the bed shear stress is smaller than the critical shear stress of soil a very small erosion is observed in the field from about t 12 h resulting in a further decrease in the bottom elevation accordingly the breach width gradually increases to 144 0 m at t 7 3 h and then keeps constant fig 4 the measured value for the final breach width is 145 m with a relatively small error of 0 7 since the instability and collapse of breach two sides are not considered in the model the simulated breach width increases smoothly without any sudden changes while the increase of actual breach width may experience abrupt changes the calculated peak discharge is 6 725 m3 s while the measured peak outflow is 6 500 m3 s with a relative error of only 3 5 fig 5 the arrival of the peak discharge from the numerical model is 48 min later than that measured in the field with a relative error of 12 3 the reason for the time delay might be a slightly larger value of m the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom which lead to a smaller water head at the breach bottom and a delay in the arrival time of the peak discharge as shown in fig 6 the variation of the lake level with the time is captured well by the model except for the little deviation of the numerical result from the measurement from t 12 h due to the small erosion that was neglected in the numerical approach significant discrepancy between the calculated and measured velocities in the breach is found in the ascending branch while the difference is inapparent in the descending branch fig 7 it is indicated that the hydrodynamic process is described very well by the numerical model while the coupled solution for the process of soil erosion and hydrodynamics should be improved meanwhile the observed average flow velocity is obtained by multiplying the measured surface flow velocity by a constant correction factor of 0 73 liu et al 2010 in the velocity rising stage where the boundary of flow changes sharply it is worth discussing whether it is appropriate to establish the relationship between the observed average flow velocity and the surface flow velocity of a cross section by using the constant correction coefficient of 0 73 it is seen from fig 5 that the predicted peak outflow rate from the db nhri model is 6 737 m3 s with a relative error of only 3 6 and the db iwhr model provides a peak outflow rate of 7 640 m3 s with a relative error of 17 5 the peak outflow rates and the rising stages calculated from both models arrive earlier than the measured value fig 6 shows that the lake level produced by the db iwhr model descends faster and becomes lower than the observed values with time it may be resulted from the assumption of constant critical shear stress along the dam depth in the db iwhr model which also causes a quicker incision a deeper breach depth and a larger outflow velocity as shown in fig 3 and fig 7 3 2 2 baige landslide dam the duration of the numerical simulation of the baige landslide dam failure is 14 h which started at 12 00 a m on november 13 and ended at 2 00 a m on november 14 the comparisons are conducted between the calculated erosion rate the breach geometry the outflow discharge and the lake level with the measured results fig 8 illustrates the erodibility of baige landslide dam by using the linear erosion model the hyperbolic erosion model and the proposed arctangent erosion model respectively the coefficient for the linear erosion model is a 368 mm3 ns that was adopted by zhong et al 2020 for the back analysis of breaching process of baige landslide dam the hyperbolic model proposed by chen et al 2020a b is used with coefficients of c 1 1 and d 0 00038 the arctangent erosion model proposed in this study is used with the erodibility coefficient of α 0 0004 experimental investigations of the erosion rate with soil shear stress of the baige landslide dam materials were conducted by a cylindrical erosion test apparatus ceta chen et al 2020a b results show that the erosion rate increases rapidly for small shear stresses i e τ 45 pa and then slows down as soil shear stress increases which indicates that soil should not have unlimited strength against erosion it can be found that the erosion rate increases rapidly without a limit by using the linear erosion model however for the hyperbolic erosion model and the arctangent erosion model both of which can well predict the change of the erosion rate with the breach bed shear stress these two types of erosion models have asymptotic lines with the maximum possible erosion rate which can accurately capture the erosion rate even with large shear stresses at the breach bed and simulate the erosion process more realistically additionally since it is difficult to obtain material properties of landslide dams in time the arctangent erosion model with only one input parameter is easier and more convenient to be used the detailed process of the breach development in the field is not accessible while the top and bottom width of the final breach are observed as 264 1 m and 107 8 m with an arithmetic average value of 185 95 m and the final breach depth defined as the elevation difference between the landslide dam top and the final breach bottom is approximately 60 25 m zhong et al 2020 as shown in fig 9 the numerical result shows the breach width gradually rises to 191 48 m at t 7 39 h and then keeps constant the calculated value for the final breach width falls in the range between the top and the bottom breach width observed in the field with a relative error of 3 0 compared to the arithmetic average width the calculated breach depth increases to 56 95 m at t 7 39 h and then keeps constant a relative error of 5 5 is found between the numerical and measured values of the final breach depth fig 10 illustrates that the predicted outflow discharge agrees well with the observation in the field the calculated peak discharge is 29 209 m3 s while the measured peak flow is 31 000 m3 s and the relative error is 5 8 the arrival of the peak discharge from the numerical model is 10 min later than that measured in the field with a relative error of 2 8 from fig 11 it can be found that the simulated hydrography is in a good agreement with measured data as shown in fig 10 the db iwhr model predicts the ascending stage of the outflow rate very well with the peak flow rate of qp 31 041 m3 s and a relative error of only 0 1 however it overestimates the descending stage of outburst flow which may be caused by lack of consideration of changes in soil shear stress along the dam height for landslide dams the erosion resistance normally increases along the depth and soil strength becomes largest at the dam bottom where large rocks and gravels are deposited since soil strength is assumed to be the same for the baige landslide dam by using the db iwhr model the shear stress of the dam bottom is significantly underestimated which results in excessive incision of the breach and an obviously larger outflow discharge the results are also consistent with the stage hydrograph of the db iwhr model as shown in fig 11 the predicted stage hydrograph agrees well with the measured data in the first eight hours but significantly lower than the observation since t 8 h this may be caused by underestimating of soil shear stress at the lower part of the dam which leads to additional overcutting of the breach for the db nhri model the arrival time of outflow discharge seems delay in comparison to the measured outflow data and the predicted peak flow rate is 28 613 m3 s with a relative error of 7 7 the stage hydrograph provided by the db nhri model shows a good agreement with the measured data however the db nhri model uses a linear erosion model to describe the breach geometry process which considers the soil shear stress of the entire dam as a constant thus in order to obtain a realistic and reasonable result the final breach depth has to be predefined if the predefined breach depth differs greatly from the real breach depth the simulation results will be different 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of numerical results for homogeneous and heterogeneous dams several observations in the field prove that the property of landslide deposit varies along the depth resulting in variations in soil erodibility dunning 2006 evans et al 2007 chang et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the heterogeneousness of the deposit is considered in this presented numerical model to evaluate the impact of variation of soil erodibility on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph numerical simulations on homogeneous landslide dams are conducted to make a comparison both the tangjiashan and the baige landslide dams are simulated while only the results of the tangjiashan landslide dam are presented here since similar findings are found in both the two landslide dams for simplicity the soil property of the first layer is applied in the whole deposit of the tangjiashan landslide dam as shown in fig 12 the soil erosion continuously developed for the homogeneous dam while the erosion in the heterogeneous dam stopped as the soil anti erodibility i e critical shear stress increase along the depth for the homogeneous dam the final bottom elevation of the breach is 701 53 m at the time t 16 3 h resulting in a breach depth of 38 47 m which is about twice of the breach depth for the heterogeneous dam i e 20 00 m accordingly the breach enlargement for the homogeneous condition expands to a width of 262 2 m which is 1 8 times larger than that in the heterogeneous condition b 144 0 m the lake level descends further with the downcut of the breach bottom leading to a final drop of 40 59 m in the lake level for the homogeneous dam which is as 1 9 times as that in the heterogeneous dam the stage hydrograph of the outflow discharge becomes fatter in the homogeneous dam implying that more water is drained from the lake due to the lower breach bottom it may be concluded from the comparison with field measurements that numerical models without considering the heterogeneousness of landslide dam materials will predict the breach development and the outflow hydrograph unreasonable the proposed model in this study can effectively predict the entire breach process with a special consideration of different soil erodibility along the dam depth the model performance can be further improved with more detailed and accessible information of the landslide dam materials 4 2 sensitivity analysis the proposed model involves three parameters associated with three physical processes namely the broad crested weir flow the soil erosion and the lateral enlargement of breach respectively in this section sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the influence of the three parameters on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph by using the data of the tangjiashan landslide dam additionally a numerical scheme is used to discretize the mathematical equations contained in the proposed landslide dam break model which adopts a velocity step δv rather than the widely used time step δt in the conventional numerical methods e g fread 1988 singh et al 1988 zhong et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 therefore the calculated results with different δv are compared to verify the rigour and accuracy of the numerical solution 4 2 1 influence of the parameter related to the broad crested weir flow formula the parameter related to the broad crested weir flow formula i e m is approximately regarded as the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom which is vital for evaluating the outflow hydrograph three different values of m namely m 0 75 0 80 and 0 90 are considered to calculate the breach development and the associated outflow hydrograph the adopted value m for simulating the tangjiashan landslide dam in the previous section of results is 0 85 the variations of the breach bottom elevation with time for the tangjiashan landslide dam are presented in fig 13 a the vertical incision of the breach is faster when the value of m decreases the reason is that the drop of the potential energy is larger when the value of m is smaller resulting in larger kinetic energy of flow in the breach which has a larger scouring capability the final breach bottom elevation with m 0 80 is close to each other however when m 0 80 the final breach bottom elevation is notably sensitive to the value of m and a smaller m produces a lower final bottom elevation this is because that the bed shear stress acted by the flow for m 0 75 exceeds the critical shear stress at the breach bottom which led to a further soil erosion as a result the final breach width is not sensitive to the value of m when m 0 80 for m 0 80 the duration of breach enlargement process increases with the decrease of m leading to a larger final breach width fig 13 b the outflow hydrograph with different values of m of the tangjiashan landslide dam is shown in fig 13 c it can be found that the rising stage delays and the whole outflow hydrograph becomes slimmer when the value of m increases the peak outflow rate slightly declines while the corresponding arrival time becomes later with the increase of m the level variation of the landslide lake is presented in fig 13 d the lake level is sensitive to the value of m when m 0 80 the final lake level is notably lower when m becomes smaller due to a lower elevation of the breach bottom the results of the four key breaching parameters i e the peak outflow rate qp and its arrival time tp the final breach width bf and the final erosion depth df corresponding to different m are presented in table 4 when m 0 80 the relative differences among the results for the four key parameters are all in the range of 10 particularly for the most crucial parameter of the peak outflow rate the relative difference is even smaller than 5 indicating the model is not sensitive to m and it is beneficial for practical application 4 2 2 influence of the parameter related to the arctangent erosion model the parameter related to the arctangent erosion model i e α directly affects the vertical erosion rate of breach bottom which plays an important role in the downcutting process of the breach bottom the parameter α is multiplied by 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 to assess its influence on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph the evolution of the breach bottom elevation with different erodibility coefficients is shown in fig 14 a it is seen that the downcutting process of the breach bottom is faster with the decrease of the erodibility coefficient α the final elevation of the breach bottom is not sensitive to α as the bed shear stress does not exceed the critical value a similar condition occurs for the breach enlargement as presented in fig 14 b the breach width increases quicker when the erodibility coefficient reduces similarly the final breach width is not sensitive to the erodibility coefficients considered in the analysis as the result of a slower breach undercutting and enlargement process the ascending stage takes place later and the discharge hydrograph become fatter with an increase of the erodibility coefficient α as shown in fig 14 c the peak discharge decreases significantly and its arrival time delays with a larger erodibility coefficient fig 14 d shows that the impact of the erodibility coefficient on the lake level is similar to that on the breach bottom the lake level drops faster with a smaller erodibility coefficient and the final values of the lake level corresponding to different erodibility coefficients are close to each other it can be concluded that the erodibility coefficient significantly affects the breach development the outflow discharge and the stage hydrography which especially influences the peak outflow rate and its arrival time however the final breach geometry i e bf and df and the lake level at the final stage are not sensitive to the erodibility coefficient as shown in table 4 4 2 3 influence of the parameter related to the lateral enlargement model the parameter related to the lateral enlargement model β directly impacts the evolution of the breach width the parameter β is multiplied by 0 9 1 0 1 1 and 1 2 to assess its influence on the breach development and the outflow hydrograph the evolution of breach bottom elevation with different lateral enlargement rates is shown in fig 15 a it can be found that the downcutting of the breach bottom is almost independent on the lateral enlargement rate the breach extends faster with a larger lateral enlargement rate and has a greater final width as presented in fig 15 b the influence of lateral enlargement rate on the outflow discharge is not significant fig 15 c the discharge hydrograph only delays slightly with a smaller lateral enlargement rate while the peak discharge increases a little the impacts of the lateral enlargement rate on the stage hydrograph is not remarkable and the final lake levels are close to each other as presented in fig 15 d in general the lateral enlargement rate does not significantly influence the outflow discharge and the stage hydrography which only affects the breach width obviously table 4 4 2 4 influence of the velocity step the breach of the tangjiashan landslide dam is simulated with four different velocity steps that cross two orders of magnitude i e δv 0 01 0 005 0 001 and 0 0001 m s to verify the rigour and accuracy of the numerical solution it can be found that though the velocity steps vary in a wide range the simulated results almost coincide with each other indicting insensitivity of the proposed dam breach model more detailed information of the sensitivity analysis of the four key parameters i e qp tp bf df with different δv can be referred to table 4 since the proposed dam breach model is insensitive to the velocity step it is beneficial and convenient for predicting landslide dam overtopping 5 conclusions in this study a numerical model is established to simulate the breach process of a landslide dam and the resultant outburst flood which includes the outflow hydrograph model and the breach geometry evolution model the present study proposes an arctangent erosion model for describing the vertical incision of the breach which has an asymptote of the ultimate erosion rate for avoiding overestimation of the soil erosion from the application of baige landslide dam it can be found that both the hyperbolic and the arctangent erosion model can well predict changes of the erosion rate of the dam accumulations while the linear erosion model gives an infinitely increasing result in addition to the high accuracy the proposed arctangent erosion model has another advantage of simplicity with only one required input parameter which is particular suitable for landslide dams of high uncertainty and natural complexity moreover in this study soil characteristics of the deposit are considered individually in different layers for addressing the variations in soil erodibility along the depth the breach shape is considered as a rectangle for simplicity the numerical model was applied in the tangjiashan landslide dam and the baige landslide dam the simulated results were compared with the measured data in the field including the evolution of breach bottom and width the outflow hydrograph the elevation of lake level etc the simulated results are in good agreement with the observations especially for the peak discharge the relative errors between the predicted and the measured values are within 6 meanwhile the proposed numerical approach was compared with two widely used landslide dam break models i e the db nhri model and the da iwhr model the descending process of the lake level and the downcut of the breach are predicted better by the proposed approach this may be caused by the use of the arctangent erosion model and the consideration of soil property changes along the deposit depth moreover a comparison of the dam breach process for homogeneous and heterogeneous dams by using the proposed model was also conducted results show the importance of considering variations of soil properties along the depth both the erosion in the breach and the associated outflow hydrograph would be overestimated for the homogeneous dam without considering variations of soil erodibility along the depth a sensitivity analysis was further conducted for assessing the influence of four parameters on the breach evolution and the outflow hydrograph i e the vertical contraction coefficient of the head above the breach bottom m the erodibility coefficient α the lateral enlargement rate β and the velocity step δv results demonstrate that the downcut and the enlargement of the breach as well as the hydrographs are sensitive to m when m 0 80 a smaller value of α leads to a faster evolution of the breach geometry a quicker drop of the lake level and a larger peak outflow rate corresponded to an earlier arrival time nevertheless the final breach shape and the lake level are not remarkably sensitive to α the variation of β results in an insignificant change in the discharge the stage hydrograph and the breach bottom which only affects the breach width the numerical results are almost independent on the velocity step which varied across two orders of magnitude in this study credit authorship contribution statement bo wang

water depth obtained from eqs a1 and a4 respectively τ c j is the critical shear stress of soil in the jth layer of the deposit which can be determined by eq 14 elimination of δ z s i and δ t i in eqs

is equal to zero i e dv dt 0 and both the numerator and denominator in eq a10 are close to zero the resultant value of δ z d i may be abnormal occasionally a special treatment is required for smoothening the calculation at the peak velocity where the sign of the velocity interval will shift it is indicated from eq 13 that the soil erosion rate is always larger than zero i e dzd dt 0 three

d z d 0 when the input of δ v i produces a value of δ z d i respectively it means that the increment of breach bottom elevation increases with the velocity interval the calculation process is normal when the signs of δ v i and δ z d i are opposite it is indicated that the increment of breach bottom elevation decreases with the velocity interval a negative value of δ v i should be used in the subsequent calculations when the velocity reaches the maximum as dv dzd 0 because of both the numerator and denominator approaching zero in eq a10 an abnormal value of δ z d i may be produced when the value of li falls in the range of 0 985 li 1 015 chen et al 2015 the velocity can be approximated by expansion in the power series if only first three terms remain a13 v i v max d v d z d δ z d i 1 2

3404,investigating the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought and identifying their difference in the regions with different climate conditions can provide an essential reference for the sustainable management of groundwater resources as a case study in the two largest and typical catchments in china the temporal evolution spatial distribution and trend characteristics of groundwater drought are identified by grace based groundwater drought index in the yangtze river catchments yzrc with a humid climate condition and yellow river catchments yrc with an arid semi arid climate condition their influencing factors which include natural net recharge p et teleconnection factors enso pdo and ao and anthropogenic factors land use and land cover lulc are investigated and quantitatively compared based on pearson correlation analysis cross wavelet transform and random forest the results indicate that 1 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur during 2002 2009 which are mostly in the middle and lower reaches of the catchments and they show a decreasing trend in most regions of the catchments in the yrc they mainly occur during 2015 2019 which influence almost the whole catchments and they show an increasing trend in most regions of the catchments 2 the p et has a significant positive impact on the mitigation of groundwater drought in the yzrc while it fails to reverse the groundwater drought aggravation in the yrc the teleconnection factors have obvious influences on groundwater drought evolution among which arctic oscillation ao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are the important factors affecting groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc respectively for lulc the decrease of cropland and grassland could alleviate groundwater drought in the yzrc and the increase of grassland forest and urban area in the yrc could aggravate groundwater drought in the catchments 3 when quantitatively comparing the contributions the lulc and p et are the crucial factors affecting groundwater drought in the two catchments while in the yrc the impact of teleconnection factors cannot be ignored although it is relatively weak moreover groundwater exploitation plays an important role on groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc its contribution in the yzrc and yrc is slightly lower than that of p et but obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors keywords grace groundwater drought influencing factors quantitative contribution 1 introduction groundwater is the largest distributed store of liquid freshwater in the world and provides essential water for human and human dependent ecosystems wada 2016 when there is a lack of recharge in the groundwater system or a lack of groundwater in terms of groundwater storage or groundwater head in a specific period the groundwater system is vulnerable to droughts namely groundwater droughts mishra and singh 2010 van lanen and peters 2000 the groundwater drought is a major threat to global water security and it will not only bring enormous losses to industry and agriculture which depend on the groundwater but also cause many adverse effects such as groundwater resources shortage and ecological environment deterioration mustafa et al 2017 van lanen et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to understand the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought characterizing groundwater drought relies on effective groundwater monitoring and traditional monitoring method is mostly based on groundwater wells nevertheless groundwater measurements are relatively difficult to acquire because of the cost associated with drilling and maintaining wells chao et al 2020a li et al 2019 furthermore the regions where groundwater measurements are available often without digitized and centralized datasets or are withheld from the public due to political considerations feng et al 2013 li et al 2019 moreover well observations are often limited in spatial coverage due to the spatial heterogeneity and may have discontinuous and or short records which makes them unsuitable for drought monitoring with the rapid development of earth observation based on remote sensing technology the original groundwater monitoring method based on well can be improved to achieve large scale groundwater assessment gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity satellite is a new and valuable tool to fill the gap in data availability and groundwater monitoring tapley et al 2004 groundwater storage anomaly gwsa derived from grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa has been used in several studies to evaluate groundwater dynamics in many regions such as the western united states famiglietti 2014 india bhanja et al 2016 and the liaohe river basin zhong et al 2018 furthermore some studies have used the grace based groundwater drought index such as dsi gwsa drought severity index ggdi grace groundwater drought index for groundwater drought monitoring and assessment han et al 2021 thomas et al 2017 however multiple influencing factors of groundwater drought were not involved in these studies diagnosing the influencing factors of groundwater drought is critical to reduce and manage the risks of groundwater drought meteorological variables play an important role in influencing groundwater resources under natural conditions precipitation p and evapotranspiration et are considered as the natural factors that have a direct influence on groundwater recharge groundwater level and storage loáiciga et al 2000 su et al 2020 precipitation minus evapotranspiration p et is regarded as the natural net recharge of surface and groundwater byrne and o gorman 2015 for instance su et al 2020 discussed the effects of the natural net recharge namely p et on the groundwater storage in the huang huai hai plain in china however the impacts of natural net recharge on groundwater drought are unclear at present moreover the natural net recharge will be different under different climate conditions cuthbert et al 2019 therefore it would be meaningful to figure out the impact and its difference of natural net recharge on groundwater drought under different climate conditions for more effectively understanding and managing groundwater systems teleconnection factors are also found to have an impact on the groundwater system and they can control groundwater level and recharge by a complex interaction anderson and emanuel 2008 kuss and gurdak 2014 rust et al 2019 for instance velasco et al 2017 discovered that low frequency climate modes such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo have a strong influence on groundwater fluctuations across a north south gradient of the west coast but groundwater drought was not involved in their study recently some investigations were carried out to explore the relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors for example rust et al 2019 found that teleconnection factors systematically and periodically control the recurrence of groundwater drought in the uk studies related to the relationship between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors in china indicated that el niño southern oscillation enso arctic oscillation ao and pdo especially enso have significant influence on groundwater drought in the north china plain e g wang et al 2020 however these studies do not consider whether there is difference and what the differences are in the effects of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought under different climate conditions hence this study selects the teleconnection factors including enso pdo and ao in order to improve the understanding about the effects of these teleconnection factors on groundwater drought in other regions of china and to investigate their differences under different climate conditions except for meteorological variables and teleconnection factors the influence of anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought cannot be ignored some studies found that anthropogenic factors which mainly are groundwater withdrawals can exacerbate groundwater depletion joodaki et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 wendt et al 2020 revealed that exceeded groundwater withdrawals can lengthen and intensify the groundwater droughts in the uk wang et al 2020 also indicated that groundwater exploitation will increase the risk of triggering groundwater drought in the north china plain in addition to the exceeded groundwater withdrawal human modification of land use and land cover lulc can probably aggravate the regional groundwater drought the changes of lulc control the overall water balance e g water demand and supply and redistribute water resources such as the locations rates and mechanisms of groundwater recharge and even consequently lower the groundwater level han et al 2017 some studies indicated that the changes of lulc caused by vegetation restoration and urban expansion will increase groundwater demand and exert more pressure on the groundwater system han et al 2020 zhang et al 2014b however lulc and its changes are different in regions with different climate conditions and the distinctions of regional groundwater droughts caused by it have not been clearly understood more importantly as far as we know there is a lack of quantitative comparison of the effects of these factors namely meteorological variables teleconnection factors and anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought in order to fill this gap this study is conducted in the two largest and typical catchments in china with different climate conditions which are yangtze river catchments and yellow river catchments to analyze the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought and figure out the key influencing factors with quantitative comparison the yangtze river catchments yzrc with a humid climate condition is one of the catchments with the richest water storage in china however with climate change and the intensification of human activities the frequency and intensity of droughts and associated hazards in the catchments are increasing sun et al 2018 the yellow river catchments yrc belong to the arid semi arid climate condition where the agricultural irrigation and industry greatly depend on groundwater while the yrc has experienced serious groundwater depletion lin et al 2019 the systematic investigation about the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought is seldomly conducted in the two catchments especially in the yzrc therefore the main aim of this study is to improve the understanding about the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought and further quantify the contribution of each factor to groundwater drought in the regions with different climate conditions namely yzrc and yrc to provide a reference for the other similar humid and arid semi arid catchments around the world the primary objectives of this study are 1 to identify the spatio temporal characteristics and evolution trend of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc during 2002 2020 2 to diagnose influencing factors including natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc of groundwater drought and the differences of their impacts in the two selected catchments 3 to quantitatively compare the contribution of each influencing factor to the development of groundwater drought in the two catchments the following sections are organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used in this study section 3 presents

classification and high spatial resolution and its high accuracy in china has been proved yang et al 2017 therefore it is suitable for the large scale and long term study of lulc change in the yzrc and yrc 3 methodology as mentioned above this study is aimed to identify the spatio temporal characteristics and evolution trend of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc during 2002 2020 evaluate the impact of influencing factors and quantitatively diagnose the key influencing factors therefore the following steps are conducted to accomplish the aims firstly gwsa is retrieved from grace and gldas secondly groundwater drought index based on grace derived gwsa is calculated to identify the groundwater drought at monthly scale thirdly the singular spectrum analysis ssa and mann kendall mk trend test are used to characterize the evolution trend of groundwater drought fourthly the pearson correlation analysis and cross wavelet transform are adopted to analyze the impact of influencing factors on the groundwater drought finally the random forest rf is utilized to quantitatively compare the contribution of each influencing factor to groundwater drought the flowchart of this study is presented in fig 2 it should be noted that the analysis in this study is conducted at catchment scale and grid scale to reveal the characteristic of temporal evolution and spatial distribution respectively the calculation at catchment scale is based on the time series derived from the average value of all the grids within the study area the calculation at grid scale is based on the time series of each grid which aims to derive its average value and show the differences among different grids 3 1 groundwater storage anomaly gwsa the grace twsa mainly concludes the change of groundwater soil moisture snow water and canopy water eq 1 in order to investigate the groundwater changes the groundwater storage anomaly gwsa in the study area can be obtained by deducting the contribution of the soil moisture storage anomaly smsa snow water equivalent anomaly swea and canopy water storage anomalies cwsa provided by gldas model therefore the anomaly in satellite based gwsa namely gwsa can be determined in equation 2 as follows 1 twsa g w s a s m s a s w e a c w s a 2 gwsa t w s a s m s a s w e a c w s a where smsa swa and swea are obtained from gldas noah 3 2 grace based groundwater drought index the grace based groundwater drought index namely dsi is utilized in this study to characterize groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc han et al 2019 the dsi is a standardized drought severity index exclusively based on grace derived gwsa which is a dimensionless quantity it is simpler to calculate and retained the seasonal characteristics of drought compared with ggdi proposed by thomas et al 2017 hence dsi is selected in this study to identify groundwater drought the dsi is defined as follows 3 ds i i j gws a i j gws a j σ j where i is the year ranging from 2002 to 2020 j is the month ranging from january to december gws a j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of groundwater storage anomaly in month j respectively moreover the drought threshold of dsi is 0 8 lower than which means groundwater drought occurs 3 3 trend test 3 3 1 singular spectral analysis ssa in this study singular spectrum analysis ssa is used to identify the change process and trend item of dsi time series in the two catchments ssa is a tool to decompose a time series into components ordered by variance intensity vautard et al 1992 it is widely used to extract the trend especially non linear trend and leading oscillations of time signals or to eliminate noise the fundamental principle of ssa is to sample the time series into time lagged segments to get the correlation information among the segments and to reconstruct the time series based on the temporal correlation the detailed procedures of ssa are as follows the first step is to construct the trajectory matrix for the time series x x 1 x n the trajectory matrix of x can be constructed by follows 4 x x 1 x 2 x m x 2 x 3 x m 1 x l x l 1 x n where l n 1 m is the length of moving window the second step is singular value decomposition λ i and u i are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix x x t respectively suppose d min l m and v i x t u i λ i i 1 d then x can be composed of elementary matrices 5 x x 1 x 2 x d where x i λ i u i v i t λ i is the singular spectrum of sequence x and the eigenvector corresponding to its maximum value is considered as the maximum variation trend of the signal the third step is grouping suppose i i 1 i p the matrix x i x i 1 x ip which corresponding to i can divide x into k disjoint matrices namely x x i 1 x ik the final step is reconstruction usually using the diagonal average method suppose l min l m m max l m and x ij x ij l m x ji l m x can be converted to the time series y 1 y n according to the diagonal average method 6 y m 1 m k 1 m x k m k 1 1 m l 1 l k 1 l x k m k 1 l m m 1 n 1 m k m 1 m n 1 m x k m k 1 m m n 3 3 2 mann kendall mk trend test the mann kendall mk trend test is adopted in this study to evaluate the overall trend of groundwater drought in the two catchments both at catchment scale and grid scale the mk trend test which is a nonparametric method is widely used to analyze the trend of time series ashraf et al 2021 kendall 1948 mann 1945 in this test there are two hypotheses the null hypothesis h 0 signifies no trend in the data and the alternative hypothesis h a signifies a presence of increasing or decreasing trend within the data algorithms used for mk trend test statistics s var and standardized test statistics z are as follows 7 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 8 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 0 x j x i 0 1 x j x i 0 9 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 10 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 where x i and x j are the time series monitoring data in sequential order n is the length of the time series t k is the number of the tie in the sample in the k th value and m is the numbers of tied variables if z z 1 α 2 h 0 is rejected and a significant trend exists within the data the positive value of the z means upward rising and a negative value means downward trend the significant level α is usually 0 01 and 0 05 and the corresponding z 1 α 2 is 2 5758 and 1 9600 respectively 3 4 evapotranspiration et estimation the generalized nonlinear form of the complementary principle which is based on the routine meteorological variables to estimate actual evapotranspiration is adopted in this study to derive the actual evapotranspiration namely et in the two catchments brutsaert 2015 the et can be calculated as follows 11 et e po e pa 2 2 e pa e po where e po is the evaporation that would take place from the same large surface as et when it is well supplied with water e pa is the potential evapotranspiration which can be estimated by penman monteith method allen et al 1998 12 e po α c δ δ γ r n g 13 e pa 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where α c is an adjustable parameter which is also the single parameter in the improved complementary relationship in this study α c in the yzrc and yrc is selected as 1 10 and 0 85 respectively which is based on the calibration of et observations obtained from water balance and flux stations in the two catchments li et al 2021 liu et al 2018a δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 t a

deficit kpa the computation for e po e pa and all parameters involved follows the method and procedure given in chapter 3 of the fao paper 56 allen et al 1998 the data required for the calculations of e po e pa and parameters i e latitude elevation tmax tmin rhu ssd and win are obtained from meteorological stations in the two selected catchments provided by the cma https data cma cn 3 5 identification of impact of influencing factors on groundwater drought the pearson correlation analysis and the cross wavelet transform are selected to identify the impact of influencing factors on groundwater drought among them pearson correlation analysis is also used to identify other correlation relationships in this study for two elements x and y if their sample values are x i and y i i 1 2 n the pearson correlation coefficient between them is defined as follows 14 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 cross wavelet transform method is an effective signal analysis method which combines wavelet transform with cross spectrum analysis torrence and compo 1998 it can effectively analyze the correlation between two time series and can reveal the relationship between two sequences in time frequency domain from the perspective of multiple time scales grinsted et al 2004 moreover cross wavelet transform can reveal the region with the same energy spectrum after wavelet transform and consequently figure out the significance of the interaction between the two time series in different time frequency domain in this study the relationships between dsi and teleconnection factors in the two catchments are investigated by using cross wavelet transform the cross wavelet transform of the two time series x i and y i i 1 2 n can be described as w xy w x w y where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy can be regarded as the local relative phase between x i and y i in time and frequency domains the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two time series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is expressed as follows 15 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 3 6 quantification of the contribution of influencing factors to groundwater drought the random forest rf algorithm is used to calculate importance scores for each influencing factor and consequently quantify the contribution of each influencing factor to groundwater drought in the two catchments rf is based on classification and regression trees and produces numerous independent trees to reach a final decision through randomization approach to the selection of training samples and the selection of variables at each node of a tree breiman 2001 variable importance is a weighted mean of the individual trees improvement in the splitting criterion produced by each variable liaw and wiener 2002 its rationale is the following by randomly permuting the predictor variable x j its original association with the response y is broken when the permuted variable x j together with the remaining unpermuted predictor variables is used to predict the response the prediction accuracy i e the number of observations classified correctly decreases substantially if the original variable x j was associated with the response thus a reasonable measure for variable importance is the difference in prediction accuracy before and after permuting x j in this study the predictor variables of rf are natural net recharge p et teleconnection factors enso pdo and ao and lulc and the response variable is the groundwater drought index namely dsi the variable importance score is used to determine which influencing factors have the most significant contribution to the development of groundwater drought this method is also adopted to explore what meteorological variables i e tmax tmin rhu ssd and win affect natural net recharge i e p et and how p et is affected by these meteorological variables in this study 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal characteristics of groundwater drought in the two catchments in order to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics and evolution trend of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 the grace based groundwater drought index namely dsi and trend test methods which are ssa and mk trend test are used in this study the accuracy of twsa derived from grace and the capability of grace based dsi to characterize groundwater drought in the two selected catchments during 04 2002 03 2020 have been verified in our previous study zhang et al 2021 4 1 1 temporal characteristics of groundwater drought fig 3 illustrates the temporal evolution characteristics of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 for the yzrc the dsi shows an upward trend with a linear tendency rate of 0 07 month indicating that the dsi identified groundwater drought is decreasing in the yzrc during 04 2002 03 2020 fig 3 a the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur from 2002 to 2009 fig 3 a the average value of dsi is 0 80 during 2002 2009 while it is 0 72 during 2010 2020 during 2002 2003 the dsi values are the lowest which indicates the yzrc experiences the most serious groundwater drought in this period fig 3 a furthermore ssa is used to reflect the variation characteristics of dsi trends a high consistency exists between the changes of dsi and ssa derived trend items in the period of 04 2002 to 03 2020 pearson correlation coefficient r reaching 0 78 under the significant level of p 0 01 from the ssa derived trend items it can be seen that dsi is increasing in the yzrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 moreover according to the mk trend test there is a significant upward trend z 13 02 in the dsi of the yzrc the upward trends of dsi obtained by ssa and mk trend test both indicate that the groundwater drought in the yzrc is gradually alleviating for the yrc the dsi shows a downward trend with a linear tendency rate of 0 04 month indicating that the dsi identified groundwater drought is increasing in the yrc during 04 2002 03 2020 fig 3 b the groundwater droughts in the yrc mainly occur from 2015 to 2020 fig 3 b the average value of dsi is 0 30 during 2002 2014 while it is 0 87 during 2010 2020 from 2017 to 2018 the dsi values are relatively low which means the groundwater drought during this period is more serious than that during other periods fig 3 b similar to the yzrc the changes of dsi and ssa derived trend items also show a high consistency with r reaching 0 91 under the significant level of p 0 01 for the period of 04 2002 to 03 2020 from the ssa derived trend items it can be seen that dsi is decreasing in the yrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 according to the mk trend test there is a significant downward trend z 14 61 in the dsi of the yrc different from the decrease of groundwater drought in the yzrc the dsi trends in the yrc obtained by ssa and mk trend test are both downward which indicates that the groundwater drought in the yrc is gradually aggravating 4 1 2 spatial characteristics of groundwater drought since the groundwater droughts in the yzrc and yrc mainly occur in the periods of 2002 2009 and 2015 2020 respectively fig 3 the spatial distributions of groundwater droughts in these two periods in the two catchments are illustrated in fig 4 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc are mainly observed in the middle and southeast of the catchment involving sichuan yunnan chongqing guizhou hubei hunan and jiangxi provinces fig 4 a especially in the eastern part of sichuan middle and southern parts of chongqing and northern part of guizhou the lower values of dsi are observed fig 4 a for the yrc except for some regions on the southern edge of yrc the groundwater droughts are distributed in the almost whole catchment which includes all provinces in the catchment fig 4 b the lower values of dsi are distributed in the middle and eastern parts of the catchment which are the middle and northern parts of ningxia middle and northern parts of shaanxi most regions of shanxi and shandong within the catchment fig 4 b the dsi in the yrc ranges from 1 39 to 0 88 at grid scale while it in the yzrc ranges from 1 01 to 0 91 at grid scale moreover there are 53 59 grids with relatively low monthly average dsi 0 9 in the yrc while there are 2 43 grids with monthly average dsi values below 0 9 in the yzrc thus the groundwater droughts in the yrc are more serious and have a wider impact on the catchment than that in the yzrc the spatial distributions of groundwater droughts in these two periods namely2002 2003 in the yzrc and 2017 2018 in the yrc when the most serious groundwater droughts mainly occur in the two catchments fig 3 are shown in fig 5 the most serious groundwater droughts in the yzrc are mainly located in the northern part of the central catchment involving chongqing shaanxi hubei and henan provinces fig 5 a for the yrc the most serious groundwater droughts are distributed in the most regions of the catchment which includes qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia shaanxi and shanxi provinces fig 5 b moreover there are 75 58 grids with relatively low monthly average dsi 0 9 in the yrc while there are 54 26 grids with monthly average dsi values below 0 9 in the yzrc in general the most serious groundwater droughts in the yrc have a wider impact on the catchment than that in the yzrc the spatial distributions of dsi trend derived from mk trend test in the two catchments are displayed in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a except for some regions in the upper reaches of the yzrc most regions in the catchment show a significant upward trend there are 71 grids with significant upward trend of dsi z 1 96 which indicates that groundwater droughts are gradually alleviating in most regions of the yzrc fig 6 b shows that except for some regions on the southern edge of yrc most regions in the catchment show a significant downward trend there are 88 grids with significant downward trend of dsi z 1 96 which indicates that groundwater droughts are increasing in most regions of the yrc during 04 2002 03 2020 han et al 2020 also found the downward trend during 2005 2013 in the loess plateau which is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yrc both in grace based groundwater drought index i e dsi and in situ groundwater table therefore the gradual mitigation of groundwater droughts in the yzrc and the aggravation of groundwater droughts in the yrc are also revealed at grid scale 4 2 impact of natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc on groundwater drought in the two catchments to further identify influencing factors of groundwater drought and the difference of their impacts in the regions with different climate conditions the impacts of factors namely natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc on groundwater drought are analyzed in two selected catchments 4 2 1 impact of natural net recharge on groundwater drought fig 7 displays the annual variations of dsi and p et in the yzrc and yrc as shown in fig 7 a the variations of dsi and p et in the yzrc are consistent and they both show an increasing trend from 2003 to 2019 dsi 0 16 yr p et 7 82 mm yr for instance p et increases during 2003 2005 and 2013 2017 meanwhile dsi also increases gradually during these periods based on pearson correlation coefficient dsi is significantly positively correlated with p et r 0 57 p 0 05 in the yzrc which indicates that the evolution of groundwater drought in the catchment is significantly affected by natural net recharge and the natural net recharge plays a promoting role in alleviating groundwater drought in the catchment it can be seen from fig 6 a that groundwater droughts in the middle and east of the yzrc show a trend of decreasing and fig 8 a and b shows that the average annual p et in these regions is relatively high during the period that groundwater drought mainly occurs in the northwest of the yzrc groundwater drought tends to intensify fig 6 a while p et is relatively low in these regions therefore sufficient and increasing natural recharge is one of the important reasons for alleviating groundwater drought in the middle and east of the yzrc fig 7 b shows that annual dsi in the yrc from 2003 to 2019 decreases obviously 0 11 yr while annual p et increases slightly from 2004 to 2019 2 31 mm yr additionally the dsi is negatively related to p et r 0 48 p 0 05 in the yrc which indicates that the slightly increased natural net recharge cannot mitigate the increase of groundwater drought in the yrc furthermore the average annual p et in the yrc which is 99 04 mm is much lower compared with that in the yzrc which is 451 32 mm besides it can be seen from fig 8 c and d that the average annual p et in all regions in the yrc is relatively low and the grids with the high values of average annual p et when groundwater drought mainly occurs which is from 2015 to 2019 are less than that from 2003 to 2014 when groundwater drought seldomly occurs there are 42 36 grids with relatively high p et which is higher than 400 mm from 2015 to 2019 while there are 43 38 grids with relatively high p et from 2003 to 2014 hence the intensification of groundwater drought in the yrc may not be able to be alleviated by the slightly increased but still relatively low natural net recharge in the catchment 4 2 2 impact of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought enso pdo and ao are selected in this study to characterize the influences of large scale climate indices on groundwater drought in the two selected catchments in order to reveal the impact of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought in the time frequency domain and its difference in the yzrc and yrc during 04 2002 03 2020 the cross wavelet transform method is utilized to avoid boundary effect and high frequency false information of the wavelet transform the thin solid line in fig 9 is the boundary of the cone of influence with effective spectral regions within it for the yzrc as shown in fig 9 a enso has a statistically significant correlation with dsi with a 14 20 months signal in 2014 2018 there is also a prominent and positive correlation between pdo and dsi in 2014 2018 with a 16 24 months signal fig 9 b fig 9 c shows that ao has a significant negative correlation with dsi with a 16 30 months signal in 2002 2020 in addition from 2002 to 2020 there is an intermittent low resonance period between dsi and teleconnection factors about 1 14 months in conclusion the statistically significant correlation between dsi and teleconnection factors implies teleconnection factors play an important role during the groundwater drought evolution in the yzrc and the impacts of ao on the groundwater droughts in the catchment are stronger than those of enso and pdo for the yrc enso has a statistically significant correlation with dsi with a 15 24 months signal in 2006 2012 fig 9 d similar to that in the yzrc the prominent correlation between pdo and dsi is also found in the same period when enso is significantly correlated with dsi there is also a prominent and positive correlation between pdo and dsi in 2006 2012 with a 32 50 months signal fig 9 e generally phase changes in the pdo have a propensity to coincide with changes of enso events where the positive phase of the pdo is associated with an enhanced frequency of el niño events while the negative phase is shown to be more favorable for the development of la niña events verdon and franks 2006 it may be the reason why pdo and enso have similar effects on dsi both in the two catchments fig 9 f shows that ao has a significant negative correlation with dsi with a 16 30 months signal in 2002 2020 and a 12 18 months signal in 2009 2011 additionally from 2002 to 2020 there is an intermittent low resonance period between dsi and teleconnection factors about 1 14 months similar to that in the yzrc a statistically significant correlation also exists between dsi and teleconnection factors in the yrc which indicates that teleconnection factors also play an important role during the groundwater drought evolution in the yrc different from that in the yzrc the impact of pdo on the groundwater droughts in the yrc is stronger than that of enso and ao 4 2 3 impact of lulc on groundwater drought the dominant lulc type in the yzrc from 2003 to 2019 is cropland which is in high water demand the cropland covers nearly half of the catchment area and accounts for 44 46 44 56 and 43 44 in 2003 2010 and 2019 which are randomly selected three years during 2003 2019 fig 10 fig 11 a c and e forest is the second in dominance which accounts for 35 77 35 31 and 35 81 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively followed by grassland which accounts for 17 07 16 97 and 16 87 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively fig 10 fig 11 a c and e as shown in fig 10 cropland is mainly distributed in the middle and east of the yzrc while forest is mainly in the middle north and west and grassland is mainly in the northwest of the catchment the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur in the middle and east of the catchment where is dominated by cropland and forest with high water demand except for irrigation which will increase the groundwater demand and thus reduce groundwater vegetation could absorb soil moisture and increase et which can lead to a decrease in groundwater recharge and consequently cause a decline in groundwater storage zhang and schilling 2006 moreover the coverage of urban shows a dramatic increase from 2003 to 2019 which increases by 91 58 between 2003 and 2010 and by 61 54 between 2010 and 2019 fig 11 g the expansion of urban will further increase the water demand which may exert pressure on groundwater system zhang et al 2014b it can be seen from fig 12 that groundwater drought in the yzrc is significantly negatively related to cropland area r 0 63 p 0 01 and grassland area r 0 87 p 0 01 while significantly positively correlated with urban area r 0 95 p 0 01 it should be noted that cropland and grassland exhibit a decrease of 2 29 and 1 20 from 2003 to 2019 fig 11 g as shown in fig 6 a dsi in most regions of the yzrc particularly the middle and east of the catchment presents an upward trend which means the groundwater droughts in the yzrc are decreasing chao et al 2020b also indicated that the groundwater storage in the yzrc from 2003 to 2015 was increased therefore the decrease of cropland and grassland will contribute to the alleviation of groundwater drought however urbanization in the yzrc may not have exacerbated the groundwater drought in the catchment for the yrc the dominant lulc type from 2003 to 2019 is grassland which covers nearly half of the catchment area and accounts for 48 23 48 68 and 48 76 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively fig 10 fig 11 b d and f cropland is second in dominance which accounts for 37 64 36 66 and 35 73 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively followed by forest which accounts for 9 77 9 76 and 9 83 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively fig 10 fig 11 b d and f grassland is mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest of the yrc while cropland is mainly in the southeast and northwest of the catchment and forest is mainly in the southeast of the catchment fig 10 during 2003 2019 the area of grassland forest and urban gradually increased while the area of cropland gradually decreased fig 11 h among them the urban area has a significant increase which increased by 150 between 2003 and 2010 and by 70 59 between 2010 and 2019 fig 12 shows that groundwater drought in the yrc is significantly positively correlated with cropland area r 0 93 p 0 01 while significantly negatively related to grassland area r 0 58 p 0 05 forest area r 0 65 p 0 01 and urban area r 0 95 p 0 01 as shown in fig 6 b the intensified trend of groundwater drought almost covers the whole catchment therefore the increase of grassland forest and urban area may aggravate groundwater drought while the decrease of cropland fails to reverse the groundwater drought increase in the yrc 4 3 contribution of each influencing factor to groundwater drought to further quantify the contribution of influencing factors which include p et lulc i e cropland forest grassland sparse vegetation urban unutilized and waters and teleconnection factors i e enso pdo and ao to groundwater drought and its differences in the two selected catchments the rf is used the contribution of various influencing factors to groundwater drought development is evaluated based on the variable importance scores obtained by the rf for the yzrc as shown in fig 13 a the lulc gets the relatively high variable importance particularly urban 0 61 and cropland 0 42 followed by p et 0 27 while the variable importance scores of teleconnection factors are much lower 0 05 it indicates that the impacts of lulc especially cropland and urban and p et on groundwater drought in the yzrc are stronger than teleconnection factors since p et can be the direct recharge of groundwater and the decrease of cropland could reduce the water demand the mitigation of groundwater drought in the yzrc is mainly because sufficient recharge can offset or even excessive groundwater discharge as for the cropland in the yzrc it was pointed out that groundwater could be recharged by irrigation return water in the catchment in some previous studies e g pan et al 2019 huang et al 2015 also indicated that the irrigation is the main contributor to the increase of groundwater in the yzrc although the variable importance of urban is high the increased dsi is positively related to the increased urban area which implies the urbanization in the yzrc does not deteriorate groundwater drought in the catchment it is probably due to the negative impacts of urbanization on groundwater drought is compensated by the plenitude and increase of p et in the yzrc in summary the dominant influencing factors corresponding to groundwater drought in the yzrc are p et and lulc for the yrc the lulc especially cropland 0 42 and urban 0 42 and p et 0 15 also get the relatively high variable importance moreover pdo which is included teleconnection factors obtains variable importance 0 11 that close to but slightly lower than that of p et hence as the contribution analysis revealed that the main influencing factors of groundwater drought in the yrc are lulc which mainly is the expansion of urban and p et while the impact corresponds to teleconnection factors especially pdo on groundwater drought in the yrc cannot be ignored which is different from that in the yzrc for the expansion of urban it can be explained that the groundwater withdrawal for urban production and livelihood which includes industry domestic public and eco environment was increased during 2003 2019 and it exerted considerable pressure on groundwater in yrc zhang et al 2021 as for the p et which is one of the main impact factors of groundwater drought both in the two catchments hu et al 2019 showed that natural recharge has much more control on groundwater than other natural factors however according to the aforementioned analysis the decreased dsi is negatively correlated with the increased p et and positively related to decreased cropland it indicates that the slightly increased but still relatively low p et and the decrease of cropland fail to reverse the aggravation of groundwater drought in the yrc 5 discussion 5 1 changes of groundwater storage in the two catchments the occurrence of groundwater drought reveals the decline in groundwater storage fig 14 shows the temporal and spatial variations of gwsa in the two catchments during 04 2002 03 2020 the gwsa in the yzrc at temporal scale ranging from 4 26 cm to 6 86 cm is relatively higher than that in the yrc ranging from 11 78 cm to 2 09 cm fig 14 a and c the trends of gwsa in the two catchments are opposite the overall trend of gwsa is upward in the yzrc which is 0 25 cm month while it is downward in the yrc which is 0 55 cm month it suggests that the groundwater storage in the yzrc is increasing while it is decreasing in the yrc some related studies also revealed the similar pattern in groundwater storage identified by grace or observations in the yzrc and yrc for instance chao et al 2020b indicated that there is an increasing trend in grace derived groundwater storage from 2003 to 2015 in the yzrc liu et al 2020 found that there is a rising trend in groundwater storage derived from grace from 2003 to 2012 in the yzrc and they verified it by using the unregulated river baseflow observations in the catchment lin et al 2019 pointed out that the groundwater storage monitored by grace in the yrc decreased significantly from 2010 to 2016 zhang et al 2019 also found that the groundwater table anomaly based on in situ observations and the grace groundwater storage anomaly in the yrc from 2005 to 2014 both showed a continuous decline in the study of yin et al 2021 they also indicated that the groundwater storage observed by grace during 04 2002 12 2016 in the yzrc is increasing and it in the yrc is decreasing and they verified it by groundwater resources published in bulletin at spatial scale the increasing gwsa distributes in most regions of yzrc especially in the middle part of the catchment which includes chongqing guizhou and hunan and there are 79 38 grids with increasing trend of gwsa in the catchment fig 14 b however most regions of yrc are occupied by the decreasing trend of gwsa particularly in the eastern part of the catchment which includes shanxi and henan fig 14 d there are 92 82 grids with decreasing trend of gwsa in the yrc the increase of gwsa in the yzrc further reveals the alleviation of groundwater drought in the catchment and the decline of gwsa in the yrc suggests the aggravation of groundwater drought in the catchment 5 2 integrated effects of natural net recharge and anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought in two catchments the main reason for groundwater drought is that groundwater recharge cannot offset groundwater discharge well li et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 van lanen and peters 2000 as shown in the contribution analysis p et has relatively strong effect on groundwater drought in the two catchments however when diagnosing the impact of the influencing factors in yzrc and yrc it seems that there is a contradictory phenomenon which is that the p et is positively correlated with dsi in the yzrc a humid catchment while negatively related to dsi in the yrc an arid semi arid catchment according to our previous study the groundwater droughts in the yzrc and yrc especially the yrc are strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors namely exceeded groundwater withdrawal for human use zhang et al 2021 but the effects of natural net recharge and other anthropogenic factors for instance lulc on groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc are not taken into account in that study therefore the impacts of natural net recharge lulc and groundwater withdrawal for human use on the occurrence and development of groundwater droughts in the two catchments with different climate conditions are further investigated in this study for the yzrc the cropland and urban with high water demand are mainly distributed on the middle and lower reaches of the catchment where the groundwater consumption which is collected from yangtze river water resources bulletin http www cjw gov cn is relatively high in these regions fig 15 a b for instance the groundwater consumption in hunan province located in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment is 8 98 mm yr groundwater consumption per unit area during 2003 2009 and 7 59 mm yr during 2010 2019 while the groundwater consumption in qinghai province located in the upper reaches of the catchment is almost zero during 2003 2019 but in the regions with relatively high groundwater consumption during 2003 2009 p et is relatively low fig 8 a b the groundwater droughts in the yzrc from 2003 to 2009 are probably due to the low natural net recharge during this period which could not offset the amount of groundwater extracted however the decreasing trend of groundwater droughts shown in most regions of yzrc and the positive correlation between p et and dsi indicate the natural net recharge replenished the groundwater storage and thus mitigated groundwater drought in the catchment besides as shown in fig 16 the groundwater recharge rate in the yzrc is relatively high especially in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment which is generally higher than 100 mm yr it further reveals the groundwater recharge is sufficient in the yzrc and it is important for the decrease of groundwater drought in the catchment for the yrc the groundwater consumption which is collected from yellow river water resources bulletin http www yrcc gov cn is generally much higher than that in the yzrc especially in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment fig 15 c and d as mentioned in section 1 groundwater is a critical water resource in the yrc fig 15 c and d shows that the middle and lower reaches of the yrc are the regions with dense cropland and urban where the groundwater consumption is higher than 14 mm yr and even higher than 30 mm yr in some areas such as henan province as mentioned above the decline in the cropland is not able to reverse the aggravation of groundwater drought in recent years the yrc zhang et al 2021 also found that the groundwater consumption in the yrc was maintained at a stable and relatively high level during 2003 2019 although the cropland area was decreasing it is worth noting that the proportion of grassland in the yrc is quite high which is conducive to groundwater recharge because of the relatively strong infiltration capacity of grassland adane and gates 2015 moreover except for natural net recharge agricultural irrigation reflux can also recharge the groundwater storage liu et al 2018b however it can be seen from fig 16 that the groundwater recharge rate is relatively low in the yrc it is lower than 100 mm yr and even lower than 20 mm yr in some regions it is probably mainly due to the quite low natural recharge in the catchment as shown in fig 7 b and fig 8 c and d that the natural net recharge in the yrc is much lower than that in the yzrc which is mainly due to the quite low precipitation and relatively high et in the yrc the average annual precipitation in the yrc is 0 43 of that in the yzrc while the average annual et in the yrc is 0 61 of that in the yzrc p yrc 452 81 mm yr yzrc 1042 73 mm yr et yrc 357 29 mm yr yzrc 586 17 mm yr considering the important role of groundwater extraction in the two catchments the contribution of groundwater consumption gwc to groundwater drought is analyzed along with other influencing factors mentioned before which are p et lulc and teleconnection factors as shown in fig 17 similar to the results mentioned in section 4 3 p et and lulc are still important influencing factors in the two catchments moreover the effect of teleconnection factors especially pdo on groundwater drought in the yrc cannot be ignored fig 17 b the difference is that the addition of gwc reduces the importance of other variables gwc has relatively high importance in the two catchments in the yzrc the importance of gwc 0 20 is only slightly lower than that of p et 0 23 fig 17 a for the yrc the importance of gwc 0 14 is slightly lower than that of p et 0 17 and obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors enso 0 06 pdo 0 10 ao 0 06 fig 17 b it further reveals that the groundwater withdrawal for human use exerts an enormous function on groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc in addition vegetation in the yrc which mainly are forest and grassland increases from 2003 to 2019 fig 11 h which is mainly due to the vegetation restoration plan in the catchment lu et al 2018 however increased vegetation can increase the water storage capacity of the upper layer of soil thus slower the infiltration of rainfall and irrigation water through the shallow layer of soil to the deep layer and consequently lead to the decline of groundwater recharge a et al 2019 in the yzrc although the forest coverage rate is high the natural recharge in the catchment is sufficient and the precipitation soil moisture and surface water are relatively rich liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 which play a role in promoting the high groundwater recharge rate on the other hand the infiltration capacity of the yrc dominated by sand is usually stronger than that of the yzrc dominated by clay fig 18 because sand generally has a higher infiltration rate due to its higher porosity mamedov et al 2001 nevertheless the quite low groundwater recharge rate indicates that the relatively limited natural net recharge in the yrc may prevent the increase of infiltration rate and thus negatively affected the groundwater recharge rate in the catchment furthermore the water retaining capacity of clay is commonly higher than that of sand combined with rich surface water in the yzrc mentioned above which could reduce groundwater discharge for surface water in the catchment and is beneficial to groundwater recharge in summary the scarcity of recharge for groundwater in the yrc coupled with rapid vegetation restoration which probably further reduce groundwater recharge and relatively high groundwater consumption ultimately lead to the intensification of groundwater drought in the catchment 5 3 differences between the crucial teleconnection factors affecting groundwater drought in the yzrc and the yrc as analyzed in section 4 2 2 the main teleconnection factors that influence groundwater droughts in the yzrc and yrc are different for the yzrc ao plays an important role in the development of groundwater droughts in the yzrc while pdo has a quite strong impact on groundwater droughts in the yrc tremblay et al 2011 indicated that groundwater in the region with humid climate condition is more susceptible to ao besides ao has a strong linkage with the southern branch trough which can bring more moisture transport and cause active synoptic scale disturbances in vertical motion over central southern china and thus provoke more extreme precipitation events there mao et al 2011 the increase in precipitation will improve the recharge of groundwater therefore the effect of ao on the groundwater droughts in the yzrc humid catchments located in southern china is relatively strong for the yrc over the catchment lies an anomalously high mean sea level pressure center which can be strongly affected by pdo and result in a dynamical set up that involves anomalous northerlies and subsidence conducive to a reduction in precipitation and consequently decrease groundwater storage over the catchment gao et al 2015 hence the influence of pdo is greater in the yrc compared with that of enso and ao in addition contribution analysis shows that teleconnection factors have stronger effect on groundwater drought in the yrc an arid semi arid catchment in northern china compared with that in the yzrc humid catchment in southern china some related studies indicated that there is a closer linkage between teleconnection factors and drought that occurred in northern china ma 2007 qian and zhou 2014 huang et al 2017 also pointed out that the arid region is more sensitive to the changes in atmospheric circulation 5 4 influences of meteorological variables on natural net recharge as we know that changes of natural net recharge are closely related to other meteorological variables such as maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin saturated vapor pressure svp relative humidity rhu sunshine duration ssd and wind speed win these meteorological variables are able to indirectly affect groundwater by influencing p and et kumar 2012 to further understand the effects of these meteorological variables on the p et and their difference under different climate conditions the contributions of annual tmax tmin svp rhu ssd and win to annual p et are quantified and compared in the two selected catchments as shown in fig 19 a p et in the yzrc is most sensitive to ssd with variable importance of 0 51 followed by rhu and svp with variable importance of 0 22 and 0 17 respectively similar to that in the yzrc ssd variable importance 0 17 and rhu variable importance 0 10 also have a significant influence on p et in the yrc especially ssd fig 19 b it is different that another major factor affecting p et in the yrc is win variable importance 0 07 rather than svp and the difference is shown in the effects of these two factors on et fig 20 it is mainly because the relatively high svp values in humid areas have a strong control effect on the variations of evapotranspiration jhajharia et al 2012 while in arid semi arid regions changes in wind speed affect evapotranspiration with more severity eslamian et al 2011 ssd has significant negative effect on p et both in the two catchments yzrc r 0 51 p 0 05 yrc r 0 50 p 0 05 in the two catchments ssd is negatively correlated with p yzrc r 0 41 p 0 05 yrc r 0 44 p 0 08 while positively related to et yzrc r 0 83 p 0 05 yrc r 0 50 p 0 05 fig 20 the decreased ssd mainly increases p et by increasing p and reducing et in the two catchments fig 21 e and g fig 22 e and g some related studies also pointed out that shorter ssd leads to more frequent p and less et han et al 2018 zongxing et al 2012 rhu is significantly positively related to p et in the two catchments yzrc r 0 62 p 0 05 yrc r 0 57 p 0 05 it is significantly positively correlated with p in the two catchments yzrc r 0 61 p 0 05 yrc r 0 60 p 0 05 it is mainly due to rhu plays a major role in the formation of p nojarov 2012 in addition the increased rhu has a weak negative effect on the slight decreased et in the yzrc r 0 12 p 0 65 while the decreased rhu positively affects the decreased et in the yrc r 0 30 p 0 24 the main reason is that the increases in relative humidity greatly reduce the evapotranspiration potential gong et al 2006 in summary ssd and rhu are the main meteorological variables which have vital influence on p et both in the two selected catchments while the other key variables affects p et in the yzrc and yrc is svp and win respectively these meteorological variables could directly affect p et and consequently indirectly influence groundwater droughts in the two catchments as a case study in the two largest catchments in china this study preliminarily investigates the influencing factors which mainly are meteorological variables i e p et teleconnection factors i e enso pdo and ao and lulc i e cropland forest grassland sparse vegetation urban unutilized and waters of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc the identification of groundwater drought in this study is based on grace due to the data limitation which mainly is the lacking of groundwater observations but in the future we hope well observations can be accessed furthermore in addition to the data limitation there may be other factors such as the increased area of the impervious layer as a result of urbanization and the changes of surface runoff affecting groundwater drought which is not considered in this study han et al 2017 wang et al 2021 a more comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on groundwater drought in the regions with different climate conditions is to be further investigated in the future 6 conclusions in this study the grace based groundwater drought index i e dsi was utilized as a metric to characterize the groundwater drought in the two largest catchments in china namely yzrc and yrc the evolution trend of groundwater drought in the two catchments was identified at temporal and spatial scales by ssa and mk trend test the influencing factors which include natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc of groundwater drought and the difference of their impacts in the two selected catchments were analyzed additionally the contribution of each influencing factor to the groundwater drought in the two catchments was quantified and compared by rf the primary conclusions are as follows 1 from 2002 to 2020 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur from 2002 to 2009 while for the yrc groundwater droughts mainly occur from 2015 to 2020 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc show a decreasing trend while they show an increasing trend in the yrc the groundwater droughts in the yzrc are mainly observed in the middle and east of the catchment and the groundwater droughts in most regions of the yzrc are generally mitigating while in the upper reaches of the catchment the groundwater droughts show an increasing trend the groundwater droughts in the yrc are almost distributed in the whole catchment and they are experiencing aggravation 2 the natural net recharge namely p et has a significant positive impact on the groundwater drought in the yzrc the sufficient and increasing p et plays a promoting role in alleviating groundwater drought in the yzrc for the yrc although p et has a slight increase its relatively low values cannot mitigate the increase of groundwater drought in the catchment among teleconnection factors i e enso pdo and ao ao has the strongest effect on groundwater drought in the yzrc while pdo has the most significant impact on the groundwater drought in the yrc for the changes of lulc the decrease of cropland and grassland have an obvious contribution to the decrease of groundwater drought in the yzrc while the increase of urban seems not to aggravate the groundwater drought in the catchment for the yrc the increase of grassland forest and the urban area has a strong effect on the increase of groundwater drought but the decrease of cropland is not able to reverse the aggravation of groundwater drought in the catchment 3 in terms of the quantitative comparison of the influencing factors for the yzrc the crucial influencing factors of groundwater drought are p et and lulc for the yrc the lulc and p et are also the important influencing factors of the groundwater drought in the catchment but different from the yzrc the influence of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought in the yrc cannot be ignored while it is weaker than that of lulc and p et furthermore it should be noted that groundwater exploitation is important for the groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc it exerts considerable pressure on groundwater system in the yzrc and yrc especially when natural net recharge is insufficient based on the quantitative contribution analysis which takes groundwater exploitation into account the importance of groundwater exploitation is slightly lower than that of p et while obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors both in the yzrc and yrc data availability statement in situ meteorological variables observations are

3404,investigating the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought and identifying their difference in the regions with different climate conditions can provide an essential reference for the sustainable management of groundwater resources as a case study in the two largest and typical catchments in china the temporal evolution spatial distribution and trend characteristics of groundwater drought are identified by grace based groundwater drought index in the yangtze river catchments yzrc with a humid climate condition and yellow river catchments yrc with an arid semi arid climate condition their influencing factors which include natural net recharge p et teleconnection factors enso pdo and ao and anthropogenic factors land use and land cover lulc are investigated and quantitatively compared based on pearson correlation analysis cross wavelet transform and random forest the results indicate that 1 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur during 2002 2009 which are mostly in the middle and lower reaches of the catchments and they show a decreasing trend in most regions of the catchments in the yrc they mainly occur during 2015 2019 which influence almost the whole catchments and they show an increasing trend in most regions of the catchments 2 the p et has a significant positive impact on the mitigation of groundwater drought in the yzrc while it fails to reverse the groundwater drought aggravation in the yrc the teleconnection factors have obvious influences on groundwater drought evolution among which arctic oscillation ao and pacific decadal oscillation pdo are the important factors affecting groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc respectively for lulc the decrease of cropland and grassland could alleviate groundwater drought in the yzrc and the increase of grassland forest and urban area in the yrc could aggravate groundwater drought in the catchments 3 when quantitatively comparing the contributions the lulc and p et are the crucial factors affecting groundwater drought in the two catchments while in the yrc the impact of teleconnection factors cannot be ignored although it is relatively weak moreover groundwater exploitation plays an important role on groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc its contribution in the yzrc and yrc is slightly lower than that of p et but obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors keywords grace groundwater drought influencing factors quantitative contribution 1 introduction groundwater is the largest distributed store of liquid freshwater in the world and provides essential water for human and human dependent ecosystems wada 2016 when there is a lack of recharge in the groundwater system or a lack of groundwater in terms of groundwater storage or groundwater head in a specific period the groundwater system is vulnerable to droughts namely groundwater droughts mishra and singh 2010 van lanen and peters 2000 the groundwater drought is a major threat to global water security and it will not only bring enormous losses to industry and agriculture which depend on the groundwater but also cause many adverse effects such as groundwater resources shortage and ecological environment deterioration mustafa et al 2017 van lanen et al 2013 therefore it is crucial to understand the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought characterizing groundwater drought relies on effective groundwater monitoring and traditional monitoring method is mostly based on groundwater wells nevertheless groundwater measurements are relatively difficult to acquire because of the cost associated with drilling and maintaining wells chao et al 2020a li et al 2019 furthermore the regions where groundwater measurements are available often without digitized and centralized datasets or are withheld from the public due to political considerations feng et al 2013 li et al 2019 moreover well observations are often limited in spatial coverage due to the spatial heterogeneity and may have discontinuous and or short records which makes them unsuitable for drought monitoring with the rapid development of earth observation based on remote sensing technology the original groundwater monitoring method based on well can be improved to achieve large scale groundwater assessment gravity recovery and climate experiment grace gravity satellite is a new and valuable tool to fill the gap in data availability and groundwater monitoring tapley et al 2004 groundwater storage anomaly gwsa derived from grace terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa has been used in several studies to evaluate groundwater dynamics in many regions such as the western united states famiglietti 2014 india bhanja et al 2016 and the liaohe river basin zhong et al 2018 furthermore some studies have used the grace based groundwater drought index such as dsi gwsa drought severity index ggdi grace groundwater drought index for groundwater drought monitoring and assessment han et al 2021 thomas et al 2017 however multiple influencing factors of groundwater drought were not involved in these studies diagnosing the influencing factors of groundwater drought is critical to reduce and manage the risks of groundwater drought meteorological variables play an important role in influencing groundwater resources under natural conditions precipitation p and evapotranspiration et are considered as the natural factors that have a direct influence on groundwater recharge groundwater level and storage loáiciga et al 2000 su et al 2020 precipitation minus evapotranspiration p et is regarded as the natural net recharge of surface and groundwater byrne and o gorman 2015 for instance su et al 2020 discussed the effects of the natural net recharge namely p et on the groundwater storage in the huang huai hai plain in china however the impacts of natural net recharge on groundwater drought are unclear at present moreover the natural net recharge will be different under different climate conditions cuthbert et al 2019 therefore it would be meaningful to figure out the impact and its difference of natural net recharge on groundwater drought under different climate conditions for more effectively understanding and managing groundwater systems teleconnection factors are also found to have an impact on the groundwater system and they can control groundwater level and recharge by a complex interaction anderson and emanuel 2008 kuss and gurdak 2014 rust et al 2019 for instance velasco et al 2017 discovered that low frequency climate modes such as pacific decadal oscillation pdo have a strong influence on groundwater fluctuations across a north south gradient of the west coast but groundwater drought was not involved in their study recently some investigations were carried out to explore the relationships between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors for example rust et al 2019 found that teleconnection factors systematically and periodically control the recurrence of groundwater drought in the uk studies related to the relationship between groundwater drought and teleconnection factors in china indicated that el niño southern oscillation enso arctic oscillation ao and pdo especially enso have significant influence on groundwater drought in the north china plain e g wang et al 2020 however these studies do not consider whether there is difference and what the differences are in the effects of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought under different climate conditions hence this study selects the teleconnection factors including enso pdo and ao in order to improve the understanding about the effects of these teleconnection factors on groundwater drought in other regions of china and to investigate their differences under different climate conditions except for meteorological variables and teleconnection factors the influence of anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought cannot be ignored some studies found that anthropogenic factors which mainly are groundwater withdrawals can exacerbate groundwater depletion joodaki et al 2014 zhao et al 2019 wendt et al 2020 revealed that exceeded groundwater withdrawals can lengthen and intensify the groundwater droughts in the uk wang et al 2020 also indicated that groundwater exploitation will increase the risk of triggering groundwater drought in the north china plain in addition to the exceeded groundwater withdrawal human modification of land use and land cover lulc can probably aggravate the regional groundwater drought the changes of lulc control the overall water balance e g water demand and supply and redistribute water resources such as the locations rates and mechanisms of groundwater recharge and even consequently lower the groundwater level han et al 2017 some studies indicated that the changes of lulc caused by vegetation restoration and urban expansion will increase groundwater demand and exert more pressure on the groundwater system han et al 2020 zhang et al 2014b however lulc and its changes are different in regions with different climate conditions and the distinctions of regional groundwater droughts caused by it have not been clearly understood more importantly as far as we know there is a lack of quantitative comparison of the effects of these factors namely meteorological variables teleconnection factors and anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought in order to fill this gap this study is conducted in the two largest and typical catchments in china with different climate conditions which are yangtze river catchments and yellow river catchments to analyze the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought and figure out the key influencing factors with quantitative comparison the yangtze river catchments yzrc with a humid climate condition is one of the catchments with the richest water storage in china however with climate change and the intensification of human activities the frequency and intensity of droughts and associated hazards in the catchments are increasing sun et al 2018 the yellow river catchments yrc belong to the arid semi arid climate condition where the agricultural irrigation and industry greatly depend on groundwater while the yrc has experienced serious groundwater depletion lin et al 2019 the systematic investigation about the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought is seldomly conducted in the two catchments especially in the yzrc therefore the main aim of this study is to improve the understanding about the characteristics and influencing factors of groundwater drought and further quantify the contribution of each factor to groundwater drought in the regions with different climate conditions namely yzrc and yrc to provide a reference for the other similar humid and arid semi arid catchments around the world the primary objectives of this study are 1 to identify the spatio temporal characteristics and evolution trend of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc during 2002 2020 2 to diagnose influencing factors including natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc of groundwater drought and the differences of their impacts in the two selected catchments 3 to quantitatively compare the contribution of each influencing factor to the development of groundwater drought in the two catchments the following sections are organized as follows section 2 describes the study area and data used in this study section 3 presents the adopted methodology results and discussion are respectively presented in section 4 and section 5 and conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the two largest catchments in china namely the yangtze river catchments yzrc and yellow river catchments yrc are selected in this study the yzrc 91 e 122 e 25 n 35 n is located in southern china with a humid climate condition xue et al 2017 it is the longest river in china with 1 800 000 km2 watershed area which accounts for one fifth of the area of china s territory long et al 2015 the terrain of the yzrc is high in the west and low in the east and the river originates from the tanggula range in western china and traversing 11 provinces from west to east fig 1 a the mean annual precipitation and air temperature in the yzrc from 2002 to 2019 are 1042 73 mm and 13 17 respectively the yrc 95 e 119 e 32 n 41 n is located in northern china with an arid semi arid climate condition zhang et al 2014a the yellow river is the second longest river in china with 795 000 km2 watershed area it originates from bayan har mountains on the qinghai tibet plateau and it flows through 9 provinces in china and finally empties into the bo sea fig 1 b the mean annual precipitation and air temperature in the yrc from 2002 to 2019 are 452 81 mm and 7 97 respectively 2 2 data 2 2 1 water storage anomaly gravity

classification and high spatial resolution and its high accuracy in china has been proved yang et al 2017 therefore it is suitable for the large scale and long term study of lulc change in the yzrc and yrc 3 methodology as mentioned above this study is aimed to identify the spatio temporal characteristics and evolution trend of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc during 2002 2020 evaluate the impact of influencing factors and quantitatively diagnose the key influencing factors therefore the following steps are conducted to accomplish the aims firstly gwsa is retrieved from grace and gldas secondly groundwater drought index based on grace derived gwsa is calculated to identify the groundwater drought at monthly scale thirdly the singular spectrum analysis ssa and mann kendall mk trend test are used to characterize the evolution trend of groundwater drought fourthly the pearson correlation analysis and cross wavelet transform are adopted to analyze the impact of influencing factors on the groundwater drought finally the random forest rf is utilized to quantitatively compare the contribution of each influencing factor to groundwater drought the flowchart of this study is presented in fig 2 it should be noted that the analysis in this study is conducted at catchment scale and grid scale to reveal the characteristic of temporal evolution and spatial distribution respectively the calculation at catchment scale is based on the time series derived from the average value of all the grids within the study area the calculation at grid scale is based on the time series of each grid which aims to derive its average value and show the differences among different grids 3 1 groundwater storage anomaly gwsa the grace twsa mainly concludes the change of groundwater soil moisture snow water and canopy water eq 1 in order to investigate the groundwater changes the groundwater storage anomaly gwsa in the study area can be obtained by deducting the contribution of the soil moisture storage anomaly smsa snow water equivalent anomaly swea and canopy water storage anomalies cwsa provided by gldas model therefore the anomaly in satellite based gwsa namely gwsa can be determined in equation 2 as follows 1 twsa g w s a s m s a s w e a c w s a 2 gwsa t w s a s m s a s w e a c w s a where smsa swa and swea are obtained from gldas noah 3 2 grace based groundwater drought index the grace based groundwater drought index namely dsi is utilized in this study to characterize groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc han et al 2019 the dsi is a standardized drought severity index exclusively based on grace derived gwsa which is a dimensionless quantity it is simpler to calculate and retained the seasonal characteristics of drought compared with ggdi proposed by thomas et al 2017 hence dsi is selected in this study to identify groundwater drought the dsi is defined as follows 3 ds i i j gws a i j gws a j σ j where i is the year ranging from 2002 to 2020 j is the month ranging from january to december gws a j and σ j are the mean and standard deviation of groundwater storage anomaly in month j respectively moreover the drought threshold of dsi is 0 8 lower than which means groundwater drought occurs 3 3 trend test 3 3 1 singular spectral analysis ssa in this study singular spectrum analysis ssa is used to identify the change process and trend item of dsi time series in the two catchments ssa is a tool to decompose a time series into components ordered by variance intensity vautard et al 1992 it is widely used to extract the trend especially non linear trend and leading oscillations of time signals or to eliminate noise the fundamental principle of ssa is to sample the time series into time lagged segments to get the correlation information among the segments and to reconstruct the time series based on the temporal correlation the detailed procedures of ssa are as follows the first step is to construct the trajectory matrix for the time series x x 1 x n the trajectory matrix of x can be constructed by follows 4 x x 1 x 2 x m x 2 x 3 x m 1 x l x l 1 x n where l n 1 m is the length of moving window the second step is singular value decomposition λ i and u i are the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix x x t respectively suppose d min l m and v i x t u i λ i i 1 d then x can be composed of elementary matrices 5 x x 1 x 2 x d where x i λ i u i v i t λ i is the singular spectrum of sequence x and the eigenvector corresponding to its maximum value is considered as the maximum variation trend of the signal the third step is grouping suppose i i 1 i p the matrix x i x i 1 x ip which corresponding to i can divide x into k disjoint matrices namely x x i 1 x ik the final step is reconstruction usually using the diagonal average method suppose l min l m m max l m and x ij x ij l m x ji l m x can be converted to the time series y 1 y n according to the diagonal average method 6 y m 1 m k 1 m x k m k 1 1 m l 1 l k 1 l x k m k 1 l m m 1 n 1 m k m 1 m n 1 m x k m k 1 m m n 3 3 2 mann kendall mk trend test the mann kendall mk trend test is adopted in this study to evaluate the overall trend of groundwater drought in the two catchments both at catchment scale and grid scale the mk trend test which is a nonparametric method is widely used to analyze the trend of time series ashraf et al 2021 kendall 1948 mann 1945 in this test there are two hypotheses the null hypothesis h 0 signifies no trend in the data and the alternative hypothesis h a signifies a presence of increasing or decreasing trend within the data algorithms used for mk trend test statistics s var and standardized test statistics z are as follows 7 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i 8 s g n x j x i 1 x j x i 0 0 x j x i 0 1 x j x i 0 9 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 10 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 where x i and x j are the time series monitoring data in sequential order n is the length of the time series t k is the number of the tie in the sample in the k th value and m is the numbers of tied variables if z z 1 α 2 h 0 is rejected and a significant trend exists within the data the positive value of the z means upward rising and a negative value means downward trend the significant level α is usually 0 01 and 0 05 and the corresponding z 1 α 2 is 2 5758 and 1 9600 respectively 3 4 evapotranspiration et estimation the generalized nonlinear form of the complementary principle which is based on the routine meteorological variables to estimate actual evapotranspiration is adopted in this study to derive the actual evapotranspiration namely et in the two catchments brutsaert 2015 the et can be calculated as follows 11 et e po e pa 2 2 e pa e po where e po is the evaporation that would take place from the same large surface as et when it is well supplied with water e pa is the potential evapotranspiration which can be estimated by penman monteith method allen et al 1998 12 e po α c δ δ γ r n g 13 e pa 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t a 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where α c is an adjustable parameter which is also the single parameter in the improved complementary relationship in this study α c in the yzrc and yrc is selected as 1 10 and 0 85 respectively which is based on the calibration of et observations obtained from water balance and flux stations in the two catchments li et al 2021 liu et al 2018a δ is the slope of the saturated water vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 γ is psychrometric constant kpa c 1 r n is net radiation at the crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 t a

deficit kpa the computation for e po e pa and all parameters involved follows the method and procedure given in chapter 3 of the fao paper 56 allen et al 1998 the data required for the calculations of e po e pa and parameters i e latitude elevation tmax tmin rhu ssd and win are obtained from meteorological stations in the two selected catchments provided by the cma https data cma cn 3 5 identification of impact of influencing factors on groundwater drought the pearson correlation analysis and the cross wavelet transform are selected to identify the impact of influencing factors on groundwater drought among them pearson correlation analysis is also used to identify other correlation relationships in this study for two elements x and y if their sample values are x i and y i i 1 2 n the pearson correlation coefficient between them is defined as follows 14 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 cross wavelet transform method is an effective signal analysis method which combines wavelet transform with cross spectrum analysis torrence and compo 1998 it can effectively analyze the correlation between two time series and can reveal the relationship between two sequences in time frequency domain from the perspective of multiple time scales grinsted et al 2004 moreover cross wavelet transform can reveal the region with the same energy spectrum after wavelet transform and consequently figure out the significance of the interaction between the two time series in different time frequency domain in this study the relationships between dsi and teleconnection factors in the two catchments are investigated by using cross wavelet transform the cross wavelet transform of the two time series x i and y i i 1 2 n can be described as w xy w x w y where denotes their complex conjugation the cross wavelet power is expressed as w xy the complex argument arg w xy can be regarded as the local relative phase between x i and y i in time and frequency domains the theoretical distribution of the cross wavelet power of the two time series with their background power spectra p k x and p k y is expressed as follows 15 d w n x s w n y s σ x σ y p z v p v p k x p k y where z v p is the confidence level associated with the probability p for a probability distribution function which is defined by the square root of two χ 2 distributions grinsted et al 2004 3 6 quantification of the contribution of influencing factors to groundwater drought the random forest rf algorithm is used to calculate importance scores for each influencing factor and consequently quantify the contribution of each influencing factor to groundwater drought in the two catchments rf is based on classification and regression trees and produces numerous independent trees to reach a final decision through randomization approach to the selection of training samples and the selection of variables at each node of a tree breiman 2001 variable importance is a weighted mean of the individual trees improvement in the splitting criterion produced by each variable liaw and wiener 2002 its rationale is the following by randomly permuting the predictor variable x j its original association with the response y is broken when the permuted variable x j together with the remaining unpermuted predictor variables is used to predict the response the prediction accuracy i e the number of observations classified correctly decreases substantially if the original variable x j was associated with the response thus a reasonable measure for variable importance is the difference in prediction accuracy before and after permuting x j in this study the predictor variables of rf are natural net recharge p et teleconnection factors enso pdo and ao and lulc and the response variable is the groundwater drought index namely dsi the variable importance score is used to determine which influencing factors have the most significant contribution to the development of groundwater drought this method is also adopted to explore what meteorological variables i e tmax tmin rhu ssd and win affect natural net recharge i e p et and how p et is affected by these meteorological variables in this study 4 results 4 1 spatio temporal characteristics of groundwater drought in the two catchments in order to investigate the spatio temporal characteristics and evolution trend of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 the grace based groundwater drought index namely dsi and trend test methods which are ssa and mk trend test are used in this study the accuracy of twsa derived from grace and the capability of grace based dsi to characterize groundwater drought in the two selected catchments during 04 2002 03 2020 have been verified in our previous study zhang et al 2021 4 1 1 temporal characteristics of groundwater drought fig 3 illustrates the temporal evolution characteristics of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 for the yzrc the dsi shows an upward trend with a linear tendency rate of 0 07 month indicating that the dsi identified groundwater drought is decreasing in the yzrc during 04 2002 03 2020 fig 3 a the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur from 2002 to 2009 fig 3 a the average value of dsi is 0 80 during 2002 2009 while it is 0 72 during 2010 2020 during 2002 2003 the dsi values are the lowest which indicates the yzrc experiences the most serious groundwater drought in this period fig 3 a furthermore ssa is used to reflect the variation characteristics of dsi trends a high consistency exists between the changes of dsi and ssa derived trend items in the period of 04 2002 to 03 2020 pearson correlation coefficient r reaching 0 78 under the significant level of p 0 01 from the ssa derived trend items it can be seen that dsi is increasing in the yzrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 moreover according to the mk trend test there is a significant upward trend z 13 02 in the dsi of the yzrc the upward trends of dsi obtained by ssa and mk trend test both indicate that the groundwater drought in the yzrc is gradually alleviating for the yrc the dsi shows a downward trend with a linear tendency rate of 0 04 month indicating that the dsi identified groundwater drought is increasing in the yrc during 04 2002 03 2020 fig 3 b the groundwater droughts in the yrc mainly occur from 2015 to 2020 fig 3 b the average value of dsi is 0 30 during 2002 2014 while it is 0 87 during 2010 2020 from 2017 to 2018 the dsi values are relatively low which means the groundwater drought during this period is more serious than that during other periods fig 3 b similar to the yzrc the changes of dsi and ssa derived trend items also show a high consistency with r reaching 0 91 under the significant level of p 0 01 for the period of 04 2002 to 03 2020 from the ssa derived trend items it can be seen that dsi is decreasing in the yrc from 04 2002 to 03 2020 according to the mk trend test there is a significant downward trend z 14 61 in the dsi of the yrc different from the decrease of groundwater drought in the yzrc the dsi trends in the yrc obtained by ssa and mk trend test are both downward which indicates that the groundwater drought in the yrc is gradually aggravating 4 1 2 spatial characteristics of groundwater drought since the groundwater droughts in the yzrc and yrc mainly occur in the periods of 2002 2009 and 2015 2020 respectively fig 3 the spatial distributions of groundwater droughts in these two periods in the two catchments are illustrated in fig 4 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc are mainly observed in the middle and southeast of the catchment involving sichuan yunnan chongqing guizhou hubei hunan and jiangxi provinces fig 4 a especially in the eastern part of sichuan middle and southern parts of chongqing and northern part of guizhou the lower values of dsi are observed fig 4 a for the yrc except for some regions on the southern edge of yrc the groundwater droughts are distributed in the almost whole catchment which includes all provinces in the catchment fig 4 b the lower values of dsi are distributed in the middle and eastern parts of the catchment which are the middle and northern parts of ningxia middle and northern parts of shaanxi most regions of shanxi and shandong within the catchment fig 4 b the dsi in the yrc ranges from 1 39 to 0 88 at grid scale while it in the yzrc ranges from 1 01 to 0 91 at grid scale moreover there are 53 59 grids with relatively low monthly average dsi 0 9 in the yrc while there are 2 43 grids with monthly average dsi values below 0 9 in the yzrc thus the groundwater droughts in the yrc are more serious and have a wider impact on the catchment than that in the yzrc the spatial distributions of groundwater droughts in these two periods namely2002 2003 in the yzrc and 2017 2018 in the yrc when the most serious groundwater droughts mainly occur in the two catchments fig 3 are shown in fig 5 the most serious groundwater droughts in the yzrc are mainly located in the northern part of the central catchment involving chongqing shaanxi hubei and henan provinces fig 5 a for the yrc the most serious groundwater droughts are distributed in the most regions of the catchment which includes qinghai sichuan gansu ningxia shaanxi and shanxi provinces fig 5 b moreover there are 75 58 grids with relatively low monthly average dsi 0 9 in the yrc while there are 54 26 grids with monthly average dsi values below 0 9 in the yzrc in general the most serious groundwater droughts in the yrc have a wider impact on the catchment than that in the yzrc the spatial distributions of dsi trend derived from mk trend test in the two catchments are displayed in fig 6 as shown in fig 6 a except for some regions in the upper reaches of the yzrc most regions in the catchment show a significant upward trend there are 71 grids with significant upward trend of dsi z 1 96 which indicates that groundwater droughts are gradually alleviating in most regions of the yzrc fig 6 b shows that except for some regions on the southern edge of yrc most regions in the catchment show a significant downward trend there are 88 grids with significant downward trend of dsi z 1 96 which indicates that groundwater droughts are increasing in most regions of the yrc during 04 2002 03 2020 han et al 2020 also found the downward trend during 2005 2013 in the loess plateau which is located in the upper and middle reaches of the yrc both in grace based groundwater drought index i e dsi and in situ groundwater table therefore the gradual mitigation of groundwater droughts in the yzrc and the aggravation of groundwater droughts in the yrc are also revealed at grid scale 4 2 impact of natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc on groundwater drought in the two catchments to further identify influencing factors of groundwater drought and the difference of their impacts in the regions with different climate conditions the impacts of factors namely natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc on groundwater drought are analyzed in two selected catchments 4 2 1 impact of natural net recharge on groundwater drought fig 7 displays the annual variations of dsi and p et in the yzrc and yrc as shown in fig 7 a the variations of dsi and p et in the yzrc are consistent and they both show an increasing trend from 2003 to 2019 dsi 0 16 yr p et 7 82 mm yr for instance p et increases during 2003 2005 and 2013 2017 meanwhile dsi also increases gradually during these periods based on pearson correlation coefficient dsi is significantly positively correlated with p et r 0 57 p 0 05 in the yzrc which indicates that the evolution of groundwater drought in the catchment is significantly affected by natural net recharge and the natural net recharge plays a promoting role in alleviating groundwater drought in the catchment it can be seen from fig 6 a that groundwater droughts in the middle and east of the yzrc show a trend of decreasing and fig 8 a and b shows that the average annual p et in these regions is relatively high during the period that groundwater drought mainly occurs in the northwest of the yzrc groundwater drought tends to intensify fig 6 a while p et is relatively low in these regions therefore sufficient and increasing natural recharge is one of the important reasons for alleviating groundwater drought in the middle and east of the yzrc fig 7 b shows that annual dsi in the yrc from 2003 to 2019 decreases obviously 0 11 yr while annual p et increases slightly from 2004 to 2019 2 31 mm yr additionally the dsi is negatively related to p et r 0 48 p 0 05 in the yrc which indicates that the slightly increased natural net recharge cannot mitigate the increase of groundwater drought in the yrc furthermore the average annual p et in the yrc which is 99 04 mm is much lower compared with that in the yzrc which is 451 32 mm besides it can be seen from fig 8 c and d that the average annual p et in all regions in the yrc is relatively low and the grids with the high values of average annual p et when groundwater drought mainly occurs which is from 2015 to 2019 are less than that from 2003 to 2014 when groundwater drought seldomly occurs there are 42 36 grids with relatively high p et which is higher than 400 mm from 2015 to 2019 while there are 43 38 grids with relatively high p et from 2003 to 2014 hence the intensification of groundwater drought in the yrc may not be able to be alleviated by the slightly increased but still relatively low natural net recharge in the catchment 4 2 2 impact of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought enso pdo and ao are selected in this study to characterize the influences of large scale climate indices on groundwater drought in the two selected catchments in order to reveal the impact of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought in the time frequency domain and its difference in the yzrc and yrc during 04 2002 03 2020 the cross wavelet transform method is utilized to avoid boundary effect and high frequency false information of the wavelet transform the thin solid line in fig 9 is the boundary of the cone of influence with effective spectral regions within it for the yzrc as shown in fig 9 a enso has a statistically significant correlation with dsi with a 14 20 months signal in 2014 2018 there is also a prominent and positive correlation between pdo and dsi in 2014 2018 with a 16 24 months signal fig 9 b fig 9 c shows that ao has a significant negative correlation with dsi with a 16 30 months signal in 2002 2020 in addition from 2002 to 2020 there is an intermittent low resonance period between dsi and teleconnection factors about 1 14 months in conclusion the statistically significant correlation between dsi and teleconnection factors implies teleconnection factors play an important role during the groundwater drought evolution in the yzrc and the impacts of ao on the groundwater droughts in the catchment are stronger than those of enso and pdo for the yrc enso has a statistically significant correlation with dsi with a 15 24 months signal in 2006 2012 fig 9 d similar to that in the yzrc the prominent correlation between pdo and dsi is also found in the same period when enso is significantly correlated with dsi there is also a prominent and positive correlation between pdo and dsi in 2006 2012 with a 32 50 months signal fig 9 e generally phase changes in the pdo have a propensity to coincide with changes of enso events where the positive phase of the pdo is associated with an enhanced frequency of el niño events while the negative phase is shown to be more favorable for the development of la niña events verdon and franks 2006 it may be the reason why pdo and enso have similar effects on dsi both in the two catchments fig 9 f shows that ao has a significant negative correlation with dsi with a 16 30 months signal in 2002 2020 and a 12 18 months signal in 2009 2011 additionally from 2002 to 2020 there is an intermittent low resonance period between dsi and teleconnection factors about 1 14 months similar to that in the yzrc a statistically significant correlation also exists between dsi and teleconnection factors in the yrc which indicates that teleconnection factors also play an important role during the groundwater drought evolution in the yrc different from that in the yzrc the impact of pdo on the groundwater droughts in the yrc is stronger than that of enso and ao 4 2 3 impact of lulc on groundwater drought the dominant lulc type in the yzrc from 2003 to 2019 is cropland which is in high water demand the cropland covers nearly half of the catchment area and accounts for 44 46 44 56 and 43 44 in 2003 2010 and 2019 which are randomly selected three years during 2003 2019 fig 10 fig 11 a c and e forest is the second in dominance which accounts for 35 77 35 31 and 35 81 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively followed by grassland which accounts for 17 07 16 97 and 16 87 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively fig 10 fig 11 a c and e as shown in fig 10 cropland is mainly distributed in the middle and east of the yzrc while forest is mainly in the middle north and west and grassland is mainly in the northwest of the catchment the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur in the middle and east of the catchment where is dominated by cropland and forest with high water demand except for irrigation which will increase the groundwater demand and thus reduce groundwater vegetation could absorb soil moisture and increase et which can lead to a decrease in groundwater recharge and consequently cause a decline in groundwater storage zhang and schilling 2006 moreover the coverage of urban shows a dramatic increase from 2003 to 2019 which increases by 91 58 between 2003 and 2010 and by 61 54 between 2010 and 2019 fig 11 g the expansion of urban will further increase the water demand which may exert pressure on groundwater system zhang et al 2014b it can be seen from fig 12 that groundwater drought in the yzrc is significantly negatively related to cropland area r 0 63 p 0 01 and grassland area r 0 87 p 0 01 while significantly positively correlated with urban area r 0 95 p 0 01 it should be noted that cropland and grassland exhibit a decrease of 2 29 and 1 20 from 2003 to 2019 fig 11 g as shown in fig 6 a dsi in most regions of the yzrc particularly the middle and east of the catchment presents an upward trend which means the groundwater droughts in the yzrc are decreasing chao et al 2020b also indicated that the groundwater storage in the yzrc from 2003 to 2015 was increased therefore the decrease of cropland and grassland will contribute to the alleviation of groundwater drought however urbanization in the yzrc may not have exacerbated the groundwater drought in the catchment for the yrc the dominant lulc type from 2003 to 2019 is grassland which covers nearly half of the catchment area and accounts for 48 23 48 68 and 48 76 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively fig 10 fig 11 b d and f cropland is second in dominance which accounts for 37 64 36 66 and 35 73 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively followed by forest which accounts for 9 77 9 76 and 9 83 in 2003 2010 and 2019 respectively fig 10 fig 11 b d and f grassland is mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest of the yrc while cropland is mainly in the southeast and northwest of the catchment and forest is mainly in the southeast of the catchment fig 10 during 2003 2019 the area of grassland forest and urban gradually increased while the area of cropland gradually decreased fig 11 h among them the urban area has a significant increase which increased by 150 between 2003 and 2010 and by 70 59 between 2010 and 2019 fig 12 shows that groundwater drought in the yrc is significantly positively correlated with cropland area r 0 93 p 0 01 while significantly negatively related to grassland area r 0 58 p 0 05 forest area r 0 65 p 0 01 and urban area r 0 95 p 0 01 as shown in fig 6 b the intensified trend of groundwater drought almost covers the whole catchment therefore the increase of grassland forest and urban area may aggravate groundwater drought while the decrease of cropland fails to reverse the groundwater drought increase in the yrc 4 3 contribution of each influencing factor to groundwater drought to further quantify the contribution of influencing factors which include p et lulc i e cropland forest grassland sparse vegetation urban unutilized and waters and teleconnection factors i e enso pdo and ao to groundwater drought and its differences in the two selected catchments the rf is used the contribution of various influencing factors to groundwater drought development is evaluated based on the variable importance scores obtained by the rf for the yzrc as shown in fig 13 a the lulc gets the relatively high variable importance particularly urban 0 61 and cropland 0 42 followed by p et 0 27 while the variable importance scores of teleconnection factors are much lower 0 05 it indicates that the impacts of lulc especially cropland and urban and p et on groundwater drought in the yzrc are stronger than teleconnection factors since p et can be the direct recharge of groundwater and the decrease of cropland could reduce the water demand the mitigation of groundwater drought in the yzrc is mainly because sufficient recharge can offset or even excessive groundwater discharge as for the cropland in the yzrc it was pointed out that groundwater could be recharged by irrigation return water in the catchment in some previous studies e g pan et al 2019 huang et al 2015 also indicated that the irrigation is the main contributor to the increase of groundwater in the yzrc although the variable importance of urban is high the increased dsi is positively related to the increased urban area which implies the urbanization in the yzrc does not deteriorate groundwater drought in the catchment it is probably due to the negative impacts of urbanization on groundwater drought is compensated by the plenitude and increase of p et in the yzrc in summary the dominant influencing factors corresponding to groundwater drought in the yzrc are p et and lulc for the yrc the lulc especially cropland 0 42 and urban 0 42 and p et 0 15 also get the relatively high variable importance moreover pdo which is included teleconnection factors obtains variable importance 0 11 that close to but slightly lower than that of p et hence as the contribution analysis revealed that the main influencing factors of groundwater drought in the yrc are lulc which mainly is the expansion of urban and p et while the impact corresponds to teleconnection factors especially pdo on groundwater drought in the yrc cannot be ignored which is different from that in the yzrc for the expansion of urban it can be explained that the groundwater withdrawal for urban production and livelihood which includes industry domestic public and eco environment was increased during 2003 2019 and it exerted considerable pressure on groundwater in yrc zhang et al 2021 as for the p et which is one of the main impact factors of groundwater drought both in the two catchments hu et al 2019 showed that natural recharge has much more control on groundwater than other natural factors however according to the aforementioned analysis the decreased dsi is negatively correlated with the increased p et and positively related to decreased cropland it indicates that the slightly increased but still relatively low p et and the decrease of cropland fail to reverse the aggravation of groundwater drought in the yrc 5 discussion 5 1 changes of groundwater storage in the two catchments the occurrence of groundwater drought reveals the decline in groundwater storage fig 14 shows the temporal and spatial variations of gwsa in the two catchments during 04 2002 03 2020 the gwsa in the yzrc at temporal scale ranging from 4 26 cm to 6 86 cm is relatively higher than that in the yrc ranging from 11 78 cm to 2 09 cm fig 14 a and c the trends of gwsa in the two catchments are opposite the overall trend of gwsa is upward in the yzrc which is 0 25 cm month while it is downward in the yrc which is 0 55 cm month it suggests that the groundwater storage in the yzrc is increasing while it is decreasing in the yrc some related studies also revealed the similar pattern in groundwater storage identified by grace or observations in the yzrc and yrc for instance chao et al 2020b indicated that there is an increasing trend in grace derived groundwater storage from 2003 to 2015 in the yzrc liu et al 2020 found that there is a rising trend in groundwater storage derived from grace from 2003 to 2012 in the yzrc and they verified it by using the unregulated river baseflow observations in the catchment lin et al 2019 pointed out that the groundwater storage monitored by grace in the yrc decreased significantly from 2010 to 2016 zhang et al 2019 also found that the groundwater table anomaly based on in situ observations and the grace groundwater storage anomaly in the yrc from 2005 to 2014 both showed a continuous decline in the study of yin et al 2021 they also indicated that the groundwater storage observed by grace during 04 2002 12 2016 in the yzrc is increasing and it in the yrc is decreasing and they verified it by groundwater resources published in bulletin at spatial scale the increasing gwsa distributes in most regions of yzrc especially in the middle part of the catchment which includes chongqing guizhou and hunan and there are 79 38 grids with increasing trend of gwsa in the catchment fig 14 b however most regions of yrc are occupied by the decreasing trend of gwsa particularly in the eastern part of the catchment which includes shanxi and henan fig 14 d there are 92 82 grids with decreasing trend of gwsa in the yrc the increase of gwsa in the yzrc further reveals the alleviation of groundwater drought in the catchment and the decline of gwsa in the yrc suggests the aggravation of groundwater drought in the catchment 5 2 integrated effects of natural net recharge and anthropogenic factors on groundwater drought in two catchments the main reason for groundwater drought is that groundwater recharge cannot offset groundwater discharge well li et al 2014 mishra and singh 2010 van lanen and peters 2000 as shown in the contribution analysis p et has relatively strong effect on groundwater drought in the two catchments however when diagnosing the impact of the influencing factors in yzrc and yrc it seems that there is a contradictory phenomenon which is that the p et is positively correlated with dsi in the yzrc a humid catchment while negatively related to dsi in the yrc an arid semi arid catchment according to our previous study the groundwater droughts in the yzrc and yrc especially the yrc are strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors namely exceeded groundwater withdrawal for human use zhang et al 2021 but the effects of natural net recharge and other anthropogenic factors for instance lulc on groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc are not taken into account in that study therefore the impacts of natural net recharge lulc and groundwater withdrawal for human use on the occurrence and development of groundwater droughts in the two catchments with different climate conditions are further investigated in this study for the yzrc the cropland and urban with high water demand are mainly distributed on the middle and lower reaches of the catchment where the groundwater consumption which is collected from yangtze river water resources bulletin http www cjw gov cn is relatively high in these regions fig 15 a b for instance the groundwater consumption in hunan province located in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment is 8 98 mm yr groundwater consumption per unit area during 2003 2009 and 7 59 mm yr during 2010 2019 while the groundwater consumption in qinghai province located in the upper reaches of the catchment is almost zero during 2003 2019 but in the regions with relatively high groundwater consumption during 2003 2009 p et is relatively low fig 8 a b the groundwater droughts in the yzrc from 2003 to 2009 are probably due to the low natural net recharge during this period which could not offset the amount of groundwater extracted however the decreasing trend of groundwater droughts shown in most regions of yzrc and the positive correlation between p et and dsi indicate the natural net recharge replenished the groundwater storage and thus mitigated groundwater drought in the catchment besides as shown in fig 16 the groundwater recharge rate in the yzrc is relatively high especially in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment which is generally higher than 100 mm yr it further reveals the groundwater recharge is sufficient in the yzrc and it is important for the decrease of groundwater drought in the catchment for the yrc the groundwater consumption which is collected from yellow river water resources bulletin http www yrcc gov cn is generally much higher than that in the yzrc especially in the middle and lower reaches of the catchment fig 15 c and d as mentioned in section 1 groundwater is a critical water resource in the yrc fig 15 c and d shows that the middle and lower reaches of the yrc are the regions with dense cropland and urban where the groundwater consumption is higher than 14 mm yr and even higher than 30 mm yr in some areas such as henan province as mentioned above the decline in the cropland is not able to reverse the aggravation of groundwater drought in recent years the yrc zhang et al 2021 also found that the groundwater consumption in the yrc was maintained at a stable and relatively high level during 2003 2019 although the cropland area was decreasing it is worth noting that the proportion of grassland in the yrc is quite high which is conducive to groundwater recharge because of the relatively strong infiltration capacity of grassland adane and gates 2015 moreover except for natural net recharge agricultural irrigation reflux can also recharge the groundwater storage liu et al 2018b however it can be seen from fig 16 that the groundwater recharge rate is relatively low in the yrc it is lower than 100 mm yr and even lower than 20 mm yr in some regions it is probably mainly due to the quite low natural recharge in the catchment as shown in fig 7 b and fig 8 c and d that the natural net recharge in the yrc is much lower than that in the yzrc which is mainly due to the quite low precipitation and relatively high et in the yrc the average annual precipitation in the yrc is 0 43 of that in the yzrc while the average annual et in the yrc is 0 61 of that in the yzrc p yrc 452 81 mm yr yzrc 1042 73 mm yr et yrc 357 29 mm yr yzrc 586 17 mm yr considering the important role of groundwater extraction in the two catchments the contribution of groundwater consumption gwc to groundwater drought is analyzed along with other influencing factors mentioned before which are p et lulc and teleconnection factors as shown in fig 17 similar to the results mentioned in section 4 3 p et and lulc are still important influencing factors in the two catchments moreover the effect of teleconnection factors especially pdo on groundwater drought in the yrc cannot be ignored fig 17 b the difference is that the addition of gwc reduces the importance of other variables gwc has relatively high importance in the two catchments in the yzrc the importance of gwc 0 20 is only slightly lower than that of p et 0 23 fig 17 a for the yrc the importance of gwc 0 14 is slightly lower than that of p et 0 17 and obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors enso 0 06 pdo 0 10 ao 0 06 fig 17 b it further reveals that the groundwater withdrawal for human use exerts an enormous function on groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc in addition vegetation in the yrc which mainly are forest and grassland increases from 2003 to 2019 fig 11 h which is mainly due to the vegetation restoration plan in the catchment lu et al 2018 however increased vegetation can increase the water storage capacity of the upper layer of soil thus slower the infiltration of rainfall and irrigation water through the shallow layer of soil to the deep layer and consequently lead to the decline of groundwater recharge a et al 2019 in the yzrc although the forest coverage rate is high the natural recharge in the catchment is sufficient and the precipitation soil moisture and surface water are relatively rich liu et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 which play a role in promoting the high groundwater recharge rate on the other hand the infiltration capacity of the yrc dominated by sand is usually stronger than that of the yzrc dominated by clay fig 18 because sand generally has a higher infiltration rate due to its higher porosity mamedov et al 2001 nevertheless the quite low groundwater recharge rate indicates that the relatively limited natural net recharge in the yrc may prevent the increase of infiltration rate and thus negatively affected the groundwater recharge rate in the catchment furthermore the water retaining capacity of clay is commonly higher than that of sand combined with rich surface water in the yzrc mentioned above which could reduce groundwater discharge for surface water in the catchment and is beneficial to groundwater recharge in summary the scarcity of recharge for groundwater in the yrc coupled with rapid vegetation restoration which probably further reduce groundwater recharge and relatively high groundwater consumption ultimately lead to the intensification of groundwater drought in the catchment 5 3 differences between the crucial teleconnection factors affecting groundwater drought in the yzrc and the yrc as analyzed in section 4 2 2 the main teleconnection factors that influence groundwater droughts in the yzrc and yrc are different for the yzrc ao plays an important role in the development of groundwater droughts in the yzrc while pdo has a quite strong impact on groundwater droughts in the yrc tremblay et al 2011 indicated that groundwater in the region with humid climate condition is more susceptible to ao besides ao has a strong linkage with the southern branch trough which can bring more moisture transport and cause active synoptic scale disturbances in vertical motion over central southern china and thus provoke more extreme precipitation events there mao et al 2011 the increase in precipitation will improve the recharge of groundwater therefore the effect of ao on the groundwater droughts in the yzrc humid catchments located in southern china is relatively strong for the yrc over the catchment lies an anomalously high mean sea level pressure center which can be strongly affected by pdo and result in a dynamical set up that involves anomalous northerlies and subsidence conducive to a reduction in precipitation and consequently decrease groundwater storage over the catchment gao et al 2015 hence the influence of pdo is greater in the yrc compared with that of enso and ao in addition contribution analysis shows that teleconnection factors have stronger effect on groundwater drought in the yrc an arid semi arid catchment in northern china compared with that in the yzrc humid catchment in southern china some related studies indicated that there is a closer linkage between teleconnection factors and drought that occurred in northern china ma 2007 qian and zhou 2014 huang et al 2017 also pointed out that the arid region is more sensitive to the changes in atmospheric circulation 5 4 influences of meteorological variables on natural net recharge as we know that changes of natural net recharge are closely related to other meteorological variables such as maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin saturated vapor pressure svp relative humidity rhu sunshine duration ssd and wind speed win these meteorological variables are able to indirectly affect groundwater by influencing p and et kumar 2012 to further understand the effects of these meteorological variables on the p et and their difference under different climate conditions the contributions of annual tmax tmin svp rhu ssd and win to annual p et are quantified and compared in the two selected catchments as shown in fig 19 a p et in the yzrc is most sensitive to ssd with variable importance of 0 51 followed by rhu and svp with variable importance of 0 22 and 0 17 respectively similar to that in the yzrc ssd variable importance 0 17 and rhu variable importance 0 10 also have a significant influence on p et in the yrc especially ssd fig 19 b it is different that another major factor affecting p et in the yrc is win variable importance 0 07 rather than svp and the difference is shown in the effects of these two factors on et fig 20 it is mainly because the relatively high svp values in humid areas have a strong control effect on the variations of evapotranspiration jhajharia et al 2012 while in arid semi arid regions changes in wind speed affect evapotranspiration with more severity eslamian et al 2011 ssd has significant negative effect on p et both in the two catchments yzrc r 0 51 p 0 05 yrc r 0 50 p 0 05 in the two catchments ssd is negatively correlated with p yzrc r 0 41 p 0 05 yrc r 0 44 p 0 08 while positively related to et yzrc r 0 83 p 0 05 yrc r 0 50 p 0 05 fig 20 the decreased ssd mainly increases p et by increasing p and reducing et in the two catchments fig 21 e and g fig 22 e and g some related studies also pointed out that shorter ssd leads to more frequent p and less et han et al 2018 zongxing et al 2012 rhu is significantly positively related to p et in the two catchments yzrc r 0 62 p 0 05 yrc r 0 57 p 0 05 it is significantly positively correlated with p in the two catchments yzrc r 0 61 p 0 05 yrc r 0 60 p 0 05 it is mainly due to rhu plays a major role in the formation of p nojarov 2012 in addition the increased rhu has a weak negative effect on the slight decreased et in the yzrc r 0 12 p 0 65 while the decreased rhu positively affects the decreased et in the yrc r 0 30 p 0 24 the main reason is that the increases in relative humidity greatly reduce the evapotranspiration potential gong et al 2006 in summary ssd and rhu are the main meteorological variables which have vital influence on p et both in the two selected catchments while the other key variables affects p et in the yzrc and yrc is svp and win respectively these meteorological variables could directly affect p et and consequently indirectly influence groundwater droughts in the two catchments as a case study in the two largest catchments in china this study preliminarily investigates the influencing factors which mainly are meteorological variables i e p et teleconnection factors i e enso pdo and ao and lulc i e cropland forest grassland sparse vegetation urban unutilized and waters of groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc the identification of groundwater drought in this study is based on grace due to the data limitation which mainly is the lacking of groundwater observations but in the future we hope well observations can be accessed furthermore in addition to the data limitation there may be other factors such as the increased area of the impervious layer as a result of urbanization and the changes of surface runoff affecting groundwater drought which is not considered in this study han et al 2017 wang et al 2021 a more comprehensive analysis of the influencing factors on groundwater drought in the regions with different climate conditions is to be further investigated in the future 6 conclusions in this study the grace based groundwater drought index i e dsi was utilized as a metric to characterize the groundwater drought in the two largest catchments in china namely yzrc and yrc the evolution trend of groundwater drought in the two catchments was identified at temporal and spatial scales by ssa and mk trend test the influencing factors which include natural net recharge teleconnection factors and lulc of groundwater drought and the difference of their impacts in the two selected catchments were analyzed additionally the contribution of each influencing factor to the groundwater drought in the two catchments was quantified and compared by rf the primary conclusions are as follows 1 from 2002 to 2020 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc mainly occur from 2002 to 2009 while for the yrc groundwater droughts mainly occur from 2015 to 2020 the groundwater droughts in the yzrc show a decreasing trend while they show an increasing trend in the yrc the groundwater droughts in the yzrc are mainly observed in the middle and east of the catchment and the groundwater droughts in most regions of the yzrc are generally mitigating while in the upper reaches of the catchment the groundwater droughts show an increasing trend the groundwater droughts in the yrc are almost distributed in the whole catchment and they are experiencing aggravation 2 the natural net recharge namely p et has a significant positive impact on the groundwater drought in the yzrc the sufficient and increasing p et plays a promoting role in alleviating groundwater drought in the yzrc for the yrc although p et has a slight increase its relatively low values cannot mitigate the increase of groundwater drought in the catchment among teleconnection factors i e enso pdo and ao ao has the strongest effect on groundwater drought in the yzrc while pdo has the most significant impact on the groundwater drought in the yrc for the changes of lulc the decrease of cropland and grassland have an obvious contribution to the decrease of groundwater drought in the yzrc while the increase of urban seems not to aggravate the groundwater drought in the catchment for the yrc the increase of grassland forest and the urban area has a strong effect on the increase of groundwater drought but the decrease of cropland is not able to reverse the aggravation of groundwater drought in the catchment 3 in terms of the quantitative comparison of the influencing factors for the yzrc the crucial influencing factors of groundwater drought are p et and lulc for the yrc the lulc and p et are also the important influencing factors of the groundwater drought in the catchment but different from the yzrc the influence of teleconnection factors on groundwater drought in the yrc cannot be ignored while it is weaker than that of lulc and p et furthermore it should be noted that groundwater exploitation is important for the groundwater drought in the yzrc and yrc it exerts considerable pressure on groundwater system in the yzrc and yrc especially when natural net recharge is insufficient based on the quantitative contribution analysis which takes groundwater exploitation into account the importance of groundwater exploitation is slightly lower than that of p et while obviously higher than that of teleconnection factors both in the yzrc and yrc data availability statement in situ meteorological variables observations are
