11525,ground cover rice production systems gcrps have been shown to both save water and increase yields compared to traditional paddy rice production systems tprps physiological processes and mechanisms explaining the superiority of a popular gcrps were investigated in a series of hydroponic soil column and field experiments soil water temperature and nitrogen leaf gas exchange plant water and nitrogen growth and yield transpiration and water productivity were analyzed compared to tprps plant available soil inorganic nitrogen was generally improved under gcrps due to a combination of higher soil temperature and less nitrogen loss through non physiological water consumption especially during the early growing season consequently more nitrogen was absorbed by plants under gcrps except serious drought conditions accompanied by higher nitrogen contents in plant tissues preferable specific leaf nitrogen might lead to higher leaf photosynthetic rate under optimal water conditions and less decrease relative to leaf transpiration rate under water stress therefore rice under gcrps grew faster with much more biomass and grain yield while transpiration consumption was limited in spite of the fact that the number of tillers and therefore leaf area were increased relative to tprps resulting in superior water productivity compared to tprps the root system under gcrps was limited but it could absorb enough water and nutrients especially nitrogen to support a relatively large canopy even when under water stress which might be attributed to its higher nitrogen content and thus stronger activity keywords leaf gas exchange root uptake capacity specific leaf nitrogen specific root nitrogen water use efficiency 1 introduction rice is the major staple food for more than 50 of the world s population accounting for approximately 20 of total energy intake and an annual increase of 8 10 million t is estimated as necessary to meet future needs seck et al 2012 asia produces about 75 of the world s rice while consuming 45 of its total fresh water resources bouman and tuong 2001 bouman et al 2007 it is estimated that about 15 20 million ha of irrigated rice will suffer from water scarcity by 2025 tuong and bouman 2003 as the largest rice producer in the world china cultivates 29 million ha of rice representing about 30 of its total farmland and consuming about 70 of its total agricultural water resources zhang 2007 water shortage in china is estimated to reach 400 billion m3 by 2050 roughly corresponding to 80 of its current annual capacity tso 2004 global rice production predominantly depends on traditional paddy rice production systems tprps where a standing water layer is always maintained except during the drying field periods and water consumption per unit area is about 3 5 times that of alternative dry land crop production systems bouman and tuong 2001 therefore exploring a high efficient rice production technology to meet the requirements of increasing production coupled with decreasing water consumption is necessary designed to promote water conservation one kind of ground cover rice production system gcrps with some strip soil beds mulched by plastic film and on which there is not a standing water layer even when irrigation is implemented through the surrounding furrows has been successfully applied in more than 4 million ha in china lin et al 2002 liu et al 2013 tao et al 2014 this popular gcrps was initially introduced in the mountainous regions of central china in 1980s to overcome both limitations of low temperatures during the early growing season and seasonal water shortages lin et al 2002 compared with tprps the significant differences for gcrps lie in the transformation of root zone soil water status from completely saturated and anaerobic to unsaturated and aerobic and an increased temperature in the near surface soil layer especially during the early growing season tao et al 2015 in recent years with the rapid expansion of gcrps efforts have been made by many researchers to investigate this novel system regarding water consumption plant growth yield formation leaf gas exchange water use efficiency wue etc except for cases when temperature was not the main limitation for rice growth at the beginning of vegetation period such as in southeast china xu et al 2007a b zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 previous studies have indicated significant promotion of shoot growth and grain yield under gcrps while non physiological water losses the sum of runoff deep drainage and evaporation and even transpiration consumption were reduced in comparison to tprps liu et al 2005b li et al 2007 fan et al 2012 qu et al 2012 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2014 tao et al 2014 2015 jin et al 2016 the superior water productivity of gcrps especially resulted from the increased yield while decreased transpiration consumption is inspiring since it is completely different from most dryland crops production systems water productivity can be improved under appropriate water stress conditions when plant growth and thus grain yield are reduced at a lower rate than transpiration however its attractiveness is offset and discredited as the accompanying economic costs of the reduced yields become inhibitory liu et al 2005a zhang et al 2008 lei et al 2009 matsuo et al 2010 the superior water productivity of rice under gcrps is likely due to the integrated effects of soil water and temperature conditions firstly under gcrps increased soil temperature and decreased soil water content might directly impact rice tillering and root lengthening shimono et al 2002 nagasuga et al 2011 secondly the changed soil water and temperature conditions and therefore the changed soil nutrient e g nitrogen conditions under gcrps might also influence water and nutrient uptake and their contents in the plant itself liu et al 2003 fan et al 2005 for many kinds of plant such as wheat and american elm positive correlation has been found between wue evaluated on transpiration and specific leaf nitrogen morgan 1984 heitholt 1989 reich et al 1989 shi et al 2014 as well as between root uptake activity and nitrogen content in roots shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 however the physiological processes and mechanisms driving rice under gcrps to produce more biomass and even grain yield along with less transpiration are not clear and have yet to be determined this study consequently was driven by the hypothesis that the higher water productivity under gcrps could be attributed to preferable nitrogen contents in soil and thus in plant tissues resulting from the corresponding soil water and temperature conditions taking tprps as a control three experiments hydroponic soil column and field were conducted to explore possible physiological processes and mechanisms for the water saving and yield increasing characteristics of gcrps by analyzing the dynamics of soil water and temperature conditions root and shoot growth water and nitrogen uptake soil and plant nitrogen contents gas exchange and their interrelationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment exp 1 a field experiment in a randomized block design with three replications described in detail by jin et al 2016 was conducted to investigate the superior water productivity of ground cover rice production system gcrps at fangxian agricultural bureau farm in shiyan hubei province china before transplanting basal fertilizers 150 kg n ha 1 as urea 45 kg p ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and 45 kg k ha 1 as potassium chloride were applied for 9 independent plots 9 m wide by 10 m long and each plot was separated into five strip soil beds 1 56 m in width and 9 4 m in length surrounded by 0 15 m wide and 0 15 m deep furrows six plots were randomly chosen for gcrps where the soil beds were covered with 5 Î¼m thick and 1 7 m wide plastic film twenty five day old rice seedlings oryza sativa l cv yixiang 3728 were transplanted into soil beds on 28 april 2013 and 29 april 2014 and were harvested on 10 september 135 days after transplanting 135 dat and 19 september 143 dat respectively the three plots without plastic film were prepared for traditional paddy rice production system tprps where irrigation was applied to maintain an average water layer on the soil beds between 2 and 5 cm thick the three plots with plastic film for gcrpssat were irrigated intermittently through the furrows to keep the average root zone 0 40 cm soil layer soil water content close to saturation while without a standing water layer on the soil beds the remaining three plots with plastic film were managed identically to gcrpssat until mid tillering and afterwards transient irrigation was intermittently implemented to fully fill the furrows when the measured average root zone water content reached approximately 80 of field water capacity gcrps80 for all the three treatments irrigation was forbidden during the drying field periods 66 72 and 113 135 dat in 2013 78 85 and 121 143 dat in 2014 soil water content under gcrps was measured every 2 days with a capacitance probe diviner 2000 sentek inc australia at 10 cm intervals from surface to 60 cm depth soil temperature at the depths of 5 with 3 replications 10 and 20 cm only one replication was measured hourly by a multipoint temperature instrument cb 0221 yaxin china for each treatment after 85 dat in 2014 some failure of the temperature probes at 10 and 20 cm occurred resulting in incomplete data plants were sampled during the mid

included leaf area shoot biomass stomatal conductance leaf transpiration and photosynthetic rates root growth and distribution and grain yield water potential of sampled flag leaves under each treatment was measured using a dewpoint potential meter wp4 decagon inc usa nitrogen contents in shoots and roots were measured by an element analyzer ea1108 fisons instruments italy with their samples powered by a ball mill mm200 retsch inc germany specific leaf nitrogen mg n cm 2 was estimated by dividing nitrogen mass in shoots with leaf area shi et al 2014 and specific root nitrogen mg n m 1 was determined by dividing nitrogen mass in roots with root length the increase of total nitrogen mass in both shoots and roots was taken as plant nitrogen uptake between two sampling events inorganic nitrogen concentrations in sampled soil solution and runoff water were measured with a continuous flow analyzer traacs 2000 bran luebbe norderstedt germany field scale transpiration was estimated through water balance calculation jin et al 2016 water use efficiency kg m 3 was evaluated in two ways first by dividing the increase of total biomass with the corresponding transpiration between two sampling events wuet b and secondly by dividing grain yield with total transpiration over the growth season wuet y according to the data regarding plant nitrogen uptake transpiration and inorganic nitrogen concentration in soil solution dimensionless root nitrogen uptake factors Î´ were estimated for various growth stages as follows shi et al 2007 shi and zuo 2009 zhu et al 2010 shi

column experiment with simplified soil water and nitrogen consumption processes also described in detail by jin et al 2016 was conducted to verify the results found in exp 1 such as the difference of plant physiological traits and soil inorganic nitrogen contents between gcrps and tprps a single germinated rice same cultivar with that in exp 1 seed was directly transplanted into each soil column on 8 may 2013 and cultivated until 15 august 99 dat basal fertilizers were applied for all columns as described in exp 1 plants were uniformly cultured with a thin water layer over the soil surface until 22 dat when specific irrigation treatments were initialized the three treatments of tprps gcrpssat and gcrps80 were managed similarly to those in exp 1 through surface irrigation an additional treatment of gcrpsfwc where the lower threshold for average root zone soil water content was field water capacity was included a total of 4 sampling events were carried out on 39 59 79 and 99 dat and the measured parameters and methods were kept same with those in exp 1 jin et al 2016 2 3 hydroponic experiment exp 3 a hydroponic experiment with rice same cultivar as that in exp 1 cultured in nutrient solution was conducted to investigate the relationship between root uptake capacity and specific root nitrogen as well as between leaf photosynthetic rate and specific leaf nitrogen on 18 november 2012 germinated seeds were transferred into quartz sand saturated without a standing water layer with the half strength nutrient solution in yoshida et al 1976 which contained mg l 1 n 40 p 10 k 40 ca 40 mg 40 si 56 mn 0 5 mo 0 05 b 0 2 zn 0 01 cu 0 01 fe 2 on 16 december 2012 seedlings were randomly transferred into 45 plastic buckets 21 cm in height 15 cm bottom diameter and 19 cm upper diameter filled with the full strength nutrient solution in yoshida et al 1976 except nitrogen each bucket was covered by a foam board on which 3 holes 2 cm in diameter were bored symmetrically to fix 3 seedlings with sponge totally 15 treatments were designed with 3 replications including 3 n combinations 100 0 50 50 0 100 of 2 nitrogen forms nh4 n no3 n and 5 nitrogen concentrations 10 20 40 80 and 120 mg l 1 the solution in each bucket was replaced every 2 days and fresh air was injected continuously with a compressor the ph value of solution was kept around 5 5 and 0 84 mg l 1 dicyandiamide was added to limit nitrification gao et al 2010 during the entire experimental period from 16 december 2012 to 30 january 2013 45 dat the growth conditions in greenhouse were kept as photosynthetic photon flux density of 500 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 over plants for 12 h per day from 8 00 to 20 00 day night air temperature of 25 18 2 c relative humidity of 50 5 all the buckets with plants were weighed daily at around 18 00 and daily evapotranspiration was determined according to water loss daily transpiration was estimated as the difference of evapotranspiration from evaporation which was approximated by weighing three equally equipped buckets located under the canopies while without plants in addition to an initial sampling before transplanting a total of 3 sampling events were carried out on 13 29 and 45 dat corresponding to the main growth stages of early mid and max tillering respectively at each sampling event three duplicate plants under each treatment were randomly chosen to measure photosynthetic rates of flag leaves between 9 00 11 00 by a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor usa with 500 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 active radiation 400 Î¼mol s 1 air flow rate and 370 Î¼mol mol 1 ambient co2 leaf area root length dry weight and nitrogen content in roots and shoots were measured as described in exp 1 root water and nitrogen uptake capacity was estimated by dividing the total transpiration and the increase of plant nitrogen mass with the average root length between two sampling events 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance was performed with the general linear model procedure glm of statistical software package spss 20 0 international business machines corporation usa the statistical model included sources of variation due to year treatment and their interaction one way analysis of variance f statistic was adopted to evaluate the effects on the studied parameters with the least significant difference lsd at 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 soil water and temperature conditions under gcrps under tprps soil was assumed to be saturated except during the drying field periods 66 72 and 113 135 dat in 2013 78 85 and 121 143 dat in 2014 in exp 1 under the two gcrps treatments the root zone 0 40 cm was essentially unsaturated except during the early growth period about 1 34 dat and occasionally during rainfall fig 1 a and b under gcrpssat the root zone soil water content was basically stable except during the drying field periods with an average value of around 0 41 cm3 cm 3 corresponding to 87 of the average root zone saturated water content the average root zone soil water content under gcrps80 fluctuated between 0 24 cm3 cm 3 and saturation with a mean of 0 33 cm3 cm 3 corresponding to 82 of the average root zone field water capacity in exp 2 average soil water content of about 0 45 cm3 cm 3 was consistently maintained under gcrpssat corresponding to 88 of the saturated water content fig 1c under gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 starting at saturation soil water content declined slowly from 22 to 58 dat and then was maintained at an average of 0 26 cm3 cm 3 108 of the field water capacity and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 89 of the field water capacity respectively significant difference in soil temperature was not found between the gcrps treatments thus their average was analyzed in exp 1 soil temperature under gcrps was about 13 higher than that under tprps before mid tillering in both 2013 and 2014 fig 1d and e afterwards the warming effect under gcrps weakened and even disappeared with plant growth in exp 2 there was also a warming effect under gcrps compared to tprps with soil temperatures averaging no more than 5 higher before mid tillering fig 1f 3 2 plant responses to gcrps root sampling was implemented only at maturity in 2013 while in 2014 a longer period was covered in exp 1 since no significant differences were found between the comparable stages in the two years for root parameters such as biomass length and specific root nitrogen table 1 the 2014 root system data alone are presented and further analyzed no significant difference was found between the two years and interaction was not found between years and treatments for all the other parameters including growth and physiological measurements jin et al 2016 therefore average values of these parameters from the two growing seasons of exp 1 are depicted in this study 3 2 1 plant water and nitrogen status during the early growth period before mid tillering in exp 1 and early tillering in exp 2 no significant difference was found in leaf water potential between treatments but afterwards the potential decreased as average root zone soil water content fig 2 a and b compared to gcrps80 and tprps in exp 1 there was a larger difference between gcrps80 gcrpsfwc and tprps in exp 2 indicating that plants under gcrps80 gcrpsfwc in exp 2 suffered more serious water stress than gcrps80 in exp 1 specific leaf nitrogen under all gcrps treatments was consistently higher than under tprps but the superiority weakened with plant growth or water stress duration fig 2c and d under gcrps80 or gcrpsfwc specific root nitrogen was generally higher than that for tprps and gcrpssat with the superiority increasing with plant growth fig 2e and f 3 2 2 leaf gas exchange during mid tillering stage in exp 1 and early tillering stage in exp 2 no significant difference was found in leaf transpiration rates between treatments while the leaf photosynthetic rates under all gcrps treatments were higher than those under tprps fig 3 at later growth stages leaf gas exchange under gcrps was significantly limited as a function of the lower average root zone soil water content with the effect on leaf transpiration rate being much more significant than that on leaf photosynthetic rate 3 2 3 plant growth and yield in exp 1 root length and biomass growth were stimulated under gcrps during the early growth stage at subsequent growth stages the superiority diminished and the situation was reversed for the case of development of relatively serious water stress under gcrps80 fig 4 a and c shoot biomass and leaf area growth under all gcrps treatments nevertheless was always more vigorous than under tprps throughout the growing season fig 4c and e this trend also diminished with plant growth or water stress duration under gcrps relative to tprps the mean increase in leaf area index and biomass of shoots under gcrps reached 92 9 and 108 9 at mid tillering and fell to 43 7 and 20 9 at anthesis stage finally grain yield under gcrps was significantly around 11 6 greater than that under tprps in exp 1 table 2 the effect of gcrps on plant growth was verified in exp 2 with obvious relative limitations due to water stress fig 4b d and f 3 2 4 plant water and nitrogen uptake compared to tprps transpiration under gcrps was somewhat higher before max tillering and was much lower during the longer later period from panicle initiation to maturity in exp 1 fig 5 a seasonal transpiration significantly decreased 6 1 under gcrpssat and 9 7 under gcrps80 while no significant difference was found between the two gcrps treatments table 2 the limitation of water stress on transpiration was more obvious in exp 2 with decreases of 9 2 under gcrpsfwc and 27 5 under gcrps80 fig 5b and table 2 transpiration under gcrpssat was not different with that under tprps nitrogen uptake under gcrps was significantly enhanced in comparison to tprps throughout the growing season in exp 1 fig 5c but the superiority weakened with plant growth or water stress duration relative to tprps the positive effect of gcrps on nitrogen uptake was verified under gcrpssat in exp 2 but significant limitation occurred after max tillering under gcrps80 fig 5d 3 2 5 water productivity in exp 1 and 2 wuet b under gcrps was significantly enhanced before panicle initiation in comparison to tprps but no significant difference was found during the following periods fig 6 compared with 2 41 kg m 3 for tprps in exp 1 average seasonal wuet b under gcrpssat 2 97 kg m 3 and gcrps80 3 07 kg m 3 was enhanced 23 2 and 27 4 respectively table 2 throughout the experimental period in exp 2 wuet b under tprps was 4 28 kg m 3 while it increased 8 4 4 64 kg m 3 9 9 4 74 kg m 3 and 20 5 5 25 kg m 3 under gcrpssat gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 respectively table 2 finally wuet y under gcrps in exp 1 was enhanced about 19 8 table 2 3 3 effects of plant nitrogen status on root uptake and leaf photosynthesis results from exp 3 indicated that leaf photosynthetic rates of flag leaves fig 7 a increased in a manner approximately proportional to specific leaf nitrogen r2 0 39 root water nitrogen uptake capacity fig 7b also increased linearly r2 0 76 and 0 69 respectively with specific root nitrogen regardless of nitrogen form concentration in nutrient solution or experimental period 4 discussion under proper except extreme drought conditions higher water productivity has been found for many kinds of crops with less relative decrease in dry matter or grain yield compared to transpiration liu et al 2005a zhang et al 2008 lei et al 2009 matsuo et al 2010 besides the contribution of transpiration limited by drought higher water productivity under gcrps in comparison to tprps fig 6 and table 2 was also partially due to the higher dry matter and grain yield jin et al 2016 the reduction of transpiration consumption under gcrps resulted from the bigger decrease in leaf transpiration rate than the increase in leaf area although transpiration decreased relatively later figs fig 33a and b and fig 44e and f similarly the enhancement of rice growth under gcrps was attributed to the later and less decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate fig 3c and d than the increase in leaf area fig 4e and f during the early growth season root zone soil water content under all the treatments was completely or nearly saturated fig 1a c and thus plant water potential under gcrps was maintained similar to that under tprps fig 2a and b and leaf scale transpiration was not affected fig 3a and b leaf photosynthetic rate under gcrps however was enhanced in comparison to tprps fig 3c and d which might be related to its higher specific leaf nitrogen figs fig 22c and d and fig 77a this result concurs with previous findings for sunflower connor et al 1993 and several c3 species such as rice evans 1989 and winter wheat shi et al 2014 with larger leaf area than tprps fig 4e and f transpiration fig 5a and b was enhanced under gcprs but dry matter accumulation was enhanced even more fig 4c and d resulting in higher wue fig 6 this result supports popular reports regarding linear relationships between wue and specific leaf nitrogen shi et al 2014 although root zone soil water content under all the treatments was similar during the early growth season soil temperature under tprps was always lower than 25 c fig 1d f which might be unfavorable for rice growth shimono et al 2002 nagasuga et al 2011 stuerz et al 2014 under gcrps this increased soil temperature might be responsible for the faster growth of roots and shoots fig 4 stress from low soil temperatures might inhibit root lengthening and branching by slowing auxin transport in root system nagasuga et al 2011 higher soil temperature might impact shoot meristem near soil surface so as to promote tillering shimono et al 2002 and leaf growth stuerz et al 2014 the tiller numbers under gcrps treatments in both exp 1 and 2 were increased by 41 6 66 8 compared to those under tprps in spite of this the higher soil inorganic nitrogen content and potential more nitrogen uptake found under gcrps fig 8 might also be important for rice growth xu et al 2014 influenced by the sharp decrease of non physiological water consumption the sum of surface evaporation deep percolation and runoff under gcrps jin et al 2016 nitrogen loss through mass flow was remarkably limited tan et al 2015 before mid tillering in exp 1 the integrated nitrogen loss through leaching and runoff was decreased from 12 7 kg ha 1 under tprps to 6 5 kg ha 1 under gcrps additionally higher soil temperature under gcrps might partially lead to higher soil inorganic nitrogen content by accelerating urea release and soil organic nitrogen mineralization rodrigo et al 1997 fan et al 2005 for example in exp 2 where nitrogen loss through leaching and runoff were completely eliminated the higher soil inorganic nitrogen content under gcrps fig 8b might be attributed to the increased soil temperature the improved soil inorganic nitrogen content under gcrps might result in more water and nitrogen uptake and preferable leaf nitrogen content during the early growth season of rice and thus enhance shoot and root growth in comparison to tprps after mid tillering accompanied by a gradually weakening and finally disappearing warming effect under gcrps fig 1d f soil water content became the predominant factor affecting rice growth the decrease of soil water content under gcrps led to significant reductions in leaf water potential fig 2a and b and consequently in leaf transpiration and photosynthetic rates fig 3 however the limitation of water stress was much less on leaf photosynthetic rate than on transpiration rate which was likely also attributed to the higher specific leaf nitrogen under gcrps fig 2c and d due to its positive relationship with leaf photosynthetic rate fig 7a reich et al 1989 novriyanti et al 2012 shi et al 2014 except for the treatments causing significant water stress gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 in exp 2 gcrps led to increased uptake of nitrogen fig 5c and d resulting in faster and greater decrease in soil inorganic nitrogen content than that under tprps fig 8 even as less nitrogen was lost through non physiological water consumption under gcrps80 in exp 2 soil inorganic nitrogen content was much higher than under other treatments fig 8 due to less nitrogen uptake limited by serious water stress fig 5d benefiting from the improved plant nitrogen content and consequently a less decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate relative to transpiration rate higher leaf area and biomass developed early in the growth season was maintained fig 4 even when root growth was limited by water stress gcrpssat in exp 1 and 2 gcrps80 in exp 1 increased nitrogen uptake and thus higher nitrogen content in the plant itself under gcrps may have played a critical role in enhancing water productivity except for the water stressed gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 in exp 2 the value of Î´ under gcrps was almost greater than that under tprps during the whole growth season fig 9 which implies plants under film mulched treatments experiencing no serious water stress absorb nitrogen more actively the decreased root length fig 4a and b and the less relative decrease in transpiration but higher nitrogen uptake fig 5 and the higher specific root nitrogen fig 2e and f under gcrps compared to tprps imply relatively vigorous root uptake capacity linear relationships between root uptake capacity and specific root nitrogen fig 7b have additionally been reported for winter wheat shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 this indicates that with a smaller and shorter but more active root system rice under gcrps might absorb sufficient water and nutrient especially nitrogen to support a relatively large canopy 5 conclusions compared to tprps field scale transpiration was limited while biomass and grain yield were greatly enhanced under gcrps the higher water productivity under gcrps might be driven by the higher soil temperature during the early growth season which promoted plant tillering urea release soil organic nitrogen mineralization and by the unsaturated soil water conditions which reduced nitrogen loss via non physiological water consumption and limited leaf scale transpiration rate more than photosynthetic rate based on the improved plant available inorganic nitrogen and a smaller shorter but more active root system with higher specific root nitrogen rice under gcrps might take up sufficient water and more nitrogen and result in a relatively small decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate compared to transpiration rate when stressed by drought understanding of these physiological processes and mechanisms driving the water saving and yield increasing characteristics of gcrps is expected to aid in the expansion of this high efficient rice production technology and promotion of water saving agriculture

11525,ground cover rice production systems gcrps have been shown to both save water and increase yields compared to traditional paddy rice production systems tprps physiological processes and mechanisms explaining the superiority of a popular gcrps were investigated in a series of hydroponic soil column and field experiments soil water temperature and nitrogen leaf gas exchange plant water and nitrogen growth and yield transpiration and water productivity were analyzed compared to tprps plant available soil inorganic nitrogen was generally improved under gcrps due to a combination of higher soil temperature and less nitrogen loss through non physiological water consumption especially during the early growing season consequently more nitrogen was absorbed by plants under gcrps except serious drought conditions accompanied by higher nitrogen contents in plant tissues preferable specific leaf nitrogen might lead to higher leaf photosynthetic rate under optimal water conditions and less decrease relative to leaf transpiration rate under water stress therefore rice under gcrps grew faster with much more biomass and grain yield while transpiration consumption was limited in spite of the fact that the number of tillers and therefore leaf area were increased relative to tprps resulting in superior water productivity compared to tprps the root system under gcrps was limited but it could absorb enough water and nutrients especially nitrogen to support a relatively large canopy even when under water stress which might be attributed to its higher nitrogen content and thus stronger activity keywords leaf gas exchange root uptake capacity specific leaf nitrogen specific root nitrogen water use efficiency 1 introduction rice is the major staple food for more than 50 of the world s population accounting for approximately 20 of total energy intake and an annual increase of 8 10 million t is estimated as necessary to meet future needs seck et al 2012 asia produces about 75 of the world s rice while consuming 45 of its total fresh water resources bouman and tuong 2001 bouman et al 2007 it is estimated that about 15 20 million ha of irrigated rice will suffer from water scarcity by 2025 tuong and bouman 2003 as the largest rice producer in the world china cultivates 29 million ha of rice representing about 30 of its total farmland and consuming about 70 of its total agricultural water resources zhang 2007 water shortage in china is estimated to reach 400 billion m3 by 2050 roughly corresponding to 80 of its current annual capacity tso 2004 global rice production predominantly depends on traditional paddy rice production systems tprps where a standing water layer is always maintained except during the drying field periods and water consumption per unit area is about 3 5 times that of alternative dry land crop production systems bouman and tuong 2001 therefore exploring a high efficient rice production technology to meet the requirements of increasing production coupled with decreasing water consumption is necessary designed to promote water conservation one kind of ground cover rice production system gcrps with some strip soil beds mulched by plastic film and on which there is not a standing water layer even when irrigation is implemented through the surrounding furrows has been successfully applied in more than 4 million ha in china lin et al 2002 liu et al 2013 tao et al 2014 this popular gcrps was initially introduced in the mountainous regions of central china in 1980s to overcome both limitations of low temperatures during the early growing season and seasonal water shortages lin et al 2002 compared with tprps the significant differences for gcrps lie in the transformation of root zone soil water status from completely saturated and anaerobic to unsaturated and aerobic and an increased temperature in the near surface soil layer especially during the early growing season tao et al 2015 in recent years with the rapid expansion of gcrps efforts have been made by many researchers to investigate this novel system regarding water consumption plant growth yield formation leaf gas exchange water use efficiency wue etc except for cases when temperature was not the main limitation for rice growth at the beginning of vegetation period such as in southeast china xu et al 2007a b zhang et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 previous studies have indicated significant promotion of shoot growth and grain yield under gcrps while non physiological water losses the sum of runoff deep drainage and evaporation and even transpiration consumption were reduced in comparison to tprps liu et al 2005b li et al 2007 fan et al 2012 qu et al 2012 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2014 tao et al 2014 2015 jin et al 2016 the superior water productivity of gcrps especially resulted from the increased yield while decreased transpiration consumption is inspiring since it is completely different from most dryland crops production systems water productivity can be improved under appropriate water stress conditions when plant growth and thus grain yield are reduced at a lower rate than transpiration however its attractiveness is offset and discredited as the accompanying economic costs of the reduced yields become inhibitory liu et al 2005a zhang et al 2008 lei et al 2009 matsuo et al 2010 the superior water productivity of rice under gcrps is likely due to the integrated effects of soil water and temperature conditions firstly under gcrps increased soil temperature and decreased soil water content might directly impact rice tillering and root lengthening shimono et al 2002 nagasuga et al 2011 secondly the changed soil water and temperature conditions and therefore the changed soil nutrient e g nitrogen conditions under gcrps might also influence water and nutrient uptake and their contents in the plant itself liu et al 2003 fan et al 2005 for many kinds of plant such as wheat and american elm positive correlation has been found between wue evaluated on transpiration and specific leaf nitrogen morgan 1984 heitholt 1989 reich et al 1989 shi et al 2014 as well as between root uptake activity and nitrogen content in roots shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 however the physiological processes and mechanisms driving rice under gcrps to produce more biomass and even grain yield along with less transpiration are not clear and have yet to be determined this study consequently was driven by the hypothesis that the higher water productivity under gcrps could be attributed to preferable nitrogen contents in soil and thus in plant tissues resulting from the corresponding soil water and temperature conditions taking tprps as a control three experiments hydroponic soil column and field were conducted to explore possible physiological processes and mechanisms for the water saving and yield increasing characteristics of gcrps by analyzing the dynamics of soil water and temperature conditions root and shoot growth water and nitrogen uptake soil and plant nitrogen contents gas exchange and their interrelationships 2 materials and methods 2 1 field experiment exp 1 a field experiment in a randomized block design with three replications described in detail by jin et al 2016 was conducted to investigate the superior water productivity of ground cover rice production

without plastic film were prepared for traditional paddy rice production system tprps where irrigation was applied to maintain an average water layer on the soil beds between 2 and 5 cm thick the three plots with plastic film for gcrpssat were irrigated intermittently through the furrows to keep the average root zone 0 40 cm soil layer soil water content close to saturation while without a standing water layer on the soil beds the remaining three plots with plastic film were managed identically to gcrpssat until mid tillering and afterwards transient irrigation was intermittently implemented to fully fill the furrows when the measured average root zone water content reached approximately 80 of field water capacity gcrps80 for all the three treatments irrigation was forbidden

inorganic nitrogen concentrations in sampled soil solution and runoff water were measured with a continuous flow analyzer traacs 2000 bran luebbe norderstedt germany field scale transpiration was estimated through water balance calculation jin et al 2016 water use efficiency kg m 3 was evaluated in two ways first by dividing the increase of total biomass with the corresponding transpiration

column experiment with simplified soil water and nitrogen consumption processes also described in detail by jin et al 2016 was conducted to verify the results found in exp 1 such as the difference of plant physiological traits and soil inorganic nitrogen contents between gcrps and tprps a single germinated rice same cultivar with that in exp 1 seed was directly transplanted into each soil column on 8 may 2013 and cultivated until 15 august 99 dat basal fertilizers were applied for all columns as described in exp 1 plants were uniformly cultured with a thin water layer over the soil surface until 22 dat when specific irrigation treatments were initialized the three treatments of tprps gcrpssat and gcrps80 were managed similarly to those in exp 1 through surface irrigation an additional treatment of gcrpsfwc where the lower threshold for average root zone soil water content was field water capacity was included a total of 4 sampling events were carried out on 39 59 79 and 99 dat and the measured parameters and methods were kept same with those in exp 1 jin et al 2016 2 3 hydroponic experiment exp 3 a hydroponic experiment with rice same cultivar as that in exp 1 cultured in nutrient solution was conducted to investigate the relationship between root uptake capacity and specific root nitrogen as well as between leaf photosynthetic rate and specific leaf nitrogen on 18 november 2012 germinated seeds were transferred into quartz sand saturated without a standing water layer with the half strength nutrient solution in yoshida et al 1976 which contained mg l 1 n 40 p

dicyandiamide was added to limit nitrification gao et al 2010 during the entire experimental period from 16 december 2012 to 30 january 2013 45 dat the growth conditions in greenhouse were kept as photosynthetic photon flux density of 500 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 over plants for 12 h per day from 8 00 to 20 00 day night air temperature of 25 18 2 c relative humidity of 50 5 all the buckets with plants were weighed daily at around 18 00 and daily evapotranspiration was determined according to water loss daily transpiration was estimated as the difference of evapotranspiration from evaporation which was approximated by weighing three equally equipped buckets located under the canopies while without plants in addition to an initial sampling before transplanting a total of 3 sampling events were carried out on 13 29 and 45 dat corresponding to the main growth stages of early mid and max tillering respectively at each sampling event three duplicate plants under each treatment were randomly chosen to measure photosynthetic rates of flag leaves between 9 00 11 00 by a portable photosynthesis system li 6400 li cor usa with 500 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 active radiation 400 Î¼mol s 1 air flow rate and

dividing the total transpiration and the increase of plant nitrogen mass with the average root length between two sampling events 2 4 statistical analysis analysis of variance was performed with the general linear model procedure glm of statistical software package spss 20 0 international business machines corporation usa the statistical model included sources of variation due to year treatment and their interaction one way analysis of variance f statistic was adopted to evaluate the effects on the studied parameters with the least significant difference lsd at 0 05 probability level 3 results 3 1 soil water and temperature conditions under gcrps under tprps soil was assumed to be saturated except during the drying field periods 66 72 and 113 135 dat in 2013 78 85 and 121 143 dat in 2014 in exp 1 under the two gcrps treatments the root zone 0 40 cm was essentially unsaturated except during the early growth period about 1 34 dat and occasionally during rainfall fig 1 a and b under gcrpssat the root zone soil water content was basically stable except during the drying field periods with an average value of around 0 41 cm3 cm 3 corresponding to 87 of the average root zone saturated water content the average root zone soil water content under gcrps80 fluctuated between 0 24 cm3 cm 3 and saturation with a mean of 0 33 cm3 cm 3 corresponding to 82 of the average root zone field water capacity in exp 2 average soil water content of about 0 45 cm3 cm 3 was consistently maintained under gcrpssat corresponding to 88 of the saturated water content fig 1c under gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 starting at saturation soil water content declined slowly from 22 to 58 dat and then was maintained at an average of 0 26 cm3 cm 3 108 of the field water capacity and 0 22 cm3 cm 3 89 of the field water capacity respectively significant difference in soil temperature was not found between the gcrps treatments thus their average was analyzed in exp 1 soil temperature under gcrps was about 13 higher than that under tprps before mid tillering in both 2013 and 2014 fig 1d and e afterwards the warming effect under gcrps weakened and even disappeared with plant growth in exp 2 there was also a warming effect under gcrps compared to tprps with soil temperatures averaging no more than 5 higher before mid tillering fig 1f 3 2 plant responses to gcrps root sampling was implemented only at maturity in 2013 while in 2014 a longer period was covered in exp 1 since no significant differences were found between the comparable stages in the two years for root parameters such as biomass length and specific root nitrogen table 1 the 2014 root system data alone are presented and further analyzed no significant difference was found between the two years and interaction was not found between years and treatments for all the other parameters including growth and physiological measurements jin et al 2016 therefore average values of these parameters from the two growing seasons of exp 1 are depicted in this study 3 2 1 plant water and nitrogen status during the early growth period before mid tillering in exp 1 and early tillering in exp 2 no significant difference was found in leaf water potential between treatments but afterwards the potential decreased as average root zone soil water content fig 2 a and b compared to gcrps80 and tprps in exp 1 there was a larger difference between gcrps80 gcrpsfwc and tprps in exp 2 indicating that plants under gcrps80 gcrpsfwc in exp 2 suffered more serious water stress than gcrps80 in exp 1 specific leaf nitrogen under all gcrps treatments was consistently higher than under tprps but the superiority weakened with plant growth or water stress duration fig 2c and d under gcrps80 or gcrpsfwc specific root nitrogen was generally higher than that for tprps and gcrpssat with the superiority increasing with plant growth fig 2e and f 3 2 2 leaf gas exchange during mid tillering stage in exp 1 and early tillering stage in exp 2 no significant difference was found in leaf transpiration rates between treatments while the leaf photosynthetic rates under all gcrps treatments were higher than those under tprps fig 3 at later growth stages leaf gas exchange under gcrps was significantly limited as a function of the lower average root zone soil water content with the effect on leaf transpiration rate being much more significant than that on leaf photosynthetic rate 3 2 3 plant growth and yield in exp 1 root length and biomass growth were stimulated under gcrps during the early growth stage at subsequent growth stages the superiority diminished and the situation was reversed for the case of development of relatively serious water stress under gcrps80 fig 4 a and c shoot biomass and leaf area growth under all gcrps treatments nevertheless was always more vigorous than under tprps throughout the growing season fig 4c and e this trend also diminished with plant growth or water stress duration under gcrps relative to tprps the mean increase in leaf area index and biomass of shoots under gcrps reached 92 9 and 108 9 at mid tillering and fell to 43 7 and 20 9 at anthesis stage finally grain yield under gcrps was significantly around 11 6 greater than that under tprps in exp 1 table 2 the effect of gcrps on plant growth was verified in exp 2 with obvious relative limitations due to water stress fig 4b d and f 3 2 4 plant water and nitrogen uptake compared to tprps transpiration under gcrps was somewhat higher before max tillering and was much lower during the longer later period from panicle initiation to maturity in exp 1 fig 5 a seasonal transpiration significantly decreased 6 1 under gcrpssat and 9 7 under gcrps80 while no significant difference was found between the two gcrps treatments table 2 the limitation of water stress on transpiration was more obvious in exp 2 with decreases of 9 2 under gcrpsfwc and 27 5 under gcrps80 fig 5b and table 2 transpiration under gcrpssat was not different with that under tprps nitrogen uptake under gcrps was significantly enhanced in comparison to tprps throughout the growing season in exp 1 fig 5c but the superiority weakened with plant growth or water stress duration relative to tprps the positive effect of gcrps on nitrogen uptake was verified under gcrpssat in exp 2 but significant limitation occurred after max tillering under gcrps80 fig 5d 3 2 5 water productivity in exp 1 and 2 wuet b under gcrps was significantly enhanced before panicle initiation in comparison to tprps but no significant difference was found during the following periods fig 6 compared with 2 41 kg m 3 for tprps in exp 1 average seasonal wuet b under gcrpssat 2 97 kg m 3 and gcrps80 3 07 kg m 3 was enhanced 23 2 and 27 4 respectively table 2 throughout the experimental period in exp 2 wuet b under tprps was 4 28 kg m 3 while it increased 8 4 4 64 kg m 3 9 9 4 74 kg m 3 and 20 5 5 25 kg m 3 under gcrpssat gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 respectively table 2 finally wuet y under gcrps in exp 1 was enhanced about 19 8 table 2 3 3 effects of plant nitrogen status on root uptake and leaf photosynthesis results from exp 3 indicated that leaf photosynthetic rates of flag leaves fig 7 a increased in a manner approximately proportional to specific leaf nitrogen r2 0 39 root water nitrogen uptake capacity fig 7b also increased linearly r2 0 76 and 0 69 respectively with specific root nitrogen regardless of nitrogen form concentration in nutrient solution or experimental period 4 discussion under proper except extreme drought conditions higher water productivity has been found for many kinds of crops with less relative decrease in dry matter or grain yield compared to transpiration liu et al 2005a zhang et al 2008 lei et al 2009 matsuo et al 2010 besides the contribution of transpiration limited by drought higher water productivity under gcrps in comparison to tprps fig 6 and table 2 was also partially due to the higher dry matter and grain yield jin et al 2016 the reduction of transpiration consumption under gcrps resulted from the bigger decrease in leaf transpiration rate than the increase in leaf area although transpiration decreased relatively later figs fig 33a and b and fig 44e and f similarly the enhancement of rice growth under gcrps was attributed to the later and less decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate fig 3c and d than the increase in leaf area fig 4e and f during the early growth season root zone soil water content under all the treatments was completely or nearly saturated fig 1a c and thus plant water potential under gcrps was maintained similar to that under tprps fig 2a and b and leaf scale transpiration was not affected fig 3a and b leaf photosynthetic rate under gcrps however was enhanced in comparison to tprps fig 3c and d which might be related to its higher specific leaf nitrogen figs fig 22c and d and fig 77a this result concurs with previous findings for sunflower connor et al 1993 and several c3 species such as rice evans 1989 and winter wheat shi et al 2014 with larger leaf area than tprps fig 4e and f transpiration fig 5a and b was enhanced under gcprs but dry matter accumulation was enhanced even more fig 4c and d resulting in higher wue fig 6 this result supports popular reports regarding linear relationships between wue and specific leaf nitrogen shi et al 2014 although root zone soil water content under all the treatments was similar during the early growth season soil temperature under tprps was always lower than 25 c fig 1d f which might be unfavorable for rice growth shimono et al 2002 nagasuga et al 2011 stuerz et al 2014 under gcrps this increased soil temperature might be responsible for the faster growth of roots and shoots fig 4 stress from low soil temperatures might inhibit root lengthening and branching by slowing auxin transport in root system nagasuga et al 2011 higher soil temperature might impact shoot meristem near soil surface so as to promote tillering shimono et al 2002 and leaf growth stuerz et al 2014 the tiller numbers under gcrps treatments in both exp 1 and 2 were increased by 41 6 66 8 compared to those under tprps in spite of this the higher soil inorganic nitrogen content and potential more nitrogen uptake found under gcrps fig 8 might also be important for rice growth xu et al 2014 influenced by the sharp decrease of non physiological water consumption the sum of surface evaporation deep percolation and runoff under gcrps jin et al 2016 nitrogen loss through mass flow was remarkably limited tan et al 2015 before mid tillering in exp 1 the integrated nitrogen loss through leaching and runoff was decreased from 12 7 kg ha 1 under tprps to 6 5 kg ha 1 under gcrps additionally higher soil temperature under gcrps might partially lead to higher soil inorganic nitrogen content by accelerating urea release and soil organic nitrogen mineralization rodrigo et al 1997 fan et al 2005 for example in exp 2 where nitrogen loss through leaching and runoff were completely eliminated the higher soil inorganic nitrogen content under gcrps fig 8b might be attributed to the increased soil temperature the improved soil inorganic nitrogen content under gcrps might result in more water and nitrogen uptake and preferable leaf nitrogen content during the early growth season of rice and thus enhance shoot and root growth in comparison to tprps after mid tillering accompanied by a gradually weakening and finally disappearing warming effect under gcrps fig 1d f soil water content became the predominant factor affecting rice growth the decrease of soil water content under gcrps led to significant reductions in leaf water potential fig 2a and b and consequently in leaf transpiration and photosynthetic rates fig 3 however the limitation of water stress was much less on leaf photosynthetic rate than on transpiration rate which was likely also attributed to the higher specific leaf nitrogen under gcrps fig 2c and d due to its positive relationship with leaf photosynthetic rate fig 7a reich et al 1989 novriyanti et al 2012 shi et al 2014 except for the treatments causing significant water stress gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 in exp 2 gcrps led to increased uptake of nitrogen fig 5c and d resulting in faster and greater decrease in soil inorganic nitrogen content than that under tprps fig 8 even as less nitrogen was lost through non physiological water consumption under gcrps80 in exp 2 soil inorganic nitrogen content was much higher than under other treatments fig 8 due to less nitrogen uptake limited by serious water stress fig 5d benefiting from the improved plant nitrogen content and consequently a less decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate relative to transpiration rate higher leaf area and biomass developed early in the growth season was maintained fig 4 even when root growth was limited by water stress gcrpssat in exp 1 and 2 gcrps80 in exp 1 increased nitrogen uptake and thus higher nitrogen content in the plant itself under gcrps may have played a critical role in enhancing water productivity except for the water stressed gcrpsfwc and gcrps80 in exp 2 the value of Î´ under gcrps was almost greater than that under tprps during the whole growth season fig 9 which implies plants under film mulched treatments experiencing no serious water stress absorb nitrogen more actively the decreased root length fig 4a and b and the less relative decrease in transpiration but higher nitrogen uptake fig 5 and the higher specific root nitrogen fig 2e and f under gcrps compared to tprps imply relatively vigorous root uptake capacity linear relationships between root uptake capacity and specific root nitrogen fig 7b have additionally been reported for winter wheat shi and zuo 2009 shi et al 2013 this indicates that with a smaller and shorter but more active root system rice under gcrps might absorb sufficient water and nutrient especially nitrogen to support a relatively large canopy 5 conclusions compared to tprps field scale transpiration was limited while biomass and grain yield were greatly enhanced under gcrps the higher water productivity under gcrps might be driven by the higher soil temperature during the early growth season which promoted plant tillering urea release soil organic nitrogen mineralization and by the unsaturated soil water conditions which reduced nitrogen loss via non physiological water consumption and limited leaf scale transpiration rate more than photosynthetic rate based on the improved plant available inorganic nitrogen and a smaller shorter but more active root system with higher specific root nitrogen rice under gcrps might take up sufficient water and more nitrogen and result in a relatively small decrease in leaf photosynthetic rate compared to transpiration rate when stressed by drought understanding of these physiological processes and mechanisms driving the water saving and yield increasing characteristics of gcrps is expected to aid in the expansion of this high efficient rice production technology and promotion of water saving agriculture

basin occupying an overall area of a little less than 1 million ha and producing 30 million t of tubers faostat 2017 in the mediterranean coastal regions of several countries such as tunisia egypt cyprus israel lebanon turkey and italy potatoes are usually grown in the winter spring cycle planting from november to january and harvesting from march to early june for early production which is highly appreciated and mainly exported to northern european countries with considerable profit mauromicale et al 2003 ierna 2010 to promote earliness and high yields as well as meet the quality standards demanded by the fresh vegetable market early potato crops are usually irrigated and fertilized during vegetative growth and tuber bulking in particular irrigation plays a decisive role since early potatoes are very sensitive to water stresses during tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages which adversely influence not only yields but also earliness foti et al 1995 ierna and mauromicale 2012 a regular and adequate water supply is required from tuber initiation until near maturity for high yields and good grade and quality ierna and mauromicale 2006 fertilizers are generally used inefficiently by the crop also due to large nutrient losses through seepage or percolation above all under conventional methods of irrigation like furrows or sprinklers foti et al 1995 as a result appropriate fertilizers and water application should be considered together in a comprehensive approach ierna et al 2011 in a study conducted in the same environment demonstrated that the right combination of irrigation level and n p k fertilization rate are an effective means to increase tuber yield however considering that irrigation water is costly exploitable and limited in the semi arid areas of the mediterranean basin it is crucial to maximize water savings and water productivity wp this may be defined as the ratio between the crop yield achieved and crop water consumption or evapotranspiration pereira et al 2012 it is known that wp of crops besides water availability could be affected by other factors such as soil characteristics cultivar and fertilization management a proper nutrient balance of the crop would therefore lead to increased yields and thus increase wp however fertilization also contributes to increasing evapotranspiration et and as a result wp may decrease extensive research has been conducted in the mediterranean area to study crop growth seasonal et et yield y relationships and yield response to water irrigation islam et al 1990 unlu et al

achieved in the combined treatment high irrigation level with high rate of fertilization i3f3 equally high and not significantly different values have been found in i3f2 i2f3 and i2f2 the appropriate combination of irrigation and fertilization levels probably improved the photosynthetic production efficiency of leaves thus for the obvious reasons the crop produced greater dry matter and the cgr increased however the highest cgr value found in this experiment was substantially lower than that found in a warm mediterranean climate camargo et al 2015 the increase in water supply led to higher total dry matter accumulation rate in all growth stages this is consistent with reports of other authors kashyap and panda 2003 camargo et al 2015 nevertheless the effect of fertilization rate on cgr was important and varied in relation to water supply and growth stage indeed in plots irrigated at emergence i1 differences between fertilization levels were negligible in all growth stages studied in plots irrigated at 50 etm i2 cgr increased due to the effect of fertilization rates f2 and f3 up to 94 104 dap while in plots irrigated with 100 etm i3 these positive effects were maintained until the end of the cycle 114 122 dap table 3 3 2 aboveground dry biomass and tuber yield results on aboveground dry biomass and tuber yield in the two years are presented in table 4 regardless of fertilization rate the highest aboveground dry biomass yield and tuber yields in both years were recorded with 100 etm irrigation level 0 99 and 1 20 t ha 1 aboveground biomass dw in 2007 and 2008 respectively and 7 56 and 6 59 t ha 1 tuber dw both aboveground dry biomass and tuber yields have diminished to the decrease of the irrigation level reaching in plots irrigated only at emergence i1 0 64 and 0 78 t ha 1 aboveground biomass dw in 2007 and 2008 respectively and 3 72 and 3 53 t ha 1 tuber dw in both years in irrigated plots 50 and 100 etm aboveground dry biomass and tuber yields generally increased with the increase of fertilization rate the increased supply of water in combination with medium or high fertilization rate favoured an overall improvement in plant vigour in terms of development of leaves and stems which consequently increased aboveground dw and resulted in better tuber growth in unirrigated control plots i1 aboveground dry biomass yield increased due to the effect of the highest nutrient supply f3 compared to f1 and f2 on the average 63 in 2007 and 25 in 2008 whereas tuber yield was generally unaffected by fertilization rate table 4 in agreement with findings for n fertilization by darwish et al 2006 and ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 presumably plants irrigated only at emergence used initially high rates of fertilization f3 for canopy growth stems leaves however the lack of adequate water availability subsequently caused water stress affecting the photosynthetic activity and hence the synthesis and translocation of photosynthates from leaves stems source to tubers sink the sink source ratio reached the lowest values 4 3 in 2007 and 3 5 in 2008 respectively in the plots irrigated only at emergence and fertilized with the highest fertilization rate i1f3 table 4 a similar effect albeit to a lesser extent occurred in plots irrigated at 50 of etm i2f3 by contrast the highest fertilization level in plots irrigated at 100 etm i3f3 determined the highest sink source ratio in both years 8 3 and 6 1 in 2007 and 2008 respectively confirming the role played by optimal nutrition and availability of water for the efficiency of the photosynthesis process a good sink source balance was also found when low rates of fertilization were used in plots irrigated at 50 etm i2f1 3 3 seasonal evapotranspiration etc and yield etc relationships seasonal evapotranspiration was significantly influenced only by the irrigation level in both years table 1 irrespective of the rate of fertilization etc in 2007 was 170 mm in the plots irrigated only at the plant emergence i1 and significantly increased in i2 311 mm and i3 448 mm in 2008 etc was equal to 155 mm in i1 282 mm in i2 and 411 mm in i3 fig 1 the etc values in i3 are comparable to those obtained in similar environmental conditions ferreira and carr 2002 shock et al 2003 onder et al 2005 ati et al 2012 although the irrigation level fertilization rate interaction was not significant etc increased owing to the effect of the higher fertilization rate f3 compared to f1 and f2 in plots irrigated at 50 etm from 304 to 320 mm in 2007 and from 270 to 292 mm in 2008 and in plots irrigated at 100 etm from 440 to 461 mm in 2007 and from 395 to 428 mm in 2008 data not shown the regressions determined for each fertilization rate between etc and aboveground biomass yield were not significant whereas regression between etc and tuber yields were significant and linear in accordance with what is commonly found in other agricultural systems vos and haverkort 2007 previous studies have shown that potato tuber yield responded linearly to the amount of water applied fabeiro et al 2001 yuan et al 2003 badr et al 2012 in our experiments however regression equations exhibited different slopes for different sets for each fertilization rate table 5 values of these slopes which also represent an estimation of water productivity increased significantly p 0 01 as fertilization rate increased from f1 to f2 to f3 0 96 1 32 to 1 68 kg m 3 ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 did not find in wp significant differences attributable to nitrogen fertilizer treatments 80 240 kg ha 1 of n if we express the wp as kg tubers fresh weight m 3 water values are about 5 3 kg m 3 f1 7 3 kg m 3 f2 and 9 3 kg m 3 f3 which are within range of those reported by cantore et al 2014 in apulia 9 30 11 0 kg m 3 camargo et al 2015 in spain 7 9 9 5 kg m 3 and ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 in portugal 6 4 9 9 kg m 3 3 4 water productivity data on wp in both years are shown in table 4 in both years wpb and wpt decreased with the increase in water supplied by irrigation reaching the minimum values in plots irrigated at 100 etm our results corroborate the findings of previous researches in the mediterranean region in which several authors have reported wp values for tuber yield that are higher under deficit than under adequate irrigation darwish et al 2006 fabeiro et al 2001 islam et al 1990 kashyap and panda 2003 onder et al 2005 yuan et al 2003 badr et al 2012 however contrary to irrigation level nutrient fertilization positively influence both wpb and wpt in particular wpb was enhanced by fertilization in plots irrigated only at emergence i1 or at 50 etm i2 in both years consequently in both years the highest values of wpb were recorded in i1f3 0 49 and 0 56 kg m 3 in 2007 and 2008 respectively the lowest in i3f1 0 19 and 0 26 kg m 3 respectively table 4 in both years medium and high fertilization rates almost always significantly increased wpt in irrigated plots with 50 and 100 etm in agreement with other authors who found wpt increased as n supply unlu et al 2006 and badr et al 2012 or k supply ati et al 2012 increased the highest fertilization rate showed on the contrary a negative effect on wpt in plots irrigated only at emergence i1 generally the highest values of wp tubers were found in plots irrigated only at emergence and fertilized with low and medium fertilization rate i1f1 and i1f2 about 2 3 kg m 3 table 4 the last finding may have positive implications for potato cultivation in semi arid environments or when irrigation water availability is low as in both cases the corresponding tuber yield in both years was more than acceptable and equal to about 3 7 t ha 1 dw corresponding to about 20 t ha 1 fw overall our findings agree with hatfield et al 2001 suggesting that it was possible to increase crop wp by 25 40 through soil management which involves tillage and 15 25 by modifying nutrient management practices 3 5 yield response factor kyy and kyb are represented by the slope of regression between the relative tuber yield decrease or aboveground biomass yield decrease and the corresponding relative evapotranspiration deficit for f1 level kyy and kyb were similar 0 68 and 0 67 to ky 0 70 found by doorenbos and kassam 1979 when water deficit was at yield formation phase in our experiments kyy is significantly increased from f1 0 68 to f2 0 82 and f3 0 87 table 6 the value of kyy found in medium fertilization rate f2 is in line with that reported by darwish et al 2006 0 8 obtained in lebanon utilizing n level of 125 kg ha 1 in a processing cultivar the increase in kyy value by augmenting the rate of fertilization was not found by other authors studying the effect of n fertilization rates which varied due to seasonality ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 or method of irrigation unlu et al 2006 the increase in kyy values with medium and high rates of fertilization would indicate a greater plant exposure to the effects of water stress however since all kyy values were 1 0 the expected relative yield decrease for a given evapotranspiration deficit was proportionally less than the relative decrease in evapotranspiration kirda et al 1999 4 conclusion our study demonstrates that there was a significant irrigation level fertilization rate interaction on potato crop growth seasonal etc tuber yield relationships yield response factor and wp the combined treatments based on irrigation at 100 of etm high rate of n p k fertilization proved to be the best combination to increase seasonal etc promote crop growth and improve aboveground biomass yield tuber yield and sink source ratio but not wp indeed wp was negatively affected by irrigation whereas it was enhanced by fertilization especially under very limited water availability conditions as in plots irrigated only at plant emergence in these both low and medium fertilization rates allowed the crop to maximize wp giving an acceptable tuber yield about 3 9 t ha 1 dw corresponding to roughly 22 t ha 1 fw these results may have positive implications for potato cultivation allowing farmers to achieve a more efficient and rational use of water and to undertake early potato cultivation in semi arid areas which to date are not used for this crop

irrigation based on 100 of etm high rate of n p k fertilization proved the best combination to promote etc crop growth and improve aboveground biomass tuber yield and sink source ratio but not wp fertilization played a crucial role in enhancing wp of this crop especially in plots irrigated only at plant emergence where both low and medium fertilization rates allowed maximizing wp 2 3 kg m 3

very limited water availability environments keywords solanum tuberosum water supply fertilizer yield water saving crop drought 1 introduction potato is an important staple food in the mediterranean basin occupying an overall area of a little less than 1 million ha and producing 30 million t of tubers faostat 2017 in the mediterranean coastal regions of several countries such as tunisia egypt cyprus israel lebanon turkey and italy potatoes are usually grown in the winter spring cycle planting from november to january and harvesting from march to early june for early production which is highly appreciated and mainly exported to northern european countries with considerable profit mauromicale et al 2003 ierna 2010 to promote earliness and high yields as well as meet the quality standards demanded by the fresh vegetable market early potato crops are usually irrigated and fertilized during vegetative growth and tuber bulking in particular irrigation plays a decisive role since early potatoes are very sensitive to water stresses during tuber initiation and tuber bulking stages which adversely influence not only yields but also earliness foti et al 1995 ierna and mauromicale 2012 a regular and adequate water supply is required from tuber initiation until near maturity for high yields and good grade and quality ierna and mauromicale 2006 fertilizers are generally used inefficiently by the crop also due to large nutrient losses through seepage or percolation above all under conventional methods of irrigation like furrows or sprinklers foti et al 1995 as a result appropriate fertilizers and water application should be considered together in a comprehensive approach ierna et al 2011 in a study conducted in the same environment demonstrated that the right combination of irrigation level and n p k fertilization rate are an effective means to increase tuber yield however considering that irrigation water is costly exploitable and limited in the semi arid areas of the mediterranean basin it is crucial to maximize water savings and water productivity wp this may be defined as the ratio between the crop yield achieved and crop water consumption or evapotranspiration pereira et al 2012 it is known that wp of crops besides water availability could be affected by other factors such as soil characteristics cultivar and fertilization management a proper nutrient balance of the crop would therefore lead to increased yields and thus increase wp however fertilization also contributes to increasing evapotranspiration et and as a result wp may decrease extensive research has been conducted in the mediterranean area to study crop growth seasonal et et yield y relationships and yield response to water irrigation islam et al 1990 unlu et al

plots irrigated at 50 etm i2 cgr increased due to the effect of fertilization rates f2 and f3 up to 94 104 dap while in plots irrigated with 100 etm i3 these positive effects were maintained until the end of the cycle 114 122 dap table 3 3 2 aboveground dry biomass and tuber yield results on aboveground dry biomass and tuber yield in the two years are presented in table 4 regardless of fertilization rate the highest aboveground dry biomass yield and tuber yields in both years were recorded with 100 etm irrigation level 0 99 and 1 20 t ha 1 aboveground biomass dw in 2007 and 2008 respectively and 7 56 and 6 59 t ha 1 tuber dw both aboveground dry biomass and tuber yields have diminished to the decrease of the irrigation level reaching in plots irrigated only at emergence i1 0 64 and 0 78 t ha 1 aboveground biomass dw in 2007 and 2008 respectively and 3 72 and 3 53 t ha 1 tuber dw in both years in irrigated plots 50 and 100 etm aboveground dry biomass and tuber yields generally increased with the increase of fertilization rate the increased supply of water in combination with medium or high fertilization rate favoured an overall improvement in plant vigour in terms of development of leaves and stems which consequently increased aboveground dw and resulted in better tuber growth in unirrigated control plots i1 aboveground dry biomass yield increased due to the effect of the highest nutrient supply f3 compared to f1 and f2 on the average 63 in 2007 and 25 in 2008 whereas tuber yield was generally unaffected by fertilization rate table 4 in agreement with findings for n fertilization by darwish et al 2006 and ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 presumably plants irrigated only at emergence used initially high rates of fertilization f3 for canopy growth stems leaves however the lack of adequate water availability subsequently caused water stress affecting the photosynthetic activity and hence the synthesis and translocation of photosynthates from leaves stems source to tubers sink the sink source ratio reached the lowest values 4 3 in 2007 and 3 5 in 2008 respectively in the plots irrigated only at emergence and fertilized with the highest fertilization rate i1f3 table 4 a similar effect albeit to a lesser extent occurred in plots irrigated at 50 of etm i2f3 by contrast the highest fertilization level in plots irrigated at 100 etm i3f3 determined the highest sink source ratio in both years 8 3 and 6 1 in 2007 and 2008 respectively confirming the role played by optimal nutrition and availability of water for the efficiency of the photosynthesis process a good sink source balance was also found when low rates of fertilization were used in plots irrigated at 50 etm i2f1 3 3 seasonal evapotranspiration etc and yield etc relationships seasonal evapotranspiration was significantly influenced only by the irrigation level in both years table 1 irrespective of the rate of fertilization etc in 2007 was 170 mm in the plots irrigated only at the plant emergence i1 and significantly increased in i2 311 mm and i3 448 mm in 2008 etc was equal to 155 mm in i1 282 mm in i2 and 411 mm in i3 fig 1 the etc values in i3 are comparable to those obtained in similar environmental conditions ferreira and carr 2002 shock et al 2003 onder et al 2005 ati et al 2012 although the irrigation level fertilization rate interaction was not significant etc increased owing to the effect of the higher fertilization rate f3 compared to f1 and f2 in plots irrigated at 50 etm from 304 to 320 mm in 2007 and from 270 to 292 mm in 2008 and in plots irrigated at 100 etm from 440 to 461 mm in 2007 and from 395 to 428 mm in 2008 data not shown the regressions determined for each fertilization rate between etc and aboveground biomass yield were not significant whereas regression between etc and tuber yields were significant and linear in accordance with what is commonly found in other agricultural systems vos and haverkort 2007 previous studies have shown that potato tuber yield responded linearly to the amount of water applied fabeiro et al 2001 yuan et al 2003 badr et al 2012 in our experiments however regression equations exhibited different slopes for different sets for each fertilization rate table 5 values of these slopes which also represent an estimation of water productivity increased significantly p 0 01 as fertilization rate increased from f1 to f2 to f3 0 96 1 32 to 1 68 kg m 3 ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 did not find in wp significant differences attributable to nitrogen fertilizer treatments 80 240 kg ha 1 of n if we express the wp as kg tubers fresh weight m 3 water values are about 5 3 kg m 3 f1 7 3 kg m 3 f2 and 9 3 kg m 3 f3 which are within range of those reported by cantore et al 2014 in apulia 9 30 11 0 kg m 3 camargo et al 2015 in spain 7 9 9 5 kg m 3 and ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 in portugal 6 4 9 9 kg m 3 3 4 water productivity data on wp in both years are shown in table 4 in both years wpb and wpt decreased with the increase in water supplied by irrigation reaching the minimum values in plots irrigated at 100 etm our results corroborate the findings of previous researches in the mediterranean region in which several authors have reported wp values for tuber yield that are higher under deficit than under adequate irrigation darwish et al 2006 fabeiro et al 2001 islam et al 1990 kashyap and panda 2003 onder et al 2005 yuan et al 2003 badr et al 2012 however contrary to irrigation level nutrient fertilization positively influence both wpb and wpt in particular wpb was enhanced by fertilization in plots irrigated only at emergence i1 or at 50 etm i2 in both years consequently in both years the highest values of wpb were recorded in i1f3 0 49 and 0 56 kg m 3 in 2007 and 2008 respectively the lowest in i3f1 0 19 and 0 26 kg m 3 respectively table 4 in both years medium and high fertilization rates almost always significantly increased wpt in irrigated plots with 50 and 100 etm in agreement with other authors who found wpt increased as n supply unlu et al 2006 and badr et al 2012 or k supply ati et al 2012 increased the highest fertilization rate showed on the contrary a negative effect on wpt in plots irrigated only at emergence i1 generally the highest values of wp tubers were found in plots irrigated only at emergence and fertilized with low and medium fertilization rate i1f1 and i1f2 about 2 3 kg m 3 table 4 the last finding may have positive implications for potato cultivation in semi arid environments or when irrigation water availability is low as in both cases the corresponding tuber yield in both years was more than acceptable and equal to about 3 7 t ha 1 dw corresponding to about 20 t ha 1 fw overall our findings agree with hatfield et al 2001 suggesting that it was possible to increase crop wp by 25 40 through soil management which involves tillage and 15 25 by modifying nutrient management practices 3 5 yield response factor kyy and kyb are represented by the slope of regression between the relative tuber yield decrease or aboveground biomass yield decrease and the corresponding relative evapotranspiration deficit for f1 level kyy and kyb were similar 0 68 and 0 67 to ky 0 70 found by doorenbos and kassam 1979 when water deficit was at yield formation phase in our experiments kyy is significantly increased from f1 0 68 to f2 0 82 and f3 0 87 table 6 the value of kyy found in medium fertilization rate f2 is in line with that reported by darwish et al 2006 0 8 obtained in lebanon utilizing n level of 125 kg ha 1 in a processing cultivar the increase in kyy value by augmenting the rate of fertilization was not found by other authors studying the effect of n fertilization rates which varied due to seasonality ferreira and conÃ§alves 2007 or method of irrigation unlu et al 2006 the increase in kyy values with medium and high rates of fertilization would indicate a greater plant exposure to the effects of water stress however since all kyy values were 1 0 the expected relative yield decrease for a given evapotranspiration deficit was proportionally less than the relative decrease in evapotranspiration kirda et al 1999 4 conclusion our study demonstrates that there was a significant irrigation level fertilization rate interaction on potato crop growth seasonal etc tuber yield relationships yield response factor and wp the combined treatments based on irrigation at 100 of etm high rate of n p k fertilization proved to be the best combination to increase seasonal etc promote crop growth and improve aboveground biomass yield tuber yield and sink source ratio but not wp indeed wp was negatively affected by irrigation whereas it was enhanced by fertilization especially under very limited water availability conditions as in plots irrigated only at plant emergence in these both low and medium fertilization rates allowed the crop to maximize wp giving an acceptable tuber yield about 3 9 t ha 1 dw corresponding to roughly 22 t ha 1 fw these results may have positive implications for potato cultivation allowing farmers to achieve a more efficient and rational use of water and to undertake early potato cultivation in semi arid areas which to date are not used for this crop 
11527,border irrigation is widely practised for winter wheat production on the north china plain winter wheat is mainly irrigated with groundwater as a supplement to insufficient precipitation to maintain high agricultural production as a result of the increased demands for water groundwater levels have declined therefore improvements to border irrigation performance and water use efficiency are urgently needed the objective of this study was to determine the optimal distance at which to cut off inflow under different inflow rate conditions in closed ended border systems the experimental treatments included three inflow rates high moderate and low with average rates of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 respectively and three cut off ratios crs arranged in three replications at the cas ecological agricultural experiment station in nanpi hebei province china the surface irrigation hydraulic simulation model winsrfr was used to examine the sensitivity of the existing design to a range of bottom slopes surface roughness values and inflow rates to demonstrate the robustness of the solutions in terms of their application efficiency and low quarter distribution uniformity the results present the optimum cr values for different inflow rate conditions to maximize irrigation performance the results indicate that irrigation performance above the optimum cr values for high moderate and low inflow rates is not very sensitive to bottom slope and no substantial changes in performance were noted when manning s roughness coefficient was between 0 04 and 0 09 a set of inflow rate ranges that corresponds to the recommended crs that could achieve high irrigation performance is presented keywords surface irrigation border irrigation inflow rate cut off ratio irrigation performance 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the two major crops grown in hebei province china irrigation with groundwater is necessary for maintaining sustainable crop production because less than 30 of precipitation falls in the winter which is much lower than the water requirements of winter wheat lv et al 2013 today approximately 70 of the water resources extracted for agriculture of which approximately 70 are used for wheat irrigation are pumped from groundwater in hebei province on the north china plain lv et al 2013 groundwater levels have declined as a result of climate change human activities and increasing demands for water resulting in the formation of perennial shallow groundwater depression cones over a wide area in hebei province therefore the development of an irrigation system to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use and to prevent further over exploitation of groundwater is urgently needed border irrigation is widely practised for wheat and corn production on the north china plain and is the most common irrigation method in this region relying on gravity and the field surface to distribute water within a field morris et al 2015 assessing the performance of border irrigation requires knowledge of the management methods used by farmers and system variable measures i e border dimensions length and width inflow rate q slope s manning s roughness coefficient n cut off time and soil infiltration properties pereira et al 2002 researchers have achieved improved border irrigation performance by optimizing border dimensions anwar et al 2016 chen et al 2012 adopting appropriate inflow rates and cut off times morris et al 2015 improving inflow rate and measuring the field elevations carefully bautista et al 2009a additionally manning s roughness coefficient has been shown to affect the performance of border irrigation bautista et al 2002 therefore the optimization of the design and or operation of a border irrigation system needs to account for the potential range of infiltration and manning s roughness coefficient conditions that could be encountered bautista et al 2009a zhang et al 2006 bautista et al 2009a and anwar et al 2016 recommended field roughness coefficients of 0 02 0 40 0 04 0 10 and 0 04 0 16 respectively border irrigation performance depends greatly on the cut off time in a well designed and operated system the volume of applied water is precisely controlled thus for a given inflow rate the cut off time is determined from the prescribed application depth however the inflow is not measured routinely except at the farm turnout additionally under this method the water overflow may occur at the end of the field or the water may not reach the end of the field particularly in level basins thus in many counties the adopted cut off time in level basins is at the point of completion of the advance phase clyma and ali 1977 wattenburger and clyma 1989 in level basins this approach is more robust than the limiting length approach particularly when a farmer has poor control over the water reddy et al 2013 clemmens 1998 presented a new procedure for the design of level basins based on cut off time and concluded that the cut off distance could be adjusted depending on the manning roughness coefficient for the previous reasons instead of determining the cut off time from the application depth the researchers adopted the cut off ratio cr defined as the ratio of the advance distance at cut off to the total field length the distance based cut off criterion can help compensate for inflow uncertainties where the inflow can be expected to vary but cannot be readily measured furthermore to some degree the distance based cut off criterion may also help compensate for uncertainties in other field variables such as slope roughness and infiltration the recommended crs for open ended border irrigation with loamy sand soil and lengths of 200 and 400 m were 0 77 and 0 85 respectively mailhol and merot 2007 and the recommended cr for block end furrow irrigation with loamy soil and moderate slope 0 005 m m 1 was 0 89 cahoon et al 1995 previous studies have addressed the problem of cut off time in level basins open ended borders or furrow systems however the longitudinal slope graded basin or border has significant effects on cut off time and irrigation performance gonzÃ¡lez et al 2011 additionally closed ended border irrigation systems currently prevail on the north china plain and the most popular irrigation cut off method adopted by farmers is to stop irrigation when the water reaches the lower end of the field cr 1 under this method the irrigation water often reaches depths in excess of the required depth pereira et al 2002 and water accumulates at the end of the field significantly increasing the overflow risk furthermore some crops cannot tolerate excessive ponding hence the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to determine the optimal distance at which to cut off inflow under different inflow rate conditions in closed ended border systems in the north china plain three inflow rates in three blocks considering the infiltration values for each border 2 to establish different scenarios incorporating different slopes n values and inflow rates to assess the sensitivity ranges of these variables on the irrigation performance when optimum cut off distance values are used and 3 to provide recommendations for improving the performance of border irrigation systems on the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 field measurements 2 1 1 study area field studies were conducted at the cas ecological agricultural experiment station in the town of nanpi in hebei province china at a longitude latitude and elevation of 116 40 e 38 06 n and 20 m respectively this area is located in a monsoon climate zone with an annual evaporation range between 1500 and 1800 mm the mean annual precipitation and temperature at the study site are approximately 567 4 mm and 12 3 c respectively rainfall generally occurs during the summer with 73 11 13 and 3 of the annual precipitation occurring during the summer spring autumn and winter respectively a field was planted with winter wheat on october 15 2014 and was harvested in the middle of june 2015 the soil at the site is classified as silt loam 67 02 silt 25 19 sand and 7 79 clay on average and the groundwater depth is approximately 4 m the volumetric soil water content at field capacity before irrigation ranged from 15 8 to 19 6 the bulk densities were 1 21 g cm3 in the surface soil layer 0 5 cm 1 51 g cm3 in the subsurface soil layer 60 80 cm and 1 45 g cm3 at a depth of 1 m 2 1 2 experimental design and management a field experiment was conducted during the 2015 irrigation season with three replications three inflow rates were combined with three crs the experimental site was divided into three blocks a b and c each block was divided by nine borders resulting in a total of 27 separate irrigation assessments according to farm household surveys most farmers prefer to practise simple irrigation management with large borders to minimize labour costs when large water supplies are available at a site farmers can extend the border width without affecting their irrigation practices however smaller water supplies are available at most sites such that farmers limit the border widths to accelerate surface water flow and to accomplish each irrigation event quickly therefore the border applied in the experimental field measured 100 m in length and 3 7 m in width similar to the border dimensions used by local farmers the winter wheat is irrigated two times per season in the study area pre sowing and spring irrigation the experiment was conducted during the spring irrigation event and the required application water depth was 60 mm jiao and wang 2012 2 1 3 inflow the inflow rate plays a principal role in irrigation performance and its values greatly depend on the water source and pump performance during irrigation in practise the amount of discharge supplied varies among the sites in the study area with averages of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 the inflows for all the irrigation events were set at these values these inflow rates and different crs were investigated to determine the optimal values to achieve high irrigation performance the crs for both of the first two inflow rates were 0 8 0 85 and 0 90 however because the last inflow rate was low the crs reached 0 90 0 95 and 1 00 respectively generally each q cr combination was replicated three times it was assumed that only one border was irrigated at a time that the full amount of inflow through the service point was applied to that border and that the buffering capacity of the farm channel removed most of the short term variation consequently the time averaged inflow rate was used in all the evaluations 2 1 4 irrigation performance measures the indicators that were used in this study to evaluate the performance of closed ended border irrigation were application efficiency ae requirement efficiency re distribution uniformity dulq water deficit dd and deep percolation dp burt et al 1997 these indicators were defined as follows 1 a e a v e r a g e d e p t h o f i n f i l t r a t e d w a t e r s t o r e d i n t h

2 modelling 2 2 1 field characteristic parameters the field characteristic parameters manning n and infiltration parameters were required to evaluate the irrigation events when estimating the soil infiltration parameters the analysis was conducted using the simple post irrigation volume balance pivb merriam and keller 1987 u s dept of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 1997 to solve for the k parameter in the kostiakov equation z kÏa in which the exponent is independently determined z is the cumulative depth of infiltration in m Ï is the intake opportunity time in min and k is a coefficient with units of m mina the field characteristic parameter values were established with the aid of the hydraulic surface irrigation simulation model winsrfr bautista et al 2009a b 2014 and trial and error as follows initial values were set for the a and n parameters and an initial estimate for the k parameter was calculated using the winsrfr model the parameter set was then fed into the winsrfr simulation model the simulated advance and recession curves were compared with the observed curves and if the fit was poor new values were assigned to the a and n parameters this procedure was repeated until a good fit between the two curves was achieved in this manner the values of n a and k were obtained the input data for winsrfr for each irrigation event included the irrigation requirement the advance and recession times at each measurement distance within each border every 5 m along the border length the border dimensions measured using a measuring tape in the field and the elevations along the border length measured using an optical level fig 1 shows the measured field elevations for the longitudinal section and the ordinary least square regression for borders 8 12 and 20 in blocks a b and c respectively the coefficients of the ordinary least squares regression equations are reported as the slopes s of the borders in this study all 28 borders slope in the downstream direction the first border recession time was not observed and some other data were not obtained from border 24 due to the field conditions therefore the elevations of borders 1 and 24 were not included in the analysis the hydraulic simulation model winsrfr 4 1 3 was calibrated for each individual irrigation event resulting in soil infiltration values for each event 2 2 2 sensitivity analyses because of the uncertainty of the field properties a and k and system inputs s n and q systematic sensitivity analyses must be conducted to assess the robustness of any operation or design recommendation bautista et al 2009a in this study the hydraulic simulation model winsrfr was used for sensitivity analysis of the performance the sensitivity of the performance to the inflow rate was examined to provide a clearer understanding of the performance at different inflow rates manning s n varies throughout the irrigation season the average reported slope in each block can also vary from border to border and throughout the irrigation season hence the existing design was tested over ranges of roughness manning s n values of 0 10 60 slope from 0 0005 to 0 004 and discharge and the range of the tested discharge is discussed in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 model fitting as described above the infiltration parameters that were input into the winsrfr model were selected through comparison of the advance and recession curves produced from the measured advance and recession data with those produced by the winsrfr model the simulated results for the advance and recession curves for borders 2 15 and 20 fig 2 are presented here table 1 provides details of the inflow rate average slope manning s n inflow duration advance time cr and input volume to borders the estimated parameters of the ke equation using the winsrfr hydraulic simulation module are listed in table 1 the advance curve can be adjusted by modifying parameter a thus when the soil conditions were similar in each block parameter a was expected to be similar the values of parameter a in the ke equation were 0 77 0 68 and 0 57 in blocks a b and c respectively with average inflow rates of 6 91 4 95 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 respectively however the k parameter values were different over the borders in each block manning s n ranged from 0 06 to 0 09 which is within the basic recommended range of the field roughness coefficient bautista et al 2009a zhang et al 2006 3 2 inflow rate and irrigation deficit in the field experiments statistical analysis of the inflow rate yielded standard deviations Ï of 0 12 0 10 and 0 05 for blocks a b and c respectively and coefficients of variation cv of 1 7 2 1 and 1 8 respectively these results indicate that no large variation in the inflow distribution occurred within each block fig 3 the effects of different inflow rates and crs on irrigation performance in each block were then investigated in block a experiments b1 through b9 the average final advance time was not sensitive to the cr values under different field conditions the final advance time remained stable 26 min with increasing cr fig 4 a however the total water applied increased rapidly with increasing cr fig 5 the average applied water increased from 28 m3 to 35 m3 indicating average infiltrations of 75 and 95 mm of water respectively as the cr value increased from 0 80 to 0 90 the applied volumes were reasonable considering the minimum volume needed to satisfy the irrigation requirement 60 mm for block b experiments b10 through b18 the average final advance times were 30 28 and 27 min for cr values of 0 80 0 85 and 0 90 respectively fig 4b the total water applied was between 23 and 28 m3 which satisfied the irrigation requirement in this block at the moderate inflow rate 4 95 l s 1 m 1 increasing the cr did not consistently increase the total applied volume fig 5 for example in borders 10 and 15 the total applied water in each was approximately 23 m3 with crs of 0 8 and 0 85 respectively whereas in borders 14 and 15 the total water in each was approximately 25 m3 with crs of 0 85 and 0 9 respectively for block c experiments b19 through b27 the average final advance times were approximately equal 48 min for different cr values 0 90 0 95 and 1 00 and field conditions fig 4c although the total water applied satisfied the irrigation requirement the water amount increased significantly with increasing cr value fig 5 in general when the inflow rate is low 2 81 l s 1 m 1 in our case a cr less than 0 9 may result in an incomplete advance phase to avoid such a scenario the irrigation time should be lengthy and the total water applied may be higher than irrigation requirement particularly if the advance phase is completed in general under the field conditions and applied inflow rates when the total water applied is between 26 m3 and 28 m3 the water reaches the end of the field resulting in satisfactory irrigation fig 5 3 3 irrigation performance indexes for each irrigation event fig 6 shows the percentages of dulq ae re dp and dd for an application depth of 60 mm in fig 6a for the average discharge of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 in block a the optimum cut off time was 18 min when the cr value was 0 80 which resulted in maximum dulq values of 84 and 94 in borders 2 and 3 cr 0 80 respectively the same optimum cr value was obtained when ae was used as the determining performance indicator i e maximizing ae rather than dulq fig 6b typically ae and dulq are highly correlated in closed ended borders moderately high uniformity values for dulq resulted in a cr value of 0 85 in block b where the average inflow rate was 4 95 l s 1 m 1 fig 6a the dulq values were 86 93 and 88 in borders 13 14 and 15 cr 0 85 respectively in those borders the cut off times were 26 24 and 21 min respectively the dulq values obtained from borders 16 17 and 18 cr 0 90 were higher than those obtained from borders 13 14 and 15 cr 0 85 however the dp values of borders 16 17 and 18 were also higher than those of borders 13 14 and 15 whereas the ae values of borders 16 17 and 18 were lower fig 6b and d additionally an acceptable irrigation performance was achieved at cr 0 85 fig 6c and d and a longer inflow rate duration was not needed cr 0 85 in block c at an average inflow rate of 2 81 l s 1 m 1 the maximum dulq achieved a value of 85 and the ae values were 83 92 and 80 at cr 0 9 in borders 19 20 and 21 respectively fig 6a and c in those borders the cut off times were 42 39 and 45 min respectively in this block continuing the supply of water until completion of the advance phase cr 1 resulted in decreasing ae and increasing dp values fig 6b and d therefore the recommended cr values for the average inflow rates of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 are 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 respectively under the field conditions three monitoring points were needed to identify the management strategies along the field these points are located at 0 8 0 85 and 0 90 of the field length when the advance wave takes approximately 18 min to reach the first monitoring point it indicates that the inflow rate is high 6 91 l s 1 m 1 with a recommended cr of 0 8 when the advance wave takes between 21 and 26 min to reach the second point it indicates that the inflow rate is moderate 4 95 l s 1 m 1 with a recommended cr of 0 85 when the advance wave takes between 39 and 45 min to reach the third monitoring point it indicates that the inflow rate is small 2 81 l s 1 m 1 with a recommended cr of 0 9 3 4 sensitivity analysis in the interest of brevity the results of the analyses of sensitivity to inflow rate slope and manning s roughness are reported without any adjustments to the recommended crs for borders 2 block a 15 block b and 20 block c ae and dulq were used as performance indicators ae dulq and re were plotted on the following figures and the same results were obtained when other irrigation performance indicators were used as the determining performance indicators generally an improved surface irrigation system can achieve acceptable performance with minimum distribution uniformity and an ae of 80 pereira et al 2007 the sensitivity of the existing solutions was tested over a range of slopes from 0 0005 to 0 004 fig 7 shows the values of the performance indicators over a range of slopes the high inflow rate with cr 0 8 in block a fig 7a resulted in ae and dulq values greater than 80 for slopes between 0 002 and 0 004 a high slope at cr 0 8 comparatively early contributed to water advancement the water reached the end of the field after the water was cut off and high performance was achieved in block b the inflow rate and cr were 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 0 85 respectively and the optimum slope range was between 0 0010 and 0 004 with performance indicator values greater than 85 fig 7b however obtaining performance indicator ae and dulq values greater than 85 was difficult at the low inflow rate and cr of 0 9 that were applied in block c for slopes between 0 0010 and 0 004 the dulq and ae values were greater than 80 in block c fig 7c these results indicate that over the recommended crs the ae and dulq increased as the slope increased the ae and dulq were less sensitive to slope changes thereafter the dulq values began to decrease for higher slope values additionally even if the slope is increased which decreases the volume stored in the surface at cut off time the irrigation events in block a block b and block c satisfy the irrigation requirement at the recommended slope ranges fig 7 the sensitivities of the average field characteristics were tested over a range of n values from 0 04 to 0 16 fig 8 shows the values of the performance indicators over a range of manning s n values without any adjustments in the recommended cr values in each block neither performance indicator was very sensitive to variation in roughness in blocks a b and c high performance indicators were obtained for manning s roughness ranges of 0 04 0 09 0 04 0 10 and 0 04 0 10 respectively fig 8a c these findings indicate that over these ranges of roughness values the irrigation performances of the recommended crs in each block were robust fig 9 shows the results of the sensitivity analyses over a range of inflow rates without any adjustments of the crs in each block for the larger decreases in the average inflow rate applied in each block the dulq values decreased significantly however for larger increases in discharge the dulq values were less sensitive to changes in block c border 20 lower performance indicator values were obtained when the inflow rate decreased to less than 2 6 l s 1 m 1 and the dulq was less than 70 fig 9a as discharge increased the performance indicator values increased and when discharge decreased the performance indicators decreased for larger increases in the average applied inflow in block c 52 5 at cr 0 9 the performance indicator values were greater than 80 this inflow rate 4 5 l s 1 m 1 corresponded to a decrease in the average applied inflow 14 5 in block b border 15 where the cr was 0 85 and lower discharge resulted in high performance indicator values in block b fig 9b similarly larger increases in the average inflow applied in block b 27 5 resulted in performance indicator values greater than 85 and this inflow rate value 6 5 l s 1 m 1 approximately corresponded to the decrease of the average applied inflow 2 5 in block a where the cr was 0 8 the inflow rate of 6 5 l s 1 m 1 in block a resulted in a dulq value of 84 and an ae value of 77 in block a the inflow range of 6 5 l s 1 m 1 7 8 l s 1 m 1 corresponded to dulq values greater than 80 and ae values of 75 or 77 notably as the inflow rate increased in block a the dulq increased and the ae decreased fig 9c this result occurred because dulq is calculated as a ratio of the average depth of infiltration in a quarter of the field and because more water accumulated above the soil surface and infiltrated deeper at the end of the border than it did at the other positions therefore when the same high inflow rates as those applied in block a are used farmers can accomplish each irrigation event quickly with a cr of 0 8 whereas when the same moderate or low inflow rates as those applied in blocks b and c are used farmers can efficiently accomplish irrigation events by setting cr values to 0 85 and 0 90 respectively the low inflow rates applied in block c required a long irrigation time approximately 50 min even at cr 0 9 hence a range of inflow rates results in high performance indicator values with cr values of 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 in blocks a b and c respectively the maximum and minimum s n and q values that corresponded to the high performance indicators in blocks a b and c are summarized in table 2 the boundary values above are currently recommended for achieving high ae and dulq values 4 conclusions to maintain high agricultural production with sustainable utilization of limited water resources for a particular area recommendations of specific inflow rates and inflow durations are necessary under the field conditions in this study high performance indicator values were achieved using crs below the currently adopted value cr 1 a set of inflow rate ranges and corresponding crs for achieving high performance indicator values are recommended the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 establishing a cut off time before the advance phase is completed when the inflow rate is high 6 5 l s 1 m 1 is necessary to prevent the accumulation of water at the end of the field particularly when the slope is high the recommended cr for an average inflow rate of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 is 0 80 2 acceptable performance indicator values can be achieved using average moderate and low inflow rates of 4 95 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 with crs of 0 85 and 0 9 respectively 3 irrigation performance indicators at levels above the currently recommended crs for high moderate and low inflow rates show low sensitivity to the bottom slope and manning s n no substantial changes in performance were noted at manning s n values between 0 04 and 0 09 4 the minimum recommended inflow rate is 2 6 l s 1 m 1 for irrigation events when the cr is 0 90 5 the sensitivity analysis showed that high performance indicator values are achievable for high moderate and low inflow rates of 7 8 6 5 l s 1 m 1 6 5 4 5 l s 1 m 1 and 4 5 2 6 l s 1 m 1 at crs of 0 80 0 85 and 0 90 respectively therefore from a farmer s perspective the inflow rate is adjustable and the recommended cr remains unchanged within each recommended range of inflow rate the border irrigation tests presented here provide a range of different inflow rate levels and crs that could be encountered across a field however although the optimal crs were calculated for a fixed required depth 60 mm which is the most frequent required depth in the study area the required depth can vary depending on the needs of the crop and the soil additionally the evaluations involved short fields and some experiments applied high inflow rates and therefore short opportunity times under such conditions the infiltration parameters are sensitive for these reasons further research should be conducted to determine the optimal crs in soils with infiltration properties or requirements different from those considered in the present study acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable

11527,border irrigation is widely practised for winter wheat production on the north china plain winter wheat is mainly irrigated with groundwater as a supplement to insufficient precipitation to maintain high agricultural production as a result of the increased demands for water groundwater levels have declined therefore improvements to border irrigation performance and water use efficiency are urgently needed the objective of this study was to determine the optimal distance at which to cut off inflow under different inflow rate conditions in closed ended border systems the experimental treatments included three inflow rates high moderate and low with average rates of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 respectively and three cut off ratios crs arranged in three replications at the cas ecological agricultural experiment station in nanpi hebei province china the surface irrigation hydraulic simulation model winsrfr was used to examine the sensitivity of the existing design to a range of bottom slopes surface roughness values and inflow rates to demonstrate the robustness of the solutions in terms of their application efficiency and low quarter distribution uniformity the results present the optimum cr values for different inflow rate conditions to maximize irrigation performance the results indicate that irrigation performance above the optimum cr values for high moderate and low inflow rates is not very sensitive to bottom slope and no substantial changes in performance were noted when manning s roughness coefficient was between 0 04 and 0 09 a set of inflow rate ranges that corresponds to the recommended crs that could achieve high irrigation performance is presented keywords surface irrigation border irrigation inflow rate cut off ratio irrigation performance 1 introduction winter wheat is one of the two major crops grown in hebei province china irrigation with groundwater is necessary for maintaining sustainable crop production because less than 30 of precipitation falls in the winter which is much lower than the water requirements of winter wheat lv et al 2013 today approximately 70 of the water resources extracted for agriculture of which approximately 70 are used for wheat irrigation are pumped from groundwater in hebei province on the north china plain lv et al 2013 groundwater levels have declined as a result of climate change human activities and increasing demands for water resulting in the formation of perennial shallow groundwater depression cones over a wide area in hebei province therefore the development of an irrigation system to increase the efficiency of irrigation water use and to prevent further over exploitation of groundwater is urgently needed border irrigation is widely practised for wheat and corn production on the north china plain and is the most common irrigation method in this region relying on gravity and the field surface to distribute water within a field morris et al 2015 assessing the performance of border irrigation requires knowledge of the management methods used by farmers and system variable measures i e border dimensions length and width inflow rate q slope s manning s roughness coefficient n cut off time and soil infiltration properties pereira et al 2002 researchers have achieved improved border irrigation performance by optimizing border dimensions anwar et al 2016 chen et al 2012 adopting appropriate inflow rates and cut off times morris et al 2015 improving inflow rate and measuring the field elevations carefully bautista et al 2009a additionally manning s roughness coefficient has been shown to affect the performance of border irrigation bautista et al 2002 therefore the optimization of the design and or operation of a border irrigation system needs to account for the potential range of infiltration and manning s roughness coefficient conditions that could be encountered bautista et al 2009a zhang et al 2006 bautista et al 2009a and anwar et al 2016 recommended field roughness coefficients of 0 02 0 40 0 04 0 10 and 0 04 0 16 respectively border irrigation performance depends greatly on the cut off time in a well designed and operated system the volume of applied water is precisely controlled thus for a given inflow rate the cut off time is determined from the prescribed application depth however the inflow is not measured routinely except at the farm turnout additionally under this method the water overflow may occur at the end of the field or the water may not reach the end of the field particularly in level basins thus in many counties the adopted cut off time in level basins is at the point of completion of the advance phase clyma and ali 1977 wattenburger and clyma 1989 in level basins this approach is more robust than the limiting length approach particularly when a farmer has poor control over the water reddy et al 2013 clemmens 1998 presented a new procedure for the design of level basins based on cut off time and concluded that the cut off distance could be adjusted depending on the manning roughness coefficient for the previous reasons instead of determining the cut off time from the application depth the researchers adopted the cut off ratio cr defined as the ratio of the advance distance at cut off to the total field length the distance based cut off criterion can help compensate for inflow uncertainties where the inflow can be expected to vary but cannot be readily measured furthermore to some degree the distance based cut off criterion may also help compensate for uncertainties in other field variables such as slope roughness and infiltration the recommended crs for open ended border irrigation with loamy sand soil and lengths of 200 and 400 m were 0 77 and 0 85 respectively mailhol and merot 2007 and the recommended cr for block end furrow irrigation with loamy soil and moderate slope 0 005 m m 1 was 0 89 cahoon et al 1995 previous studies have addressed the problem of cut off time in level basins open ended borders or furrow systems however the longitudinal slope graded basin or border has significant effects on cut off time and irrigation performance gonzÃ¡lez et al 2011 additionally closed ended border irrigation systems currently prevail on the north china plain and the most popular irrigation cut off method adopted by farmers is to stop irrigation when the water reaches the lower end of the field cr 1 under this method the irrigation water often reaches depths in excess of the required depth pereira et al 2002 and water accumulates at the end of the field significantly increasing the overflow risk furthermore some crops cannot tolerate excessive ponding hence the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to determine the optimal distance at which to cut off inflow under different inflow rate conditions in closed ended border systems in the north china plain three inflow rates in three blocks considering the infiltration values for each border 2 to establish different scenarios incorporating different slopes n values and inflow rates to assess the sensitivity ranges of these variables on the irrigation performance when optimum cut off distance values are used and 3 to provide recommendations for improving the performance of border irrigation systems on the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 field measurements 2 1 1 study area field studies were conducted at the cas ecological agricultural experiment station in the town of nanpi in hebei province china at a longitude latitude and elevation of 116 40 e 38 06 n and 20 m respectively this area is located in a monsoon climate zone with an annual evaporation range between 1500 and 1800 mm the mean annual precipitation and temperature at the study site are approximately 567 4 mm and 12 3 c respectively rainfall generally occurs during the summer with 73 11 13 and 3 of the annual precipitation occurring during the summer spring autumn and winter respectively a field was planted with winter wheat on october 15 2014 and was harvested in the middle of june 2015 the soil at the site is classified as silt loam 67 02 silt 25 19 sand and 7 79 clay on average and the groundwater depth is approximately 4 m the volumetric soil water content at field capacity before irrigation ranged from 15 8 to 19 6 the bulk densities were 1 21 g cm3 in the surface soil layer 0 5 cm 1 51 g cm3 in the subsurface soil layer 60 80 cm and 1 45 g cm3 at a depth of 1 m 2 1 2 experimental design and management a field experiment was conducted during the 2015 irrigation season with three replications three inflow rates were combined with three crs the experimental site was divided into three blocks a b and c each block was divided by nine borders resulting in a total of 27 separate irrigation assessments according to farm household surveys most farmers prefer to practise simple irrigation management with large borders to minimize labour costs when large water supplies are available at a site farmers can extend the border width without affecting their irrigation practices however smaller water supplies are available at most sites such that farmers limit the border widths to accelerate surface water flow and to accomplish each irrigation event quickly therefore the border applied in the experimental field measured 100 m in length and 3 7 m in width similar to the border dimensions used by local farmers the winter wheat is irrigated two times per season in the study area pre sowing and spring irrigation the experiment was conducted during the spring irrigation event and the required application water depth was 60 mm jiao and wang 2012 2 1 3 inflow the inflow rate plays a principal role in irrigation performance and its values greatly depend on the water source and pump performance during irrigation in practise the amount of discharge supplied varies among the sites in the study area with averages of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 the inflows for all the irrigation events were set at these values these inflow rates and different crs were investigated to determine the optimal values to achieve high irrigation performance the crs for both of the first two inflow rates were 0 8 0 85 and 0 90 however because the last inflow rate was low the crs reached 0 90 0 95 and 1 00 respectively generally each q cr combination was replicated three times it was assumed that only one border was irrigated at a time that the full amount of inflow through the service point was applied to that border and that the buffering capacity of the farm channel removed most of the short term variation consequently the time averaged inflow rate was used in all the evaluations 2 1 4 irrigation performance measures the indicators that were used in this study to evaluate the performance of closed ended border irrigation were application efficiency ae requirement efficiency re distribution uniformity dulq water deficit dd and deep percolation dp burt et al 1997 these indicators were defined as follows 1 a e a v e r a g e d e p t h o f i n f i l t r a t e d w a t e r s t o r e d i n t h

2 modelling 2 2 1 field characteristic parameters the field characteristic parameters manning n and infiltration parameters were required to evaluate the irrigation events when estimating the soil infiltration parameters the analysis was conducted using the simple post irrigation volume balance pivb merriam and keller 1987 u s dept of agriculture natural resources conservation service usda nrcs 1997 to solve for the k parameter in the kostiakov equation z kÏa in which the exponent is independently determined z is the cumulative depth of infiltration in m Ï is the intake opportunity time in min and k is a coefficient with units of m mina the field characteristic parameter values were established with the aid of the hydraulic surface irrigation simulation model winsrfr bautista et al 2009a b 2014 and trial and error as follows initial values were set for the a and n parameters and an initial estimate for the k parameter was calculated using the winsrfr model the parameter set was then fed into the winsrfr simulation model the simulated advance and recession curves were compared with the observed curves and if the fit was poor new values were assigned to the a and n parameters this procedure was repeated until a good fit between the two curves was achieved in this manner the values of n a and k were obtained the input data for winsrfr for each irrigation event included the irrigation requirement the advance and recession times at each measurement distance within each border every 5 m along the border length the border dimensions measured using a measuring tape in the field and the elevations along the border length measured using an optical level fig 1 shows the measured field elevations for the longitudinal section and the ordinary least square regression for borders 8 12 and 20 in blocks a b and c respectively the coefficients of the ordinary least squares regression equations are reported as the slopes s of the borders in this study all 28 borders slope in the downstream direction the first border recession time was not observed and some other data were not obtained from border 24 due to the field conditions therefore the elevations of borders 1 and 24 were not included in the analysis the hydraulic simulation model winsrfr 4 1 3 was calibrated for each individual irrigation event resulting in soil infiltration values for each event 2 2 2 sensitivity analyses because of the uncertainty of the field properties a and k and system inputs s n and q systematic sensitivity analyses must be conducted to assess the robustness of any operation or design recommendation bautista et al 2009a in this study the hydraulic simulation model winsrfr was used for sensitivity analysis of the performance the sensitivity of the performance to the inflow rate was examined to provide a clearer understanding of the performance at different inflow rates manning s n varies throughout the irrigation season the average reported slope in each block can also vary from border to border and throughout the irrigation season hence the existing design was tested over ranges of roughness manning s n values of 0 10 60 slope from 0 0005 to 0 004 and discharge and the range of the tested discharge is discussed in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 model fitting as described above the infiltration parameters that were input into the winsrfr model were selected through comparison of the advance and recession curves produced from the measured advance and recession data with those produced by the winsrfr model the simulated results for the advance and recession curves for borders 2 15 and 20 fig 2 are presented here table 1 provides details of the inflow rate average slope manning s n inflow duration advance time cr and input volume to borders the estimated parameters of the ke equation using the winsrfr hydraulic simulation module are listed in table 1 the advance curve can be adjusted by modifying parameter a thus when the soil conditions were similar in each block parameter a was expected to be similar the values of parameter a in the ke equation were 0 77 0 68 and 0 57 in blocks a b and c respectively with average inflow rates of 6 91 4 95 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 respectively however the k parameter values were different over the borders in each block manning s n ranged from 0 06 to 0 09 which is within the basic recommended range of the field roughness coefficient bautista et al 2009a zhang et al 2006 3 2 inflow rate and irrigation deficit in the field experiments statistical analysis of the inflow rate yielded standard deviations Ï of 0 12 0 10 and 0 05 for blocks a b and c respectively and coefficients of variation cv of 1 7 2 1 and 1 8 respectively these results indicate that no large variation in the inflow distribution occurred within each block fig 3 the effects of different inflow rates and crs on irrigation performance in each block were then investigated in block a experiments b1 through b9 the average final advance time was not sensitive to the cr values under different field conditions the final advance time remained stable 26 min with increasing cr fig 4 a however the total water applied increased rapidly with increasing cr fig 5 the average applied water increased from 28 m3 to 35 m3 indicating average infiltrations of 75 and 95 mm of water respectively as the cr value increased from 0 80 to 0 90 the applied volumes were reasonable considering the minimum volume needed to satisfy the irrigation requirement 60 mm for block b experiments b10 through b18 the average final advance times were 30 28 and 27 min for cr values of 0 80 0 85 and 0 90 respectively fig 4b the total water applied was between 23 and 28 m3 which satisfied the irrigation requirement in this block at the moderate inflow rate 4 95 l s 1 m 1 increasing the cr did not consistently increase the total applied volume fig 5 for example in borders 10 and 15 the total applied water in each was approximately 23 m3 with crs of 0 8 and 0 85 respectively whereas in borders 14 and 15 the total water in each was approximately 25 m3 with crs of 0 85 and 0 9 respectively for block c experiments b19 through b27 the average final advance times were approximately equal 48 min for different cr values 0 90 0 95 and 1 00 and field conditions fig 4c although the total water applied satisfied the irrigation requirement the water amount increased significantly with increasing cr value fig 5 in general when the inflow rate is low 2 81 l s 1 m 1 in our case a cr less than 0 9 may result in an incomplete advance phase to avoid such a scenario the irrigation time should be lengthy and the total water applied may be higher than irrigation requirement particularly if the advance phase is completed in general under the field conditions and applied inflow rates when the total water applied is between 26 m3 and 28 m3 the water reaches the end of the field resulting in satisfactory irrigation fig 5 3 3 irrigation performance indexes for each irrigation event fig 6 shows the percentages of dulq ae re dp and dd for an application depth of 60 mm in fig 6a for the average discharge of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 in block a the optimum cut off time was 18 min when the cr value was 0 80 which resulted in maximum dulq values of 84 and 94 in borders 2 and 3 cr 0 80 respectively the same optimum cr value was obtained when ae was used as the determining performance indicator i e maximizing ae rather than dulq fig 6b typically ae and dulq are highly correlated in closed ended borders moderately high uniformity values for dulq resulted in a cr value of 0 85 in block b where the average inflow rate was 4 95 l s 1 m 1 fig 6a the dulq values were 86 93 and 88 in borders 13 14 and 15 cr 0 85 respectively in those borders the cut off times were 26 24 and 21 min respectively the dulq values obtained from borders 16 17 and 18 cr 0 90 were higher than those obtained from borders 13 14 and 15 cr 0 85 however the dp values of borders 16 17 and 18 were also higher than those of borders 13 14 and 15 whereas the ae values of borders 16 17 and 18 were lower fig 6b and d additionally an acceptable irrigation performance was achieved at cr 0 85 fig 6c and d and a longer inflow rate duration was not needed cr 0 85 in block c at an average inflow rate of 2 81 l s 1 m 1 the maximum dulq achieved a value of 85 and the ae values were 83 92 and 80 at cr 0 9 in borders 19 20 and 21 respectively fig 6a and c in those borders the cut off times were 42 39 and 45 min respectively in this block continuing the supply of water until completion of the advance phase cr 1 resulted in decreasing ae and increasing dp values fig 6b and d therefore the recommended cr values for the average inflow rates of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 are 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 respectively under the field conditions three monitoring points were needed to identify the management strategies along the field these points are located at 0 8 0 85 and 0 90 of the field length when the advance wave takes approximately 18 min to reach the first monitoring point it indicates that the inflow rate is high 6 91 l s 1 m 1 with a recommended cr of 0 8 when the advance wave takes between 21 and 26 min to reach the second point it indicates that the inflow rate is moderate 4 95 l s 1 m 1 with a recommended cr of 0 85 when the advance wave takes between 39 and 45 min to reach the third monitoring point it indicates that the inflow rate is small 2 81 l s 1 m 1 with a recommended cr of 0 9 3 4 sensitivity analysis in the interest of brevity the results of the analyses of sensitivity to inflow rate slope and manning s roughness are reported without any adjustments to the recommended crs for borders 2 block a 15 block b and 20 block c ae and dulq were used as performance indicators ae dulq and re were plotted on the following figures and the same results were obtained when other irrigation performance indicators were used as the determining performance indicators generally an improved surface irrigation system can achieve acceptable performance with minimum distribution uniformity and an ae of 80 pereira et al 2007 the sensitivity of the existing solutions was tested over a range of slopes from 0 0005 to 0 004 fig 7 shows the values of the performance indicators over a range of slopes the high inflow rate with cr 0 8 in block a fig 7a resulted in ae and dulq values greater than 80 for slopes between 0 002 and 0 004 a high slope at cr 0 8 comparatively early contributed to water advancement the water reached the end of the field after the water was cut off and high performance was achieved in block b the inflow rate and cr were 4 95 l s 1 m 1 and 0 85 respectively and the optimum slope range was between 0 0010 and 0 004 with performance indicator values greater than 85 fig 7b however obtaining performance indicator ae and dulq values greater than 85 was difficult at the low inflow rate and cr of 0 9 that were applied in block c for slopes between 0 0010 and 0 004 the dulq and ae values were greater than 80 in block c fig 7c these results indicate that over the recommended crs the ae and dulq increased as the slope increased the ae and dulq were less sensitive to slope changes thereafter the dulq values began to decrease for higher slope values additionally even if the slope is increased which decreases the volume stored in the surface at cut off time the irrigation events in block a block b and block c satisfy the irrigation requirement at the recommended slope ranges fig 7 the sensitivities of the average field characteristics were tested over a range of n values from 0 04 to 0 16 fig 8 shows the values of the performance indicators over a range of manning s n values without any adjustments in the recommended cr values in each block neither performance indicator was very sensitive to variation in roughness in blocks a b and c high performance indicators were obtained for manning s roughness ranges of 0 04 0 09 0 04 0 10 and 0 04 0 10 respectively fig 8a c these findings indicate that over these ranges of roughness values the irrigation performances of the recommended crs in each block were robust fig 9 shows the results of the sensitivity analyses over a range of inflow rates without any adjustments of the crs in each block for the larger decreases in the average inflow rate applied in each block the dulq values decreased significantly however for larger increases in discharge the dulq values were less sensitive to changes in block c border 20 lower performance indicator values were obtained when the inflow rate decreased to less than 2 6 l s 1 m 1 and the dulq was less than 70 fig 9a as discharge increased the performance indicator values increased and when discharge decreased the performance indicators decreased for larger increases in the average applied inflow in block c 52 5 at cr 0 9 the performance indicator values were greater than 80 this inflow rate 4 5 l s 1 m 1 corresponded to a decrease in the average applied inflow 14 5 in block b border 15 where the cr was 0 85 and lower discharge resulted in high performance indicator values in block b fig 9b similarly larger increases in the average inflow applied in block b 27 5 resulted in performance indicator values greater than 85 and this inflow rate value 6 5 l s 1 m 1 approximately corresponded to the decrease of the average applied inflow 2 5 in block a where the cr was 0 8 the inflow rate of 6 5 l s 1 m 1 in block a resulted in a dulq value of 84 and an ae value of 77 in block a the inflow range of 6 5 l s 1 m 1 7 8 l s 1 m 1 corresponded to dulq values greater than 80 and ae values of 75 or 77 notably as the inflow rate increased in block a the dulq increased and the ae decreased fig 9c this result occurred because dulq is calculated as a ratio of the average depth of infiltration in a quarter of the field and because more water accumulated above the soil surface and infiltrated deeper at the end of the border than it did at the other positions therefore when the same high inflow rates as those applied in block a are used farmers can accomplish each irrigation event quickly with a cr of 0 8 whereas when the same moderate or low inflow rates as those applied in blocks b and c are used farmers can efficiently accomplish irrigation events by setting cr values to 0 85 and 0 90 respectively the low inflow rates applied in block c required a long irrigation time approximately 50 min even at cr 0 9 hence a range of inflow rates results in high performance indicator values with cr values of 0 8 0 85 and 0 9 in blocks a b and c respectively the maximum and minimum s n and q values that corresponded to the high performance indicators in blocks a b and c are summarized in table 2 the boundary values above are currently recommended for achieving high ae and dulq values 4 conclusions to maintain high agricultural production with sustainable utilization of limited water resources for a particular area recommendations of specific inflow rates and inflow durations are necessary under the field conditions in this study high performance indicator values were achieved using crs below the currently adopted value cr 1 a set of inflow rate ranges and corresponding crs for achieving high performance indicator values are recommended the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 establishing a cut off time before the advance phase is completed when the inflow rate is high 6 5 l s 1 m 1 is necessary to prevent the accumulation of water at the end of the field particularly when the slope is high the recommended cr for an average inflow rate of 6 91 l s 1 m 1 is 0 80 2 acceptable performance indicator values can be achieved using average moderate and low inflow rates of 4 95 and 2 81 l s 1 m 1 with crs of 0 85 and 0 9 respectively 3 irrigation performance indicators at levels above the currently recommended crs for high moderate and low inflow rates show low sensitivity to the bottom slope and manning s n no substantial changes in performance were noted at manning s n values between 0 04 and 0 09 4 the minimum recommended inflow rate is 2 6 l s 1 m 1 for irrigation events when the cr is 0 90 5 the sensitivity analysis showed that high performance indicator values are achievable for high moderate and low inflow rates of 7 8 6 5 l s 1 m 1 6 5 4 5 l s 1 m 1 and 4 5 2 6 l s 1 m 1 at crs of 0 80 0 85 and 0 90 respectively therefore from a farmer s perspective the inflow rate is adjustable and the recommended cr remains unchanged within each recommended range of inflow rate the border irrigation tests presented here provide a range of different inflow rate levels and crs that could be encountered across a field however although the optimal crs were calculated for a fixed required depth 60 mm which is the most frequent required depth in the study area the required depth can vary depending on the needs of the crop and the soil additionally the evaluations involved short fields and some experiments applied high inflow rates and therefore short opportunity times under such conditions the infiltration parameters are sensitive for these reasons further research should be conducted to determine the optimal crs in soils with infiltration properties or requirements different from those considered in the present study acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the reviewers for their valuable

least significance difference test to ensure that the data were normally distributed standardized skewness was verified in addition pearson product moment correlation coefficients r among the chemical and microbial properties of the water samples were analyzed p 0 05 3 results 3 1 bacterial indicator populations bacterial indicator populations of the cw rhw and stww samples are shown in table 3 among the three types of water sources rhw had the lowest bacterial indicator populations followed by cw and stww in rhw samples total coliforms were detected in all 9 samples 100 whereas fecal coliforms were found in 6 samples 67 6 9 and generic e coli in 2 samples 22 2 9 populations of total coliforms and e coli in stww samples were significantly higher than in the other two types of waters as recovered by both detection methods however no significant differences were observed in populations of enterococci among the three types of waters additionally there were no significant differences between the two methods in enumerating total coliforms e coli and enterococci populations of cw rhw and stww table 9 however membrane filtration method detected significantly higher fecal coliforms in stww than the concentrator method 3 2 detection of anaerobic bacteria table 4 shows the prevalence of b fragilis and c perfringens from the tested water samples high prevalence of b fragilis was detected in stww 86 6 7 positive but none in cw 0 9 and rhw 0 9 in stww samples b fragilis populations enumerated by the membrane filtration method and the concentrator method were different p 0 05 although no c perfringens populations were enumerated by direct plating in all three types of water sources by both detection methods high prevalence of c perfringens was detected in stww 100 7 7 cw 78 7 9 and rhw 66 6 9 following enrichment recovery of c perfringens in rhw was higher by the membrane filtration method which detected 67 positive compared to 44 positive by the concentrator method 3 3 detection of pathogenic bacteria results of the rt qpcr confirmed the presence of bacterial pathogens in the tested water samples as shown in table 5 in cw samples l monocytogenes was the only pathogen detected by both methods with further confirmation by chromogenic agars and rt qpcr assays although the presence of stx1 gene was detected in one of the cw samples by the membrane filtration method none of the presumptive colonies isolated from cw samples was confirmed positive for e coli o157 h7 results of the cw and rhw samples showed that both detection methods exerted similar performance in detecting l monocytogenes and e coli o157 h7 in these two water sources salmonella spp were only detected in stww samples detection of salmonella positive samples varied with the detection method salmonella were recovered from 43 3 7 and 29 2 7 stww samples by the membrane filtration method and the concentrator method respectively similarly e coli o157 h7 was recovered from 2 stww samples using membrane filtration method however only one sample was detected using the concentrator method 3 4 prevalence of e coli virulence genes table 6 shows the prevalence of e coli virulence genes including flic h7 antigen rfb o157 antigen and shiga toxin genes stx1 and stx2 high prevalence of flic rfbe and stx 1 genes were found in all three water sources shiga toxigenic gene stx1 was detected in 6 rhw 67 5 stww 71 and 8 cw 89 samples analyzed by the concentrator method whereas only 6 cw 67 samples were identified as stx1 positive when analyzed by the membrane filtration method the concentrator method also detected higher prevalence of the rfb gene than the membrane filtration method the rfb gene was detected in 89 8 9 and 71 5 7 cw and stww samples by the concentrator method as compared to 56 5 9 and 57 4 7 rfb positive samples respectively by the membrane filtration method prevalence of stx2 gene was very low only one of the rhw 1 9 contained stx2 and none in cw or stww 3 5 chemistry of water samples the average values of ph chlorine total and free chlorine and ec of all tested water samples met irrigation water quality standards according to fao s guideline ayers and westcot 1985 with the exception of the slightly higher ec recorded in stww as shown in table 7 the average ec of stww was 0 98 0 14 ds m which was in the range of the slight to moderate degree of restriction on use for irrigation water according to fao guidelines 0 7 3 0 ds m 3 6 correlation between chemistry and microbial indicators results of all water samples from cw rhw and stww were pooled and analyzed for pearson product moment correlation coefficients r and p value as shown in table 8 significant positive relationships p 0 05 were observed among all the microbial indicators total coliforms fecal coliforms e coli and enterococci and the highest correlation was between the e coli and fecal coliform populations r 0 8559 p 0 05 followed by between e coli and total coliforms r 0 7978 p 0 05 further the ec of the water samples was significantly correlated with total coliforms 0 4943 fecal coliforms 0 4418 and e coli 0 5877 populations 4 discussion it is estimated that 44 of the population in the world will be living in water stressed condition by 2050 scheierling et al 2011 when water becomes limited for human consumption it will be difficult to acquire water for irrigation purpose as the world faces increasing water scarcity the use of waste water roof harvest rainwater and creek water for irrigation would represent advantageous alternative sources to determine the microbiological safety of these sources as irrigation waters for fresh produce quantification and detection of indicator and pathogenic bacteria are important to ensure the fresh produce safety for human consumption a rt qpcr method was compared with the membrane filtration method for enumeration of e coli in surface water vital et al 2017 in their study rt qpcr method recovered significantly lower e coli populations than the membrane filtration method detection of enterococci in recreational water by the membrane filtration and the defined substrate based enterolert showed lower recovery p 0 05 by the latter method and reported that enterolert method was not equivalent to the membrane filtration method valente et al 2010 during a long term study buckalew et al 2006 reported that e coli populations detected by colilert in environmental water samples were similar to those detected by the membrane filtration method in the current study we also compared a new concentrator method against membrane filtration the comparative evaluation of the membrane filtration method and the concentrator method revealed no significant differences in recovery of indicator bacteria except for lower recovery of fecal coliforms in stww with the concentrator method the results suggest that the concentrator method may be used to accurately determine the populations of total coliforms e coli and enterococci in alternative irrigation waters the method may recover lower populations of fecal coliforms in stww samples moreover c perfringens and bacteroides spp have also been used as indicators of fecal contamination in water bisson and cabelli 1979 sartory et al 1998 fogarty and voytek 2005 layton et al 2006 similar to the populations of traditional indicator bacteria high prevalence of c perfringens was detected in all three alternative water sources by both detection methods according to the proposed fsma produce safety rule the irrigation water that is directly applied to growing produce should contain no more than 2 61 log cfu 100 ml e coli per sample statistical threshold value stv and 2 10 log cfu 100 ml of a geometric mean n 5 samples usfda 2013 therefore it is important that a detection method should provide accurate enumerations for e coli populations in irrigation water in the current study e coli was detected in 8 cw 2 rhw and all 7 stww samples ranging from 0 6 to 4 0 log cfu 100 ml escherichia coli populations in cw and rhw samples were within fsma regulation however 5 stww samples contained e coli populations higher than the stv for direct irrigation application results of the current study not only support the usage of concentrator method to enumerate e coli in alternative irrigation waters but also indicate that stww may only be used for drip or furrow irrigation where water is not in direct contact with the harvestable portion of crop subsurface drip irrigation has been shown to reduce contamination magnitude of crops as compared to other irrigation systems such as overhead irrigation stine et al 2005 in this study both detection methods were comparable in detecting pathogenic bacteria in cw and rhw samples and detected equal number of pathogen positive samples however the concentrator method missed one of the three salmonella positive and one of the two e coli o157 h7 positive stww samples overall we observed that the accuracy and sensitivity of the concentrator method for microbiological quality assessments in stww were compromised for bacterial pathogen detection and fecal coliform enumeration presence of solid particulates and or chemicals in the stww samples might have interfered with the target organisms in the concentrating pipette thereby negatively affecting the recovery of these bacteria as per usepa s guidelines secondary treatment standards are minimum requirements for wastewater treatment plants usepa 2017 the stww was selected for this study because it is more accessible wastewater source and may resemble to poor quality water moreover stww samples that contained higher bacterial populations than tertiary treated wastewater were preferred in order to differentiate the accuracy and sensitivity between the two methods in this study stww samples had a relatively higher average ec than the other two sources the higher ec indicates higher salinity of water which reduces plant biomass and plant growth when used for crop irrigation thereby reducing the crop yield and its quality lazof and bernstein 1999 bernstein and kafkafi 2002 electric conductivity of cw depends on the surrounding geology for example minerals in clay and limestone soils ionize as they dissolve and contribute to water conductivity wetzel 2001 the higher ec of stww than the other two water sources might be due to higher concentrations of calcium ions and organic carbon solutes usepa 2012b djaouda et al 2013 reported that water with higher ec supported the survival of e coli and salmonella spp which supports the findings of the current study that stww samples contained significantly higher e coli populations than cw and rhw additionally salmonella was only detected in stww samples among all three types of waters previously the presence of salmonella had been reported in wastewater blumenthal et al 1989 mara and cairncross 1989 shuval 1991 melloul et al 2001 investigating the prevalence of e coli virulence genes in irrigation water may be helpful in determining the microbiological safety of these alternative water sources a published multiplex pcr assay was conducted in this study for rapidly detecting the prevalence of all four e coli virulence genes in one single reaction hu et al 1999 we observed high prevalence of flic rfb and stx1 genes but low prevalence of stx2 gene in all water sources studied the results concur with our previous study where 36 80 of cw samples collected in pennsylvania contained shiga toxin genes shelton et al 2011 recent study by topalcengiz et al 2017 confirmed high prevalence of flic 52 and stx1 33 gene but low prevalence of stx2 9 in central florida irrigation water ponds interestingly although cw and rhw met the fsma standard as irrigation water sources at least one virulence gene of e coli was detected in these water samples detection of e coli virulence genes by the concentrator was superior to the membrane filtration method in cw and similar in other waters which suggest that the novel concentrator method can also be used for detecting virulence genes in these waters traditionally the membrane filtration method has been widely used for water quality analysis however this technique is not applicable for waters with a level of turbidity that would cause the filter to become blocked before an adequate volume of water has passed through sis 1996 eckner 1998 kÃ¶ster et al 2003 further background heterotrophic bacteria may decrease the recovery of coliforms in water by membrane filtration burlingame et al 1984 the concentrator method possessed one significant practical advantage when used for water samples with high particulate content in the current study membrane filters were clogged while processing some of the cw and stww samples due to water turbidity however there was no clogging issue observed using the concentrator method turbid water sample can be diluted with a sterile water or multiple filters can be used to avoid clogging in the membrane filtration method the concentrator examined in this study uses tangentially loaded filtration concentrating pipette to capture microorganisms and the trapped microorganisms are released through a patented wet foam elution process into 250 Î¼l pbs based elution fluid it does not require vacuum and filter manifold setup previously hunter et al 2011 used ultrafiltration and the concentrator to detect e coli o157 h7 in spiked recreational water and reported that this method provided accurate detection of this pathogen the current study was the first report using the concentrator method to determine populations of indicator bacteria the presence of pathogenic bacteria and the prevalence of e coli virulence genes in alternative irrigation waters where results were comparable to the membrane filtration method in cw and rhw samples 5 conclusions the concentrator method is comparable to membrane filtration method for analyzing microbiological quality of creek water and roof harvested water it is superior in detecting virulence genes associated with e coli o157 h7 in creek water the concentrator method is simple highly effective and rapid in detecting bacterial populations in irrigation water and can be used as an alternative to traditional tedious membrane

least significance difference test to ensure that the data were normally distributed standardized skewness was verified in addition pearson product moment correlation coefficients r among the chemical and microbial properties of the water samples were analyzed p 0 05 3 results 3 1 bacterial indicator populations bacterial indicator populations of the cw rhw and stww samples are shown in table 3 among the three types of water sources rhw had the lowest bacterial indicator populations followed by cw and stww in rhw samples total coliforms were detected in all 9 samples 100 whereas fecal coliforms were found in 6 samples 67 6 9 and generic e coli in 2 samples 22 2 9 populations of total coliforms and e coli in stww samples were significantly higher than in the other two types of waters as recovered by both detection methods however no significant differences were observed in populations of enterococci among the three types of waters additionally there were no significant differences between the two methods in enumerating total coliforms e coli and enterococci populations of cw rhw and stww table 9 however membrane filtration method detected significantly higher fecal coliforms in stww than the concentrator method 3 2 detection of anaerobic bacteria table 4 shows the prevalence of b fragilis and c perfringens from the tested water samples high prevalence of b fragilis was detected in stww 86 6 7 positive but none in cw 0 9 and rhw 0 9 in stww samples b fragilis populations enumerated by the membrane filtration method and the concentrator method were different p 0 05 although no c perfringens populations were enumerated by direct plating in all three types of water sources by both detection methods high prevalence of c perfringens was detected in stww 100 7 7 cw 78 7 9 and rhw 66 6 9 following enrichment recovery of c perfringens in rhw was higher by the membrane filtration method which detected 67 positive compared to 44 positive by the concentrator method 3 3 detection of pathogenic bacteria results of the rt qpcr confirmed the presence of bacterial pathogens in the tested water samples as shown in table 5 in cw samples l monocytogenes was the only pathogen detected by both methods with further confirmation by chromogenic agars and rt qpcr assays although the presence of stx1 gene was detected in one of the cw samples by the membrane filtration method none of the presumptive colonies isolated from cw samples was confirmed positive for e coli o157 h7 results of the cw and rhw samples showed that both detection methods exerted similar performance in detecting l monocytogenes and e coli o157 h7 in these two water sources salmonella spp were only detected in stww samples detection of salmonella positive samples varied with the detection method salmonella were recovered from 43 3 7 and 29 2 7 stww samples by the membrane filtration method and the concentrator method respectively similarly e coli o157 h7 was recovered from 2 stww samples using membrane filtration method however only one sample was detected using the concentrator method 3 4 prevalence of e coli virulence genes table 6 shows the prevalence of e coli virulence genes including flic h7 antigen rfb o157 antigen and shiga toxin genes stx1 and stx2 high prevalence of flic rfbe and stx 1 genes were found in all three water sources shiga toxigenic gene stx1 was detected in 6 rhw 67 5 stww 71 and 8 cw 89 samples analyzed by the concentrator method whereas only 6 cw 67 samples were identified as stx1 positive when analyzed by the membrane filtration method the concentrator method also detected higher prevalence of the rfb gene than the membrane filtration method the rfb gene was detected in 89 8 9 and 71 5 7 cw and stww samples by the concentrator method as compared to 56 5 9 and 57 4 7 rfb positive samples respectively by the membrane filtration method prevalence of stx2 gene was very low only one of the rhw 1 9 contained stx2 and none in cw or stww 3 5 chemistry of water samples the average values of ph chlorine total and free chlorine and ec of all tested water samples met irrigation water quality standards according to fao s guideline ayers and westcot 1985 with the exception of the slightly higher ec recorded in stww as shown in table 7 the average ec of stww was 0 98 0 14 ds m which was in the range of the slight to moderate degree of restriction on use for irrigation water according to fao guidelines 0 7 3 0 ds m 3 6 correlation between chemistry and microbial indicators results of all water samples from cw rhw and stww were pooled and analyzed for pearson product moment correlation coefficients r and p value as shown in table 8 significant positive relationships p 0 05 were observed among all the microbial indicators total coliforms fecal coliforms e coli and enterococci and the highest correlation was between the e coli and fecal coliform populations r 0 8559 p 0 05 followed by between e coli and total coliforms r 0 7978 p 0 05 further the ec of the water samples was significantly correlated with total coliforms 0 4943 fecal coliforms 0 4418 and e coli 0 5877 populations 4 discussion it is estimated that 44 of the population in the world will be living in water stressed condition by 2050 scheierling et al 2011 when water becomes limited for human consumption it will be difficult to acquire water for irrigation purpose as the world faces increasing water scarcity the use of waste water roof harvest rainwater and creek water for irrigation would represent advantageous alternative sources to determine the microbiological safety of these sources as irrigation waters for fresh produce quantification and detection of indicator and pathogenic bacteria are important to ensure the fresh produce safety for human consumption a rt qpcr method was compared with the membrane filtration method for enumeration of e coli in surface water vital et al 2017 in their study rt qpcr method recovered significantly lower e coli populations than the membrane filtration method detection of enterococci in recreational water by the membrane filtration and the defined substrate based enterolert showed lower recovery p 0 05 by the latter method and reported that enterolert method was not equivalent to the membrane filtration method valente et al 2010 during a long term study buckalew et al 2006 reported that e coli populations detected by colilert in environmental water samples were similar to those detected by the membrane filtration method in the current study we also compared a new concentrator method against membrane filtration the comparative evaluation of the membrane filtration method and the concentrator method revealed no significant differences in recovery of indicator bacteria except for lower recovery of fecal coliforms in stww with the concentrator method the results suggest that the concentrator method may be used to accurately determine the populations of total coliforms e coli and enterococci in alternative irrigation waters the method may recover lower populations of fecal coliforms in stww samples moreover c perfringens and bacteroides spp have also been used as indicators of fecal contamination in water bisson and cabelli 1979 sartory et al 1998 fogarty and voytek 2005 layton et al 2006 similar to the populations of traditional indicator bacteria high prevalence of c perfringens was detected in all three alternative water sources by both detection methods according to the proposed fsma produce safety rule the irrigation water that is directly applied to growing produce should contain no more than 2 61 log cfu 100 ml e coli per sample statistical threshold value stv and 2 10 log cfu 100 ml of a geometric mean n 5 samples usfda 2013 therefore it is important that a detection method should provide accurate enumerations for e coli populations in irrigation water in the current study e coli was detected in 8 cw 2 rhw and all 7 stww samples ranging from 0 6 to 4 0 log cfu 100 ml escherichia coli populations in cw and rhw samples were within fsma regulation however 5 stww samples contained e coli populations higher than the stv for direct irrigation application results of the current study not only support the usage of concentrator method to enumerate e coli in alternative irrigation waters but also indicate that stww may only be used for drip or furrow irrigation where water is not in direct contact with the harvestable portion of crop subsurface drip irrigation has been shown to reduce contamination magnitude of crops as compared to other irrigation systems such as overhead irrigation stine et al 2005 in this study both detection methods were comparable in detecting pathogenic bacteria in cw and rhw samples and detected equal number of pathogen positive samples however the concentrator method missed one of the three salmonella positive and one of the two e coli o157 h7 positive stww samples overall we observed that the accuracy and sensitivity of the concentrator method for microbiological quality assessments in stww were compromised for bacterial pathogen detection and fecal coliform enumeration presence of solid particulates and or chemicals in the stww samples might have interfered with the target organisms in the concentrating pipette thereby negatively affecting the recovery of these bacteria as per usepa s guidelines secondary treatment standards are minimum requirements for wastewater treatment plants usepa 2017 the stww was selected for this study because it is more accessible wastewater source and may resemble to poor quality water moreover stww samples that contained higher bacterial populations than tertiary treated wastewater were preferred in order to differentiate the accuracy and sensitivity between the two methods in this study stww samples had a relatively higher average ec than the other two sources the higher ec indicates higher salinity of water which reduces plant biomass and plant growth when used for crop irrigation thereby reducing the crop yield and its quality lazof and bernstein 1999 bernstein and kafkafi 2002 electric conductivity of cw depends on the surrounding geology for example minerals in clay and limestone soils ionize as they dissolve and contribute to water conductivity wetzel 2001 the higher ec of stww than the other two water sources might be due to higher concentrations of calcium ions and organic carbon solutes usepa 2012b djaouda et al 2013 reported that water with higher ec supported the survival of e coli and salmonella spp which supports the findings of the current study that stww samples contained significantly higher e coli populations than cw and rhw additionally salmonella was only detected in stww samples among all three types of waters previously the presence of salmonella had been reported in wastewater blumenthal et al 1989 mara and cairncross 1989 shuval 1991 melloul et al 2001 investigating the prevalence of e coli virulence genes in irrigation water may be helpful in determining the microbiological safety of these alternative water sources a published multiplex pcr assay was conducted in this study for rapidly detecting the prevalence of all four e coli virulence genes in one single reaction hu et al 1999 we observed high prevalence of flic rfb and stx1 genes but low prevalence of stx2 gene in all water sources studied the results concur with our previous study where 36 80 of cw samples collected in pennsylvania contained shiga toxin genes shelton et al 2011 recent study by topalcengiz et al 2017 confirmed high prevalence of flic 52 and stx1 33 gene but low prevalence of stx2 9 in central florida irrigation water ponds interestingly although cw and rhw met the fsma standard as irrigation water sources at least one virulence gene of e coli was detected in these water samples detection of e coli virulence genes by the concentrator was superior to the membrane filtration method in cw and similar in other waters which suggest that the novel concentrator method can also be used for detecting virulence genes in these waters traditionally the membrane filtration method has been widely used for water quality analysis however this technique is not applicable for waters with a level of turbidity that would cause the filter to become blocked before an adequate volume of water has passed through sis 1996 eckner 1998 kÃ¶ster et al 2003 further background heterotrophic bacteria may decrease the recovery of coliforms in water by membrane filtration burlingame et al 1984 the concentrator method possessed one significant practical advantage when used for water samples with high particulate content in the current study membrane filters were clogged while processing some of the cw and stww samples due to water turbidity however there was no clogging issue observed using the concentrator method turbid water sample can be diluted with a sterile water or multiple filters can be used to avoid clogging in the membrane filtration method the concentrator examined in this study uses tangentially loaded filtration concentrating pipette to capture microorganisms and the trapped microorganisms are released through a patented wet foam elution process into 250 Î¼l pbs based elution fluid it does not require vacuum and filter manifold setup previously hunter et al 2011 used ultrafiltration and the concentrator to detect e coli o157 h7 in spiked recreational water and reported that this method provided accurate detection of this pathogen the current study was the first report using the concentrator method to determine populations of indicator bacteria the presence of pathogenic bacteria and the prevalence of e coli virulence genes in alternative irrigation waters where results were comparable to the membrane filtration method in cw and rhw samples 5 conclusions the concentrator method is comparable to membrane filtration method for analyzing microbiological quality of creek water and roof harvested water it is superior in detecting virulence genes associated with e coli o157 h7 in creek water the concentrator method is simple highly effective and rapid in detecting bacterial populations in irrigation water and can be used as an alternative to traditional tedious membrane filtration method the type of water sources may influence the accuracy and efficiency of the concentrator disclosure the mention of trade names or commercial products does not imply recommendation or

farms in the world are irrigated with surface irrigation in surface irrigation if deep percolation and runoff increase occur the efficiency and uniformity of water distribution along the field will be decreased resulting in low irrigation performance moravejalahkami et al 2012 therefore decreasing deep percolation and runoff are very important to improve the efficiency and uniformity of surface irrigation for the design and evaluation of surface irrigation deep percolation and runoff values are investigated using simulation models however due to the complexities of surface irrigation systems simulation models are not able to determine the optimal solutions simulation optimization models using mathematical calculation and objective function and constraints applied to the system can compensate for this disadvantage of simulation models mishra et al 2005 wu et al 2016 development of a simulation optimization model for surface irrigation systems is carried out based on the initial

2004 burguete et al 2014 the mentioned models and software are not able to perform optimization thus hydraulic performance indicators are considered and calculated separately where the effectiveness of irrigation hart et al 1979 depends on the simultaneous consideration of hydraulic performance indicators valipour and montazar 2012b regarding the optimization of surface irrigation methods researchers have used different models algorithms performance indicators and decision variables in the optimec model to find the quasi optimum combination of irrigation date cut off time and inflow

are few studies on the development of simulation optimization models based on meta heuristic algorithms for the design and evaluation of surface irrigation using these models is an idea to optimize the hydraulic performance of surface irrigation and to present an optimal strategy to simultaneously reduce deep percolation and runoff and increase efficiency and uniformity also there is a need to

of surface irrigation model was developed for surface irrigation in this model for the simulation of the surface hydraulic flow which consisted of the design and evaluation of basin border and furrow irrigation the volume balance model walker and skogerboe 1987 was used regarding optimization twenty meta heuristic algorithms blum and roli 2003 engelbrecht 2007 yang 2010a b were applied fig 1 2 2 simulation in the edosim model hydraulic simulation of surface irrigation in the edosim model was done using the volume balance equation lewis and milne 1938 1 0 t q t d t 0 x a x t d x 0 x z x t d x where q t is inlet discharge and a x t z x t are the cross sectional area of the surface and subsurface flow which variate with distance x and time t to solve the volume balance equation the numerical power advance method walker and skogerboe 1987 including the kostiakov lewis infiltration z kta f0t and the power advance x ptr equations was used based on the assumptions of a 0 77 a0 and q t q0 eq 1 could be rearranged as follows elliott and walker 1982 2 q 0 t 0 77 a 0 x Ï z k t a x f 0 t x 1 r where k a and f0 are the parameters of kostiakov lewis equation r and p are the parameters of power advance equation q0 is the inlet discharge a0 is the cross section at the inlet and Ïz is the subsurface shape factor to calculate the volume of infiltration when there is no advance and recession table for the design optimization of design evaluation without advance and recession table and optimization of evaluation a method was proposed that was dependent on the irrigation method in this method auxiliary points of 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 of the field length were considered and the length of field was divided into four equal sections for the design and evaluation of basin infiltrations in 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 of the field length z0 25 z0 50 and z0 75 were obtained from the linear interpolation between z0 and zl eq 3 for the design and evaluation of border and furrow advance times tadv0 25

furrow in the edosim model vary tables s1 and s2 design and evaluation leads to the calculation of the performance indicators and the objective function tables s1 and s2 2 3 optimization in the edosim model in the edosim model the functional presentation of the objective function by a mathematical formula multi dimensional more than one decision variable static without taking seasonal and spatial variations of inputs and outputs and not considering the time window constraint considering constraints in the objective function continuous using continuous algorithms single objective hydraulic objective and meta heuristic optimization using the mechanisms to exit from local optima was used haupt and haupt 2004 the optimization inputs of the edosim model included the objective function decision variables selection of optimization algorithms and algorithm parameters as discussed in the following sections 2 3 1 objective function the objective function of the edosim model was formulated from the combination of seven performance indicators these seven performance indicators included three concepts of uniformity adequacy and efficiency that are necessary and sufficient for the full explanation of surface irrigation canone et al 2015 the multi objective problem of the edosim model was formulated as the utility function method keeney 1982 in this method the utility or total objective function was obtained from the linear combination of all the objectives because of the uni dimensional objectives the decomposition method of weighted sum zhang and li 2007 with single objective algorithms was used the ideal values for each application efficiency ea irrigation efficiency ei requirement efficiency er distribution uniformity du and distribution efficiency de were one and the ideal values for each tail water ratio twr and deep percolation ratio dpr were zero in the edosim model the minimum hydraulic objective function z including the above performance indicators was formulated in such a way that there would be a global optimum of zero in theory 10 z 1 ea 100 1 ei 100 1 er 100 1 du 100 1 de 100 twr 100 dpr 100 1 Î² violation where the term 1 Î² violation is the penalty term that acts in optimization where the outrage from the constraints takes place violation is the value of penalty tables s1 and s2 given that the objective function can be between zeros and seven the value of Î² coefficient of penalty was assumed to be equal to 100 which showed a high penalty 2 3 2 decision variables decision variables such as discharge are those that have a direct impact on the objective function and can be adjusted parameters such as the manning roughness coefficient can not be changed decision variables and parameters which were selected from the inputs of design or evaluation of basin border and furrow and constraints are presented for the optimization of design and evaluation table 1 the optimization of design and evaluation of furrow due to the ability to change the cross section can have more potential for optimization in comparison with the design and evaluation of basin and border width except furrow and cut off time in the optimization of evaluation are decision variables but in optimization of design they are not decision variables because they will be determined in the design process slope in the optimization of evaluation of basin is also as decision variable but in the optimization of design of basin it is known as zero and can not be taken a decision variable decision variables of zreq and lf determine the optimal level of irrigation and leaching respectively 2 3 3 selection of the optimization algorithm there is no exact algorithm for solving the objective function of the edosim model by considering one decision variable valipour and montazar 2012b due to more than one decision variable in the edosim model the use of heuristic or meta heuristic algorithms was inevitable as there is no mechanism for the escape from the local optima in heuristic algorithms meta heuristic algorithms were used in the edosim model among hundreds of meta heuristic algorithms twenty famous and more applicable algorithms were used blum and roli 2003 engelbrecht 2007 yang 2010a b table s3 to apply each of the twenty optimization algorithms five steps were followed 1 problem definition including the definition of the objective function range and the number of decision variables 2 the optimization algorithm parameters 3 initialization such as initial population and basic settings and the memory required to be filled by the algorithm 4 the generation and evaluation of the solutions by the main loop of the algorithm and 5 the display of the results in the genetic algorithm of the edosim model three methods of roulette wheel selection tournament selection and random selection holland 1975 have been implemented in the edosim model the usability of constriction coefficient rule in pso eberhart and shi 2000 has been created 2 3 4 algorithm parameters in the edosim model the parameters are set based on the selected algorithm for all algorithms the specific number of iterations maxit was considered as the stopping criterion to set the parameters of algorithms the taguchi method using minitab software mathews 2005 was used this method is one of the fractional factorial methods of design of experiments doe by requiring fewer tests and less processing time than the full factorial method it also enjoys generality and simplicity montgomery 2008 for each of the experimental fields optimizations were made based on the constant values of the maximum and minimum limits of decision variables considering three levels for each of the parameters of each algorithm based on the taguchi method the 2 parameter algorithm of tlbo the 4 parameters algorithm of sa with 9 runs and the remaining algorithms that had at least 5 parameters with 27 runs were set determination of the candidate values of the parameter levels is possible by trial and error personal experience and referring to the previous studies in this study the mechanism of algorithms was also considered for example in the harmony search algorithm the performance of the pitch adjustment rate par is similar to the mutation percentage pm in the genetic algorithm therefore levels of par were determined in a way similar to that of the mutation percentage 2 4 simulation optimization process in the edosim model five steps were followed to solve the objective function of the edosim model with meta heuristic algorithms fig 2 1 creating a mechanism to define save and retrieve the model 2 defining a mechanism for creating random solutions including naive decision variables coding 3 creating a mechanism to change naive decision variables to main decision variables of problem parsing 4 calculating the objective function value and satisfiying the constraints and 5 connecting the objective function to the optimization algorithm in the section related to the production of the feasible solution the preserving strategies which is a method for the optimization constraint handling was used talbi 2009 for example for the decision variable of length it can be written as l lmin lhat lmax lmin given that lhat is always between zero and one lmin l lmax therefore the constraint of length could be satisfied automatically among the parameters more changes could be observed for the values of advance time to the end and to the one half of the field length tl and t0 5l due to the changes in the field size and the flow rate therefore for the evaluation of all irrigation methods of basin border and furrow based on the assumption that the coefficient and exponent of the power advance equation r and p are constant as compared to the initial evaluation after the production of the feasible solution for the length we can write t 0 5 l h 2 h 2 0 5 l p 1 r t l l p 1 r where 0 5l l 2 2 5 implementation of the edosim model for programming a combination of the functional and graphical style in matlab programming software was used and a graphical user interface gui mathworks 2015c was designed in the edosim model to reduce the run time it was attempted to use vectorized programming techniques getreuer 2006 as much as possible also the pre allocation technique getreuer 2006 was used to cover the fault of the interpreter matlab programming language as it took more time to run 2 6 validation of the edosim model 2 6 1 validation of simulation for the validation of simulation fifteen experimental field data were used table s4 shows an overview of these field data including the design and evaluation of basin border and furrow irrigation more details are given in tables s5 s7 the objective function values of the edosim model zei without considering the penalty term were compared with the calculated objective function values for the hydrodynamic model zhi of the sirmod software walker 2003 as a base method the statistical indicators of the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse coefficient of residual mass crm and normalized rmse nrmse were used for this purpose pulvento et al 2013 dokoohaki et al 2016 n 15 positive and negative values of crm indicator indicated the underestimation and overestimation of the model as compared to the observation value respectively pulvento et al 2013 11 r m s e i 1 n z h i z e i 2 n 12 c r m i 1 n z h i i 1 n z e i i 1 n z h i 13 nrmse 100 rmse zh the observed and predicted advance data for the edosim model were also compared using the same four statistical indicators for the fields 12 15 which had advance and recession data 2 6 2 validation of optimization after the initial simulation of the fifteen experimental fields optimization of the fields was carried out using each of the twenty algorithms with the adjusted parameters for all the algorithms the same minimum and maximum of decision variables were used the validation of optimization was then applied by following two steps 1 comparison of the algorithms with each other and 2 comparison of the theoretical optimum with matlab software 1 criterion for the comparison of the algorithms with each other and determination of the rank was the lower weighted sums of the dimensionless criteria the run time the objective function and the number of function evaluation nfe orouji et al 2013 each of the criteria in each algorithm was dimensionless in comparison to the maximum values of the same criteria in all algorithms 2 the lowest objective function among all of the algorithms was the theoretical optimum the theoretical optimum of the edosim model was compared with the fmincon solver of optimization toolbox mathworks 2015b and seven solvers of globalsearch multistart patternsearch particleswarm ga simulannealbnd and gamultiobj of the global optimization toolbox mathworks 2015a of matlab software the same values for the minimum and maximum of decision variables assumed for the algorithms of the edosim model were used for the eight solvers 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of simulation statistical indicators showed a close agreement between the observed and predicted advance data for the edosim model in the fields 12 15 which had advance and recession data fig 3 the value of rmse was between 0 5 1 3 min which indicated the low errror of the edosim model in the estimation of the observed advance data the value of r2 was also varied between 0 996 and 1 for the fields 14 and 12 showing a high correlation of the edosim model with the observed advance data the value of crm indicator was varied between 0 02 and 0 027 min revealing the low bias of the predicted advance data by the edosim model as compared to the observed advance data the values of nrmse were lower than ten percent showing the very good simulation of the edosim model dokoohaki et al 2016 the performance indicators and the objective functions of the fifteen experimental fields were determined using the edosim model then the objective function of the edosim model ze was compared with the hydrodynamic model of sirmod software zh table 2 in the comparison of ze and zh for 15 experimental fields the values of rmse r2 crm and nrmse were 0 068 0 988 0 005 and 4 2 respectively the values of rmse r2 crm and nrmse were in a close agreement with the values of zero one zero and zero respectively this showed low error high correlation low bias and a very good simulation for the edosim model respectively pulvento et al 2013 dokoohaki et al 2016 therefore the volume balance method used in the edosim model despite its simplicity as compared to the hydrodynamic model of sirmod software had a good accuracy the objective functions of fifteen experimental fields that resulted from the edosim model varied from 0 52 to 2 53 table 2 according to eq 10 the objective function values could be between zeros to seven therefore the initial hydraulic performance of the field simulations was different the fields with the higher objective function could have a better hydraulic performance lower objective function for design fields fields 1 10 and field no 11 which had no advance and recession data the proposed method was used to estimate the volume of infiltration the comparison of the objective functions ze and zh indicated the good performance of the proposed method 3 2 parameters setting of algorithms for all fifteen experimental fields each of the twenty optimization algorithms had a number of parameters and each parameter had three levels the results showed that each parameter had different optimal levels the level of each parameter having the best results in more fields was considered as the default value in the algorithms parameter setting windows default values for the parameters of the algorithms table s8 provided a low objective function within a reasonable time than the computational time of each algorithm they were a convenient starting point for decreasing the objective function through parameters setting in the ga and pso algorithms of the edosim model the application of roulette wheel selection and constriction coefficients rule presented the lower objective function respectively therefore these options were enabled by default 3 3 the changes in the range of decision variables field no 14 was used as an example to check the effect of the changes in the range of decision variables on the objective function high over irrigation occurred in this field and more than two thirds of the water was lost through deep percolation and runoff table 2 for the elimination of the optimization algorithm role and its parameters one of the algorithms of the edosim model with tuned parameters was used therefore the results were only related to the range of decision variables due to over irrigation in the initial evaluation some ranges for the decrease of discharge were considered table 3 the results showed the decrease of the objective function for each range table 3 comparison of the objective functions before table 2 and after table 3 optimization indicated the role of optimization in the improvement and the effect of discharge as a decision variable in surface irrigation 3 4 theoretical optimum 3 4 1 theoretical optimum of design in the optimization of design which was based on full irrigation decision variables of zreq and lf were not considered and they were the basic values for the optimization of design of basin fields 1 3 border fields 4 6 and furrow fields 7 10 respectively two three and eight other decision variables were considered table 4 due to the large number of the experimental fields in table s9 the results of the theoretical optimums of design for some of the experimental fields are presented the theoretical optimum for three fields of basin design and the obtained optimum length in the minimum allowed range are presented in table 4 optimization of the basin design reached the objective function value to a good level showing the potential of this method for example the comparison of the objective function of 1 56 table 2 and 0 33 table 4 for the field no 3 in the edosim model the cost of labor and relocation is not considered therefore the existence of 114 basins nb and 17 5 h of irrigation time cut off time of 9 2 min multiplied by the number of basins in the field no 1 table s9 could cause problems some of these problems could be solved by increasing the minimum length of basin with increasing the minimum length the optimum discharge was increased the width of basins was decreased and the number of basins along width was increased but the total number of basins was decreased this situation did not have much impact on the total irrigation time of the basins however because the objective function was increased the previous optimum plan was satisfied the width of field no 2 was 360 m table s5 and the optimal basins width was 63 m table s9 therefore 5 basins along the width were formed where 45 m of field width was lost the edosim model in addition to simulation optimization has the ability to simulate fig 1 therefore for no loss of width in the field no 2 with simulation after simulation optimization the width of basins could be 60 m such that 6 basins along the width could be formed this could not be scientific because the objective function was increased but it would be practical then the recent plan was assessed in the simulation design of basin of the edosim model by considering the value of 90 m for length and 0 25 m3 min m for discharge the same field was simulated and the objective function became 0 4 the results of theoretical optimum for three fields of border design showed that the optimum length occurred in the maximum allowed range table 4 for the field no 6 because the optimal length and discharge before table s5 and after table 4 optimization were similar only the slope was determinator table 4 in the optimization of the border design the advance time 145 9 and 1088 2 min for the field no 4 and 5 was greater than the cut off time 84 3 and 563 8 min for the fields no 4 and 5 table s9 which was compatible with the results of walker and skogerboe 1987 in the edosim model if there is no feasible solution an error message will be displayed for example in the field no 4 if the maximum and minimum discharge were equal to the value of 0 01 m3 min m by not considering other decision variables error message would be displayed because optimization of the border design was based on full irrigation 0 01 m3 min m was lower than the minimum discharge of 0 032 m3 min m table s9 in the field no 4 if the limit values of decision variables were similar to the values of table 4 and only the minimum slope were equal to 0 00001 the objective function would be 0 07 which could be very close to zero but in this situation from 360 m the length of the field a border with the length of 337 m was formed and 23 m of the field could not be in the optimal layout the optimal design of this field with the optimal slope of 0 0001 had the objective function value of 0 25 table 4 which was more worse than 0 07 however the optimal length of 360 m could be achieved which eliminated the resistance of farmers to losing the field field no 5 for the border design had the high bad objective function of 2 41 table 2 basin irrigation design was recommended for it by walker and skogerboe 1987 the optimal design of the basin for the field no 5 was performed in the field no 2 tables 4 and s9 in the optimization of this field the decision variable of slope which is the main difference between the border and basin had a high effect regardless of the leveling cost which was not considered in the edosim model by reducing the slope to 0 0000007 one border with the length of 360 m and the width of 227 m could be formed in the design of border this field had four borders and each border had the cut off time of 1000 min walker and skogerboe 1987 therefore irrigation time was 70 h which was not common after optimization the irrigation time became lower than 10 h 563 8 min with the objective function of 0 09 tables table 44 and s9 the only negative point of this optimized design was the loss of 133 m of the field width due to the availability of irrigation water the rest of the field could be considered for another optimal design the results of the theoretical optimum for four fields of furrow design showed that the optimum length occurred in the minimum allowed range table 4 given that in the design of furrow the number of decision variables was 10 and in the design of basin and border it was 4 and 5 the optimized layout could be obtained with the same or very little difference in the objective function for different combinations of decision variables these different combinations are often for the decision variables of the cross sectional area and slope it seems that in addition to the greater number of decision variables some of the reasons are the little range of change for the decision variables of cross sectional area and slope the multimodal objective function along these variables and probably the low sensitivity of algorithms to these variables however evaluating the trend of the objective function along these variables and performing sensitivity analysis could provide a more clear answer to this issue this issue was the case in all four fields the best optimization algorithm of the field no 9 offered four sets along the length and three sets along the width table s9 cut off time was 478 min and irrigation time was 96 h due to the large irrigation time it was important to evaluate the irrigation module system discharge was 6 m3 min 100 lps and the field area was about 26 ha table s6 therefore the irrigation module was approximately 4 l s ha based on the common irrigation modulus for surface irrigation about 2 l s ha with the continuous available water it could satisfy the requirements for the 16 h irrigation in a day the irrigation of the field could take 6 days and in each day two sets would be irrigated 3 4 2 theoretical optimum of evaluation because the optimization of evaluation is for one basin border or furrow contrary to the optimization of design there are no length and width of field and system discharge therefore the decision variables of length width and somewhat discharge could not be maneuvered in the optimization of design the degree of freedom for these variables is more but in the optimization of evaluation the field is available and a redesign is required therefore the decision variables of length and width or furrow spacing and tmax tmid base ymax were considered equal to the values of them in the initial evaluation and these variables were not considered to minimize the farmer s resistance to the change in the existing conditions if in the initial evaluation over irrigation occurred the decision variables of zreq and lf were not considered but in under irrigation the decision variable of zreq by 10 percent deficit irrigation was considered totally for the optimization of evaluation four decision variables were considered table 5 in table s10 the results related to the theoretical optimums of evaluation for some of the experimental fields are presented due to the over irrigation in the initial simulation of the field no 11 table 2 by optimizing this field slope was increased and the discharge and cut off time were reduced table 5 the objective function was changed from 1 75 for the evaluation of basin table 2 to the value of 0 095 for the optimization of evaluation of basin table 5 because of the requirement efficiency of lower than 100 percent in the field no 12 table 2 zreq decision variable was decreased to 0 18 m table 5 in addition by applying the high discharge per unit width and the low cut off time the objective function value reached to 0 1 table 5 in the optimization of border evaluation similar to the optimization of border design the cut off time 50 min in the field no 12 was lower than advance time 61 min in the field no 12 tables 5 and s10 in the optimization of border evaluation advance time 61 min in the field no 12 should be lower than recession time 98 3 min in the field no 12 tables s2 and s10 field no 14 which was relevant to evaluation of furrow in the initial simulation had the high unpleasantness objective function of 2 53 table 2 by considering the discharge as a decision variable this field reached to the objective function of 0 12 table 3 in the optimization of evaluation the cut off time is among the decision variables table 1 a suitable combination of discharge and cut off time as decision variables based on the condition of the possibility of implementation could provide excellent results it may be necessary to eliminate the consideration of other decision variables for example by applying the decision variable of cut off time in addition to discharge the objective function was reduced to 0 095 table 5 only with appropriate management practices combination of discharge and cut off time the water losses could be avoided and water would be received the same as what is required it was tried to the irrigation volume which is the product of discharge and cut off time not to be much different from the initial simulation field no 15 had under irrigation and large tail water runoff losses table 2 applying high discharge and low cut off time could overcome this problem table 5 this field had heavy textured soil with a large value of 0 224 m for the soil moisture deficit table s7 the high soil depth of 120 cm also caused this large soil moisture deficit abbasi et al 1999 in each surface irrigation event about 100 mm of water is applied tables s5 s7 therefore one half of the soil moisture deficits could be supplied and instead the 60 cm could be considered as soil depth by cultivating a plant with the effective root depth of 60 cm and considering the decision variables of discharge cut off time and soil moisture deficit performance indicators became close to the ideal ones table s10 3 5 validation of optimization 3 5 1 comparison of the algorithms with each other the twenty algorithms in addition to the rank can be assessed based on run time objective functions and nfe due to the large number of experimental fields and applied algorithms the comparison of the algorithms with each other for only three fields is provided table 6 the results of other fields had a similar trend in terms of the criterion of run time sce pso and ica algorithms table s3 were the best ones respectively table 6 also the run time of hybrid algorithms was much lower than the series run of each of basic algorithms given the similarity of the five steps in terms of solving the optimization problems with meta heuristic algorithms the reasons for differences in the run time of algorithms must be searched in the five steps to implement each of the twenty algorithms problem definition the optimization algorithm parameters initialization the main loop and display results in these five steps step 1 problem definition and step 5 display results were the same for all algorithms step 2 the optimization algorithm parameters did not play a role in the run time therefore only step 3 initialization and step 4 the main loop which contained the mastermind and paradigm of the algorithm could make the difference in run time the interpreter matlab programming language caused a slight slowdown but since all algorithms of the edosim model were written by matlab language the runtime of algorithms did not depend on programming language the most important reason for the difference in run time in addition to the number of lines and the inherent complexity of implementing algorithms was the use of repeat loops and conditional constructs in the case of no possibility to use vectorized programming techniques this problem was intensified when the nested repeat loops and conditional constructs were implemented in the algorithm for example in the implementation of the fa algorithm which had the most run time the nested repeat loops and conditional constructs had been used which attempt to review all the cases in terms of the objective function criterion the results of abc acor ba bbo ica mba pso psoga sce and tlbo algorithms could be trusted table 6 by increasing the number of decision variables and having the optimal of these variables between the upper and lower allowed limit algorithms could find more differences the reason lies in the objective function value of algorithms in the experimental field no 3 design of basin with five decision variables and the experimental field no 8 design of furrow with 10 decision variables in the experimental field no 3 fifteen algorithms and in the experimental field no 8 only six algorithms achieved the best results table 6 in terms of the nfe criterion the sce algorithm and after that the pso and ica algorithms had the lowest nfe table 6 the run time and nfe were in a direct proportion obviously hybrid algorithms as compared to the basic ones had more nfe by the comparison of the objective function and nfe values the important point is the intelligence of algorithms and having a strong reason to find the optimum not utilize the power of computers and the random search therefore the lower nfe could obtain the lower objective function for example the sce algorithm while having the lowest nfe was one of the best algorithms in finding the lower objective function finally by checking the rank of algorithms sce algorithm was found to be the most compatible algorithm with the surface irrigation problem for the sets of field data used in this study table 6 this algorithm was presented for the rainfall runoff problem duan et al 1993 the pso and ica algorithms were placed in the next category after them sfla ga tlbo hs and bbo algorithms table s3 had a better rank among others table 6 in the next category de iwo acor abc ca gapso and psoga algorithms and after them mba fa ba sa and saga algorithms were placed 3 5 2 comparison of the theoretical optimum with the solvers of matlab software the results related to the theoretical optimum of the edosim model were the best in most cases and in the fields 12 and 14 they were among the best objective functions by a small difference table 7 among the eight built in solvers of matlab software the solver of particleswarm despite its simplicity provided the best results the lowest objective function table 7 the pso algorithm is one of the twenty algorithms of the edosim model in the previous section after sce algorithm it presented the best results therefore the superiority of the particleswarm solver in finding the lowest objective function confirmed the pso algorithm again the two solvers of globalsearch and multistart in all fields offered reasonable results table 7 in some cases they were the best especially in the optimization of design of border irrigation the ga and gamultiobj solvers were placed in the next ranks with little differences table 7 with some trial and error especially in the population size of these solvers the results showed improvement in the best situation they could be matched to the theoretical optimum of edosim model results the basic mode of the simulannealbnd solver like sa algorithm in the edosim was not efficient table 7 according to the guide of the global optimization toolbox mathworks 2015a a very slow logarithmic cooling pattern could improve it the patternsearch solver was placed at the rank of seven out of eight solvers lack of objective function gradient information and reliance only on the objective function could be regarded as the main reason for the weakness of this solver the fmincon solver of optimization toolbox which is a heuristic algorithm without a mechanism for escape from local optima had the worst results table 7 there was no exact algorithm to solve the objective function of the edosim model and the heuristic algorithms were weak therefore the best option was to use meta heuristic algorithms the meta heuristic algorithms with intelectal search structure and perfect parameters setting could have more chance of finding the global optimum the theoretical optimum of the edosim model had the minimum objective function while the optimization toolbox of matlab software had the maximum objective function global optimization toolbox of matlab software was ranked between these two 4 conclusions a simulation optimization surface irrigation model called edosim using volume balance model and meta heuristic algorithms was developed in the present study this model as compared to the previous models introduces the simulation optimization approach with the ability to consider simultaneously seven performance indicators and the decision variables and limitations for each decision variable therefore this model is able to present an optimal strategy to simultaneously reduce deep percolation and runoff and increase efficiency and uniformity the validation of the simulation of the edosim model through comparison with the hydrodynamic model of sirmod software showed the good performance of the edosim model and the proposed method in estimating the volume of infiltration based on fifteen sets of experimental field data optimization of basin irrigation helped the objective function to reach a value at a good level showing the potential of this method optimization of border irrigation also resulted in a cut off time lower than the advance time in the optimization of design of furrow irrigation the optimized layout was obtained with the same or very little difference in the objective function for different combinations of decision variables in the optimization of evaluation of basin border and furrow irrigation the proper combination of discharge and cut off time established a very good result that nearly eliminated the need to consider other decisions variables and also obviated the need to make any considerable changes in field situations to create the optimal conditions the comparison of the algorithms with each other showed that the sce algorithm and after that the pso and ica algorithms were the best ones for all experimental fields optimization with the edosim model caused the decrease improvement of the objective functions in comparison to the initial simulation performance the objective function of the edosim model was lower better than eight solvers of optimization and global optimization toolboxes of matlab software as a result the edosim model which is a specialized tool for surface irrigation despite its simplicity

11529,simulation optimization models are valuable tools for determining the optimal performance of systems the main objective of this research was to develop and validate edosim evaluation design and optimization of surface irrigation model as a simulation optimization model for surface irrigation systems for simulation which consisted of the design or evaluation of basin border and furrow

farms in the world are irrigated with surface irrigation in surface irrigation if deep percolation and runoff increase occur the efficiency and uniformity of water distribution along the field will be decreased resulting in low irrigation performance moravejalahkami et al 2012 therefore decreasing deep percolation and runoff are very important to improve the efficiency and uniformity of surface irrigation for the design and evaluation of surface irrigation deep percolation and runoff values are investigated using simulation models however due to the complexities of surface irrigation systems simulation models are not able to determine the optimal solutions simulation optimization models using mathematical calculation and objective function and constraints applied to the system can compensate for this disadvantage of simulation models mishra et al 2005 wu et al 2016 development of a simulation optimization model for surface irrigation systems is carried out based on the initial

been developed to cover the drawbacks of the initial optimization techniques talbi 2009 also with the expansion zhang and li 2007 improvement pham and castellani 2009 and hybridization ramezani and lotfi 2013 of the algorithms their performance can be improved many studies have been done to develop and use surface irrigation simulation models based on hydrodynamic zero inertia kinematic wave and volume balance models for the design and evaluation of surface irrigation methods ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 some of them include the hydrodynamic models of idimod fernÃ¡ndez gÃ³mez et al 2004 and sofip mailhol et al 2005 that are used to simulate furrow irrigation zero inertia model of zimod is employed to simulate border and furrow irrigation abbasi et al 2003 and sides model is also used to design and evaluate surface irrigation methods adamala et al 2014 some types of software have also been developed to improve the design and operation of surface irrigation bautista et al 2015 nrcs 2004 burguete et al 2014 the mentioned models and software are not able to perform optimization thus hydraulic performance indicators are considered and calculated separately where the effectiveness of irrigation hart et al 1979 depends on the simultaneous consideration of hydraulic performance indicators valipour and montazar 2012b regarding the optimization of surface irrigation methods researchers have used different models algorithms performance indicators and decision variables in the optimec model to find the quasi optimum combination of irrigation date cut off time and inflow rate the genetic algorithm was used montesinos et al 2001 in the winsrfr surface irrigation model for the optimization of length width and discharge the trial and error method was used bautista et al 2009a b in the swdc model for optimization of the discharge of furrow irrigation five performance indicators were used valipour and montazar 2012a in the pozal model to determine the optimal cut off time the secant numerical method was employed gonzÃ¡lez et al 2011 some examples of applied optimizations are optimization of the length and width of border irrigation based on the zero inertia model

hbmo meta heuristic algorithm in comparison with the traditional and gradient based methods in finding the shortest path of project management bozorg haddad et al 2010 has been mentioned also the lower better loss function of the resos simulation optimization model in comparison to the standard operating policy sop in reservoir operation jahanpour et al 2014 has been previously reported there are few studies on the development of simulation optimization models based on meta heuristic algorithms for the design and evaluation of surface irrigation using these models is an idea to optimize the hydraulic performance of surface irrigation and to present an optimal strategy to simultaneously reduce deep percolation and runoff and increase efficiency and uniformity also there is a need to simultaneously consider performance indicators and decision variables and limitations for each decision variable the objectives of this study were 1 development of a simulation optimization model for surface irrigation using the volume balance model and meta heuristic algorithms edosim model 2 validation of the simulation of the edosim model based on the comparison of results with those of the hydrodynamic model of the sirmod software by using different real sets of field data and 3 validation of the optimization of the edosim model through determining the best algorithms and comparing the optimal results with matlab software 2 materials and methods 2 1 introduction of the edosim model in this research a new simulation optimization model called edosim evaluation design and optimization of surface irrigation model was developed for surface irrigation in this model for the simulation of the surface hydraulic flow which consisted of the design and evaluation of basin border and furrow irrigation the volume balance model walker and skogerboe 1987 was used regarding optimization twenty meta heuristic algorithms blum and roli 2003 engelbrecht 2007 yang 2010a b were applied fig 1 2 2 simulation in the edosim model hydraulic simulation of surface irrigation in the edosim model was done using the volume balance equation lewis and milne 1938 1 0 t q t d t 0 x a x t d x 0 x z x t d x where q t is inlet discharge and a x t z x t are the cross sectional area of the surface and subsurface flow which variate with distance x and time t to solve the volume balance equation the numerical power advance method walker and skogerboe 1987 including the kostiakov lewis infiltration z kta f0t and the power advance x ptr equations was used based on the assumptions of a 0 77 a0 and q t q0 eq 1 could be rearranged as follows elliott and walker 1982 2 q 0 t 0 77 a 0 x Ï z k t a x f 0 t x 1 r where k a and f0 are the parameters of kostiakov lewis equation r and p are the parameters of power advance equation q0 is the inlet discharge a0 is the cross section at the inlet and Ïz is the subsurface shape factor to calculate the volume of infiltration when there is no advance and recession table for the design optimization of design evaluation without advance and recession table and optimization of evaluation a method was proposed that was dependent on the irrigation method in this method auxiliary points of 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 of the field length were considered and the length of field was divided into four equal sections for the design and evaluation of basin infiltrations in 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 of the field length z0 25 z0 50 and z0 75 were obtained from the linear interpolation between z0 and zl eq 3 for the design and evaluation of border and furrow advance times tadv0 25 tadv0 50 and tadv0 75 were calculated from the power advance equation eq 4 regarding the design and evaluation of border recession times trec0 25 trec0 50 trec0 75 were obtained from the linear interpolation between td and tr eq 5 in the design and evaluation of furrow recession times were considered equal to the cut off time for the design and evaluation of border and furrow opportunity times topp0 25 topp0 50 topp0 75 were obtained from the difference between advance and recession times eq 6 the infiltration values were calculated from the kostiakov lewis equation eq 7 for the design and evaluation of border and eq 8 for the design and evaluation of furrow in the design and evaluation of all three irrigation methods the volume of infiltration was calculated using the trapezoidal rule eq 9 3 z i 1 i z 0 iz l i 0 25 0 5 0 75 4 t advi il p 1 r i 0 25 0 5 0 75 5 t reci 1 i t d it r i 0 25 0 5 0 75 6 t oppi t reci t advi i 0 25 0 5 0 75 7 z i k t oppi a f 0 t oppi i 0

furrow in the edosim model vary tables s1 and s2 design and evaluation leads to the calculation of the performance indicators and the objective function tables s1 and s2 2 3 optimization in the edosim model in the edosim model the functional presentation of the objective function by a mathematical formula multi dimensional more than one decision variable static without taking seasonal and spatial variations of inputs and outputs and not considering the time window constraint considering constraints in the objective function continuous using continuous algorithms single objective hydraulic objective and meta heuristic optimization using the mechanisms to exit from local optima was used haupt and haupt 2004 the optimization inputs of the edosim model included the objective function decision variables selection of optimization algorithms and algorithm parameters as discussed in the following sections 2 3 1 objective function the objective function of the edosim model was formulated from the combination of seven performance indicators these seven performance indicators included three concepts of uniformity adequacy and efficiency that are necessary and sufficient for the full explanation of surface irrigation canone et al 2015 the multi objective problem of the edosim model was formulated as the utility function method keeney 1982 in this method the utility or total objective function was obtained from the linear combination of all the objectives because of the uni dimensional objectives the decomposition method of weighted sum zhang and li 2007 with single objective algorithms was used the ideal values for each application efficiency ea irrigation efficiency ei requirement efficiency er distribution uniformity du and distribution efficiency de were one and the ideal values for each tail water ratio twr and deep percolation ratio dpr were zero in the edosim model the minimum hydraulic objective function z including the above performance indicators was formulated in such a way that there would be a global optimum of zero in theory 10 z 1 ea 100 1 ei 100 1 er 100 1 du 100 1 de 100 twr 100 dpr 100 1 Î² violation where the term 1 Î² violation is the penalty term that acts in optimization where the outrage from the constraints takes place violation is the value of penalty tables s1 and s2 given that the objective function can be between zeros and seven the value of Î² coefficient of penalty was assumed to be equal to 100 which showed a high penalty 2 3 2 decision variables decision variables such as discharge are those that have a direct impact on the objective function and can be adjusted parameters such as the manning roughness coefficient can not be changed decision variables and parameters which were selected from the inputs of design or evaluation of basin border and furrow and constraints are presented for the optimization of design and evaluation table 1 the optimization of design and evaluation of furrow due to the ability to change the cross section can have more potential for optimization in comparison with the design and evaluation of basin and border width except furrow and cut off time in the optimization of evaluation are decision variables but in optimization of design they are not decision variables because they will be determined in the design process slope in the optimization of evaluation of basin is also as decision variable but in the optimization of design of basin it is known as zero and can not be taken a decision variable decision variables of zreq and lf determine the optimal level of irrigation and leaching respectively 2 3 3 selection of the optimization algorithm there is no exact algorithm for solving the objective function of the edosim model by considering one decision variable valipour and montazar 2012b due to more than one decision variable in the edosim model the use of heuristic or meta heuristic algorithms was inevitable as there is no mechanism for the escape from the local optima in heuristic algorithms meta heuristic algorithms were used in the edosim model among hundreds of meta heuristic algorithms twenty famous and more applicable algorithms were used blum and roli 2003 engelbrecht 2007 yang 2010a b table s3 to apply each of the twenty optimization algorithms five steps were followed 1 problem definition including the definition of the objective function range and the number of decision variables 2 the optimization algorithm parameters 3 initialization such as initial population and basic settings and the memory required to be filled by the algorithm 4 the generation and evaluation of the solutions by the main loop of the algorithm and 5 the display of the results in the genetic algorithm of the edosim model three methods of roulette wheel selection tournament selection and random selection holland 1975 have been implemented in the edosim model the usability of constriction coefficient rule in pso eberhart and shi 2000 has been created 2 3 4 algorithm parameters in the edosim model the parameters are set based on the selected algorithm for all algorithms the specific number of iterations maxit was considered as the stopping criterion to set the parameters of algorithms the taguchi method using minitab software mathews 2005 was used this method is one of the fractional factorial methods of design of experiments doe by requiring fewer tests and less processing time than the full factorial method it also enjoys generality and simplicity montgomery 2008 for each of the experimental fields optimizations were made based on the constant values of the maximum and minimum limits of decision variables considering three levels for each of the parameters of each algorithm based on the taguchi method the 2 parameter algorithm of tlbo the 4 parameters algorithm of sa with 9 runs and the remaining algorithms that had at least 5 parameters with 27 runs were set determination of the candidate values of the parameter levels is possible by trial and error personal experience and referring to the previous studies in this study the mechanism of algorithms was also considered for example in the harmony search algorithm the performance of the pitch adjustment rate par is similar to the mutation percentage pm in the genetic algorithm therefore levels of par were determined in a way similar to that of the mutation percentage 2 4 simulation optimization process in the edosim model five steps were followed to solve the objective function of the edosim model with meta heuristic algorithms fig 2 1 creating a mechanism to define save and retrieve the model 2 defining a mechanism for creating random solutions including naive decision variables coding 3 creating a mechanism to change naive decision variables to main decision variables of problem parsing 4 calculating the objective function value and satisfiying the constraints and 5 connecting the objective function to the optimization algorithm in the section related to the production of the feasible solution the preserving strategies which is a method for the optimization constraint handling was used talbi 2009 for example for the decision variable of length it can be written as l lmin lhat lmax lmin given that lhat is always between zero and one lmin l lmax therefore the constraint of length could be satisfied automatically among the parameters more changes could be observed for the values of advance time to the end and to the one half of the field length tl and t0 5l due to the changes in the field size and the flow rate therefore for the evaluation of all irrigation methods of basin border and furrow based on the assumption that the coefficient and exponent of the power advance equation r and p are constant as compared to the initial evaluation after the production of the feasible solution for the length we can write t 0 5 l h 2 h 2 0 5 l p 1 r t l l p 1 r where 0 5l l 2 2 5 implementation of the edosim model for programming a combination of the functional and graphical style in matlab programming software was used and a graphical user interface gui mathworks 2015c was designed in the edosim model to reduce the run time it was attempted to use vectorized programming techniques getreuer 2006 as much as possible also the pre allocation technique getreuer 2006 was used to cover the fault of the interpreter matlab programming language as it took more time to run 2 6 validation of the edosim model 2 6 1 validation of simulation for the validation of simulation fifteen experimental field data were used table s4 shows an overview of these field data including the design and evaluation of basin border and furrow irrigation more details are given in tables s5 s7 the objective function values of the edosim model zei without considering the penalty term were compared with the calculated objective function values for the hydrodynamic model zhi of the sirmod software walker 2003 as a base method the statistical indicators of the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse coefficient of residual mass crm and normalized rmse nrmse were used for this purpose pulvento et al 2013 dokoohaki et al 2016 n 15 positive and negative values of crm indicator indicated the underestimation and overestimation of the model as compared to the observation value respectively pulvento et al 2013 11 r m s e i 1 n z h i z e i 2 n 12 c r m i 1 n z h i i 1 n z e i i 1 n z h i 13 nrmse 100 rmse zh the observed and predicted advance data for the edosim model were also compared using the same four statistical indicators for the fields 12 15 which had advance and recession data 2 6 2 validation of optimization after the initial simulation of the fifteen experimental fields optimization of the fields was carried out using each of the twenty algorithms with the adjusted parameters for all the algorithms the same minimum and maximum of decision variables were used the validation of optimization was then applied by following two steps 1 comparison of the algorithms with each other and 2 comparison of the theoretical optimum with matlab software 1 criterion for the comparison of the algorithms with each other and determination of the rank was the lower weighted sums of the dimensionless criteria the run time the objective function and the number of function evaluation nfe orouji et al 2013 each of the criteria in each algorithm was dimensionless in comparison to the maximum values of the same criteria in all algorithms 2 the lowest objective function among all of the algorithms was the theoretical optimum the theoretical optimum of the edosim model was compared with the fmincon solver of optimization toolbox mathworks 2015b and seven solvers of globalsearch multistart patternsearch particleswarm ga simulannealbnd and gamultiobj of the global optimization toolbox mathworks 2015a of matlab software the same values for the minimum and maximum of decision variables assumed for the algorithms of the edosim model were used for the eight solvers 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation of simulation statistical indicators showed a close agreement between the observed and predicted advance data for the edosim model in the fields 12 15 which had advance and recession data fig 3 the value of rmse was between 0 5 1 3 min which indicated the low errror of the edosim model in the estimation of the observed advance data the value of r2 was also varied between 0 996 and 1 for the fields 14 and 12 showing a high correlation of the edosim model with the observed advance data the value of crm indicator was varied between 0 02 and 0 027 min revealing the low bias of the predicted advance data by the edosim model as compared to the observed advance data the values of nrmse were lower than ten percent showing the very good simulation of the edosim model dokoohaki et al 2016 the performance indicators and the objective functions of the fifteen experimental fields were determined using the edosim model then the objective function of the edosim model ze was compared with the hydrodynamic model of sirmod software zh table 2 in the comparison of ze and zh for 15 experimental fields the values of rmse r2 crm and nrmse were 0 068 0 988 0 005 and 4 2 respectively the values of rmse r2 crm and nrmse were in a close agreement with the values of zero one zero and zero respectively this showed low error high correlation low bias and a very good simulation for the edosim model respectively pulvento et al 2013 dokoohaki et al 2016 therefore the volume balance method used in the edosim model despite its simplicity as compared to the hydrodynamic model of sirmod software had a good accuracy the objective functions of fifteen experimental fields that resulted from the edosim model varied from 0 52 to 2 53 table 2 according to eq 10 the objective function values could be between zeros to seven therefore the initial hydraulic performance of the field simulations was different the fields with the higher objective function could have a better hydraulic performance lower objective function for design fields fields 1 10 and field no 11 which had no advance and recession data the proposed method was used to estimate the volume of infiltration the comparison of the objective functions ze and zh indicated the good performance of the proposed method 3 2 parameters setting of algorithms for all fifteen experimental fields each of the twenty optimization algorithms had a number of parameters and each parameter had three levels the results showed that each parameter had different optimal levels the level of each parameter having the best results in more fields was considered as the default value in the algorithms parameter setting windows default values for the parameters of the algorithms table s8 provided a low objective function within a reasonable time than the computational time of each algorithm they were a convenient starting point for decreasing the objective function through parameters setting in the ga and pso algorithms of the edosim model the application of roulette wheel selection and constriction coefficients rule presented the lower objective function respectively therefore these options were enabled by default 3 3 the changes in the range of decision variables field no 14 was used as an example to check the effect of the changes in the range of decision variables on the objective function high over irrigation occurred in this field and more than two thirds of the water was lost through deep percolation and runoff table 2 for the elimination of the optimization algorithm role and its parameters one of the algorithms of the edosim model with tuned parameters was used therefore the results were only related to the range of decision variables due to over irrigation in the initial evaluation some ranges for the decrease of discharge were considered table 3 the results showed the decrease of the objective function for each range table 3 comparison of the objective functions before table 2 and after table 3 optimization indicated the role of optimization in the improvement and the effect of discharge as a decision variable in surface irrigation 3 4 theoretical optimum 3 4 1 theoretical optimum of design in the optimization of design which was based on full irrigation decision variables of zreq and lf were not considered and they were the basic values for the optimization of design of basin fields 1 3 border fields 4 6 and furrow fields 7 10 respectively two three and eight other decision variables were considered table 4 due to the large number of the experimental fields in table s9 the results of the theoretical optimums of design for some of the experimental fields are presented the theoretical optimum for three fields of basin design and the obtained optimum length in the minimum allowed range are presented in table 4 optimization of the basin design reached the objective function value to a good level showing the potential of this method for example the comparison of the objective function of 1 56 table 2 and 0 33 table 4 for the field no 3 in the edosim model the cost of labor and relocation is not considered therefore the existence of 114 basins nb and 17 5 h of irrigation time cut off time of 9 2 min multiplied by the number of basins in the field no 1 table s9 could cause problems some of these problems could be solved by increasing the minimum length of basin with increasing the minimum length the optimum discharge was increased the width of basins was decreased and the number of basins along width was increased but the total number of basins was decreased this situation did not have much impact on the total irrigation time of the basins however because the objective function was increased the previous optimum plan was satisfied the width of field no 2 was 360 m table s5 and the optimal basins width was 63 m table s9 therefore 5 basins along the width were formed where 45 m of field width was lost the edosim model in addition to simulation optimization has the ability to simulate fig 1 therefore for no loss of width in the field no 2 with simulation after simulation optimization the width of basins could be 60 m such that 6 basins along the width could be formed this could not be scientific because the objective function was increased but it would be practical then the recent plan was assessed in the simulation design of basin of the edosim model by considering the value of 90 m for length and 0 25 m3 min m for discharge the same field was simulated and the objective function became 0 4 the results of theoretical optimum for three fields of border design showed that the optimum length occurred in the maximum allowed range table 4 for the field no 6 because the optimal length and discharge before table s5 and after table 4 optimization were similar only the slope was determinator table 4 in the optimization of the border design the advance time 145 9 and 1088 2 min for the field no 4 and 5 was greater than the cut off time 84 3 and 563 8 min for the fields no 4 and 5 table s9 which was compatible with the results of walker and skogerboe 1987 in the edosim model if there is no feasible solution an error message will be displayed for example in the field no 4 if the maximum and minimum discharge were equal to the value of 0 01 m3 min m by not considering other decision variables error message would be displayed because optimization of the border design was based on full irrigation 0 01 m3 min m was lower than the minimum discharge of 0 032 m3 min m table s9 in the field no 4 if the limit values of decision variables were similar to the values of table 4 and only the minimum slope were equal to 0 00001 the objective function would be 0 07 which could be very close to zero but in this situation from 360 m the length of the field a border with the length of 337 m was formed and 23 m of the field could not be in the optimal layout the optimal design of this field with the optimal slope of 0 0001 had the objective function value of 0 25 table 4 which was more worse than 0 07 however the optimal length of 360 m could be achieved which eliminated the resistance of farmers to losing the field field no 5 for the border design had the high bad objective function of 2 41 table 2 basin irrigation design was recommended for it by walker and skogerboe 1987 the optimal design of the basin for the field no 5 was performed in the field no 2 tables 4 and s9 in the optimization of this field the decision variable of slope which is the main difference between the border and basin had a high effect regardless of the leveling cost which was not considered in the edosim model by reducing the slope to 0 0000007 one border with the length of 360 m and the width of 227 m could be formed in the design of border this field had four borders and each border had the cut off time of 1000 min walker and skogerboe 1987 therefore irrigation time was 70 h which was not common after optimization the irrigation time became lower than 10 h 563 8 min with the objective function of 0 09 tables table 44 and s9 the only negative point of this optimized design was the loss of 133 m of the field width due to the availability of irrigation water the rest of the field could be considered for another optimal design the results of the theoretical optimum for four fields of furrow design showed that the optimum length occurred in the minimum allowed range table 4 given that in the design of furrow the number of decision variables was 10 and in the design of basin and border it was 4 and 5 the optimized layout could be obtained with the same or very little difference in the objective function for different combinations of decision variables these different combinations are often for the decision variables of the cross sectional area and slope it seems that in addition to the greater number of decision variables some of the reasons are the little range of change for the decision variables of cross sectional area and slope the multimodal objective function along these variables and probably the low sensitivity of algorithms to these variables however evaluating the trend of the objective function along these variables and performing sensitivity analysis could provide a more clear answer to this issue this issue was the case in all four fields the best optimization algorithm of the field no 9 offered four sets along the length and three sets along the width table s9 cut off time was 478 min and irrigation time was 96 h due to the large irrigation time it was important to evaluate the irrigation module system discharge was 6 m3 min 100 lps and the field area was about 26 ha table s6 therefore the irrigation module was approximately 4 l s ha based on the common irrigation modulus for surface irrigation about 2 l s ha with the continuous available water it could satisfy the requirements for the 16 h irrigation in a day the irrigation of the field could take 6 days and in each day two sets would be irrigated 3 4 2 theoretical optimum of evaluation because the optimization of evaluation is for one basin border or furrow contrary to the optimization of design there are no length and width of field and system discharge therefore the decision variables of length width and somewhat discharge could not be maneuvered in the optimization of design the degree of freedom for these variables is more but in the optimization of evaluation the field is available and a redesign is required therefore the decision variables of length and width or furrow spacing and tmax tmid base ymax were considered equal to the values of them in the initial evaluation and these variables were not considered to minimize the farmer s resistance to the change in the existing conditions if in the initial evaluation over irrigation occurred the decision variables of zreq and lf were not considered but in under irrigation the decision variable of zreq by 10 percent deficit irrigation was considered totally for the optimization of evaluation four decision variables were considered table 5 in table s10 the results related to the theoretical optimums of evaluation for some of the experimental fields are presented due to the over irrigation in the initial simulation of the field no 11 table 2 by optimizing this field slope was increased and the discharge and cut off time were reduced table 5 the objective function was changed from 1 75 for the evaluation of basin table 2 to the value of 0 095 for the optimization of evaluation of basin table 5 because of the requirement efficiency of lower than 100 percent in the field no 12 table 2 zreq decision variable was decreased to 0 18 m table 5 in addition by applying the high discharge per unit width and the low cut off time the objective function value reached to 0 1 table 5 in the optimization of border evaluation similar to the optimization of border design the cut off time 50 min in the field no 12 was lower than advance time 61 min in the field no 12 tables 5 and s10 in the optimization of border evaluation advance time 61 min in the field no 12 should be lower than recession time 98 3 min in the field no 12 tables s2 and s10 field no 14 which was relevant to evaluation of furrow in the initial simulation had the high unpleasantness objective function of 2 53 table 2 by considering the discharge as a decision variable this field reached to the objective function of 0 12 table 3 in the optimization of evaluation the cut off time is among the decision variables table 1 a suitable combination of discharge and cut off time as decision variables based on the condition of the possibility of implementation could provide excellent results it may be necessary to eliminate the consideration of other decision variables for example by applying the decision variable of cut off time in addition to discharge the objective function was reduced to 0 095 table 5 only with appropriate management practices combination of discharge and cut off time the water losses could be avoided and water would be received the same as what is required it was tried to the irrigation volume which is the product of discharge and cut off time not to be much different from the initial simulation field no 15 had under irrigation and large tail water runoff losses table 2 applying high discharge and low cut off time could overcome this problem table 5 this field had heavy textured soil with a large value of 0 224 m for the soil moisture deficit table s7 the high soil depth of 120 cm also caused this large soil moisture deficit abbasi et al 1999 in each surface irrigation event about 100 mm of water is applied tables s5 s7 therefore one half of the soil moisture deficits could be supplied and instead the 60 cm could be considered as soil depth by cultivating a plant with the effective root depth of 60 cm and considering the decision variables of discharge cut off time and soil moisture deficit performance indicators became close to the ideal ones table s10 3 5 validation of optimization 3 5 1 comparison of the algorithms with each other the twenty algorithms in addition to the rank can be assessed based on run time objective functions and nfe due to the large number of experimental fields and applied algorithms the comparison of the algorithms with each other for only three fields is provided table 6 the results of other fields had a similar trend in terms of the criterion of run time sce pso and ica algorithms table s3 were the best ones respectively table 6 also the run time of hybrid algorithms was much lower than the series run of each of basic algorithms given the similarity of the five steps in terms of solving the optimization problems with meta heuristic algorithms the reasons for differences in the run time of algorithms must be searched in the five steps to implement each of the twenty algorithms problem definition the optimization algorithm parameters initialization the main loop and display results in these five steps step 1 problem definition and step 5 display results were the same for all algorithms step 2 the optimization algorithm parameters did not play a role in the run time therefore only step 3 initialization and step 4 the main loop which contained the mastermind and paradigm of the algorithm could make the difference in run time the interpreter matlab programming language caused a slight slowdown but since all algorithms of the edosim model were written by matlab language the runtime of algorithms did not depend on programming language the most important reason for the difference in run time in addition to the number of lines and the inherent complexity of implementing algorithms was the use of repeat loops and conditional constructs in the case of no possibility to use vectorized programming techniques this problem was intensified when the nested repeat loops and conditional constructs were implemented in the algorithm for example in the implementation of the fa algorithm which had the most run time the nested repeat loops and conditional constructs had been used which attempt to review all the cases in terms of the objective function criterion the results of abc acor ba bbo ica mba pso psoga sce and tlbo algorithms could be trusted table 6 by increasing the number of decision variables and having the optimal of these variables between the upper and lower allowed limit algorithms could find more differences the reason lies in the objective function value of algorithms in the experimental field no 3 design of basin with five decision variables and the experimental field no 8 design of furrow with 10 decision variables in the experimental field no 3 fifteen algorithms and in the experimental field no 8 only six algorithms achieved the best results table 6 in terms of the nfe criterion the sce algorithm and after that the pso and ica algorithms had the lowest nfe table 6 the run time and nfe were in a direct proportion obviously hybrid algorithms as compared to the basic ones had more nfe by the comparison of the objective function and nfe values the important point is the intelligence of algorithms and having a strong reason to find the optimum not utilize the power of computers and the random search therefore the lower nfe could obtain the lower objective function for example the sce algorithm while having the lowest nfe was one of the best algorithms in finding the lower objective function finally by checking the rank of algorithms sce algorithm was found to be the most compatible algorithm with the surface irrigation problem for the sets of field data used in this study table 6 this algorithm was presented for the rainfall runoff problem duan et al 1993 the pso and ica algorithms were placed in the next category after them sfla ga tlbo hs and bbo algorithms table s3 had a better rank among others table 6 in the next category de iwo acor abc ca gapso and psoga algorithms and after them mba fa ba sa and saga algorithms were placed 3 5 2 comparison of the theoretical optimum with the solvers of matlab software the results related to the theoretical optimum of the edosim model were the best in most cases and in the fields 12 and 14 they were among the best objective functions by a small difference table 7 among the eight built in solvers of matlab software the solver of particleswarm despite its simplicity provided the best results the lowest objective function table 7 the pso algorithm is one of the twenty algorithms of the edosim model in the previous section after sce algorithm it presented the best results therefore the superiority of the particleswarm solver in finding the lowest objective function confirmed the pso algorithm again the two solvers of globalsearch and multistart in all fields offered reasonable results table 7 in some cases they were the best especially in the optimization of design of border irrigation the ga and gamultiobj solvers were placed in the next ranks with little differences table 7 with some trial and error especially in the population size of these solvers the results showed improvement in the best situation they could be matched to the theoretical optimum of edosim model results the basic mode of the simulannealbnd solver like sa algorithm in the edosim was not efficient table 7 according to the guide of the global optimization toolbox mathworks 2015a a very slow logarithmic cooling pattern could improve it the patternsearch solver was placed at the rank of seven out of eight solvers lack of objective function gradient information and reliance only on the objective function could be regarded as the main reason for the weakness of this solver the fmincon solver of optimization toolbox which is a heuristic algorithm without a mechanism for escape from local optima had the worst results table 7 there was no exact algorithm to solve the objective function of the edosim model and the heuristic algorithms were weak therefore the best option was to use meta heuristic algorithms the meta heuristic algorithms with intelectal search structure and perfect parameters setting could have more chance of finding the global optimum the theoretical optimum of the edosim model had the minimum objective function while the optimization toolbox of matlab software had the maximum objective function global optimization toolbox of matlab software was ranked between these two 4 conclusions a simulation optimization surface irrigation model called edosim using volume balance model and meta heuristic algorithms was developed in the present study this model as compared to the previous models introduces the simulation optimization approach with the ability to consider simultaneously seven performance indicators and the decision variables and limitations for each decision variable therefore this model is able to present an optimal strategy to simultaneously reduce deep percolation and runoff and increase efficiency and uniformity the validation of the simulation of the edosim model through comparison with the hydrodynamic model of sirmod software showed the good performance of the edosim model and the proposed method in estimating the volume of infiltration based on fifteen sets of experimental field data optimization of basin irrigation helped the objective function to reach a value at a good level showing the potential of this method optimization of border irrigation also resulted in a cut off time lower than the advance time in the optimization of design of furrow irrigation the optimized layout was obtained with the same or very little difference in the objective function for different combinations of decision variables in the optimization of evaluation of basin border and furrow irrigation the proper combination of discharge and cut off time established a very good result that nearly eliminated the need to consider other decisions variables and also obviated the need to make any considerable changes in field situations to create the optimal conditions the comparison of the algorithms with each other showed that the sce algorithm and after that the pso and ica algorithms were the best ones for all experimental fields optimization with the edosim model caused the decrease improvement of the objective functions in comparison to the initial simulation performance the objective function of the edosim model was lower better than eight solvers of optimization and global optimization toolboxes of matlab software as a result the edosim model which is a specialized tool for surface irrigation despite its simplicity showed a good performance for the simulation and optimization of surface irrigation acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the support from the isfahan university of technology iran for
