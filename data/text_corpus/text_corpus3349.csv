16745,nanosized activated carbon nac is a novel adsorbent with great potential for water reclamation however its transport and reactivity in aqueous environments may be greatly affected by its stability against aggregation this study investigated the colloidal stability of nac in model aqueous systems with broad background solution chemistries including 7 electrolytes nacl nano3 na2so4 kcl cacl2 mgcl2 and bacl2 ph 4 9 and 6 macromolecules humic acid ha fulvic acid fa cellulose cel bovine serum albumin bsa alginate alg and extracellular polymeric substance eps along with natural water samples collected from pristine to polluted rivers the results showed that higher solution ph stabilized nac by raising the critical coagulation concentration from 28 to 590 mm nacl increased cation concentration destabilized nac by charge screening with the cationic influence following ba2 ca2 mg2 na k its aggregation behavior could be predicted with the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory with a hamaker constant a cwc of 4 3 10 20 j the presence of macromolecules stabilized nac in nacl solution and most cacl2 solution following eps bsa cel ha fa alg due largely to enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance originated from adsorbed macromolecules however alg and ha strongly destabilized nac via cation bridging at high ca2 concentrations approximately half of nac particles remained stably suspended for 10 d in neutral freshwater samples the results demonstrated the complex effects of water chemistry on fate and transport of nac in aquatic environments

activated carbon nac is a novel carbonaceous engineered nanomaterial enm possessing unique nano dimension extremely porous structure enormous specific surface area ssa varied surface functionality and highly hydrophobic nature chen and huang 2017 chen et al 2017 nazem et al 2020 the sizes of nac are much smaller than conventional powdered activated carbon pac 10 50 μm mean diameter and granular activated carbon gac and are similar with or smaller than super fine pac spac roughly 0 1 1 μm mean diameter bonvin et al 2016 partlan et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of nac as adsorbents and nanofiltration membranes in water treatment processes chen et al 2017 hosseini et al 2018 besides nac is widely considered in other fields as potential candidates for antimicrobial agents lakshmi et al 2018 catalyst support abdulkareem alsultan et al 2016 and drug carriers sengupta et al 2014 direct use of nac for water treatment or unintentional release of nac during other application activities could introduce such enm into natural and engineered aquatic systems although limited research shows that nac exhibited insignificant cytotoxicity after short term exposure sengupta et al 2014 it may act as strong pollutant carriers during environmental transport vidal et al 2008 therefore understanding the fate and transport of nac in various aqueous environments is crucial for designing its application schemes for water treatment as well as evaluating its potential ecological and health risks upon release of nac nanomaterials into aquatic environments both their transport and reactivity are largely dependent on the aggregation behavior which would alter their size and ssa adsorption capacity environmental toxicity and ultimate fate hewitt et al 2020 the existing literature on fate and transport of carbonaceous enm focuses mainly on fullerene c60 kyzyma et al 2019 carbon nanotubes cnts single walled swcnts and multi walled mwcnts xia et al 2019 and graphene oxide go ali et al 2020 yet much less attention was paid to the novel nac nanomaterial our previous studies have demonstrated the potent advantages including excellent adsorption capacity chen et al 2017 and colloidal stability chen and huang 2017 simultaneously possessed by nac making it suitable for emergent contamination treatment and in situ groundwater remediation it was shown that considering solely the effects of nacl or cacl2 four different model nacs two made from bamboo and trees and others made from coconut shell and bamboo charcoals exhibited strong colloidal stability under freshwater conditions at low salt concentrations while they aggregated under seawater conditions at higher salt concentrations with behaviors predictable by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory from which their hamaker constants were derived chen and huang 2017 however natural aquatic environments contain complex solution chemistries including various electrolytes ph and macromolecules saleh et al 2010 it remains unclear how these environmental factors exert single and combined effects on the aggregation kinetics of nac environmental and biological macromolecules such as natural organic matter nom polysaccharides proteins and extracellular polymeric substance eps having different molecular size structure and functionality are ubiquitously distributed in aqueous environments liu et al 2020 as our previous study showed that nac with large ssa and hydrophobic surface had strong adsorption affinity to organic pollutants chen et al 2017 we hypothesized that macromolecules would also interact with nac and adsorb onto particle surface depending on the solution composition and concentration of electrolytes and macromolecules these environmental factors may promote or inhibit the aggregation process of nac as have been shown to vary among different carbonaceous enms e g cnts liu et al 2016 and fullerene zhang et al 2013 moreover these enms may also exhibit different aggregation behaviors in model and real water samples chowdhury et al 2013 to date previous research only reported the single influence of nacl or cacl2 on aggregation kinetics of nac without macromolecules and only in model aqueous systems chen and huang 2017 therefore complex model solutions and natural water samples should be included to elucidate the aggregation behavior of nac and its interaction mechanism with macromolecules in aqueous environments the objective of this study was to investigate the single and combined effects of solution chemistry including electrolytes ph and macromolecules on the colloidal stability of nac in model and natural aqueous solutions the following environmental scenarios were considered 1 various electrolytes and ph levels 2 different macromolecules in nacl and cacl2 solutions 3 interaction mechanism of nac with macromolecules 4 natural water samples with various solution chemistry and 5 early stage vs long term stability of nac the model solutions contained 7 electrolytes nacl nano3 na2so4 kcl cacl2 mgcl2 or bacl2 at concentrations 0 01 1000 mm typically found in aqueous environments ph 4 9 and 6 macromolecules a hydrophobic and semi rigid humic acid ha and a fulvic acid fa with smaller molecular weight and shorter carbon chain were selected as two model nom ali et al 2020 two polysaccharides included a hydrophilic cellulose cel with linear chain of d glucose units updegraff 1969 and a hydrophilic linear and semi flexible alginate alg chen et al 2019 bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a hydrophobic and globular protein saleh et al 2010 and an eps composed of polysaccharide and protein having random coils with partially extended chains was extracted for study liu et al 2020 freshwater samples from natural rivers possessing different solution chemistries ranging from acidic contaminated to neutral clean conditions were also collected for comparison of nac stability in model and natural water the results demonstrated the complex role of electrolytes ph and macromolecules on the fate and transport of nac in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 nac stock suspension super activated carbon nanoparticles stock us1077 were obtained from us research nanomaterials inc houston usa our previous studies have characterized its aggregation chen and huang 2017 and adsorption chen et al 2017 behaviors with the designation of nac4 its stock suspension was previously prepared via natural sedimentation chen and huang 2017 which was replaced here by centrifugation as described in s1 1 of the supplementary material this method yielded small intensity weighed hydrodynamic diameter d h uniform size distribution i e polydispersity index pdi fig s1a and high particle concentration fig s1b the nac concentration of stock suspension 358 0 9 8 mg l table s1 was measured gravimetrically 2 2 preparation of model and natural aqueous solutions monovalent nacl nano3 na2so4 and kcl and divalent cacl2 mgcl2 and bacl2 salts acs grade were purchased from titan scientific co ltd shanghai china suwannee river ha standard ii and fa standard i were purchased from international humic substances society st paul mn cel bsa and alg with cat no of c5013 a7030 and 1 80 947 respectively were obtained from sigma aldrich shanghai china eps was extracted from culture medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 the total organic carbon toc concentrations mgc l i e milligram toc per liter of macromolecule stock solutions are presented in table 1 six natural water nw samples were collected from dajiagou river and chahe river guizhou china with the sampling map and geographic coordinates shown in fig s2 and table 2 detailed methods for extracting eps and preparing the above model and natural aqueous solutions are described in s1 2 of the supplementary material 2 3 characterization of nac the d h of nac in different solutions was determined with dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 instrument malvern instruments ltd uk triplicate samples were each measured 10 times for electrophoretic mobility that was converted to zeta ζ potential using eq s1 the nac before and after contact with macromolecules and cacl2 were examined for its aggregation state and morphology under transmission electron microscope tem the long term stability of nac in model and natural solutions was measured by light absorbance and visual observation detailed characterization methods are described in s1 3 of the supplementary material 2 4 determination of aggregation kinetics the experimental conditions for measuring the aggregation behaviors of nac in electrolyte solutions macromolecule solutions and nw samples along with their reasons of choice are described in tables s2 s3 and s1 4 of the supplementary material the aggregation kinetics of nac were measured with the zetasizer instrument using time resolved dls technique li et al 2021 as described in s1 5 of the supplementary material the early stage aggregation rate k was determined with eq s2 the attachment efficiency α ranging from 0 no aggregation to 1 fast aggregation was employed to quantify the colloidal stability eq s3 the critical coagulation concentration ccc which represents the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited particle aggregation was determined on the stability profile from the intersection of extrapolated lines through the diffusion and reaction limited regimes chowdhury et al 2013 the experimental α data determined in nacl solution at ph 6 were fitted by the theoretical α values calculated based on the dlvo theory eqs s4 s12 s1 6 of the supplementary material 2 5 macromolecule adsorption by nac the adsorption of macromolecules onto nac was determined by one point batch adsorption experiment following a method modified from previous studies chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 as described in s1 7 of the supplementary material the adsorption experiment was conducted at 600 mg l macromolecules 30 mg l nac 1 mm nacl 25 c and ph 6 higher macromolecule and nac concentrations were used in adsorption experiments to ensure the measurement accuracy and precision 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ph and electrolyte the d h of nac measured at 1 mm nacl continuously decreased as ph increased from 2 to 4 which corresponded to the enhanced negative charge of nac yielding a point of zero charge near ph 2 fig s3 the colloidal stability of nac as a function of ph was quantified in nacl solutions fig 1 a all stability curves display two aggregation regimes predictable by the dlvo theory chen and huang 2017 reaction limited aggregation regime α 1 at electrolyte concentrations below ccc and the diffusion limited regime α 1 at electrolyte concentrations above ccc the stability curves continuously shifted rightwards at higher ph in nacl solution indicating enhanced colloidal stability of nac the ccc values increased by 21 times from 28 to 590 mm nacl as ph changed from 4 to 9 this phenomenon occurred due to the deprotonation of acidic functional groups on nac at higher ph that inhibited aggregation lászló et al 2004 2007 the results demonstrated the strong impact of ph on stability of nac especially under acidic conditions the ζ potential of nac as a function of electrolyte concentration was determined at ph 6 for different monovalent and divalent electrolytes fig 1b the two groups of electrolytes clearly showed separate regimes of ζ potentials with each group displaying overlapped trends that all increased with electrolyte concentration the cationic valence exhibited strong charge screening effect on nac rather than the type of ions given the same valence the change in ζ potential with electrolyte concentration was attributed to compressed electrical double layer yang et al 2017 divalent electrolytes exerted stronger screening effect due to their higher charge density in the diffuse layer and possibly their specific adsorption on nac surface as compared with monovalent electrolytes saleh et al 2008 for instance the ζ potentials were 43 9 and 3 1 mv at 10 mm nano3 and bacl2 respectively specifically na2so4 exhibited a trend slightly above other 1 1 electrolyte since it contains two na the ionic strength is was one of the determining parameters as seen in the debye hückel parameter eq s11 under seawater concentrations the negative charge was almost completely screened by all cations the stability curves of nac in different electrolyte solutions at ph 6 all exhibited two distinct aggregation regimes fig 1c the ccc values for divalent electrolytes were much lower than those for monovalent electrolytes indicating that divalent electrolytes were more effective in inducing nac aggregation which corresponded to the ζ potential results in fig 1b this result is consistent with other enms including c60 chen and elimelech 2007 swcnts saleh et al 2010 and mwcnts yang et al 2017 the ccc values were close among nacl 74 mm nano3 77 mm and kcl 86 mm which were approximately twice as that for na2so4 37 mm equivalent to 74 mm na counter ions the ccc values for 3 divalent electrolytes were 3 mm providing a ratio of ccc values in cacl2 and nacl proportional to 2 4 6 which followed the schulze hardy rule ranging from 2 2 to 2 6 tang et al 2017 the results again suggest that the influence of electrolytes on stability of nac mainly arises from cationic valence overall the potential for inducing nac aggregation by cations followed the order of ba2 ca2 mg2 na k noting that charge screening and even reversal occurred at high ca2 and ba2 concentrations fig 1b this was likely attributed to the specific binding of ca2 and ba2 to nac that led to significant destabilization as previously observed for black carbon xu et al 2017 furthermore this order of inducing nac aggregation was inversely correlated to the hydration force of divalent cations mg2 ca2 ba2 which would reduce their interaction with nanoparticles wang et al 2017 fig 1d shows that the theoretical simulation based on the dlvo theory eqs s4 s12 generally fitted through the experimental stability data in nacl solution this fitting process derived the hamaker constants of nac in water a cwc and vacuum a cc of 4 3 10 20 and 16 10 20 j respectively these values are greater than those previously reported for nac prepared via natural sedimentation chen and huang 2017 as compared in table s4 the aggregation behavior of nac only induced slight influence on its ssa which gradually decreased from 610 m2 g in milli q water to 604 and 601 m2 g in 2 and 25 mm cacl2 solutions respectively table s5 in summary fig s4 illustrates the combined effects of solution ph and electrolyte concentration showing that the aggregation rate of nac enhanced with increasing electrolyte concentration and decreasing ph 3 2 stability in electrolyte solution at fixed macromolecule concentration 3 2 1 nacl solutions the ζ potentials of nac in the absence or presence of 10 mgc l milligram toc per liter macromolecules were determined at varying concentrations of nacl fig 2 a despite the presence of macromolecules the ζ potentials all became less negative as electrolyte concentrations increased among 6 macromolecules bsa was the most effective in reducing the negative ζ potential of nac in nacl solution fig 2a meanwhile bsa also exhibited the strongest adsorption qe 76 1 2 3 mgc g milligram toc per gram table 1 onto nac which had hydrophobic surface and large ssa table s5 with an isoelectric point of 4 7 bsa was negatively charged at ph 6 kopac et al 2018 and so was the nac surface fig 2a to prevent the buildup of electrostatic potential co adsorption of solution cations e g na and ca2 into the interfacial film between the shear plane and particle surface occurred resulting in reduction of ζ potential the strong adsorption of bsa and development of protein corona on nanoparticles was also observed for mwcnts kopac et al 2018 soot chen et al 2019 and plastic liu et al 2020 our previous study determined that the eps sample was constituted mainly of 50 proteins followed by 25 polysaccharides and 13 uronic acids with c h o and n contents accounting for 39 6 5 7 32 5 and 10 8 respectively liu et al 2020 therefore alike bsa eps also reduced the negative charge of nac in nacl solution fig 2a compared with the spherical and compact protein structure of bsa eps existing as random coils with incompletely extending chains was less effective in charge reduction wang et al 2012 the presence of 10 mgc l fa caused minimal change 12 on ζ potential at all nacl concentrations contrarily other macromolecules ha cel and alg showed overlapped trends that slightly enhanced the negative ζ potential in nacl solution it has been reported that the presence of ha also enhanced the negative charge of mwcnts liu et al 2016 but reduced that of c60 chae et al 2012 the attachment efficiencies of nac in nacl solution with or without 10 mgc l macromolecules are presented in fig 2c the results show that all stability curves were lowered by macromolecules leading to failure of nac to display any diffusion limited aggregation behavior α 1 over the tested nacl concentrations the α values were reduced by up to 100 times under such conditions therefore all macromolecules stabilized nac in nacl solution with such stabilization effect following the order of eps bsa cel ha fa alg as mentioned above eps and bsa showing the most obvious reduction of surface charge and strongest adsorption on nac also stabilized it most effectively in nacl solution suppressing any observable aggregation with α between 0 02 0 11 the stabilization effect of cel was slightly weaker than bsa initially then enhanced to an extent identical with eps as nacl concentration increased to above 200 mm such aggregation behavior of nac was unlike mwcnts which still exhibited diffusion limited aggregation regime in nacl solution with the present of cel that raised ccc from 25 to 210 mm nacl liu et al 2016 the presence of ha effectively suppressed aggregation of nac similar to c60 chen and elimelech 2007 zhang et al 2013 and swcnts saleh et al 2010 in nacl solution by lowering α to an order of magnitude however fa showed stronger stabilization effect on nac than c60 zhang et al 2013 and soot chen et al 2019 as α continuously increased from 0 19 to 0 58 yet never reached unity as nacl concentration rising from 60 to 600 mm although alg enhanced the negative charge of nac in nacl solution fig 2a it exhibited the weakest stabilization effect among all macromolecules α 0 80 at 600 mm nacl shifting the stability curve downwards while maintaining a shape most alike the curve measured without macromolecule fig 2c 3 2 2 cacl2 solutions fig 2b shows that the macromolecular influence on ζ potential of nac was more prominent at lower cacl2 concentrations which was likely attributed to the sensitivity of particle negative charge to high ca2 concentration that diminished the macromolecular effects over the tested cacl2 concentrations bsa still exhibited the most significant reduction of negative charge on nac among all macromolecules however bsa only reduced the negative charge at 0 01 3 mm cacl2 while enhanced it at 6 20 mm cacl2 this concentration dependent effect of bsa in cacl2 solution was different from that observed in nacl solution fig 2a and in other studies which reported monotonic charge screening effect on particles over a wide range of cacl2 concentrations e g 0 5 30 mm chen et al 2019 liu et al 2018 similar to the results obtained in nacl solution cel and alg enhanced the negative charge of nac especially at low electrolyte concentrations notably the most negative ζ potential was attained at 0 01 mm cacl2 in the presence of 10 mgc l alg which enhanced it from 26 0 to 56 8 mv the ζ potentials of nac in the presence of other macromolecules ha fa and eps showed overlapped trends which were reduced at 0 4 3 mm cacl2 while enhanced at other concentrations the attachment efficiencies of nac with or without 10 mgc l macromolecules were determined at various cacl2 concentrations fig 2d unlike the stabilization results in nacl solution nac was significantly destabilized by 10 mgc l alg and ha at cacl2 concentrations above 5 and 10 mm respectively the α values exceeded 1 under these conditions and reached up to 6 5 and 2 6 in the presence of 10 mgc l alg and ha respectively at 40 mm cacl2 indicating non dlvo interactions the stronger destabilization effect of alg than ha was confirmed by visual observation which shows that nac formed apparent flocs at high cacl2 concentrations 10 20 and 40 mm in the presence of alg fig s5e but not ha fig s5a however their destabilization effect on nac reversed to stabilization below 5 mm cacl2 for instance the aggregation rate of nac was reduced by up to 22 times in the presence of ha at 3 mm cacl2 the complex effects of alg depending on cacl2 concentration have been reported for c60 saleh et al 2010 soot chen et al 2019 and graphene su et al 2018 similar results were also reported for ha on stability of c60 chen and elimelech 2007 and biochar yang et al 2019 different from alg and ha other 4 macromolecules mainly stabilized nac in cacl2 solution following the order of bsa cel eps fa fig 2d the presence of 10 mgc l fa only stabilized nac at cacl2 concentration below 10 mm similarly eps also stabilized nac most effectively at cacl2 concentrations near the ccc 3 1 mm while such effect weakened at higher cacl2 concentration and disappeared at 40 mm cacl2 this stabilization effect of eps depending on cacl2 concentration was different from its strong stabilization effect in nacl solution that was independent of electrolyte concentration fig 2c however cel and bsa still exhibited the strongest stabilization effect in cacl2 solution as similarly in nacl solution suppressing nac aggregation α 0 07 at all electrolyte concentrations it has been observed differently for mwcnts that showed both reaction and diffusion limited aggregation regimes in cacl2 solution when cel was present raising ccc from 0 9 to 2 7 mm liu et al 2016 except for alg other 5 macromolecules did not induce any apparent flocculation that could be visually observed in suspensions containing nac and cacl2 fig s5 3 3 stability in macromolecule solution at fixed electrolyte concentration the attachment efficiency as a function of macromolecule concentration was further determined at two fixed electrolyte concentrations near ccc and seawater levels fig 3 under all tested conditions macromolecules stabilized nac and such effect generally enhanced with increasing macromolecule concentration fig 3a c except for ha and alg present at 10 mm cacl2 that destabilized nac fig 3d at 60 mm nacl fig 3a cel and bsa displayed strong stabilization effect that was generally unaffected by macromolecule concentrations however ha and eps showed weaker stabilization effect that gradually enhanced with their concentrations at 10 mgc l cel bsa and eps effectively stabilized nac to similar extents negligible influence was observed for alg at any concentration the α values for 10 mgc l ha 1 10 mgc l cel and bsa and 2 5 10 mgc l eps were below 0 1 which generally correlates to negligible particle aggregation chen and huang 2017 at 600 mm nacl fig 3b no aggregation was observed at any concentrations of cel or bsa as well as 10 mgc l of eps or ha at both tested nacl concentrations the stabilization effects of ha and eps significantly enhanced with increasing macromolecule concentration for instance α decreased by an order of magnitude as eps concentration increased from 5 to 10 mgc l indicating that fast aggregation was completely inhibited the enhanced stabilization effect due to increased macromolecule concentration was also reported for other enm such as mwcnts yang et al 2017 biochar yang et al 2019 and go ali et al 2020 by contrast cel bsa and alg showed effects independent of macromolecule concentration and their results represented two extreme cases cel and bsa stabilized nac even under low macromolecule concentrations whereas alg exhibited negligible effect at high macromolecule concentrations among these 4 electrolyte concentrations the stabilization effect of macromolecules was the most obvious at 3 mm cacl2 fig 3c except for alg other 5 macromolecules strongly stabilized nac to similar extents and their stabilization effects enhanced with macromolecule concentration these results were consistent with those presented in fig 2d at 3 mm cacl2 further showing that these 5 macromolecules effectively stabilized nac even at 1 mgc l in comparison the stabilization effect of alg only became obvious at 10 mgc l more complex results were found at 10 mm cacl2 where stabilization or destabilization effects occurred depending on the type and concentration of macromolecules fig 3d at this cacl2 concentration cel and bsa still strongly stabilized nac as observed above at other 3 electrolyte concentrations although eps stabilized nac at 1 10 mgc l its effect slightly weakened with increasing macromolecule concentration this was also observed when fa and ha increased from 5 to 10 and 1 to 5 mgc l respectively it was noted that 10 mgc l ha and 1 10 mgc l alg destabilized nac in 10 mm cacl2 solution fig 3d the results indicate that ha may stabilize nac at low ha concentration e g 1 5 mgc l under seawater cacl2 conditions while destabilize nac at high ha concentration e g 10 mgc l similar result was previously reported that ha stabilized biochar at 0 5 2 5 mgc l but promoted its aggregation at 5 mgc l yang et al 2019 different from ha alg significantly destabilized nac at all macromolecule concentrations under seawater cacl2 condition with the effect enhancing with both the concentrations of alg fig 3d and cacl2 fig 2d 3 4 interaction mechanisms between nac and macromolecules 3 4 1 stabilization mechanisms enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance were two major stabilization mechanisms responsible for inhibiting nac aggregation by macromolecules however the contribution of these stabilization mechanisms was dependent upon the type and concentration of both macromolecules and electrolytes the proposed stabilization mechanisms are illustrated in fig 4 e at most nacl and cacl2 concentrations cel effectively enhanced the negative charge of nac and inhibited aggregation fig 2 displaying stronger stabilization effect at higher cel concentration fig 3 dispersed nac from 10 mm cacl2 solution could be observed under tem fig s6i the strong negative charge of cel resulted in the lowest adsorption qe 18 8 3 6 mgc g table 1 onto nac among all macromolecules due to electrical repulsion liu et al 2016 therefore enhanced electrical repulsion of nac by cel was mainly responsible for its stabilization similarly ha and fa also enhanced the negative ζ potential of nac fig 2a b contributing to their stabilization these two humic substances were recognized to contain high concentrations of negatively charged e g carboxylic and phenolic functional groups zhang et al 2013 which would deprotonate to enhance the charge of nac however electrostatic interaction was not likely the sole stabilization mechanism since the charge did not change apparently especially by fa in nacl solution fig 2a table 1 shows that the adsorption affinity of macromolecules followed the order of bsa fa alg eps ha cel the semi rigid ha and fa macromolecules adsorbed onto the hydrophobic nac surface provided steric hindrance fig 4e preventing nac aggregation as have been similarly reported for swcnts saleh et al 2010 mwcnts saleh et al 2008 c60 zhang et al 2013 and soot chen et al 2019 dispersed nac with surface coating were observed under tem for solutions containing fa and cacl2 fig s6g h the stronger stabilization effect of ha than fa in most solutions was likely attributed to the higher molecular weight longer carbon chain and more compact structure of ha ali et al 2020 therefore enhanced electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were two major stabilization mechanisms for ha and fa steric hindrance highly depends on macromolecule structure and its adsorption affinity onto nac the adsorption experiment revealed that bsa exhibited the strongest adsorption by nac among 6 macromolecules table 1 as mentioned earlier bsa could be spontaneously adsorbed onto nac surface fig 2a b the hydrophobic interactions between bsa and nac surface also promoted adsorption bergaoui et al 2017 furthermore bsa adsorbed onto nac surface underwent structural rearrangements to gain higher conformational entropy in the protein molecule resulting in a more compact globular architecture of bsa liu et al 2020 the globular protein layer of bsa attached on nac induced longer range steric hindrance force than other relatively more linear macromolecules such as ha and alg chen et al 2019 liu et al 2018 therefore bsa stabilized nac most effectively among all macromolecules via steric hindrance the extracted eps sample consisted of 50 protein and 25 polysaccharide and usually exists as random coils with partly extending chains under neural conditions wang et al 2012 therefore eps also induced charge reduction fig 2a and strong stabilization figs 2a and 3a of nac to a similar extent with bsa in nacl solution via steric hindrance however the stabilization effect of eps gradually disappeared as cacl2 concentration increased fig 2d which may be related to the polysaccharide content that concurrently destabilized nac as discussed later although alg provided the strongest charge enhancement fig 2a b of nac and exhibited strong adsorption table 1 its stabilization effect was mostly negligible figs 2c d and 3a c this was likely attributed to its destabilization effect as discussed below that counterbalanced or overcame stabilization 3 4 2 destabilization mechanism fig 4a presents the aggregation profiles of nac in cacl2 solutions with or without 10 mgc l alg or ha the aggregation rate of nac increased with cacl2 concentration from 1 to 3 mm while remained unchanged when further increased to 100 mm this aligns with the dlvo behavior since ccc was determined as 3 1 mm cacl2 fig 1c above which α stays at 1 eq s3 under diffusion limited condition where attraction dominates over repulsion however the aggregation rate was prominently elevated by 10 mgc l alg or ha at 20 mm cacl2 fig 4a yielding slopes of aggregation profiles clearly above those obtained in fast aggregation regime α 1 this contradicts with the enhanced negative ζ potential of nac under such conditions fig 2b indicating that electrical double layer compression was not likely the destabilization mechanism instead non dlvo interactions were responsible for destabilizing nac with alg showing a stronger effect than ha by raising d h up to 1800 in 20 min the major destabilization mechanism was identified as cation bridging of alg or ha with ca2 at high concentrations as depicted in fig 4e the tem images fig 4b and s6l n show that alg bridging with ca2 resulted in formation of alginate gel that enmeshed nac and significantly promoted aggregation it is recognized that ca2 can complex with the carboxylic groups in the guluronic acid blocks of alg in a planar two dimensional manner cerciello et al 2017 generating cross linked gels that destabilized graphene su et al 2018 and soot chen et al 2019 at cacl2 concentrations above 3 mm near ccc the destabilization effect enhanced with concentrations of both cacl2 fig 2d and alg fig 3d this was likely due to the presence of more available ca2 in solution and binding sites on alg to form large settling flocs in suspensions that could be visually observed fig s5e the cation bridging of ha in cacl2 solution that destabilized nac occurred by simultaneous coordination of ca2 with two carboxylic groups on ha to form ha ca2 complex li et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the interaction between ha ca2 complexes via hydrogen bonds generated larger molecular layer which formed ionic bridges with the negatively charged surface sites of nac and resulted in destabilization fig 4c and s6c f zhao et al 2019 the role of ha on nac in cacl2 solution was governed by the interplay between destabilization and stabilization effects fig 4e below 10 mm cacl2 ha stabilized nac at all tested macromolecule concentrations by enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance figs 2b d and 3c at 10 mm cacl2 and ha concentrations below 10 mgc l most ha were adsorbed on nac so that the stabilization effect dominated over or counterbalanced destabilization fig 3d at 10 mm cacl2 and 10 mgc l ha free ha present in solution could bind with ca2 to form network clusters yu et al 2019 leading to an overall destabilization effect it was noted that the stabilization effect of eps gradually diminished at higher cacl2 concentrations and even reversed to slight destabilization at 40 mm cacl2 fig 2d this indicates that the 25 polysaccharide content on eps may be similar with alg that destabilized nac via cation bridging with ca2 present at high concentration which competed with the stabilization effect of eps liu et al 2020 3 5 colloidal stability in nw samples 3 5 1 early stage stability the colloidal stability of nac was further studied in 6 nw samples that represent freshwater possessing different chemical properties the ph was near 2 6 for nw1 and nw2 while above 5 21 for other samples meanwhile the highest cation concentrations were detected in nw1 and nw2 whereas nw3 contained the highest ca2 concentration due to liming process tables 2 and s6 the reasons for variation in ph and is among 6 nw samples are explained in fig s2 and s1 2 3 of the supplementary material the early stage stability of nac in nw samples followed the order of nw6 nw5 nw4 nw3 nw2 nw1 fig 5 a c the sizes of nac in nw1 364 5 nm and nw2 351 4 nm were larger than those in other samples 300 nm fig 5a all nw samples reduced the negative ζ potential of nac absolute values 20 mv compared to that 40 mv measured in model water at 1 mm nacl and ph 6 fig s3b specifically the ζ potentials of nac in nw1 1 632 mv and nw2 1 625 mv were much less negative than in other samples fig 5b these results were reasonable since both the lowest ph 2 6 and highest cation concentrations in nw1 and nw2 table 2 would screen the negative charge of nac promoting aggregation that resulted in increased d h and pdi the high conductivity of nw1 3 likely correlated to their low ph and high is table 2 positive correlation was found between ζ potential absolute value of ζ potential and ph whereas negative correlations existed between ζ potential and is or conductivity fig s7a d the early stage aggregation profiles in nw samples show that nac underwent fast aggregation in nw1 and nw2 to 1000 nm in 20 min slightly aggregated in nw3 and nw4 while remained stable in nw5 and nw6 fig 5c table 2 shows that nw1 and nw2 contained ca2 and mg2 concentrations about 1 5 times as their ccc 3 1 mm cacl2 and 3 3 mm mgcl2 at ph 6 fig 1c meanwhile the strongly acidic condition and the presence of 2 mm al3 also promoted nac aggregation although high ca2 concentrations were detected in nw3 13 04 mm and nw4 3 790 mm nac remained relatively stable in these two samples possibly due to their high toc concentrations of 41 92 and 16 28 mg l respectively table 2 these toc concentrations were much higher than the 10 mgc l macromolecule concentration used in model water figs 2 and 3 which may correlate to macromolecules that stabilized nac via steric hindrance as aforementioned fig 4e since nw5 and nw6 contained low ionic concentrations neutral ph and low toc table 2 nac reasonably showed strong stability in these samples correlation analyses further show that aggregation rate k increased with decreasing ph and increasing electrolyte concentrations and were complexly influenced by macromolecules as reflected by toc fig s7e h 3 5 2 long term stability the long term stability of nac in nw samples was investigated by measuring the light absorbance fig 5d and visual observation fig 5e of suspensions over 11 d generally similar long term stability results were observed for nac as compared with the early stage experiments following the order of nw6 nw5 nw3 nw4 nw2 nw1 the change in relative light absorbance a a 0 in fig 5d reflects the proportion of nac remaining suspended in nw samples it shows that nw1 and nw2 significantly destabilized nac by inducing 83 reduction in a a 0 in 2 d which was consistent with their clear suspensions visually observed in fig 5e indicating fast sedimentation of nac however nac settled gradually in other nw samples as reflected from both their slowly decreasing a a 0 and dark suspensions after 7 d a a 0 decreased to 0 5 0 6 in nw3 5 yet remained above 0 9 in nw6 the a a 0 values became stable in 11 d upon which near 20 30 and 40 of nac remained suspending in nw1 nw2 and nw4 respectively while 50 60 of nac remained suspending in other samples compared with nac a previous study reported stronger stability of go nanomaterial in nw samples with above 90 particles remained suspending in calls creek water after 28 d chowdhury et al 2013 the solution chemistry of calls creek water ph 7 9 conductivity 26 μs cm and toc 2 8 mg l was similar to nw5 ph 7 67 conductivity 387 μs cm and toc 1 2 mg l as conductivity mainly correlates to electrolyte concentration the lower conductivity of calls creek water than nw5 sample may be responsible for causing a greater ζ potential of go 35 4 mv than nac 18 6 mv thereby resulting in the stronger stability of go 4 conclusion the results indicate that the colloidal stability of nac was governed by the complex interplay among solution ph electrolytes and macromolecules in model aqueous solutions higher ph stabilized nac by raising ccc from 28 to 590 mm nacl due to enhanced electrical repulsion increased cation concentration destabilized nac by charge screening with the effect following ba2 ca2 mg2 na k the aggregation behavior could be predicted by dlvo model with a hamaker constant a cwc of 4 3 10 20 j macromolecules stabilized nac in 20 600 mm nacl solutions at 10 mgc l with the order of eps bsa cel ha fa alg enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance which originated from adsorbed macromolecule layer and was affected by macromolecule structure were two major stabilization mechanisms most macromolecules still stabilized nac in cacl2 solution except for alg and ha that significantly destabilized nac due to cation bridging with ca2 at high concentrations long term stability experiments in nw samples showed that half of nac particles remained stably suspended for 10 d in neutral freshwater however nac may undergo rapid aggregation and sedimentation in acidic or saline aquatic environments depending on the type and

16745,nanosized activated carbon nac is a novel adsorbent with great potential for water reclamation however its transport and reactivity in aqueous environments may be greatly affected by its stability against aggregation this study investigated the colloidal stability of nac in model aqueous systems with broad background solution chemistries including 7 electrolytes nacl nano3 na2so4 kcl cacl2 mgcl2 and bacl2 ph 4 9 and 6 macromolecules humic acid ha fulvic acid fa cellulose cel bovine serum albumin bsa alginate alg and extracellular polymeric substance eps along with natural water samples collected from pristine to polluted rivers the results showed that higher solution ph stabilized nac by raising the critical coagulation concentration from 28 to 590 mm nacl increased cation concentration destabilized nac by charge screening with the cationic influence following ba2 ca2 mg2 na k its aggregation behavior could be predicted with the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory with a hamaker constant a cwc of 4 3 10 20 j the presence of macromolecules stabilized nac in nacl solution and most cacl2 solution following eps bsa cel ha fa alg due largely to enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance originated from adsorbed macromolecules however alg and ha strongly destabilized nac via cation bridging at high ca2 concentrations approximately half of nac particles remained stably suspended for 10 d in neutral freshwater samples the results demonstrated the complex effects of water chemistry on fate and transport of nac in aquatic environments graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aggregation kinetics attachment efficiency dlvo theory steric hindrance cation bridging surface water environments 1 introduction nanosized activated carbon nac is a novel carbonaceous engineered nanomaterial enm possessing unique nano dimension extremely porous structure enormous specific surface area ssa varied surface functionality and highly hydrophobic nature chen and huang 2017 chen et al 2017 nazem et al 2020 the sizes of nac are much smaller than conventional powdered activated carbon pac 10 50 μm mean diameter and granular activated carbon gac and are similar with or smaller than super fine pac spac roughly 0 1 1 μm mean diameter bonvin et al 2016 partlan et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated the potential applicability of nac as adsorbents and nanofiltration membranes in water treatment processes chen et al 2017 hosseini et al 2018 besides nac is widely considered in other fields as potential candidates for antimicrobial agents lakshmi et al 2018 catalyst support abdulkareem alsultan et al 2016 and drug carriers sengupta et al 2014 direct use of nac for water treatment or unintentional release of nac during other application activities could introduce such enm into natural and engineered aquatic systems although limited research shows that nac exhibited insignificant cytotoxicity after short term exposure sengupta et al 2014 it may act as strong pollutant carriers during environmental transport vidal et al 2008 therefore understanding the fate and transport of nac in various aqueous environments is crucial for designing its application schemes for water treatment as well as evaluating its potential ecological and health risks upon release of nac nanomaterials into aquatic environments both their transport and reactivity are largely dependent on the aggregation behavior which would alter their size and ssa adsorption capacity environmental toxicity and ultimate fate hewitt et al 2020 the existing literature on fate and transport of carbonaceous enm focuses mainly on fullerene c60 kyzyma et al 2019 carbon nanotubes cnts single walled swcnts and multi walled mwcnts xia et al 2019 and graphene oxide go ali et al 2020 yet much less attention was paid to the novel nac nanomaterial our previous studies have demonstrated the potent advantages including excellent adsorption capacity chen et al 2017 and colloidal stability chen and huang 2017 simultaneously possessed by nac making it suitable for emergent contamination treatment and in situ groundwater remediation it was shown that considering solely the effects of nacl or cacl2 four different model nacs two made from bamboo and trees and others made from coconut shell and bamboo charcoals exhibited strong colloidal stability under freshwater conditions at low salt concentrations while they aggregated under seawater conditions at higher salt concentrations with behaviors predictable by the derjaguin landau verwey overbeek dlvo theory from which their hamaker constants were derived chen and huang 2017 however natural aquatic environments contain complex solution chemistries including various electrolytes ph and macromolecules saleh et al 2010 it remains unclear how these environmental factors exert single and combined effects on the aggregation kinetics of nac environmental and biological macromolecules such as natural organic matter nom polysaccharides proteins and extracellular polymeric substance eps having different molecular size structure and functionality are ubiquitously distributed in aqueous environments liu et al 2020 as our previous study showed that nac with large ssa and hydrophobic surface had strong adsorption affinity to organic pollutants chen et al 2017 we hypothesized that macromolecules would also interact with nac and adsorb onto particle surface depending on the solution composition and concentration of electrolytes and macromolecules these environmental factors may promote or inhibit the aggregation process of nac as have been shown to vary among different carbonaceous enms e g cnts liu et al 2016 and fullerene zhang et al 2013 moreover these enms may also exhibit different aggregation behaviors in model and real water samples chowdhury et al 2013 to date previous research only reported the single influence of nacl or cacl2 on aggregation kinetics of nac without macromolecules and only in model aqueous systems chen and huang 2017 therefore complex model solutions and natural water samples should be included to elucidate the aggregation behavior of nac and its interaction mechanism with macromolecules in aqueous environments the objective of this study was to investigate the single and combined effects of solution chemistry including electrolytes ph and macromolecules on the colloidal stability of nac in model and natural aqueous solutions the following environmental scenarios were considered 1 various electrolytes and ph levels 2 different macromolecules in nacl and cacl2 solutions 3 interaction mechanism of nac with macromolecules 4 natural water samples with various solution chemistry and 5 early stage vs long term stability of nac the model solutions contained 7 electrolytes nacl nano3 na2so4 kcl cacl2 mgcl2 or bacl2 at concentrations 0 01 1000 mm typically found in aqueous environments ph 4 9 and 6 macromolecules a hydrophobic and semi rigid humic acid ha and a fulvic acid fa with smaller molecular weight and shorter carbon chain were selected as two model nom ali et al 2020 two polysaccharides included a hydrophilic cellulose cel with linear chain of d glucose units updegraff 1969 and a hydrophilic linear and semi flexible alginate alg chen et al 2019 bovine serum albumin bsa was used as a hydrophobic and globular protein saleh et al 2010 and an eps composed of polysaccharide and protein having random coils with partially extended chains was extracted for study liu et al 2020 freshwater samples from natural rivers possessing different solution chemistries ranging from acidic contaminated to neutral clean conditions were also collected for comparison of nac stability in model and natural water the results demonstrated the complex role of electrolytes ph and macromolecules on the fate and transport of nac in aquatic environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 nac stock suspension super activated carbon nanoparticles stock us1077 were obtained from us research nanomaterials inc houston usa our previous studies have characterized its aggregation chen and huang 2017 and adsorption chen et al 2017 behaviors with the designation of nac4 its stock suspension was previously prepared via natural sedimentation chen and huang 2017 which was replaced here by centrifugation as described in s1 1 of the supplementary material this method yielded small intensity weighed hydrodynamic diameter d h uniform size distribution i e polydispersity index pdi fig s1a and high particle concentration fig s1b the nac concentration of stock suspension 358 0 9 8 mg l table s1 was measured gravimetrically 2 2 preparation of model and natural aqueous solutions monovalent nacl nano3 na2so4 and kcl and divalent cacl2 mgcl2 and bacl2 salts acs grade were purchased from titan scientific co ltd shanghai china suwannee river ha standard ii and fa standard i were purchased from international humic substances society st paul mn cel bsa and alg with cat no of c5013 a7030 and 1 80 947 respectively were obtained from sigma aldrich shanghai china eps was extracted from culture medium of shewanella oneidensis mr 1 the total organic carbon toc concentrations mgc l i e milligram toc per liter of macromolecule stock solutions are presented in table 1 six natural water nw samples were collected from dajiagou river and chahe river guizhou china with the sampling map and geographic coordinates shown in fig s2 and table 2 detailed methods for extracting eps and preparing the above model and natural aqueous solutions are described in s1 2 of the supplementary material 2 3 characterization of nac the d h of nac in different solutions was determined with dynamic light scattering dls using a zetasizer nano zs90 instrument malvern instruments ltd uk triplicate samples were each measured 10 times for electrophoretic mobility that was converted to zeta ζ potential using eq s1 the nac before and after contact with macromolecules and cacl2 were examined for its aggregation state and morphology under transmission electron microscope tem the long term stability of nac in model and natural solutions was measured by light absorbance and visual observation detailed characterization methods are described in s1 3 of the supplementary material 2 4 determination of aggregation kinetics the experimental conditions for measuring the aggregation behaviors of nac in electrolyte solutions macromolecule solutions and nw samples along with their reasons of choice are described in tables s2 s3 and s1 4 of the supplementary material the aggregation kinetics of nac were measured with the zetasizer instrument using time resolved dls technique li et al 2021 as described in s1 5 of the supplementary material the early stage aggregation rate k was determined with eq s2 the attachment efficiency α ranging from 0 no aggregation to 1 fast aggregation was employed to quantify the colloidal stability eq s3 the critical coagulation concentration ccc which represents the minimum electrolyte concentration to induce diffusion limited particle aggregation was determined on the stability profile from the intersection of extrapolated lines through the diffusion and reaction limited regimes chowdhury et al 2013 the experimental α data determined in nacl solution at ph 6 were fitted by the theoretical α values calculated based on the dlvo theory eqs s4 s12 s1 6 of the supplementary material 2 5 macromolecule adsorption by nac the adsorption of macromolecules onto nac was determined by one point batch adsorption experiment following a method modified from previous studies chen et al 2019 zhang et al 2013 as described in s1 7 of the supplementary material the adsorption experiment was conducted at 600 mg l macromolecules 30 mg l nac 1 mm nacl 25 c and ph 6 higher macromolecule and nac concentrations were used in adsorption experiments to ensure the measurement accuracy and precision 3 results and discussion 3 1 effects of ph and electrolyte the d h of nac measured at 1 mm nacl continuously decreased as ph increased from 2 to 4 which corresponded to the enhanced negative charge of nac yielding a point of zero charge near ph 2 fig s3 the colloidal stability of nac as a function of ph was quantified in nacl solutions fig 1 a all stability curves display two aggregation regimes predictable by the dlvo theory chen and huang 2017 reaction limited aggregation regime α 1 at electrolyte concentrations below ccc and the diffusion limited regime α 1 at electrolyte concentrations above ccc the stability curves continuously shifted rightwards at higher ph in nacl solution indicating enhanced colloidal stability of nac the ccc values increased by 21 times from 28 to 590 mm nacl as ph changed from 4 to 9 this phenomenon occurred due to the deprotonation of acidic functional groups on nac at higher ph that inhibited aggregation lászló et al 2004 2007 the results demonstrated the strong impact of ph on stability of nac especially under acidic conditions the ζ potential of nac as a function of electrolyte concentration was determined at ph 6 for different monovalent and divalent electrolytes fig 1b the two groups of electrolytes clearly showed separate regimes of ζ potentials with each group displaying overlapped trends that all increased with electrolyte concentration the cationic valence exhibited strong charge screening effect on nac rather than the type of ions given the same valence the change in ζ potential with electrolyte concentration was attributed to compressed electrical double layer yang et al 2017 divalent electrolytes exerted stronger screening effect due to their higher charge density in the diffuse layer and possibly their specific adsorption on nac surface as compared with monovalent electrolytes saleh et al 2008 for instance the ζ potentials were 43 9 and 3 1 mv at 10 mm nano3 and bacl2 respectively specifically na2so4 exhibited a trend slightly above other 1 1 electrolyte since it contains two na the ionic strength is was one of the determining parameters as seen in the debye hückel parameter eq s11 under seawater concentrations the negative charge was almost completely screened by all cations the stability curves of nac in different electrolyte solutions at ph 6 all exhibited two distinct aggregation regimes fig 1c the ccc values for divalent electrolytes were much lower than those for monovalent electrolytes indicating that divalent electrolytes were more effective in inducing nac aggregation which corresponded to the ζ potential results in fig 1b this result is consistent with other enms including c60 chen and elimelech 2007 swcnts saleh et al 2010 and mwcnts yang et al 2017 the ccc values were close among nacl 74 mm nano3 77 mm and kcl 86 mm which were approximately twice as that for na2so4 37 mm equivalent to 74 mm na counter ions the ccc values for 3 divalent electrolytes were 3 mm providing a ratio of ccc values in cacl2 and nacl proportional to 2 4 6 which followed the schulze hardy rule ranging from 2 2 to 2 6 tang et al 2017 the results again suggest that the influence of electrolytes on stability of nac mainly arises from cationic valence overall the potential for inducing nac aggregation by cations followed the order of ba2 ca2 mg2 na k noting that charge screening and even reversal occurred at high ca2 and ba2 concentrations fig 1b this was likely attributed to the specific binding of ca2 and ba2 to nac that led to significant destabilization as previously observed for black carbon xu et al 2017 furthermore this order of inducing nac aggregation was inversely correlated to the hydration force of divalent cations mg2 ca2 ba2 which would reduce their interaction with nanoparticles wang et al 2017 fig 1d shows that the theoretical simulation based on the dlvo theory eqs s4 s12 generally fitted through the experimental stability data in nacl solution this fitting process derived the hamaker constants of nac in water a cwc and vacuum a cc of 4 3 10 20 and 16 10 20 j respectively these values are greater than those previously reported for nac prepared via natural sedimentation chen and huang 2017 as compared in table s4 the aggregation behavior of nac only induced slight influence on its ssa which gradually decreased from 610 m2 g in milli q water to 604 and 601 m2 g in 2 and 25 mm cacl2 solutions respectively table s5 in summary fig s4 illustrates the combined effects of solution ph and electrolyte concentration showing that the aggregation rate of nac enhanced with increasing electrolyte concentration and decreasing ph 3 2 stability in electrolyte solution at fixed macromolecule concentration 3 2 1 nacl solutions the ζ potentials of nac in the absence or presence of 10 mgc l milligram toc per liter macromolecules were determined at varying concentrations of nacl fig 2 a despite the presence of macromolecules the ζ potentials all became less negative as electrolyte concentrations increased among 6 macromolecules bsa was the most effective in reducing the negative ζ potential of nac in nacl solution fig 2a meanwhile bsa also exhibited the strongest adsorption qe 76 1 2 3 mgc g milligram toc per gram table 1 onto nac which had hydrophobic surface and large ssa table s5 with an isoelectric point of 4 7 bsa was negatively charged at ph 6 kopac et al 2018 and so was the nac surface fig 2a to prevent the buildup of electrostatic potential co adsorption of solution cations e g na and ca2 into the interfacial film between the shear plane and particle surface occurred resulting in reduction of ζ potential the strong adsorption of bsa and development of protein corona on nanoparticles was also observed for mwcnts kopac et al 2018 soot chen et al 2019 and plastic liu et al 2020 our previous study determined that the eps sample was constituted mainly of 50 proteins followed by 25 polysaccharides and 13 uronic acids with c h o and n contents accounting for 39 6 5 7 32 5 and 10 8 respectively liu et al 2020 therefore alike bsa eps also reduced the negative charge of nac in nacl solution fig 2a compared with the spherical and compact protein structure of bsa eps existing as random coils with incompletely extending chains was less effective in charge reduction wang et al 2012 the presence of 10 mgc l fa caused minimal change 12 on ζ potential at all nacl concentrations contrarily other macromolecules ha cel and alg showed overlapped trends that slightly enhanced the negative ζ potential in nacl solution it has been reported that the presence of ha also enhanced the negative charge of mwcnts liu et al 2016 but reduced that of c60 chae et al 2012 the attachment efficiencies of nac in nacl solution with or without 10 mgc l macromolecules are presented in fig 2c the results show that all stability curves were lowered by macromolecules leading to failure of nac to display any diffusion limited aggregation behavior α 1 over the tested nacl concentrations the α values were reduced by up to 100 times under such conditions therefore all macromolecules stabilized nac in nacl solution with such stabilization effect following the order of eps bsa cel ha fa alg as mentioned above eps and bsa showing the most obvious reduction of surface charge and strongest adsorption on nac also stabilized it most effectively in nacl solution suppressing any observable aggregation with α between 0 02 0 11 the stabilization effect of cel was slightly weaker than bsa initially then enhanced to an extent identical with eps as nacl concentration increased to above 200 mm such aggregation behavior of nac was unlike mwcnts which still exhibited diffusion limited aggregation regime in nacl solution with the present of cel that raised ccc from 25 to 210 mm nacl liu et al 2016 the presence of ha effectively suppressed aggregation of nac similar to c60 chen and elimelech 2007 zhang et al 2013 and swcnts saleh et al 2010 in nacl solution by lowering α to an order of magnitude however fa showed stronger stabilization effect on nac than c60 zhang et al 2013 and soot chen et al 2019 as α continuously increased from 0 19 to 0 58 yet never reached unity as nacl concentration rising from 60 to 600 mm although alg enhanced the negative charge of nac in nacl solution fig 2a it exhibited the weakest stabilization effect among all macromolecules α 0 80 at 600 mm nacl shifting the stability curve downwards while maintaining a shape most alike the curve measured without macromolecule fig 2c 3 2 2 cacl2 solutions fig 2b shows that the macromolecular influence on ζ potential of nac was more prominent at lower cacl2 concentrations which was likely attributed to the sensitivity of particle negative charge to high ca2 concentration that diminished the macromolecular effects over the tested cacl2 concentrations bsa still exhibited the most significant reduction of negative charge on nac among all macromolecules however bsa only reduced the negative charge at 0 01 3 mm cacl2 while enhanced it at 6 20 mm cacl2 this concentration dependent effect of bsa in cacl2 solution was different from that observed in nacl solution fig 2a and in other studies which reported monotonic charge screening effect on particles over a wide range of cacl2 concentrations e g 0 5 30 mm chen et al 2019 liu et al 2018 similar to the results obtained in nacl solution cel and alg enhanced the negative charge of nac especially at low electrolyte concentrations notably the most negative ζ potential was attained at 0 01 mm cacl2 in the presence of 10 mgc l alg which enhanced it from 26 0 to 56 8 mv the ζ potentials of nac in the presence of other macromolecules ha fa and eps showed overlapped trends which were reduced at 0 4 3 mm cacl2 while enhanced at other concentrations the attachment efficiencies of nac with or without 10 mgc l macromolecules were determined at various cacl2 concentrations fig 2d unlike the stabilization results in nacl solution nac was significantly destabilized by 10 mgc l alg and ha at cacl2 concentrations above 5 and 10 mm respectively the α values exceeded 1 under these conditions and reached up to 6 5 and 2 6 in the presence of 10 mgc l alg and ha respectively at 40 mm cacl2 indicating non dlvo interactions the stronger destabilization effect of alg than ha was confirmed by visual observation which shows that nac formed apparent flocs at high cacl2 concentrations 10 20 and 40 mm in the presence of alg fig s5e but not ha fig s5a however their destabilization effect on nac reversed to stabilization below 5 mm cacl2 for instance the aggregation rate of nac was reduced by up to 22 times in the presence of ha at 3 mm cacl2 the complex effects of alg depending on cacl2 concentration have been reported for c60 saleh et al 2010 soot chen et al 2019 and graphene su et al 2018 similar results were also reported for ha on stability of c60 chen and elimelech 2007 and biochar yang et al 2019 different from alg and ha other 4 macromolecules mainly stabilized nac in cacl2 solution following the order of bsa cel eps fa fig 2d the presence of 10 mgc l fa only stabilized nac at cacl2 concentration below 10 mm similarly eps also stabilized nac most effectively at cacl2 concentrations near the ccc 3 1 mm while such effect weakened at higher cacl2 concentration and disappeared at 40 mm cacl2 this stabilization effect of eps depending on cacl2 concentration was different from its strong stabilization effect in nacl solution that was independent of electrolyte concentration fig 2c however cel and bsa still exhibited the strongest stabilization effect in cacl2 solution as similarly in nacl solution suppressing nac aggregation α 0 07 at all electrolyte concentrations it has been observed differently for mwcnts that showed both reaction and diffusion limited aggregation regimes in cacl2 solution when cel was present raising ccc from 0 9 to 2 7 mm liu et al 2016 except for alg other 5 macromolecules did not induce any apparent flocculation that could be visually observed in suspensions containing nac and cacl2 fig s5 3 3 stability in macromolecule solution at fixed electrolyte concentration the attachment efficiency as a function of macromolecule concentration was further determined at two fixed electrolyte concentrations near ccc and seawater levels fig 3 under all tested conditions macromolecules stabilized nac and such effect generally enhanced with increasing macromolecule concentration fig 3a c except for ha and alg present at 10 mm cacl2 that destabilized nac fig 3d at 60 mm nacl fig 3a cel and bsa displayed strong stabilization effect that was generally unaffected by macromolecule concentrations however ha and eps showed weaker stabilization effect that gradually enhanced with their concentrations at 10 mgc l cel bsa and eps effectively stabilized nac to similar extents negligible influence was observed for alg at any concentration the α values for 10 mgc l ha 1 10 mgc l cel and bsa and 2 5 10 mgc l eps were below 0 1 which generally correlates to negligible particle aggregation chen and huang 2017 at 600 mm nacl fig 3b no aggregation was observed at any concentrations of cel or bsa as well as 10 mgc l of eps or ha at both tested nacl concentrations the stabilization effects of ha and eps significantly enhanced with increasing macromolecule concentration for instance α decreased by an order of magnitude as eps concentration increased from 5 to 10 mgc l indicating that fast aggregation was completely inhibited the enhanced stabilization effect due to increased macromolecule concentration was also reported for other enm such as mwcnts yang et al 2017 biochar yang et al 2019 and go ali et al 2020 by contrast cel bsa and alg showed effects independent of macromolecule concentration and their results represented two extreme cases cel and bsa stabilized nac even under low macromolecule concentrations whereas alg exhibited negligible effect at high macromolecule concentrations among these 4 electrolyte concentrations the stabilization effect of macromolecules was the most obvious at 3 mm cacl2 fig 3c except for alg other 5 macromolecules strongly stabilized nac to similar extents and their stabilization effects enhanced with macromolecule concentration these results were consistent with those presented in fig 2d at 3 mm cacl2 further showing that these 5 macromolecules effectively stabilized nac even at 1 mgc l in comparison the stabilization effect of alg only became obvious at 10 mgc l more complex results were found at 10 mm cacl2 where stabilization or destabilization effects occurred depending on the type and concentration of macromolecules fig 3d at this cacl2 concentration cel and bsa still strongly stabilized nac as observed above at other 3 electrolyte concentrations although eps stabilized nac at 1 10 mgc l its effect slightly weakened with increasing macromolecule concentration this was also observed when fa and ha increased from 5 to 10 and 1 to 5 mgc l respectively it was noted that 10 mgc l ha and 1 10 mgc l alg destabilized nac in 10 mm cacl2 solution fig 3d the results indicate that ha may stabilize nac at low ha concentration e g 1 5 mgc l under seawater cacl2 conditions while destabilize nac at high ha concentration e g 10 mgc l similar result was previously reported that ha stabilized biochar at 0 5 2 5 mgc l but promoted its aggregation at 5 mgc l yang et al 2019 different from ha alg significantly destabilized nac at all macromolecule concentrations under seawater cacl2 condition with the effect enhancing with both the concentrations of alg fig 3d and cacl2 fig 2d 3 4 interaction mechanisms between nac and macromolecules 3 4 1 stabilization mechanisms enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance were two major stabilization mechanisms responsible for inhibiting nac aggregation by macromolecules however the contribution of these stabilization mechanisms was dependent upon the type and concentration of both macromolecules and electrolytes the proposed stabilization mechanisms are illustrated in fig 4 e at most nacl and cacl2 concentrations cel effectively enhanced the negative charge of nac and inhibited aggregation fig 2 displaying stronger stabilization effect at higher cel concentration fig 3 dispersed nac from 10 mm cacl2 solution could be observed under tem fig s6i the strong negative charge of cel resulted in the lowest adsorption qe 18 8 3 6 mgc g table 1 onto nac among all macromolecules due to electrical repulsion liu et al 2016 therefore enhanced electrical repulsion of nac by cel was mainly responsible for its stabilization similarly ha and fa also enhanced the negative ζ potential of nac fig 2a b contributing to their stabilization these two humic substances were recognized to contain high concentrations of negatively charged e g carboxylic and phenolic functional groups zhang et al 2013 which would deprotonate to enhance the charge of nac however electrostatic interaction was not likely the sole stabilization mechanism since the charge did not change apparently especially by fa in nacl solution fig 2a table 1 shows that the adsorption affinity of macromolecules followed the order of bsa fa alg eps ha cel the semi rigid ha and fa macromolecules adsorbed onto the hydrophobic nac surface provided steric hindrance fig 4e preventing nac aggregation as have been similarly reported for swcnts saleh et al 2010 mwcnts saleh et al 2008 c60 zhang et al 2013 and soot chen et al 2019 dispersed nac with surface coating were observed under tem for solutions containing fa and cacl2 fig s6g h the stronger stabilization effect of ha than fa in most solutions was likely attributed to the higher molecular weight longer carbon chain and more compact structure of ha ali et al 2020 therefore enhanced electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance were two major stabilization mechanisms for ha and fa steric hindrance highly depends on macromolecule structure and its adsorption affinity onto nac the adsorption experiment revealed that bsa exhibited the strongest adsorption by nac among 6 macromolecules table 1 as mentioned earlier bsa could be spontaneously adsorbed onto nac surface fig 2a b the hydrophobic interactions between bsa and nac surface also promoted adsorption bergaoui et al 2017 furthermore bsa adsorbed onto nac surface underwent structural rearrangements to gain higher conformational entropy in the protein molecule resulting in a more compact globular architecture of bsa liu et al 2020 the globular protein layer of bsa attached on nac induced longer range steric hindrance force than other relatively more linear macromolecules such as ha and alg chen et al 2019 liu et al 2018 therefore bsa stabilized nac most effectively among all macromolecules via steric hindrance the extracted eps sample consisted of 50 protein and 25 polysaccharide and usually exists as random coils with partly extending chains under neural conditions wang et al 2012 therefore eps also induced charge reduction fig 2a and strong stabilization figs 2a and 3a of nac to a similar extent with bsa in nacl solution via steric hindrance however the stabilization effect of eps gradually disappeared as cacl2 concentration increased fig 2d which may be related to the polysaccharide content that concurrently destabilized nac as discussed later although alg provided the strongest charge enhancement fig 2a b of nac and exhibited strong adsorption table 1 its stabilization effect was mostly negligible figs 2c d and 3a c this was likely attributed to its destabilization effect as discussed below that counterbalanced or overcame stabilization 3 4 2 destabilization mechanism fig 4a presents the aggregation profiles of nac in cacl2 solutions with or without 10 mgc l alg or ha the aggregation rate of nac increased with cacl2 concentration from 1 to 3 mm while remained unchanged when further increased to 100 mm this aligns with the dlvo behavior since ccc was determined as 3 1 mm cacl2 fig 1c above which α stays at 1 eq s3 under diffusion limited condition where attraction dominates over repulsion however the aggregation rate was prominently elevated by 10 mgc l alg or ha at 20 mm cacl2 fig 4a yielding slopes of aggregation profiles clearly above those obtained in fast aggregation regime α 1 this contradicts with the enhanced negative ζ potential of nac under such conditions fig 2b indicating that electrical double layer compression was not likely the destabilization mechanism instead non dlvo interactions were responsible for destabilizing nac with alg showing a stronger effect than ha by raising d h up to 1800 in 20 min the major destabilization mechanism was identified as cation bridging of alg or ha with ca2 at high concentrations as depicted in fig 4e the tem images fig 4b and s6l n show that alg bridging with ca2 resulted in formation of alginate gel that enmeshed nac and significantly promoted aggregation it is recognized that ca2 can complex with the carboxylic groups in the guluronic acid blocks of alg in a planar two dimensional manner cerciello et al 2017 generating cross linked gels that destabilized graphene su et al 2018 and soot chen et al 2019 at cacl2 concentrations above 3 mm near ccc the destabilization effect enhanced with concentrations of both cacl2 fig 2d and alg fig 3d this was likely due to the presence of more available ca2 in solution and binding sites on alg to form large settling flocs in suspensions that could be visually observed fig s5e the cation bridging of ha in cacl2 solution that destabilized nac occurred by simultaneous coordination of ca2 with two carboxylic groups on ha to form ha ca2 complex li et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the interaction between ha ca2 complexes via hydrogen bonds generated larger molecular layer which formed ionic bridges with the negatively charged surface sites of nac and resulted in destabilization fig 4c and s6c f zhao et al 2019 the role of ha on nac in cacl2 solution was governed by the interplay between destabilization and stabilization effects fig 4e below 10 mm cacl2 ha stabilized nac at all tested macromolecule concentrations by enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance figs 2b d and 3c at 10 mm cacl2 and ha concentrations below 10 mgc l most ha were adsorbed on nac so that the stabilization effect dominated over or counterbalanced destabilization fig 3d at 10 mm cacl2 and 10 mgc l ha free ha present in solution could bind with ca2 to form network clusters yu et al 2019 leading to an overall destabilization effect it was noted that the stabilization effect of eps gradually diminished at higher cacl2 concentrations and even reversed to slight destabilization at 40 mm cacl2 fig 2d this indicates that the 25 polysaccharide content on eps may be similar with alg that destabilized nac via cation bridging with ca2 present at high concentration which competed with the stabilization effect of eps liu et al 2020 3 5 colloidal stability in nw samples 3 5 1 early stage stability the colloidal stability of nac was further studied in 6 nw samples that represent freshwater possessing different chemical properties the ph was near 2 6 for nw1 and nw2 while above 5 21 for other samples meanwhile the highest cation concentrations were detected in nw1 and nw2 whereas nw3 contained the highest ca2 concentration due to liming process tables 2 and s6 the reasons for variation in ph and is among 6 nw samples are explained in fig s2 and s1 2 3 of the supplementary material the early stage stability of nac in nw samples followed the order of nw6 nw5 nw4 nw3 nw2 nw1 fig 5 a c the sizes of nac in nw1 364 5 nm and nw2 351 4 nm were larger than those in other samples 300 nm fig 5a all nw samples reduced the negative ζ potential of nac absolute values 20 mv compared to that 40 mv measured in model water at 1 mm nacl and ph 6 fig s3b specifically the ζ potentials of nac in nw1 1 632 mv and nw2 1 625 mv were much less negative than in other samples fig 5b these results were reasonable since both the lowest ph 2 6 and highest cation concentrations in nw1 and nw2 table 2 would screen the negative charge of nac promoting aggregation that resulted in increased d h and pdi the high conductivity of nw1 3 likely correlated to their low ph and high is table 2 positive correlation was found between ζ potential absolute value of ζ potential and ph whereas negative correlations existed between ζ potential and is or conductivity fig s7a d the early stage aggregation profiles in nw samples show that nac underwent fast aggregation in nw1 and nw2 to 1000 nm in 20 min slightly aggregated in nw3 and nw4 while remained stable in nw5 and nw6 fig 5c table 2 shows that nw1 and nw2 contained ca2 and mg2 concentrations about 1 5 times as their ccc 3 1 mm cacl2 and 3 3 mm mgcl2 at ph 6 fig 1c meanwhile the strongly acidic condition and the presence of 2 mm al3 also promoted nac aggregation although high ca2 concentrations were detected in nw3 13 04 mm and nw4 3 790 mm nac remained relatively stable in these two samples possibly due to their high toc concentrations of 41 92 and 16 28 mg l respectively table 2 these toc concentrations were much higher than the 10 mgc l macromolecule concentration used in model water figs 2 and 3 which may correlate to macromolecules that stabilized nac via steric hindrance as aforementioned fig 4e since nw5 and nw6 contained low ionic concentrations neutral ph and low toc table 2 nac reasonably showed strong stability in these samples correlation analyses further show that aggregation rate k increased with decreasing ph and increasing electrolyte concentrations and were complexly influenced by macromolecules as reflected by toc fig s7e h 3 5 2 long term stability the long term stability of nac in nw samples was investigated by measuring the light absorbance fig 5d and visual observation fig 5e of suspensions over 11 d generally similar long term stability results were observed for nac as compared with the early stage experiments following the order of nw6 nw5 nw3 nw4 nw2 nw1 the change in relative light absorbance a a 0 in fig 5d reflects the proportion of nac remaining suspended in nw samples it shows that nw1 and nw2 significantly destabilized nac by inducing 83 reduction in a a 0 in 2 d which was consistent with their clear suspensions visually observed in fig 5e indicating fast sedimentation of nac however nac settled gradually in other nw samples as reflected from both their slowly decreasing a a 0 and dark suspensions after 7 d a a 0 decreased to 0 5 0 6 in nw3 5 yet remained above 0 9 in nw6 the a a 0 values became stable in 11 d upon which near 20 30 and 40 of nac remained suspending in nw1 nw2 and nw4 respectively while 50 60 of nac remained suspending in other samples compared with nac a previous study reported stronger stability of go nanomaterial in nw samples with above 90 particles remained suspending in calls creek water after 28 d chowdhury et al 2013 the solution chemistry of calls creek water ph 7 9 conductivity 26 μs cm and toc 2 8 mg l was similar to nw5 ph 7 67 conductivity 387 μs cm and toc 1 2 mg l as conductivity mainly correlates to electrolyte concentration the lower conductivity of calls creek water than nw5 sample may be responsible for causing a greater ζ potential of go 35 4 mv than nac 18 6 mv thereby resulting in the stronger stability of go 4 conclusion the results indicate that the colloidal stability of nac was governed by the complex interplay among solution ph electrolytes and macromolecules in model aqueous solutions higher ph stabilized nac by raising ccc from 28 to 590 mm nacl due to enhanced electrical repulsion increased cation concentration destabilized nac by charge screening with the effect following ba2 ca2 mg2 na k the aggregation behavior could be predicted by dlvo model with a hamaker constant a cwc of 4 3 10 20 j macromolecules stabilized nac in 20 600 mm nacl solutions at 10 mgc l with the order of eps bsa cel ha fa alg enhanced electrical repulsion and steric hindrance which originated from adsorbed macromolecule layer and was affected by macromolecule structure were two major stabilization mechanisms most macromolecules still stabilized nac in cacl2 solution except for alg and ha that significantly destabilized nac due to cation bridging with ca2 at high concentrations long term stability experiments in nw samples showed that half of nac particles remained stably suspended for 10 d in neutral freshwater however nac may undergo rapid aggregation and sedimentation in acidic or saline aquatic environments depending on the type and

16746,the discharge of wastewater derived viruses in aquatic environments impacts catchment scale virome composition to explore this we used viromic analysis of rna and dna virus like particles to holistically track virus communities entering and leaving wastewater treatment plants and the connecting river catchment system and estuary we reconstructed 40 000 partial viral genomes into 10 149 species level groups dominated by dsdna and ssrna bacteriophages caudoviricetes and leviviricetes and a small number of genomes that could pose a risk to human health we found substantial viral diversity and geographically distinct virus communities associated with different wastewater treatment plants river and estuarine water bodies harboured more diverse viral communities in downstream locations influenced by tidal movement and proximity to wastewater treatment plants shellfish and beach sand were enriched in viral communities when compared with the surrounding water acting as entrapment matrices for virus particles extensive phylogenetic analyses of environmental derived and reference sequences showed the presence of human associated sapovirus gii in all sample types multiple rotavirus a strains in wastewater and a diverse set of picorna like viruses associated with shellfish we conclude that wastewater derived viral genetic material is commonly deposited in the environment and can be traced throughout the freshwater marine continuum of the river catchment where it is influenced by local geography weather events and tidal effects our data illustrate the utility of viromic analyses for wastewater and environment based ecology and epidemiology and we present a conceptual model for the circulation of all types of viruses in a freshwater catchment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords viromics viral diversity wastewater viruses aquatic viruses shellfish viruses wastewater contamination virus ecology 1 introduction viruses are the most abundant biological entities in terrestrial and aquatic biomes but their origin distribution and potential to spread disease via watercourses is poorly understood roux et al 2020 previous research has demonstrated that wastewater contains a plethora of viruses including human pathogenic and zoonotic viruses and that wastewater treatment processes do not remove human viruses with sufficient efficacy da silva et al 2007 farkas et al 2018b fong et al 2010 girones et al 2010 gomes et al 2019 gulino et al 2020 hellmér et al 2014 kitajima et al 2014 prado et al 2019 qiu et al 2015 sidhu et al 2017 viral abundance behaviour infectivity and fate remain poorly understood because of knowledge gaps in the ecology and connectivity of viromes across human populations and the freshwater marine continuum the current gold standard method for investigating enteric viruses in the environment is q rt pcr a technique that provides reliable quantitative information on the presence of the genomic material of target viruses but requires prior knowledge on the identity of the virus and its genome sequence farkas et al 2020 2017b as qpcr based assays only detect a fragment of the genome the question of virus integrity and hence infectivity remains open infectivity assays can offer a solution but even where available require specialised cultivation systems and are not likely to become generally applicable for routine monitoring of public health risks dicaprio 2017 as a more comprehensive and now potentially feasible alternative we applied shotgun viromics i e next generation sequencing of the entire aquatic virome to reconstruct full virus genomes from the environment and objectively scrutinise the ecological and health implications of virus diversity and geographical distribution with minimal bias virome analyses are transforming our understanding of viral diversity and function in the biosphere emerson et al 2018 gregory et al 2020 roux et al 2016 and provide unprecedented opportunity to understand the connectivity and fate of human derived viruses at the catchment scale here we present the first integrated analysis of the full virome of a river catchment system and estuary including water sediment wastewater treatment plants beaches and shellfish production areas fig 1 and supplementary table 1 we assembled over 40 000 partial or near complete genomes uvigs uncultivated virus genomes roux et al 2019 of ssrna dsrna ssdna and dsdna viruses clustered into 10 149 species level groupings votus viral operational taxonomic units our detailed bioinformatic analysis of the rna and dna viromes provides an assessment of viral diversity in the wastewater impacted conwy river catchment located north wales uk farkas et al 2018a 2019 perkins et al 2014 robins et al 2019 encompassing information on the dynamics of viral deposition along the river system leading to viral enrichment at the estuary including shellfish destined for human consumption and a recreational bathing beach viral genome reconstruction revealed general patterns of viral enrichment dilution and degradation and the implications for human health 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection this work builds on our pilot study of a single wastewater treatment plant and a downstream water and sediment sampling site in which we optimised methods and showed that we could reconstruct rna virus genomes from environmental samples adriaenssens et al 2018 we collected and processed four different types of samples for this study wastewater influent and effluent surface water river and estuarine sediment and shellfish in june 2017 from the conwy river catchment area located in north wales uk fig 1 supplementary table 1 wastewater influent was collected from the four major treatment plants in the catchment and the corresponding effluent from three the ganol plant effluent pipe exits directly into the open sea and therefore was not sampled separately one litre per sample surface water was collected in four biological replicates of 50 l resulting in two replicates per library type rna and dna based at two locations one in the river and one at a major recreational beach sediment samples were taken in 4 biological replicates of at least 50 g two replicates per library type at low tide samples were scooped from an accessible part of the river bank into sterile bags using a sterilised spade finally mussels mytilus edulis were collected from the two main commercial shellfishery locations in the estuary and divided into eight pseudoreplicates as described below samples were collected at low tides enabling the collection of shellfish samples from shore without a boat 2 2 sample processing the wastewater 1 l and surface water 50 l samples were concentrated using a two step protocol involving tangential flow ultrafiltration tfuf and beef extract elution as described in detail previously farkas et al 2018c briefly sample volumes were reduced to 50 ml by tfuf on a krosflo research iii tangential flow filtration system spectrum labs phoenix az usa cat no syr u20 01n using a 100 kda cut off mpes minikros hollow fibre filter spectrum labs virus particles were eluted using beef extract and nano3 to a final concentration of 3 and 2 m ph 5 5 respectively after the solution s ph was adjusted to 7 5 peg 6000 was added to a final concentration of 15 with 2 nacl incubated overnight at 4 c and after centrifugation 30 min 10 000 x g 4 c the pellet was resuspended in 10 15 ml pbs ph 7 4 these suspensions were kept at 80 c until nucleic acid extraction the sediment samples were processed using beef extract elution and peg 6000 precipitation as above and described previously farkas et al 2017a for the mussel samples approximately 200 mussels were collected from each location and stored on ice each mussel was dissected and the digestive tissue extracted and minced with a scalpel the tissue was pooled per location and then divided into four pseudoreplicates two replicates per location were mixed with sm buffer 0 1 m nacl 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 10 mm mgso4 and two with pbs at 25 g of digestive tissue to 20 ml of buffer the samples were then shaken for 30 minutes 150 rpm at room temperature to dissociate viral particles from the digestive tissue after which they were stored at 80 c due to a limit on the number of shellfish collected we used both pbs and sm buffer as we could not perform a pre optimisation of the protocol no systematic differences between the two methods were detected 2 3 rna extraction wastewater surface water and sediment concentrates were processed as follows the concentrates were diluted in an equal volume 0 5 m nacl to improve dissociation of viral particles before filtration after centrifugation 5 min 3200 x g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 µm sterile syringe filter millipore the filtrate was further concentrated using vivaspin 20 spin filters 100 kda and centrifugation at 3200 x g once the volume was below 1 ml 5 ml tris buffer 5 mm trishcl 5 mm mgso4 75 mm nacl ph 7 5 was added and the volume reduced two times to reduce the nacl content of the virus suspension centrifugation times ranged between 150 minutes and 20 hours to reduce the volume below 500 µl for the next step a dnase treatment with 10 u turbo dnase invitrogen was performed to remove extra viral dna incubation at 37 c for 30 min inactivation at 75 c for 10 min mussel samples were highly viscous and required separate processing as we were unable to filter or concentrate with the vivaspin filters instead 2 1 ml aliquots per replicate were mixed with 0 1 mm glass beads mobio and lysed in a powerlyser mobio shaker 2 30 seconds at 3400 rpm debris was removed by centrifugation 5 min at 3200 x g and the supernatant was stored at 20 c for next day processing for all sample types the viral capsids were lysed using a combination of proteinase k 50 µg for clear samples 100 µg for turbid samples edta 0 5 m final concentration and sds 0 5 final concentration and incubation for one hour at 56 c next the rna was extracted by trizol extraction derived from kroger and colleagues kroger et al 2012 in short 500 µl of sample was mixed with 1 ml of trizol reagent and 200 µl of molecular grade chloroform in phasemakertm tubes invitrogen shaken vigorously and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13 000 x g the aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new tube the phase separation was repeated for samples that remained turbid the nucleic acid was recovered by isopropanol precipitation and resuspended in 50 µl of sterile rnase free water viral dna was removed with an additional dnase step adding 4 u turbo dnase 5 µl td buffer and incubating for 40 minutes at 37 c followed by inactivation of the dnase at 75 c for 10 minutes the dnase was removed by a second isopropanol precipitation as above the rna resuspended in 50 µl of rnase free water and stored at 80 c until sequencing alongside all samples a positive extraction control comprising of salmonella cells salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium strain d23580 refseq acc nc 016854 and the process control virus mengovirus 105 particles ml was extracted as was a negative tris buffer control 2 4 dna extraction wastewater surface water and sediment samples were processed similarly as for rna extraction with a few amendments to the extraction process the samples were diluted in 10 ml nacl 0 5 m for surface water and sediment samples one replicate designated a was treated with chloroform 1 ml to lyse the cellular fraction 15 min incubation with gentle shaking and the cellular debris removed by centrifugation 5 min 3200 x g the second replicate b was filtered through a 0 45 µm sterile syringe filter millipore for the wastewater samples which consisted of only one replicate the sample was split in two half treated with chloroform and half filtered and then merged all samples were then concentrated and desalted as described above using vivaspin 20 spin filters 100 kda and centrifugation at 3200 x g with centrifugation time between 100 min and 20h all sample concentrates approx 500 µl each were treated with 10 u of turbo dnase invitrogen and 10 µg of rnase a thermo fisher scientific supplemented with turbo dnase buffer for 30 min at 37 c and inactivation at 65 c for 10 min the separation of filtering and chloroform treatment before proteinase and nuclease treatment theoretically allows for the recovery of both giant viruses larger than the filter pore size and viruses with lipid membranes while simultaneously reducing the background cellular dna no differences between treatments were found for potentially pathogenic viruses however the systematic comparison of methods for all viruses is beyond the scope of this study and we encourage others to use our data for further exploration mussel digestive tissue was processed exactly as during rna extraction mixed with 0 1 mm glass beads and lysed in powerlyzer and no nuclease treatment was performed from this point all samples were extracted in the same manner capsids were lysed by adding proteinase k 50 µg ml final concentration edta 20 mm final concentration and sds 0 5 final concentration followed by incubation at 56 c for one hour and extracted using phenol chloroform isoamylalcohol 25 24 1 in phaselock tubes vwr the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and the process was repeated at least once twice for turbid samples followed by one round of chloroform phase separation finally samples were further cleaned and concentrated with ethanol precipitation 2 5 x volume 100 ethanol 1 10 volume 3 m naac ph 5 incubation at 20 c for 30 minutes precipitation 30 min at 15 000 x g 4 c washed with 70 ethanol and air dried in a laminar flow cabinet in tandem with the whole process control samples were extracted starting with the dilution in nacl we used a negative control consisting of tris buffer and a positive control consisting of 500 µl stationary culture escherichia coli mg1655 cells refseq acc nc 000913 2 2 108 pfu of escherichia phage t5 refseq

nbaf facilities at the university of liverpool uk rna libraries were prepared as in the pilot study adriaenssens et al 2018 using the nebnext ultra directional rna library preparation kit of illumina with dual indexes during library preparation the number of pcr cycles was increased to 30 to account for the low amounts of input rna 1 ng dual indexed dna libraries were generated using the nebnext ultra ii dna library prep kit according to the manufacturer s instructions libraries were pooled and sequenced on six lanes of the illumina hiseq 4000 generating paired end 2 150 bp reads three lanes for the rna libraries in july 2017 and three lanes for the dna libraries in march 2018 the dna sequencing run failed for libraries dna sw2a dna tyca b dna sba b and unfortunately we were unable to reconstruct the libraries as the samples had been mistakenly stored at 4 c and the dna had degraded furthermore the read lengths obtained for the mussel dna libraries were much lower as for all other libraries as the dna had been excessively sheared during the extraction procedure 2 6 in silico processing reads went through an initial round of quality control at cgr to remove illumina adapters cutadapt version 1 2 1 o 3 and were trimmed with sickle version 1 2 removing all reads below an average quality of 20 and shorter than 20 bp joshi and fass 2011 martin 2011 the resulting fastq files were received as raw read files from the cgr and deposited into sra under bioproject prjna509142 accession numbers srr8299359 to srr8299398 the paired end read files were further trimmed and filtered to increase quality using the prinseq lite suite schmieder and edwards 2011 and the read pairs meeting the following criteria were retained minimum length 35 bases gc content between 5 and 95 maximum 1 n trimmed until the average read quality was 30 for all exactly duplicated reads only one copy was retained the reads for the control libraries were merged per library type rna dna and used as a bowtie2 mapping reference langmead and salzberg 2012 each of the sample libraries was then mapped against its control and only the unmapped reads were retained these reads were then assembled per sample using spades version 13 9 using the k mers lengths 21 33 55 77 95 107 121 nurk et al 2013 with the exception of the mussel dna libraries containing the shorter reads where the k mers 21 33 55 77 were used the control libraries were assembled using the same parameters and compared to the sample contigs using blastn blast suite and sample contigs that showed significant similarity e value 0 001 were removed from each of the sample contig datasets camacho et al 2009 from these contigs an anvi o contig database was created according to the instructions of the metagenomics workflow eren et al 2015 to be included in the database contigs needed to meet the following criteria rna library assemblies i contig length min 1000 nucleotides nt ii amino acid similarity with any known virus iii recruit no reads from control libraries dna library assemblies i contig length min 10 000 nt ii identified by virsorter as viral in categories 1 or 2 roux et al 2015 iii recruit no reads from control libraries virsorter was run on all dna contig sets using the microbiome decontamination mode on the ivirus cyverse infrastructure bolduc et al 2017 the contig dataset comprising 40 000 uvigs was merged and clustered at an approximation of the viral species level 95 average nucleotide identity over min 80 of contig length according to the species definition for bacteriophages implemented by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv and conventionally used in virome studies adriaenssens and brister 2017 emerson et al 2018 gregory et al 2016 roux et al 2019 2016 we performed a final refinement by removing all contigs 10 000 nt assembled from rna libraries that showed amino acid similarity with dsdna viruses based on diamond blastx comparison buchfink et al 2015 with the nr database downloaded from the ncbi in january 2018 the final database contained 10 149 uvigs uncultivated viral genomes roux et al 2019 that each represent a viral species level population taxonomic information was added to the contigs database in anvi o using kaiju with the built in viral database menzel et al 2016 all individual assemblies were also compared with the nr and viral refseq protein databases version jan 2018 separately in case the length thresholds for contig database creation excluded certain virus types to compare the incidence and abundance of uvigs in the different samples for each library the reads were mapped to the contigs database using kallisto bray et al 2016 the abundances of contigs within and between samples were assessed by transforming the values into transcript per million values tpms where each contig uvig was considered a transcript using the program tximport in r soneson et al 2016 the resulting 10 149 by 58 matrix was visualised with phantasus zenkova et al 2018 the pseudobam alignment files generated by kallisto were then transformed into anvi o profiles according to the metagenomics workflow instructions and investigated using the anvi interactive interface eren et al 2015 numbers of species detected per library sample or sample type were calculated as the number of uvigs having a tpm value of minimum 10 venn diagrams were produced on the online webserver http bioinformatics psb ugent be webtools venn hosted by the vib ugent center for plant systems biology the taxonomic classifications by kaiju as part of the anvi o platform left over 5000 uvigs unclassified we then used diamond blastx against the viral refseq protein database version 200 may 2020 and megan 6 community edition to assign all uvigs to their most reliable taxonomic rank using the megan 6 long read lowest common ancestor algorithm at the default settings buchfink et al 2015 huson and weber 2013 the taxonomic bin information was added to the phantasus heatmaps by matching the uvig names and exported to r studio using the tidyverse packages to create graphs in ggplot2 wickham 2016 wickham et al 2019 to generate phylogenetic trees of taxonomic groups of interest we used the megan 6 taxonomic bins all uvigs assigned to a bin were annotated with prokka seemann 2014 using the kingdom viruses setting and the predicted cdss were manually curated in ugene okonechnikov et al 2012 to adjust for the presence of polyproteins and missing start or stop codons from incomplete genomes per rna virus taxonomic group the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp amino acid sequences were extracted and aligned together with rdrp sequences from reference databases using mafft with maximum 5 iterations katoh and standley 2013 the resulting alignments were trimmed with trimal capella gutiérrez et al 2009 using the gappyout setting followed by manual inspection in the ugene alignment viewer sequences missing the conserved structural motifs present in rdrps venkataraman et al 2018 were removed as were sequences missing more than 50 of the trimmed sites trees were computed using the iq tree suite nguyen et al 2015 including calculation of the best substitution model with modelfinder kalyaanamoorthy et al 2017 calculation of the approximate likelihood ratio test 1000 repetitions anisimova et al 2011 and ultrafast bootstrap approximation with ufboot2 1000 repetitions hoang et al 2018 the resulting trees were analysed and annotated in itol letunic and bork 2007 for the picorna calici tree the alignments generated by shi and colleagues were additionally used as references shi et al 2018 2016 rotavirus segment genotyping was performed on the rotac 2 0 webserver of the rega institute ku leuven belgium maes et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 viral species richness is environment specific and geographically distinct we generated a final species level contig database containing 10 149 votus from 44 897 assembled contigs each represented by the longest viral genome uvig we used the number of votus per sample normalised per volume ml or wet weight g of input material as an approximation of species richness fig 1 normalised viral otu species richness was highest in the shellfish digestive tissue and beach sediment samples intermediate in wastewater influent and effluent and lowest in the surface water samples the surface river water samples showed a trend of increasing viral richness moving downstream as further inputs of wastewater from treatment plants and other anthropogenic sources occurred reaching a plateau around the location of sw3 after which richness remained high fig 1 we further investigated the differential patterns of abundance of each uvig in each library by mapping reads of all samples against the votu database and visualised the data with anvi o fig 2 supplementary fig 1 to identify 13 categories of viral species abundance and composition patterns table 1 the wastewater samples contained the most diverse set of uvigs in absolute numbers however each wastewater treatment plant yielded a geographically distinct viral community the river water samples contained a lower absolute richness of viruses than the wastewater except for sample sw5 and to a lesser extent sw3 which showed a high degree of overlap in uvigs from category 1 with the wastewater influent sample from the tal y bont treatment plant rna ti fig 2 many of the same uvigs in this category 1 were also detected in the mussel shellfish samples and in the sediment samples comparing this pattern with the geographical origin of the samples fig 1 revealed that the river water upstream and distant from wastewater effluent locations contained fewer detectable virus species while the locations immediately downstream of an effluent pipe sw3 or in the tidal estuary sw5 mussels beach sediment were enriched for uvigs the high virus richness in the tidal estuary sw5 can be explained by the mixing of river and marine waters during tidal flow robins et al 2019 the sw5 wastewater treatment combined sewage outflow cso periodically discharges untreated sewage directly upstream of sw5 representing a sewage input that largely avoids the dilution effect of estuary water and is consistent with the higher detection of faecal indicator bacteria previously at this location perkins et al 2014 the viral species count per sample fig 1 also demonstrated that wastewater effluent samples mean 1287 generally had a lower species tally than influent mean 2079 indicating that wastewater treatment reduced viral species richness but the large variance and limited number of samples n 4 per group did not allow for meaningful tests of statistical significance examination of uvigs grouped per environment type for shared viral species cut off for detection 10 tpm transcripts per million see methods confirmed our observation that absolute richness was highest in wastewater samples 2692 unique votus fig 3 a river estuarine water 82 unique uvigs mussels 137 and sediment 100 all contained an order of magnitude fewer unique votus the majority of the votus present in mussels and sediment were shared with wastewater out of 4692 votus detected in mussels 3917 were also detected in wastewater 83 and for sediment this was 1464 out of 1944 75 fig 3a even though most of these votus were likely bacteriophages the high connectivity of these environments is a cause for concern indicating potential sources of contamination that pose a risk to human health and is investigated in more detail below the categories of votus in wastewater encompassed all virus types detected in this study table 1 whereas those specific to mussel shellfish and sediment comprised primarily rna viruses in the materials and methods sequencing section we describe technical difficulties during sequencing library construction that may have resulted in the underestimation or even failure to detect a group of mussel and sediment specific dna viruses in order to assign each uvig to a viral family and higher taxa we used a combination of diamond blastx against the viral refseq protein database version 200 may 2020 and taxonomic binning using a lowest common ancestor approach with megan6 buchfink et al 2015 huson and weber 2013 to reduce the number of different taxa displayed in figure 3b we assigned the uvigs at class or phylum level recently defined by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv gorbalenya et al 2020 koonin et al 2020 and where this was not unambiguously possible at the realm level with the remainder designated as either viruses similarities to viruses belonging to multiple realms or unknown no similarity with any virus in the refseq database of all contigs in our set 98 had at least one blast hit with the virus database 9935 10 149 and 88 8904 10 149 were assigned to at least the viral realm level the taxonomic composition of each library fig 3b normalised to 1 million reads per sample mapped to the uvigs showed large differences in relative abundances of virus groups between both library types and samples scanning these data confirms the observation from figure 2 that some of the rna libraries were contaminated with dna viruses in these cases all rna river water libraries and rna ti rna bi rna tyca b rna cp1 2 cs1 the relative abundance of dsdna viruses mainly tailed phages of the class caudoviricetes eclipsed the detected rna virus signatures the remainder of the rna libraries recruited the most reads against several groups of rna viruses such as the phage class leviviricetes formerly family leviviridae phylum lenarviricota and unknown rna virus uvigs realm riboviria from a previously published study on the rna virosphere of invertebrates shi et al 2016 the majority of the dna libraries were dominated by dsdna bacteriophages associated with the class caudoviricetes and its constituent families exceptions were libraries dna ti and dna le which were dominated by a small number of uvigs with ambiguous taxon assignments i e classified as viruses or unknown the read recruitment to the uvigs and their taxonomic binning clearly showed discrepancies between some of the replicates most notably the rna libraries of the shellfish digestive tissue samples these differences are in line with a recent study by pérez cataluña and colleagues who investigated library preparations for viromes of wastewater and showed that further standardisation of methods is necessary for quantitative viromics pérez cataluña et al 2021 in view of these discrepancies in read mapping patterns between replicates we investigated the taxonomic bins per environment type as an indication for richness not relative abundance supplementary fig 2 overall the most common rna virus classification was the uvig rna virus bin grouped within the realm riboviria comprising a diverse set of metagenome assembled rna viruses dsrna ssrna ssrna from invertebrates shi et al 2016 which contained the most uvigs from mussels sediment and wastewater samples the most abundant dna virus bin was the class caudoviricetes which groups all tailed phages of the order caudovirales and its constituent families myoviridae siphoviridae podoviridae ackermannviridae autographiviridae drexlerviridae herelleviridae including crass like phages and unidentified dsdna viruses probably tailed bacteriophages which were particularly rich in wastewater river water and to a lesser extent in mussels wastewater was also host to a diverse group of ssrna phages of the class leviviricetes 700 uvigs with a smaller number of these viruses observed in mussels and sediment about 6 of the total reads could not be assigned to a known group not even at the realm level and were categorized as unknown viruses while these unknown viruses represented only 6 of the total reads they made up about a third 3 502 10 149 of the votus 3 2 circulating human pathogens sapovirus coxsackievirus and rotavirus to investigate the potential environmental and public health impact of the uvigs we focused on the near complete genomes shared between wastewater and the other environments fig 3a and the taxonomic groups that contain known pathogens human animal we identified 29 votus of potential public health concern further representing 73 uvigs from six families table 2 interestingly we were unable to unambiguously identify any potentially pathogenic dsdna uvigs the ability to reconstruct a complete papillomavirus genome in our pilot study from a subset of these sites sampled at an earlier date adriaenssens et al 2018 suggests that there were in fact no predicted pathogenic dna viruses circulating above the limit of detection in the conwy catchment at the time of sampling june 2017 we speculate that the most likely reason for the absence of potentially pathogenic dna viruses from the dataset is because their presence was below the limit of detection with the discovery of the papillomavirus in the pilot study potentially due to a large shedding event it is also possible that the diversity of dsdna bacteriophages drives up the limit of detection for other dna viruses by skewing the data towards the most abundant genomes given the current pandemic we also did a search for similarity of the uvig dataset with members of the coronaviridae family but no coronavirus signatures were identified in our dataset with respect to the family astroviridae we recovered one uvig related to bat infecting astroviruses in mussel mytilus edulis tissue from the deganwy shellfishery and one uvig in wastewater sample gi highly similar to astrovirus mlb1 fj222451 which was sequenced from the stool of a child with acute diarrhoea finkbeiner et al 2008 supplementary fig 3a for the family caliciviridae we were not able to identify any uvigs representing noroviruses the leading cause of viral gastro intestinal illness in the uk and indeed worldwide ahmed et al 2014 fsa 2017 kirk et al 2015 in contrast to our pilot study performed in autumn where we assembled a norovirus gi 2 genome adriaenssens et al 2018 we did however find two near complete sapovirus uvigs and six shorter contigs grouped with the near complete genomes fig 3 supplementary fig 3b most closely related to sapoviruses of genotype gii 2 and gii 5 that were collected from children with acute gastroenteritis in nashville us diez valcarce et al 2018 this finding suggests that at the time of sampling for the dataset reported here june 2017 sapoviruses replaced noroviruses commonly associated with winter illness as the main cause of gastro intestinal disease this theory is supported by our previous rt qpcr detection study showing that sapovirus concentrations spiked between march and june in wastewater collected at the four wwtps in the conwy area farkas et al 2018a however this is difficult to formally prove as many norovirus sapovirus cases are undiagnosed clinically and the seasonality of norovirus and sapovirus is not consistent in all clinical settings in the uk brown et al 2016 inns et al 2019 we identified two potentially pathogenic uvigs in the picornaviridae family table 2 among a host of distantly related picorna like viruses fig 4 the two potentially pathogenic picornavirus uvigs which were represented by only partial genome sequences supplementary fig 3c could be identified as coxsackieviruses of the species enterovirus c most closely related to human coxsackieviruses a19 and a22 reportedly involved in meningitis gastroenteritis and herpangina tapparel et al 2013 zell et al 2017 detailed phylogenetic analysis of all calici and picorna like rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp sequences fig 4 showed that the majority of uvigs found in this study fell within a very diverse ill resolved clade low branch support comprised of environmental sequences nested within the order picornavirales bottom half of circle fig 4 based on the rdrp sequences only three uvigs in the picorna calici group were designated potential human pathogens fig 4 black arrows the two sapovirus uvigs and one of the coxsackievirus uvigs only the sapovirus uvig li node 9 was detected in all sample types posing a potential risk for human health as it was detected in the mussel beds of the commercial shellfishery sediment on the tourist beach and estuarine water supplementary fig 4 pcr based detection of sapoviruses in older studies show that among cases of gastro intestinal disease sapoviruses accounted for only 4 of cases vs 36 for noroviruses amar et al 2007 however the primers used in that study sr80 noel et al 1997 jv33 vinjé et al 2000 did not match the two sapovirus genomes reconstructed in this study data not shown the detection of this complete genome sequence from two different wastewater treatment plants is another indication that sapoviruses are more common in the uk than previously reported similar to its incidence reported in other countries mann and liebert 2019 pang et al 2019 varela et al 2018 while the phylogenetic analysis does not provide enough evidence for the presence of plant pathogenic picorna like viruses in the conwy river catchment there is a set of uvigs present that is mollusc specific coloured orange in figure 4 it is therefore likely that we have sequenced and reconstructed a set of mussel shellfish associated or infecting viruses within the non redundant species level clustered dataset 18 uvigs grouped into three categories according to read recruitment pattern and were assigned to the species rotavirus a in the family reoviridae representing a further 41 contigs analysis of reoviruses is confounded by their segmented nature i e members of the genus rotavirus contain 11 segments of dsrna and the size of the smaller segments is below our 1000 nt contig length threshold we therefore analysed all contigs larger than 500 nt for the presence of rotavirus signatures and assigned genotypes to each segment recovered fig 5 a the most common rotavirus a rva genome constellation recovered was g2 p 4 i2 r2 c2 m2 a2 n2 t2 e2 with additional genotypes r1 for the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp segment c1 for the segment encoding vp2 p 1 and p 14 for the outer capsid encoding segment a3 and a11 for nsp1 and t6 for nsp2 in many of the wastewater samples we assembled multiple contigs of the same segment indicating the presence of several co circulating population lineages of rotavirus a in the population phylogenetic analysis of the outer capsid proteins vp4 confirmed the genotype clustering and comparison with isolated rotavirus vp4 sequences points towards a human origin for the p 4 and p 14 genotypes found in samples be li le and gi and a potential bovine zoonotic origin for the p 1 genotype segment fig 5b the rva genome segments recovered here are markedly different to those recovered from wastewater influent from llanrwst le li in our pilot study 10 months prior adriaenssens et al 2018 for which the dominant genotypes of rva were g8 g10 p 1 p 14 p 41 and a diverse set of rotavirus c segments were also present we can conclude that rotavirus shedding into wastewater within the population varied both spatially and temporally but more data are required to investigate any possible seasonal patterns from the distribution of the rotavirus fragments in shellfish beach sediment and estuarine water table 2 we speculate that rotaviruses could pose a potential risk for human health in relation to shellfish consumption or recreational activities and bathing within the immediate coastal zone however rotaviruses mainly affect infants and children under the age of five hamborsky et al 2015 who are less likely to engage with such activities which may be the reason for the lack of reported illnesses we identified a number of small contigs related to ssdna circular circoviruses and parvoviruses that were originally recovered from environmental or host associated metagenomes dayaram et al 2015 phan et al 2015 zawar reza et al 2014 of these four circovirus associated votus representing 18 contigs showed significant sequence similarity to previously described uvigs from animal or wastewater metagenomes one parvovirus contig assigned to the genus ambidensovirus was related to a bat metagenome sequence however for these types of ssdna virus uvigs any causative links with disease syndromes would be very tenuous 3 3 a conceptual model for virus circulation in a freshwater catchment area the data presented in this study support the following conceptual model of virus circulation in the river system fig 6 upstream in the more pristine regions of the river with low human and livestock inputs viral species richness is low and the water virome is dominated by dsdna tailed bacteriophages caudoviruses and a few algal viruses of the family phycodnaviridae at certain points along the river wastewater effluent from large treatment plants and smaller scale septic tank discharges enter the water this effluent is much less rich in viruses than untreated wastewater influent but can still contain over 1000 different viral species per litre the entire spectrum of viral diversity detected in this study is represented in effluent treated wastewater with dna and rna bacteriophages predicted to infect members of the human gut microbiome the most commonly detected groups caudoviruses leviviruses nucleo cytoplasmic large dna virus ncldvs phycodnaviruses mimiviruses iridoviruses and common plant derived viruses present in food and excreted by the human digestive tract mainly tobamoviruses such as pepper mild mottle virus rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 and groups of enteric viruses such as sapovirus rotavirus and astrovirus within a wider collection of unclassified rna viruses are also well represented these communities are both spatially and temporally distinct upon entering the river the pathogenic virus groups fall below the limit of detection by virome sequencing which can be attributed primarily to dilution by the river water however close to an effluent site and at the estuary that is under tidal control the number of viral species detected in water samples is much higher beach sediment and filter feeding shellfish in this case mussels mytilus edulis then act as entrapment matrices enriching the viral content from the surrounding water maalouf et al 2010 whitman et al 2014 in the majority of cases the uvigs that were assembled from wastewater recruited fewer reads from beach sediment mussel tissue or estuary water libraries and the read mapping over the genome length was often patchy leading us to hypothesize that these genomes and by extension the virions are likely to be substantially degraded at the same time we observed sediment and mussel specific viral communities represented by full genomes mainly picorna like rna viruses and unclassified uvigs from invertebrates shi et al 2016 thus excluding technical bias as the explanantion for our failure to detect intact pathogenic virus genomes in sediment and shellfish in the scenario that we propose shellfish and sediment become enriched in viruses that are recruited from the environment by filter feeding and adsorption respectively those viruses that do not undergo active replication in the newly occupied niche human animal and plant pathogens in particular are degraded over time or diluted below the limit of detection while viruses that infect the shellfish the shellfish microbiome diatoms or sediment associated bacteria are maintained enabling detection of their full genome sequences in this scenario the risk of illness due to consumption of shellfish contact with sediment beach sand or swimming would depend on the time interval between uptake adsorption of pathogenic viruses in the matrix and ingestion by a human subject to critically evaluate this further experimental data on the infectivity survival kinetics for each viral species are required as this is likely to vary markedly between viral groups however this would be a herculean endeavour given the diversity of viruses detected here the difficulty in propagation and the absence of routine infectivity assays the conceptual model is supported by the results of our previous year long q rt pcr study on a subset of enteric viruses which showed that they were still detected at high titres in wastewater post treatment followed by lower titres in river water shellfish and sediment and ultimately undergoing capsid degradation in environmental matrices farkas et al 2018a our conceptual model of viral circulation is also consistent with theorectical simulations of viral discharge from wastewater treatment plants into the coastal zone robins et al 2019 importantly these models have indicated that tidal movement allows viruses in estuarine water to come into contact with shellfisheries and beaches on numerous occasions over a period of days to weeks depending on the lunar tidal cycle 4 conclusion viruses and their genetic material are commonly discharged in the environment but their risk to human health is driven by community outbreaks leading to viral shedding into the wastewater leading to temporal and spatial variations in the specific genotypes detected in the environment these viruses are then subject to cycles of dilution enrichment and virion degradation influenced by local geography weather events and tidal effects our analyses show that viromics is a useful tool to assess viral diversity in the aquatic environment in order to explore new and emerging human and animal health threats availability of data and material the datasets generated and

16746,the discharge of wastewater derived viruses in aquatic environments impacts catchment scale virome composition to explore this we used viromic analysis of rna and dna virus like particles to holistically track virus communities entering and leaving wastewater treatment plants and the connecting river catchment system and estuary we reconstructed 40 000 partial viral genomes into 10 149 species level groups dominated by dsdna and ssrna bacteriophages caudoviricetes and leviviricetes and a small number of genomes that could pose a risk to human health we found substantial viral diversity and geographically distinct virus communities associated with different wastewater treatment plants river and estuarine water bodies harboured more diverse viral communities in downstream locations influenced by tidal movement and proximity to wastewater treatment plants shellfish and beach sand were enriched in viral communities when compared with the surrounding water acting as entrapment matrices for virus particles extensive phylogenetic analyses of environmental derived and reference sequences showed the presence of human associated sapovirus gii in all sample types multiple rotavirus a strains in wastewater and a diverse set of picorna like viruses associated with shellfish we conclude that wastewater derived viral genetic material is commonly deposited in the environment and can be traced throughout the freshwater marine continuum of the river catchment where it is influenced by local geography weather events and tidal effects our data illustrate the utility of viromic analyses for wastewater and environment based ecology and epidemiology and we present a conceptual model for the circulation of all types of viruses in a freshwater catchment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords viromics viral diversity wastewater viruses aquatic viruses shellfish viruses wastewater contamination virus ecology 1 introduction viruses are the most abundant biological entities in terrestrial and aquatic biomes but their origin distribution and potential to spread disease via watercourses is poorly understood roux et al 2020 previous research has demonstrated that wastewater contains a plethora of viruses including human pathogenic and zoonotic viruses and that wastewater treatment processes do not remove human viruses with sufficient efficacy da silva et al 2007 farkas et al 2018b fong et al 2010 girones et al 2010 gomes et al 2019 gulino et al 2020 hellmér et al 2014 kitajima et al 2014 prado et al 2019 qiu et al 2015 sidhu et al 2017 viral abundance behaviour infectivity and fate remain poorly understood because of knowledge gaps in the ecology and connectivity of viromes across human populations and the freshwater marine continuum the current gold standard method for investigating enteric viruses in the environment is q rt pcr a technique that provides reliable quantitative information on the presence of the genomic material of target viruses but requires prior knowledge on the identity of the virus and its genome sequence farkas et al 2020 2017b as qpcr based assays only detect a fragment of the genome the question of virus integrity and hence infectivity remains open infectivity assays can offer a solution but even where available require specialised cultivation systems and are not likely to become generally applicable for routine monitoring of public health risks dicaprio 2017 as a more comprehensive and now potentially feasible alternative we applied shotgun viromics i e next generation sequencing of the entire aquatic virome to reconstruct full virus genomes from the environment and objectively scrutinise the ecological and health implications of virus diversity and geographical distribution with minimal bias virome analyses are transforming our understanding of viral diversity and function in the biosphere emerson et al 2018 gregory et al 2020 roux et al 2016 and provide unprecedented opportunity to understand the connectivity and fate of human derived viruses at the catchment scale here we present the first integrated analysis of the full virome of a

and methods 2 1 sample collection this work builds on our pilot study of a single wastewater treatment plant and a downstream water and sediment sampling site in which we optimised methods and showed that we could reconstruct rna virus genomes from environmental samples adriaenssens et al 2018 we collected and processed four different types of samples for this study wastewater influent and effluent surface water river and estuarine sediment and shellfish in june 2017 from the conwy river catchment area located in north wales uk fig 1 supplementary table 1 wastewater influent was collected from the four major treatment plants in the catchment and the corresponding effluent from three the ganol plant effluent pipe exits directly into the open sea and therefore was not sampled separately one litre per sample surface water was collected in four biological replicates of 50 l resulting in two replicates per library type rna and dna based at two locations one in the river and one at a major recreational beach sediment samples were taken in 4 biological replicates of at least 50 g two replicates per library type at low tide samples were scooped from an accessible part of the river bank into sterile bags using a sterilised spade finally mussels mytilus edulis were collected from the two main commercial shellfishery locations in the estuary and divided into eight pseudoreplicates as described below samples were collected at low tides enabling the collection of shellfish samples from shore without a boat 2 2 sample processing the wastewater 1 l and surface water 50 l samples were concentrated using a two step protocol involving tangential flow ultrafiltration tfuf and beef extract elution as described in detail previously farkas et al 2018c briefly sample volumes were reduced to 50 ml by tfuf on a krosflo research iii tangential flow filtration system spectrum labs phoenix az usa cat no syr u20 01n using a 100 kda cut off mpes minikros hollow fibre filter spectrum labs virus particles were eluted using beef extract and nano3 to a final concentration of 3 and 2 m ph 5 5 respectively after the solution s ph was adjusted to 7 5 peg 6000 was added to a final concentration of 15 with 2 nacl incubated overnight at 4 c and after centrifugation 30 min 10 000 x g 4 c the pellet was resuspended in 10 15 ml pbs ph 7 4 these suspensions were kept at 80 c until nucleic acid extraction the sediment samples were processed using beef extract elution and peg 6000 precipitation as above and described previously farkas et al 2017a for the mussel samples approximately 200 mussels were collected from each location and stored on ice each mussel was dissected and the digestive tissue extracted and minced with a scalpel the tissue was pooled per location and then divided into four pseudoreplicates two replicates per location were mixed with sm buffer 0 1 m nacl 50 mm tris hcl ph 7 4 10 mm mgso4 and two with pbs at 25 g of digestive tissue to 20 ml of buffer the samples were then shaken for 30 minutes 150 rpm at room temperature to dissociate viral particles from the digestive tissue after which they were stored at 80 c due to a limit on the number of shellfish collected we used both pbs and sm buffer as we could not perform a pre optimisation of the protocol no systematic differences between the two methods were detected 2 3 rna extraction wastewater surface water and sediment concentrates were processed as follows the concentrates were diluted in an equal volume 0 5 m nacl to improve dissociation of viral particles before filtration after centrifugation 5 min 3200 x g the supernatant was filtered through a 0 2 µm sterile syringe filter millipore the filtrate was further concentrated using vivaspin 20 spin filters 100 kda and centrifugation at 3200 x g once the volume was below 1 ml 5 ml tris buffer 5 mm trishcl 5 mm mgso4 75 mm nacl ph 7 5 was added and the volume reduced two times to reduce the nacl content of the virus suspension centrifugation times ranged between 150 minutes and 20 hours to reduce the volume below 500 µl for the next step a dnase treatment with 10 u turbo dnase invitrogen was performed to remove extra viral dna incubation at 37 c for 30 min inactivation at 75 c for 10 min mussel samples were highly viscous and required separate processing as we were unable to filter or concentrate with the vivaspin filters instead 2 1 ml aliquots per replicate were mixed with 0 1 mm glass beads mobio and lysed in a powerlyser mobio shaker 2 30 seconds at 3400 rpm debris was removed by centrifugation 5 min at 3200 x g and the supernatant was stored at 20 c for next day processing for all sample types the viral capsids were lysed using a combination of proteinase k 50 µg for clear samples 100 µg for turbid samples edta 0 5 m final concentration and sds 0 5 final concentration and incubation for one hour at 56 c next the rna was extracted by trizol extraction derived from kroger and colleagues kroger et al 2012 in short 500 µl of sample was mixed with 1 ml of trizol reagent and 200 µl of molecular grade chloroform in phasemakertm tubes invitrogen shaken vigorously and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13 000 x g the aqueous phase was removed and transferred to a new tube the phase separation was repeated for samples that remained turbid the nucleic acid was recovered by isopropanol precipitation and resuspended in 50 µl of sterile rnase free water viral dna was removed with an additional dnase step adding 4 u turbo dnase 5 µl td buffer and incubating for 40 minutes at 37 c followed by inactivation of the dnase at 75 c for 10 minutes the dnase was removed by a second isopropanol precipitation as above the rna resuspended in 50 µl of rnase free water and stored at 80 c until sequencing alongside all samples a positive extraction control comprising of salmonella cells salmonella enterica subsp enterica serovar typhimurium strain d23580 refseq acc nc 016854 and the process control virus mengovirus 105 particles ml was extracted as was a negative tris buffer control 2 4 dna extraction wastewater surface water and sediment samples were processed similarly as for rna extraction with a few amendments to the extraction process the samples were diluted in 10 ml nacl 0 5 m for surface water and sediment samples one replicate designated a was treated with chloroform 1 ml to lyse the cellular fraction 15 min incubation with gentle shaking and the cellular debris removed by centrifugation 5 min 3200 x g the second replicate b was filtered through a 0 45 µm sterile syringe filter millipore for the wastewater samples which consisted of only one replicate the sample was split in two half treated with chloroform and half filtered and then merged all samples were then concentrated and desalted as described above using vivaspin 20 spin filters 100 kda and centrifugation at 3200 x g with centrifugation time between 100 min and 20h all sample concentrates approx 500 µl each were treated with 10 u of turbo dnase invitrogen and 10 µg of rnase a thermo fisher scientific supplemented with turbo dnase buffer for 30 min at 37 c and inactivation at 65 c for 10 min the separation of filtering and chloroform treatment before proteinase and nuclease treatment theoretically allows for the recovery of both giant viruses larger than the filter pore size and viruses with lipid membranes while simultaneously reducing the background cellular dna no differences between treatments were found for potentially pathogenic viruses however the systematic comparison of methods for all viruses is beyond the scope of this study and we encourage others to use our data for further exploration mussel digestive tissue was processed exactly as during rna extraction mixed with 0 1 mm glass beads and lysed in powerlyzer and no nuclease treatment was performed from this point all samples were extracted in the same manner capsids were lysed by adding proteinase k 50 µg ml final concentration edta 20 mm final concentration and sds 0 5 final concentration followed by incubation at 56 c for one hour and extracted using phenol chloroform isoamylalcohol 25 24 1 in phaselock tubes vwr the aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and the process was repeated at least once twice for turbid samples followed by one round of chloroform phase separation finally samples were further cleaned and concentrated with ethanol precipitation 2 5 x volume 100 ethanol 1 10 volume 3 m naac ph 5 incubation at 20 c for 30 minutes precipitation 30 min at 15 000 x g 4 c washed with 70 ethanol and air dried in a laminar flow cabinet in tandem with the whole process control samples were extracted starting with the dilution in nacl we used a

nbaf facilities at the university of liverpool uk rna libraries were prepared as in the pilot study adriaenssens et al 2018 using the nebnext ultra directional rna library preparation kit of illumina with dual indexes during library preparation the number of pcr cycles was increased to 30 to account for the low amounts of input rna 1 ng dual indexed dna libraries were generated using the nebnext ultra ii dna library prep kit according to the manufacturer s instructions libraries were pooled and sequenced on six lanes of the illumina hiseq 4000 generating paired end 2 150 bp reads three lanes for the rna libraries in july 2017 and three lanes for the dna libraries in march 2018 the dna sequencing run failed for libraries dna sw2a dna tyca b dna sba b and unfortunately we were unable to reconstruct the libraries as the samples had been mistakenly stored at 4 c and the dna had degraded furthermore the read lengths obtained for the mussel dna libraries were much lower as for all other libraries as the dna had been excessively sheared during the extraction procedure 2 6 in silico processing reads went through an initial round of quality control at cgr to remove illumina adapters cutadapt version 1 2 1 o 3 and were trimmed with sickle version 1 2 removing all reads below an average quality of 20 and shorter than 20 bp joshi and fass 2011 martin 2011 the resulting fastq files were received as raw read files from the cgr and deposited into sra under bioproject prjna509142 accession numbers srr8299359 to srr8299398 the paired end read files were further trimmed and filtered to increase quality using the prinseq lite suite schmieder and edwards 2011 and the read pairs meeting the following criteria were retained minimum length 35 bases gc content between 5 and 95 maximum 1 n trimmed until the average read quality was 30 for all exactly duplicated reads only one copy was retained the reads for the control libraries were merged per library type rna dna and used as a bowtie2 mapping reference langmead and salzberg 2012 each of the sample libraries was then mapped against its control and only the unmapped reads were retained these reads were then assembled per

001 were removed from each of the sample contig datasets camacho et al 2009 from these contigs an anvi o contig database was created according to the instructions of the metagenomics workflow eren et al 2015 to be included in the database contigs needed to meet the following criteria rna library assemblies i contig length min 1000 nucleotides nt ii amino acid similarity with any known virus iii recruit no reads from control libraries dna library assemblies i contig length min 10 000 nt ii identified by virsorter as viral in categories 1 or 2 roux et al 2015 iii recruit no reads from control libraries virsorter was run on all dna contig sets using the microbiome decontamination mode on the ivirus cyverse infrastructure bolduc et al 2017 the contig dataset comprising 40 000 uvigs was merged and clustered at an approximation of the viral species level 95 average nucleotide identity over min 80 of contig length according to the species definition for bacteriophages implemented by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv and conventionally used in virome studies adriaenssens and brister 2017 emerson et al 2018 gregory et al 2016 roux et al 2019 2016 we performed a final refinement by removing all contigs 10 000 nt assembled from rna libraries that showed amino acid similarity with dsdna viruses based on diamond blastx comparison buchfink et al 2015 with the nr database downloaded from the ncbi in january 2018 the final database contained 10 149 uvigs uncultivated viral genomes roux et al 2019 that each represent a viral species level population taxonomic information was added to the contigs database in anvi o using kaiju with the built in viral database menzel et al 2016 all individual assemblies were also compared with the nr and viral refseq protein databases version jan 2018 separately in case the length thresholds for contig database creation excluded certain virus types to compare the incidence and abundance of uvigs in the different samples for each library the reads were mapped to the contigs database using kallisto bray et al 2016 the abundances of contigs within and between samples were assessed by transforming the values into transcript per million values tpms where each contig uvig was considered a transcript using the program tximport in r soneson et al 2016 the resulting 10 149 by 58 matrix was visualised with phantasus zenkova et al 2018 the pseudobam alignment files generated by kallisto were then transformed into anvi o profiles according to the metagenomics workflow instructions and investigated using the anvi interactive interface eren et al 2015 numbers of species detected per library sample or sample type were calculated as the number of uvigs having a tpm value of minimum 10 venn diagrams were produced on the online webserver http bioinformatics psb ugent be webtools venn hosted by the vib ugent center for plant systems biology the taxonomic classifications by kaiju as part of the anvi o platform left over 5000 uvigs unclassified we then used diamond blastx against the viral refseq protein database version 200 may 2020 and megan 6 community edition to assign all uvigs to their most reliable taxonomic rank using the megan 6 long read lowest common ancestor algorithm at the default settings buchfink et al 2015 huson and weber 2013 the taxonomic bin information was added to the phantasus heatmaps by matching the uvig names and exported to r studio using the tidyverse packages to create graphs in ggplot2 wickham 2016 wickham et al 2019 to generate phylogenetic trees of taxonomic groups of interest we used the megan 6 taxonomic bins all uvigs assigned to a bin were annotated with prokka seemann 2014 using the kingdom viruses setting and the predicted cdss were manually curated in ugene okonechnikov et al 2012 to adjust for the presence of polyproteins and missing start or stop codons from incomplete genomes per rna virus taxonomic group the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp amino acid sequences were extracted and aligned together with rdrp sequences from reference databases using mafft with maximum 5 iterations katoh and standley 2013 the resulting alignments were trimmed with trimal capella gutiérrez et al 2009 using the gappyout setting followed by manual inspection in the ugene alignment viewer sequences missing the conserved structural motifs present in rdrps venkataraman et al 2018 were removed as were sequences missing more than 50 of the trimmed sites trees were computed using the iq tree suite nguyen et al 2015 including calculation of the best substitution model with modelfinder kalyaanamoorthy et al 2017 calculation of the approximate likelihood ratio test 1000 repetitions anisimova et al 2011 and ultrafast bootstrap approximation with ufboot2 1000 repetitions hoang et al 2018 the resulting trees were analysed and annotated in itol letunic and bork 2007 for the picorna calici tree the alignments generated by shi and colleagues were additionally used as references shi et al 2018 2016 rotavirus segment genotyping was performed on the rotac 2 0 webserver of the rega institute ku leuven belgium maes et al 2009 3 results and discussion 3 1 viral species richness is environment specific and geographically distinct we generated a final species level contig database containing 10 149 votus from 44 897 assembled contigs each represented by the longest viral genome uvig we used the number of votus per sample normalised per volume ml or wet weight g of input material as an approximation of species richness fig 1 normalised viral otu species richness was highest in the shellfish digestive tissue and beach sediment samples intermediate in wastewater influent and effluent and lowest in the surface water samples the surface river water samples showed a trend of increasing viral richness moving downstream as further inputs of wastewater from treatment plants and other anthropogenic sources occurred reaching a plateau around the location of sw3 after which richness remained high fig 1 we further investigated the differential patterns of abundance of each uvig in each library by mapping reads of all samples against the votu database and visualised the data with anvi o fig 2 supplementary fig 1 to identify 13 categories of viral species abundance and composition patterns table 1 the wastewater samples contained the most diverse set of uvigs in absolute numbers however each wastewater treatment plant yielded a geographically distinct viral community the river water samples contained a lower absolute richness of viruses than the wastewater except for sample sw5 and to a lesser extent sw3 which showed a high degree of overlap in uvigs from category 1 with the wastewater influent sample from the tal y bont treatment plant rna ti fig 2 many of the same uvigs in this category 1 were also detected in the mussel shellfish samples and in the sediment samples comparing this pattern with the geographical origin of the samples fig 1 revealed that the river water upstream and distant from wastewater effluent locations contained fewer detectable virus species while the locations immediately downstream of an effluent pipe sw3 or in the tidal estuary sw5 mussels beach sediment were enriched for uvigs the high virus richness in the tidal estuary sw5 can be explained by the mixing of river and marine waters during tidal flow robins et al 2019 the sw5 wastewater treatment combined sewage outflow cso periodically discharges untreated sewage directly upstream of sw5 representing a sewage input that largely avoids the dilution effect of estuary water and is consistent with the higher detection of faecal indicator bacteria previously at this location perkins et al 2014 the viral species count per sample fig 1 also demonstrated that wastewater effluent samples mean 1287 generally had a lower species tally than influent mean 2079 indicating that wastewater treatment reduced viral species richness but the large variance and limited number of samples n 4 per group did not allow for meaningful tests of statistical significance examination of uvigs grouped per environment type for shared viral species cut off for detection 10 tpm transcripts per million see methods confirmed our observation that absolute richness was highest in wastewater samples 2692 unique votus fig 3 a river estuarine water 82 unique uvigs mussels 137 and sediment 100 all contained an order of magnitude fewer unique votus the majority of the votus present in mussels and sediment were shared with wastewater out of 4692 votus detected in mussels 3917 were also detected in wastewater 83 and for sediment this was 1464 out of 1944 75 fig 3a even though most of these votus were likely bacteriophages the high connectivity of these environments is a cause for concern indicating potential sources of contamination that pose a risk to human health and is investigated in more detail below the categories of votus in wastewater encompassed all virus types detected in this study table 1 whereas those specific to mussel shellfish and sediment comprised primarily rna viruses in the materials and methods sequencing section we describe technical difficulties during sequencing library construction that may have resulted in the underestimation or even failure to detect a group of mussel and sediment specific dna viruses in order to assign each uvig to a viral family and higher taxa we used a combination of diamond blastx against the viral refseq protein database version 200 may 2020 and taxonomic binning using a lowest common ancestor approach with megan6 buchfink et al 2015 huson and weber 2013 to reduce the number of different taxa displayed in figure 3b we assigned the uvigs at class or phylum level recently defined by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses ictv gorbalenya et al 2020 koonin et al 2020 and where this was not unambiguously possible at the realm level with the remainder designated as either viruses similarities to viruses belonging to multiple realms or unknown no similarity with any virus in the refseq database of all contigs in our set 98 had at least one blast hit with the virus database 9935 10 149 and 88 8904 10 149 were assigned to at least the viral realm level the taxonomic composition of each library fig 3b normalised to 1 million reads per sample mapped to the uvigs showed large differences in relative abundances of virus groups between both library types and samples scanning these data confirms the observation from figure 2 that some of the rna libraries were contaminated with dna viruses in these cases all rna river water libraries and rna ti rna bi rna tyca b rna cp1 2 cs1 the relative abundance of dsdna viruses mainly tailed phages of the class caudoviricetes eclipsed the detected rna virus signatures the remainder of the rna libraries recruited the most reads against several groups of rna viruses such as the phage class leviviricetes formerly family leviviridae phylum lenarviricota and unknown rna virus uvigs realm riboviria from a previously published study on the rna virosphere of invertebrates shi et al 2016 the majority of the dna libraries were dominated by dsdna bacteriophages associated with the class caudoviricetes and its constituent families exceptions were libraries dna ti and dna le which were dominated by a small number of uvigs with ambiguous taxon assignments i e classified as viruses or unknown the read recruitment to the uvigs and their taxonomic binning clearly showed discrepancies between some of the replicates most notably the rna libraries of the shellfish digestive tissue samples these differences are in line with a recent study by pérez cataluña and colleagues who investigated library preparations for viromes of wastewater and showed that further standardisation of methods is necessary for quantitative viromics pérez cataluña et al 2021 in view of these discrepancies in read mapping patterns between replicates we investigated the taxonomic bins per environment type as an indication for richness not relative abundance supplementary fig 2 overall the most common rna virus classification was the uvig rna virus bin grouped within the realm riboviria comprising a diverse set of metagenome assembled rna viruses dsrna ssrna ssrna from invertebrates shi et al 2016 which contained the most uvigs from mussels sediment and wastewater samples the most abundant dna virus bin was the class caudoviricetes which groups all tailed phages of the order caudovirales and its constituent families myoviridae siphoviridae podoviridae ackermannviridae autographiviridae drexlerviridae herelleviridae including crass like phages and unidentified dsdna viruses probably tailed bacteriophages which were particularly rich in wastewater river water and to a lesser extent in mussels wastewater was also host to a diverse group of ssrna phages of the class leviviricetes 700 uvigs with a smaller number of these viruses observed in mussels and sediment about 6 of the total reads could not be assigned to a known group not even at the realm level and were categorized as unknown viruses while these unknown viruses represented only 6 of the total reads they made up about a third 3 502 10 149 of the votus 3 2 circulating human pathogens sapovirus coxsackievirus and rotavirus to investigate the potential environmental and public health impact of the uvigs we focused on the near complete genomes shared between wastewater and the other environments fig 3a and the taxonomic groups that contain known pathogens human animal we identified 29 votus of potential public health concern further representing 73 uvigs from six families table 2 interestingly we were unable to unambiguously identify any potentially pathogenic dsdna uvigs the ability to reconstruct a complete papillomavirus genome in our pilot study from a subset of these sites sampled at an earlier date adriaenssens et al 2018 suggests that there were in fact no predicted pathogenic dna viruses circulating above the limit of detection in the conwy catchment at the time of sampling june 2017 we speculate that the most likely reason for the absence of potentially pathogenic dna viruses from the dataset is because their presence was below the limit of detection with the discovery of the papillomavirus in the pilot study potentially due to a large shedding event it is also possible that the diversity of dsdna bacteriophages drives up the limit of detection for other dna viruses by skewing the data towards the most abundant genomes given the current pandemic we also did a search for similarity of the uvig dataset with members of the coronaviridae family but no coronavirus signatures were identified in our dataset with respect to the family astroviridae we recovered one uvig related to bat infecting astroviruses in mussel mytilus edulis tissue from the deganwy shellfishery and one uvig in wastewater sample gi highly similar to astrovirus mlb1 fj222451 which was sequenced from the stool of a child with acute diarrhoea finkbeiner et al 2008 supplementary fig 3a for the family caliciviridae we were not able to identify any uvigs representing noroviruses the leading cause of viral gastro intestinal illness in the uk and indeed worldwide ahmed et al 2014 fsa 2017 kirk et al 2015 in contrast to our pilot study performed in autumn where we assembled a norovirus gi 2 genome adriaenssens et al 2018 we did however find two near complete sapovirus uvigs and six shorter contigs grouped with the near complete genomes fig 3 supplementary fig 3b most closely related to sapoviruses of genotype gii 2 and gii 5 that were collected from children with acute gastroenteritis in nashville us diez valcarce et al 2018 this finding suggests that at the time of sampling for the dataset reported here june 2017 sapoviruses replaced noroviruses commonly associated with winter illness as the main cause of gastro intestinal disease this theory is supported by our previous rt qpcr detection study showing that sapovirus concentrations spiked between march and june in wastewater collected at the four wwtps in the conwy area farkas et al 2018a however this is difficult to formally prove as many norovirus sapovirus cases are undiagnosed clinically and the seasonality of norovirus and sapovirus is not consistent in all clinical settings in the uk brown et al 2016 inns et al 2019 we identified two potentially pathogenic uvigs in the picornaviridae family table 2 among a host of distantly related picorna like viruses fig 4 the two potentially pathogenic picornavirus uvigs which were represented by only partial genome sequences supplementary fig 3c could be identified as coxsackieviruses of the species enterovirus c most closely related to human coxsackieviruses a19 and a22 reportedly involved in meningitis gastroenteritis and herpangina tapparel et al 2013 zell et al 2017 detailed phylogenetic analysis of all calici and picorna like rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp sequences fig 4 showed that the majority of uvigs found in this study fell within a very diverse ill resolved clade low branch support comprised of environmental sequences nested within the order picornavirales bottom half of circle fig 4 based on the rdrp sequences only three uvigs in the picorna calici group were designated potential human pathogens fig 4 black arrows the two sapovirus uvigs and one of the coxsackievirus uvigs only the sapovirus uvig li node 9 was detected in all sample types posing a potential risk for human health as it was detected in the mussel beds of the commercial shellfishery sediment on the tourist beach and estuarine water supplementary fig 4 pcr based detection of sapoviruses in older studies show that among cases of gastro intestinal disease sapoviruses accounted for only 4 of cases vs 36 for noroviruses amar et al 2007 however the primers used in that study sr80 noel et al 1997 jv33 vinjé et al 2000 did not match the two sapovirus genomes reconstructed in this study data not shown the detection of this complete genome sequence from two different wastewater treatment plants is another indication that sapoviruses are more common in the uk than previously reported similar to its incidence reported in other countries mann and liebert 2019 pang et al 2019 varela et al 2018 while the phylogenetic analysis does not provide enough evidence for the presence of plant pathogenic picorna like viruses in the conwy river catchment there is a set of uvigs present that is mollusc specific coloured orange in figure 4 it is therefore likely that we have sequenced and reconstructed a set of mussel shellfish associated or infecting viruses within the non redundant species level clustered dataset 18 uvigs grouped into three categories according to read recruitment pattern and were assigned to the species rotavirus a in the family reoviridae representing a further 41 contigs analysis of reoviruses is confounded by their segmented nature i e members of the genus rotavirus contain 11 segments of dsrna and the size of the smaller segments is below our 1000 nt contig length threshold we therefore analysed all contigs larger than 500 nt for the presence of rotavirus signatures and assigned genotypes to each segment recovered fig 5 a the most common rotavirus a rva genome constellation recovered was g2 p 4 i2 r2 c2 m2 a2 n2 t2 e2 with additional genotypes r1 for the rna dependent rna polymerase rdrp segment c1 for the segment encoding vp2 p 1 and p 14 for the outer capsid encoding segment a3 and a11 for nsp1 and t6 for nsp2 in many of the wastewater samples we assembled multiple contigs of the same segment indicating the presence of several co circulating population lineages of rotavirus a in the population phylogenetic analysis of the outer capsid proteins vp4 confirmed the genotype clustering and comparison with isolated rotavirus vp4 sequences points towards a human origin for the p 4 and p 14 genotypes found in samples be li le and gi and a potential bovine zoonotic origin for the p 1 genotype segment fig 5b the rva genome segments recovered here are markedly different to those recovered from wastewater influent from llanrwst le li in our pilot study 10 months prior adriaenssens et al 2018 for which the dominant genotypes of rva were g8 g10 p 1 p 14 p 41 and a diverse set of rotavirus c segments were also present we can conclude that rotavirus shedding into wastewater within the population varied both spatially and temporally but more data are required to investigate any possible seasonal patterns from the distribution of the rotavirus fragments in shellfish beach sediment and estuarine water table 2 we speculate that rotaviruses could pose a potential risk for human health in relation to shellfish consumption or recreational activities and bathing within the immediate coastal zone however rotaviruses mainly affect infants and children under the age of five hamborsky et al 2015 who are less likely to engage with such activities which may be the reason for the lack of reported illnesses we identified a number of small contigs related to ssdna circular circoviruses and parvoviruses that were originally recovered from environmental or host associated metagenomes dayaram et al 2015 phan et al 2015 zawar reza et al 2014 of these four circovirus associated votus representing 18 contigs showed significant sequence similarity to previously described uvigs from animal or wastewater metagenomes one parvovirus contig assigned to the genus ambidensovirus was related to a bat metagenome sequence however for these types of ssdna virus uvigs any causative links with disease syndromes would be very tenuous 3 3 a conceptual model for virus circulation in a freshwater catchment area the data presented in this study support the following conceptual model of virus circulation in the river system fig 6 upstream in the more pristine regions of the river with low human and livestock inputs viral species richness is low and the water virome is dominated by dsdna tailed bacteriophages caudoviruses and a few algal viruses of the family phycodnaviridae at certain points along the river wastewater effluent from large treatment plants and smaller scale septic tank discharges enter the water this effluent is much less rich in viruses than untreated wastewater influent but can still contain over 1000 different viral species per litre the entire spectrum of viral diversity detected in this study is represented in effluent treated wastewater with dna and rna bacteriophages predicted to infect members of the human gut microbiome the most commonly detected groups caudoviruses leviviruses nucleo cytoplasmic large dna virus ncldvs phycodnaviruses mimiviruses iridoviruses and common plant derived viruses present in food and excreted by the human digestive tract mainly tobamoviruses such as pepper mild mottle virus rosario et al 2009 zhang et al 2006 and groups of enteric viruses such as sapovirus rotavirus and astrovirus within a wider collection of unclassified rna viruses are also well represented these communities are both spatially and temporally distinct upon entering the river the pathogenic virus groups fall below the limit of detection by virome sequencing which can be attributed primarily to dilution by the river water however close to an effluent site and at the estuary that is under tidal control the number of viral species detected in water samples is much higher beach sediment and filter feeding shellfish in this case mussels mytilus edulis then act as entrapment matrices enriching the viral content from the surrounding water maalouf et al 2010 whitman et al 2014 in the majority of cases the uvigs that were assembled from wastewater recruited fewer reads from beach sediment mussel tissue or estuary water libraries and the read mapping over the genome length was often patchy leading us to hypothesize that these genomes and by extension the virions are likely to be substantially degraded at the same time we observed sediment and mussel specific viral communities represented by full genomes mainly picorna like rna viruses and unclassified uvigs from invertebrates shi et al 2016 thus excluding technical bias as the explanantion for our failure to detect intact pathogenic virus genomes in sediment and shellfish in the scenario that we propose shellfish and sediment become enriched in viruses that are recruited from the environment by filter feeding and adsorption respectively those viruses that do not undergo active replication in the newly occupied niche human animal and plant pathogens in particular are degraded over time or diluted below the limit of detection while viruses that infect the shellfish the shellfish microbiome diatoms or sediment associated bacteria are maintained enabling detection of their full genome sequences in this scenario the risk of illness due to consumption of shellfish contact with sediment beach sand or swimming would depend on the time interval between uptake adsorption of pathogenic viruses in the matrix and ingestion by a human subject to critically evaluate this further experimental data on the infectivity survival kinetics for each viral species are required as this is likely to vary markedly between viral groups however this would be a herculean endeavour given the diversity of viruses detected here the difficulty in propagation and the absence of routine infectivity assays the conceptual model is supported by the results of our previous year long q rt pcr study on a subset of enteric viruses which showed that they were still detected at high titres in wastewater post treatment followed by lower titres in river water shellfish and sediment and ultimately undergoing capsid degradation in environmental matrices farkas et al 2018a our conceptual model of viral circulation is also consistent with theorectical simulations of viral discharge from wastewater treatment plants into the coastal zone robins et al 2019 importantly these models have indicated that tidal movement allows viruses in estuarine water to come into contact with shellfisheries and beaches on numerous occasions over a period of days to weeks depending on the lunar tidal cycle 4 conclusion viruses and their genetic material are commonly discharged in the environment but their risk to human health is driven by community outbreaks leading to viral shedding into the wastewater leading to temporal and spatial variations in the specific genotypes detected in the environment these viruses are then subject to cycles of dilution enrichment and virion degradation influenced by local geography weather events and tidal effects our analyses show that viromics is a useful tool to assess viral diversity in the aquatic environment in order to explore new and emerging human and animal health threats availability of data and material the datasets generated and

fight to track and contain covid 19 spread within communities one of the motives behind covid 19 wbe efforts is the potential for early warning of either the onset of disease in a new setting or

the number of active shedders from wbe data zhu et al 2021 here we consider the factors influencing the potential of wbe to serve as an early warning system of disease trends and establish the constraints around when it may serve this role factors influencing wbe covid 19 early detection the goal of the current analysis is to establish a simplified framework to critique the early warning potential of wbe for community level covid 19 monitoring applications there remains significant variability in time to results for both clinical and wbe testing among communities that may impact signal interpretation and reporting time potential sources of this variability include the role of asymptomatic transmitters of disease genetic signal decay during wastewater transport through collection systems and the efficiency sensitivity of both the clinical and wbe analytical workflows our objective here is not to build a comprehensive quantitative model but rather a framework to interpret previous claims concerning the early warning potential for wbe ultimately accurate presentation and reporting of the technical potential of wbe to identify community disease trends are essential for sustained and continued technical development of wbe applications early detection as applied to covid 19 wbe implies the successful detection and reporting of covid 19 trends prior to their detection and reporting by clinical surveillance early detection via wbe may be driven by two distinct but potentially related factors the first factor is the analysis time differential of wbe and clinical testing results factors influencing the response time of clinical testing and reporting have been well documented ahmed et al 2020 delays inherent to wbe analyses have been less well reported importantly many wbe results are back dated to sampled collection date during trend analysis without further consideration of sample processing time i e when the result was actually reported this reporting differential is critical for wbe results to provide an actionable lead time the second early detection factor is the excretion of sars cov 2 rna in the stool of infected individuals prior to either nasal viral shedding or symptom onset and the subsequent clinical detection in this instance wastewater monitoring has the potential to detect covid 19 cases before it would be likely for these cases to be clinically detected delays in wbe data reporting similar to delays in clinical diagnostic reporting for covid 19 there are potential delays in reporting wbe results that influence the relative ability of wbe to precede clinical testing results delay in this context refers to the time differential between the shedding of the viral signal in stool and the reporting of the positive sars cov 2 signal in wastewater while many studies have back dated wbe results to the date of sample collection to describe the early warning potential here we describe the factors driving time to initial result reporting prerequisite to any public health decision making the first consideration is the time from viral excretion in stool to laboratory receipt of the wastewater sample depending on system configuration wastewater may have significant travel time within the collection system prior to arrival at the wastewater treatment plant or other sampling location with literature reports of wastewater travel times as high as 35 hours through collection systems d aoust mercier et al 2021 although this time may be reduced at sub sewershed sampling locations in addition composite wastewater sampling is often employed to capture temporal variability in the virus genetic signal composite sampling is most commonly performed in 24 hour increments in this sampling scheme subsamples collected early in the 24 hour collection period will be further delayed by this compositing period prior to analysis following collection samples may need to be shipped from the collection site to the laboratory adding additional delay prior to analysis considering all of these factors the period between initial viral excretion and sample receipt by the analysis laboratory may be as high as two or more days in current sample collection workflows we note that there is potential viral rna decay as well during sample collection and transport so in addition to delaying sample reporting this delay may also alter reporting accuracy ahmed et al 2020 bivins et al 2020 the second consideration is processing time in the laboratory typical analytical workflows include sample concentration nucleic acid extraction and pcr based nucleic acid quantification while there are approaches to make sample concentration more rapid e g the recent analysis by laturner et al laturner et al 2021 the overall workflow is limited by the time required for nucleic acid extraction and pcr thermal cycling in addition some laboratories do not analyze samples until there is a sufficient batch size to reduce personnel and analytical burden and costs further delaying results reporting considering all of these factors current standard sample collection and analytical workflows are reasonably capable of producing wbe results in one to three days following viral excretion in stool but under some analysis scenarios this timeframe could easily be exceeded we note that these workflow times are specific to individual wbe applications and that individual scenarios should be fully described and considered in wbe reports clinical sars cov 2 shedding data existing human sars cov 2 viral shedding data is primarily limited to care seeking covid 19 cases after the presentation of symptoms and clinical diagnosis hindering our ability to infer pre symptomatic viral shedding as well as to study asymptomatic cases animal challenge studies are a useful model for such shedding as they include a well defined intranasal inoculation time point and longitudinal monitoring of symptoms and viral load following infection here we consider two animal inoculation studies to evaluate viral shedding dynamics following infection to provide insight into the potential for wastewater monitoring to act as an early warning system in studies by hartman et al hartman et al 2020 and woolsey et al woolsey et al 2021 investigators examined shedding dynamics in african green monkeys agms following intranasal inoculation with sars cov 2 during both studies viral load was monitored via nasal and rectal swabs along with fever onset here we use nasal swabs to represent clinical disease positivity rectal swabs to represent fecal viral shedding and fever to represent symptom onset while these data are from an animal disease model both studies conclude that agms are a plausible model to study the clinical course of covid 19 in humans and subsequent medical therapies first we consider whether fecal viral shedding precedes nasal viral detection in this case wastewater monitoring would potentially have the ability to detect cases of covid 19 prior to the clinical diagnosis via nasal swab in most cases nasal viral shedding was detected at the first rna measurement point two days post inoculation no fecal sample was positive for rna prior to detection of the virus in nasal samples although in some cases both the nasal and fecal samples were positive at the initial sampling time point two days post infection while this data does not allow the definitive exclusion of early viral fecal shedding it suggests that fecal shedding does not precede nasal shedding and limits the potential fecal shedding lead time to less than two days second we consider viral detection in stool prior to symptom onset symptoms in this case were determined by increased temperature fever as defined in the original studies for animals becoming febrile virus rna was detected in stool prior to symptom onset in two of 12 agms in hartman et al fecal shedding in animal a4 preceded fever by 1 1 days in woolsey et al figure 1 b fecal shedding in agm3 preceded fever by 0 7 days in all other cases n 10 fecal shedding either trailed symptom onset or fecal shedding or fever was not observed notably just as in human populations some animals excreting virus in stool did not exhibit symptoms at any time point alongside these animal studies it is also useful to consider sars cov 2 shedding during natural human infection to further understand shedding trends in humans wölfel et al wölfel et al 2020 evaluated viral shedding in sputum stool and urine of hospitalized covid 19 patients following symptom onset the first positive stool samples were observed three days after clinical presentation and the proportion of patients with a positive stool sample increased through the first week following symptom onset this suggests that patients were not shedding high viral loads prior to symptom onset this is consistent with a recent meta analysis by miura et al miura kitajima and omori 2021 which determined that both the incidence and load of viral shedding in stool increased after initial symptom presentation we note that differing methods may be applied to quantify viral loads in stool and nasal swabs with the potential for differing conflating factors such as the presence of pcr inhibitors however taken together the evidence suggests that human viral shedding in stool is unlikely to precede symptoms on a timescale of weeks and that viral stool shedding load increases following the onset of symptoms in symptomatic cases finally we note that there are likely individual exceptions to the trends we outline above especially within human populations however as wastewater monitoring is intended to be a community level tool rare individual variations e g early fecal shedding are not expected to be significant contributors to wastewater as an early warning tool evaluating the early warning potential of wbe for covid 19 monitoring as discussed above the potential for wastewater monitoring to provide early warning depends on both viral shedding dynamics and differentials in clinical and wbe testing and reporting in fig 1 we consider the relative differentials under various shedding and reporting scenarios as discussed above the x axis of fig 1 is divided into two parts one denotes the onset of symptoms one to four days before fecal sars cov 2 rna shedding while the other denotes the onset of fecal shedding one to four days before symptoms the y axis is the reporting time differential between wbe and clinical testing results and is also divided into two parts one with wbe results leading clinical results by one to four days and the other with clinical results leading wbe results by one to four days importantly application of this framework should include relevant ranges rather than specific values for a specific scenario to reflect the uncertainty associated with varying community level wbe applications restricting this analysis to a representative range of both viral shedding and clinical wbe testing results differential is a useful exercise to consider the potential of wbe as an early warning tool based upon available shedding data we consider the range of plausible scenarios as initial viral shedding in stool two days preceding symptom onset to three days following symptom onset per observations from covid 19 patients and animal models we then consider a scenario where a clinical test is administered at symptom onset and clinical testing results are reported within zero to three days of collection as described above a representative range of wbe reporting times is one to three days from initial signal excretion in this case the reporting differential between clinical and wbe testing would range between a two day lead for wbe i e wbe results reported one day following rna stool shedding to a four day lead for clinical testing i e wbe results reported seven days following stool shedding considering both the plausible stool shedding trends and reporting differential highlighted in the green box on fig 1 the reasonable range of early detection would be from a four day lead time for wbe to a six day lead time for clinical testing limiting the possibility of longer early warning periods via wbe under this idealized scenario it should be noted that for asymptomatic infections the onset of rna stool shedding relative to symptoms would be unbounded toward the right side of the x axis in situations where asymptomatic infections are prevalent and unlikely to be detected by clinical surveillance wbe could be capable of longer lead times for early detection implicit to this analysis are the assumptions that clinical testing is widely available and that the population is willing to be tested the reporting advantage of wbe would likely increase as clinical testing is less available and or unutilized in addition this idealized analysis assumes that rna stool shedding is detected via wastewater without error false negatives and false positives are an additional concern to be considered when interpreting any disease monitoring approach including wbe in addition this analysis assumes that the major sars cov 2 rna source in wbe applications is stool which remains to be confirmed a final consideration is the performance of asymptomatic surveillance testing i e random individual testing in the absence of symptoms under such a surveillance testing scenario where asymptomatic cases are much more likely to be discovered advantages in wastewater detection for early warning will likely decrease especially when surveillance testing is analyzed and reported rapidly conclusions the potential for wbe as an early warning system is dependent on both the viral shedding dynamics relative to symptom onset and the differential between wbe and clinical results reporting delays in wbe analysis and reporting relative to sample collection should be considered when evaluating the early warning potential of wbe current data suggests that sars cov 2 shedding in stool is typically limited to a maximum of two days prior to symptom onset however additional clinical datasets on sars cov 2 rna excretion in stool and symptom onset will help to refine this estimate considering an idealized scenario where clinical testing is widely available with relatively rapid result turnaround 0 3 days the lead time for wbe early detection is constrained to a maximum of four days wbe for covid 19 has the strongest potential to provide early warning in locations with limited clinical testing capacity or delays in clinical results reporting or where prevalent asymptomatic infections may evade clinical detection future claims regarding the potential of wastewater monitoring to provide an early warning system of covid 19 should provide appropriate contextual information e g due to delayed clinical testing to allow for a nuanced interpretation of the

differentials under various shedding and reporting scenarios as discussed above the x axis of fig 1 is divided into two parts one denotes the onset of symptoms one to four days before fecal sars cov 2 rna shedding while the other denotes the onset of fecal shedding one to four days before symptoms the y axis is the reporting time differential between wbe and clinical testing results and is also divided into two parts one with wbe results leading clinical results by one to four days and the other with clinical results leading wbe results by one to four days importantly application of this framework should include relevant ranges rather than specific values for a specific scenario to reflect the uncertainty associated with varying community level wbe applications restricting this analysis to a representative range of both viral shedding and clinical wbe testing results differential is a useful exercise to consider the potential of wbe as an early warning tool based upon available shedding data we consider the range of plausible scenarios as initial viral shedding in stool two days preceding symptom onset to three days following symptom onset per observations from covid 19 patients and animal models we then consider a scenario where a clinical test is administered at symptom onset and clinical testing results are reported within zero to three days of collection as described above a representative range of wbe reporting times is one to three days from initial signal excretion in this case the reporting differential between clinical and wbe testing would range between a two day lead for wbe i e wbe results reported one day following rna stool shedding to a four day lead for clinical testing i e wbe results reported seven days following stool shedding considering both the plausible stool shedding trends and reporting differential highlighted in the green box on fig 1 the reasonable range of early detection would be from a four day lead time for wbe to a six day lead time for clinical testing limiting the possibility of longer early warning periods via wbe under this idealized scenario it should be noted that for asymptomatic infections the onset of rna stool shedding relative to symptoms would be unbounded toward the right side of the x axis in situations where asymptomatic infections are prevalent and unlikely to be detected by clinical surveillance wbe could be capable of longer lead times for early detection implicit to this analysis are the assumptions that clinical testing is widely available and that the population is willing to be tested the reporting advantage of wbe would likely increase as clinical testing is less available and or unutilized in addition this idealized analysis assumes that rna stool shedding is detected via wastewater without error false negatives and false positives are an additional concern to be considered when interpreting any disease monitoring approach including wbe in addition this analysis assumes that the major sars cov 2 rna source in wbe applications is stool which remains to be confirmed a final consideration is the performance of asymptomatic surveillance testing i e random individual testing in the absence of symptoms under such a surveillance testing scenario where asymptomatic cases are much more likely to be discovered advantages in wastewater detection for early warning will likely decrease especially when surveillance testing is analyzed and reported rapidly conclusions the potential for wbe as an early warning system is dependent on both the viral shedding dynamics relative to symptom onset and the differential between wbe and clinical results reporting delays in wbe analysis and reporting relative to sample collection should be considered when evaluating the early warning potential of wbe current data suggests that sars cov 2 shedding in stool is typically limited to a maximum of two days prior to symptom onset however additional clinical datasets on sars cov 2 rna excretion in stool and symptom onset will help to refine this estimate considering an idealized scenario where clinical testing is widely available with relatively rapid result turnaround 0 3 days the lead time for wbe early detection is constrained to a maximum of four days wbe for covid 19 has the strongest potential to provide early warning in locations with limited clinical testing capacity or delays in clinical results reporting or where prevalent asymptomatic infections may evade clinical detection future claims regarding the potential of wastewater monitoring to provide an early warning system of covid 19 should provide appropriate contextual information e g due to delayed clinical testing to allow for a nuanced interpretation of the

of non market values from the investment framework for economics of water sensitive cities inffews suite of tools case study 1 drew on information about perth australia s fourth largest city and this case study focused on a situation where the recreational cultural and environmental benefits to the community from an iconic waterway have been degraded due to non point source pollution impacts case study 2 was framed around a large inner city industrial redevelopment project planned to house 50 000 residents with poor drainage and the fisherman s bend site in melbourne australia s second largest city was the template for developing the case study in both case studies the wsud solution is not selected despite providing net benefits and the main reason is that under current institutional arrangements the required capital expenditure would not be approved and cost recovery from beneficiaries is not possible 3 proposed reform strategies six reform strategies were identified and collectively the strategies describe a comprehensive reform package three of the strategies target policy and institutional reforms to elevate wsud to a government priority and establish the enabling architecture to equip regulators utilities local government and other parties with the authority to deliver wsud the other three strategies are designed to motivate increased investment in wsud through providing utilities with investment incentives increasing private sector investment and developing a robust information and accountability system fig 1 in terms of sequencing although each australian jurisdiction is different a common set of requirements framework can be considered evidence information base the form of valuation of trade offs costing and pricing planning policies and a set of requirements within a statutory system this then provides the building blocks to make interconnected decisions to the extent that industry sector decision are driven by regulatory incentives the impact of changes in this area as an initial step are likely to be large 3 1 strengthen government policy support four main aspects of strengthening government policy were identified i creating demand for change ii creating authorizing environments iii embedding wsud in statutory planning processes and iv integration of wsud with other sectoral policies the community might understand the benefits of wsud projects and be willing to pay for them the demand for change may not however always originate from the community 8 8 we note that through the work of all levels of the education sector community understanding and expectations with respect to environmental outcomes are changing duarte et al 2017 if the community has not expressed a desire to have water sensitive outcomes this means that the community is not convinced of the benefit or the benefit is not present even if non market valuation surveys indicate community willingness to pay for a service it does not mean investment will proceed as there may be vested interests that do not want change in such situations the demand for change can be provided by the scientific community and or political leadership once the demand for change is established there is a need for policy leadership to drive change prosser et al 2015 both case studies demonstrated that the authorizing environment to execute wsud projects is complex there is no single party that is directly accountable and this makes management of projects challenging state governments need to strengthen their role in determining the policy framework within which wsud planning decisions are made including specifying the outcomes being sought by the community and the responsibilities accountabilities of relevant parties for these outcomes this could be achieved by appointing a lead agency with overall responsibility it follows that it is necessary to secure the statutory status of wsud for projects to proceed in urban areas land is scarce and if there is not equal statutory standing for wsud projects of a wsud nature will be dismissed in favour of projects such as affordable housing residential intensification and or recreational space that have greater statutory standing unless water is on a level playing field in the statutory context landowners and those deciding outcomes will not see wsud as a sufficiently high priority as such embedding wsud at the same statutory level as other priorities interests is critical finally in australia wsud is still seen as a single sectoral objective and this misses the opportunity to integrate wsud with other sectoral policies due to their multi functional nature wsud projects not only deliver environmental benefits but can also generate substantial health benefits energy savings education and social integration benefits and many other benefits rogers et al 2020 to harness the potential of wsud to generate multiple benefits in a cost effective manner the holistic nature of wsud outcomes needs to be recognized at each policy level 3 2 increase government investment for community outcomes consultations revealed unanimous support for increased government investment in projects that demonstrably deliver positive net benefits for the community with two qualifiers first the investment should be on actual projects not pilot projects as many pilot projects have already been completed second impactful differences will be observed only if investments are made in wsud community social infrastructure where outcomes can be measured 3 3 improve system level accountability as discussed in productivity commission 2020 most wsud projects face the same set of issues who benefits who is assigned the responsibility of implementation delivery of outcomes and management of the project and misunderstanding of roles many agencies need to be involved in the project to make wsud projects happen as such there are benefits in building arrangements institutions that streamline communication negotiation and planning across all agencies involved in projects to improve system level accountability for outcomes responsibilities could be assigned to a lead authority that is best placed to coordinate and or deliver wsud projects collect and distribute the funding required through regulated prices and identify beneficiaries that may be charged with specific levies when appropriate a subsidiary principle dominated thinking and the best lead agencies tend to be locally based organisations such as catchment councils or several local councils working together with a joint objective these organisations have local connections and local buy in to deliver the required outcomes there are scale and scope considerations in selecting the lead authority increasing scale typically improves the economics but at the expense of local connection the lead agency should be selected so that a catchment scale perspective is maintained while keeping the benefits of local community engagement assigning a lead agency responsible for delivering water sensitive city outcomes was also seen as a solution to the issue of abandonment of wsud assets poor quality maintenance and abandonment of wsud assets were found to result from a mismatch between funding availability and jurisdiction responsibility to date local councils have been the main implementers custodians of small scale wsud projects however they often lack appropriate policies and funding to sustainably manage wsud assets assigning a lead agency with responsibility adequate resources and decision making capacity will ensure long term management of wsud assets 3 4 regulatory incentives consistent with concepts introduced by the victorian essential services commission esc 2016 providing utilities with investment incentives that ensure utilities understand the objectives of the communities they serve emerged as a strong theme given beneficiaries are often the general community a broad based charge to provide these services is appropriate pagiola and platais 2007 engel et al 2008 the victorian waterway and drainage charge was noted as an example of a broad based uniform residential charge that has gained acceptability because the charge is based on legislation water act 1989 section 259 has clear objectives that are independently audited and the level of the charge is subject to rigorous external review see for example esc 2021 for localized projects such as a constructed wetland adoption of a broad based charge may not seem suitable but even for such projects not all beneficiaries are local and if individual wsud projects are framed within a clearly articulated city scale transition process that beneficiaries should be thought of at the city scale would be clear in general equity issues are addressed through the income tax and transfer payment system but within the wsud context capacity to pay issues can be addressed through the existing mechanisms used to discount other water utility charges how the funds raised are utilized to achieve wsud outcomes influences acceptance a positive direction to take to ensure the delivery of projects with clear measurable objectives would be to make the funds raised for wsud projects available directly to local councils through community service obligation cso payments this mechanism would require regulatory oversight to ensure the cso covered only the shortfall in a project s efficient costs after netting off revenue from standard drainage charges rates and developer charges but the technical issues associated with effective governance of such programs are well understood engel et al 2008 provision of a share of public funding on a competitive basis would promote efficiency within the context of city scale implementation of wsud the cost of implementing a standing fund that provides funding on a competitive basis to local councils would be commensurate with the expected benefits a payment for outcomes approach could be used where government payments are made based on a reverse tender auction for example local councils could bid for public funds in return for a commitment to deliver measurable outcomes reductions in nutrient discharge from their sub catchments bids would be assessed by the lead agency based on their value for money and funding awarded to those bidders with the best value projects project evaluation methods that explicitly incorporate project delivery risk are well developed and specific tools for wsud project evaluation are available for example the inffews benefit cost analysis tool 9 9 https watersensitivecities org au research our research focus 2016 2021 integrated research irp2 wp3 last accessed 2nd of may 2021 all selected projects proposals involve delivery risk but ensuring projects follow approved methodologies mitigates this risk natural disasters and weather conditions can also impact the delivery of wsud project objectives conceptually the issues involved are similar to those faced with non permanence and reversals in carbon markets and the same solutions used in these markets such as partial payments or payments with a specific reversal rule can be used brander et al 2021 improved monitoring and feedback discussed below at 3 6 as a specific strategy also plays an integral role in ensuring money is spent effectively 3 5 private sector incentives for investment as wsud gains traction new private water service providers will be able to propose service solutions obstacles to market entry and the inability of new entrants to secure access to wastewater held by the incumbent utility need to be addressed through regulation and legislative amendment specific issues relate to where governments have intervened such that developer charges in a specific location are not cost reflective in such cases the ability of utilities to average bau development costs over their large existing customer base means that locally relevant new private wsud solutions that are more cost effective are ignored nsw productivity commission 2020 both private sector finance and private sector provision are widely seen as an essential element for whole of sector success in water sector service delivery goksu et al 2019 here the key requirement is that development charges are cost reflective the 2008 decision to set water wastewater and stormwater developer charges to zero for sydney water and hunter water but allow developer charges for recycled water is a striking example of the issue in practice frontier economics 2018 pathways to ensure equal treatment between existing and new suppliers at the planning stage are also required 3 6 improved information systems and decision making capacity greater focus on outcomes and accountability for those outcomes needs to be accompanied by frameworks for measuring and monitoring outcomes decision makers regulators and the market more broadly need to be equipped with the necessary detail to identify efficient water sensitive solutions compliance with stated objectives and appropriate cost recovery mechanisms in a timely and efficient manner for payments to be conditional verification of services delivered is required engel et al 2008 in addition to creating legislative and regulatory power for enforcement the lead agency would also need access to the skills technology and resources to make adaptive decisions that are cost effective the ability to use ex post assessments to refine the ex ante project evaluations discussed in 3 4 and determine when contingent funds can be released or when reversal events have occurred is a critical part of the overall reform process 4 conclusions this paper outlines a reform pathway that will promote the creation of water sensitive cities in australia and provides globally relevant learnings our review and stakeholder consultation with industry participants and economic regulation agencies found that to achieve city scale implementation of wsud a holistic approach is required the following conclusions can be drawn governments need to adopt clear measurable but adaptable water sensitive outcomes at the city scale for individual cities a lead agency or agencies must be given responsibility to deliver outcomes with local government an integral part of the delivery of wsud projects the lead agency needs the appropriate legislative and political support to secure cooperation from other agencies access to information and decision making capacities and the basis for charging private sector investment and involvement of community groups should be encouraged and this requires legislative reform declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest

within which wsud planning decisions are made including specifying the outcomes being sought by the community and the responsibilities accountabilities of relevant parties for these outcomes this could be achieved by appointing a lead agency with overall responsibility it follows that it is necessary to secure the statutory status of wsud for projects to proceed in urban areas land is scarce and if there is not equal statutory standing for wsud projects of a wsud nature will be dismissed in favour of projects such as affordable housing residential intensification and or recreational space that have greater statutory standing unless water is on a level playing field in the statutory context landowners and those deciding outcomes will not see wsud as a sufficiently high priority as such embedding wsud at the same statutory level as other priorities interests is critical finally in australia wsud is still seen as a single sectoral objective and this misses the opportunity to integrate wsud with other sectoral policies due to their multi functional nature wsud projects not only deliver environmental benefits but can also generate substantial health benefits energy savings education and social integration benefits and many other benefits rogers et al 2020 to harness the potential of wsud to generate multiple benefits in a cost effective manner the holistic nature of wsud outcomes needs to be recognized at each policy level 3 2 increase government investment for community outcomes consultations revealed unanimous support for increased government investment in projects that demonstrably deliver positive net benefits for the community with two qualifiers first the investment should be on actual projects not pilot projects as many pilot projects have already been completed second impactful differences will be observed only if investments are made in wsud community social infrastructure where outcomes can be measured 3 3 improve system level accountability as discussed in productivity commission 2020 most wsud projects face the same set of issues who benefits who is assigned the responsibility of implementation delivery of outcomes and management of the project and misunderstanding of roles many agencies need to be involved in the project to make wsud projects happen as such there are benefits in building arrangements institutions that streamline communication negotiation and planning across all agencies involved in projects to improve system level accountability for outcomes responsibilities could be assigned to a lead authority that is best placed to coordinate and or deliver wsud projects collect and distribute the funding required through regulated prices and identify beneficiaries that may be charged with specific levies when appropriate a subsidiary principle dominated thinking and the best lead agencies tend to be locally based organisations such as catchment councils or several local councils working together with a joint objective these organisations have local connections and local buy in to deliver the required outcomes there are scale and scope considerations in selecting the lead authority increasing scale typically improves the economics but at the expense of local connection the lead agency should be selected so that a catchment scale perspective is maintained while keeping the benefits of local community engagement assigning a lead agency responsible for delivering water sensitive city outcomes was also seen as a solution to the issue of abandonment of wsud assets poor quality maintenance and abandonment of wsud assets were found to result from a mismatch between funding availability and jurisdiction responsibility to date local councils have been the main implementers custodians of small scale wsud projects however they often lack appropriate policies and funding to sustainably manage wsud assets assigning a lead agency with responsibility adequate resources and decision making capacity will ensure long term management of wsud assets 3 4 regulatory incentives consistent with concepts introduced by the victorian essential services commission esc 2016 providing utilities with investment incentives that ensure utilities understand the objectives of the communities they serve emerged as a strong theme given beneficiaries are often the general community a broad based charge to provide these services is appropriate pagiola and platais 2007 engel et al 2008 the victorian waterway and drainage charge was noted as an example of a broad based uniform residential charge that has gained acceptability because the charge is based on legislation water act 1989 section 259 has clear objectives that are independently audited and the level of the charge is subject to rigorous external review see for example esc 2021 for localized projects such as a constructed wetland adoption of a broad based charge may not seem suitable but even for such projects not all beneficiaries are local and if individual wsud projects are framed within a clearly articulated city scale transition process that beneficiaries should be thought of at the city scale would be clear in general equity issues are addressed through the income tax and transfer payment system but within the wsud context capacity to pay issues can be addressed through the existing mechanisms used to discount other water utility charges how the funds raised are utilized to achieve wsud outcomes influences acceptance a positive direction to take to ensure the delivery of projects with clear measurable objectives would be to make the funds raised for wsud projects available directly to local councils through community service obligation cso payments this mechanism would require regulatory oversight to ensure the cso covered only the shortfall in a project s efficient costs after netting off revenue from standard drainage charges rates and developer charges but the technical issues associated with effective governance of such programs are well understood engel et al 2008 provision of a share of public funding on a competitive basis would promote efficiency within the context of city scale implementation of wsud the cost of implementing a standing fund that provides funding on a competitive basis to local councils would be commensurate with the expected benefits a payment for outcomes approach could be used where government payments are made based on a reverse tender auction for example local councils could bid for public funds in return for a commitment to deliver measurable outcomes reductions in nutrient discharge from their sub catchments bids would be assessed by the lead agency based on their value for money and funding awarded to those bidders with the best value projects project evaluation methods that explicitly incorporate project delivery risk are well developed and specific tools for wsud project evaluation are available for example the inffews benefit cost analysis tool 9 9 https watersensitivecities org au research our research focus 2016 2021 integrated research irp2 wp3 last accessed 2nd of may 2021 all selected projects proposals involve delivery risk but ensuring projects follow approved methodologies mitigates this risk natural disasters and weather conditions can also impact the delivery of wsud project objectives conceptually the issues involved are similar to those faced with non permanence and reversals in carbon markets and the same solutions used in these markets such as partial payments or payments with a specific reversal rule can be used brander et al 2021 improved monitoring and feedback discussed below at 3 6 as a specific strategy also plays an integral role in ensuring money is spent effectively 3 5 private sector incentives for investment as wsud gains traction new private water service providers will be able to propose service solutions obstacles to market entry and the inability of new entrants to secure access to wastewater held by the incumbent utility need to be addressed through regulation and legislative amendment specific issues relate to where governments have intervened such that developer charges in a specific location are not cost reflective in such cases the ability of utilities to average bau development costs over their large existing customer base means that locally relevant new private wsud solutions that are more cost effective are ignored nsw productivity commission 2020 both private sector finance and private sector provision are widely seen as an essential element for whole of sector success in water sector service delivery goksu et al 2019 here the key requirement is that development charges are cost reflective the 2008 decision to set water wastewater and stormwater developer charges to zero for sydney water and hunter water but allow developer charges for recycled water is a striking example of the issue in practice frontier economics 2018 pathways to ensure equal treatment between existing and new suppliers at the planning stage are also required 3 6 improved information systems and decision making capacity greater focus on outcomes and accountability for those outcomes needs to be accompanied by frameworks for measuring and monitoring outcomes decision makers regulators and the market more broadly need to be equipped with the necessary detail to identify efficient water sensitive solutions compliance with stated objectives and appropriate cost recovery mechanisms in a timely and efficient manner for payments to be conditional verification of services delivered is required engel et al 2008 in addition to creating legislative and regulatory power for enforcement the lead agency would also need access to the skills technology and resources to make adaptive decisions that are cost effective the ability to use ex post assessments to refine the ex ante project evaluations discussed in 3 4 and determine when contingent funds can be released or when reversal events have occurred is a critical part of the overall reform process 4 conclusions this paper outlines a reform pathway that will promote the creation of water sensitive cities in australia and provides globally relevant learnings our review and stakeholder consultation with industry participants and economic regulation agencies found that to achieve city scale implementation of wsud a holistic approach is required the following conclusions can be drawn governments need to adopt clear measurable but adaptable water sensitive outcomes at the city scale for individual cities a lead agency or agencies must be given responsibility to deliver outcomes with local government an integral part of the delivery of wsud projects the lead agency needs the appropriate legislative and political support to secure cooperation from other agencies access to information and decision making capacities and the basis for charging private sector investment and involvement of community groups should be encouraged and this requires legislative reform declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest

16749,biochemical oxidation and reduction are the principle of biological water and wastewater treatment in which electron donor and or acceptor shall be provided elemental sulfur s0 as a non toxic and easily available material with low price possesses both reductive and oxidative characteristics suggesting that it is a suitable material for water and wastewater treatment recent advanced understanding of s0 respiring microorganisms and their metabolism further stimulated the development of s0 based technologies as such s0 based biotechnologies have emerged as cost effective and attractive alternatives to conventional biological methods for water and wastewater treatment for instance s0 driven autotrophic denitrification substantially lower the operational cost for nitrogen removal from water and wastewater compared to the conventional process with exogenous carbon source supplementation the introduction of s0 can also avoid secondary pollution commonly caused by overdose of organic carbon s0 reduction processes cost effectively mineralize organic matter with low sludge production biological sulfide production using s0 as electron acceptor is also an attractive technology for metal laden wastewater treatment e g acid mine drainage this paper outlines an overview of the fundamentals characteristics and advances of the s0 based biotechnologies and highlights the functional s0 related microorganisms in particular the mechanisms of microorganisms accessing insoluble s0 and feasibility to improve s0 bio utilization efficiency are critically discussed additionally the research knowledge gaps current process limitations and required further developments are identified and discussed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords elemental sulfur reduction and oxidation sulfur reducing bacteria sulfur oxidizing bacteria acid mine drainage denitrification heavy metal removal 1 introduction elemental sulfur often written as s0 s8 is one of the predominant sulfur forms i e sulfide s0 and sulfate in the terrestrial crust rabus et al 2013 and it is a central intermediate in the geochemical sulfur cycle hao et al 2014 for instance s0 is a crucial intermediate during biological sulfide oxidation to sulfate klok et al 2012 s0 can also be a final product of biological sulfide oxidation by phototrophic bacteria lin et al 2018 or sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob with o2 nitrate or ferric ions as electron acceptors di capua et al 2019 in other words s0 can be bio utilized as either electron acceptor s0 reduction or electron donor s0 oxidation in biological reactions this suggests s0 may have a broad application in water and wastewater treatment processes applying biological s0 reduction and or oxidation in water and wastewater treatment has received increasing attention in the past few decades various s0 based biotechnologies such as sludge reduction denitrification and metal laden wastewater treatment have been developed to solve complicated environmental problems that occur within current water and wastewater treatment processes in a more cost effective approach sahinkaya et al 2015 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b however there is still a lack of comprehensive summary and discussion of the key advances in the emerging s0 biotechnologies on one hand there are substantial distinctions among these s0 based bioprocesses such as microbial communities e g s0 reducing bacteria s0 oxidizing bacteria fundamental mechanisms e g s0 reduction oxidation and scenarios employed e g treatment of domestic wastewater industrial wastewater groundwater agricultural wastewater metallurgical wastewater it is thus necessary to have a clear picture on the fundamental knowledge of respective s0 based biotechnologies on the other hand there are a number of reviews related to sulfur oxidation metabolism e g sulfide s0 sulfite and thiosulfate frigaard and dahl 2008 ghosh and dam 2009 gregersen et al 2011 however we notice that sulfur metabolism especially s0 metabolism has not been used to explain and link with process design and optimization it is known that the water solubility of s0 is extremely low 5 μg l at 25 c boulegue 1978 which limits the bioavailability of s0 this could be a bottleneck for its scale up and wide applications in water and wastewater treatment thus systematical assessment on accessibility of microorganisms to s0 and their corresponding metabolism would help develop feasible strategies that could facilitate s0 bio utilization efficiency thereby substantially improving process performance this review summarizes and critically discusses the s0 related microbiology and the mechanisms how sulfur respiring bacteria access and metabolize the almost insoluble sulfur the present applications of s0 based biotechnologies for water and wastewater treatment are comprehensively reviewed the chemical and biochemical mechanisms involved in specific scenarios and their process optimization are reported this review is expected to enrich the knowledge on the emerging s0 based water and wastewater treatment biotechnologies and to provide technical guidelines for their potential engineering applications the insights gained are used to define a research agenda 2 principles of s0 based biotechnologies and s0 respiring bacteria 2 1 s0 reduction 2 1 1 s0 reducing bacteria s0 reducing bacteria s0rb oxidize organic matter using s0 as electron acceptor with sulfide being the by product eq 1 as such s0 reduction can be employed for organic removal from wastewater the biogenic sulfide can precipitate metals via forming insoluble metals sulfides indicating its feasibility for metal laden wastewater treatment in fact s0rb thrive in a variety of environments from acidic to halo alkaline as well as saline and thermophilic conditions table 1 suggesting their diverse inhabiting environments this versatility allows them to participate in water and wastewater treatment in various environments 1 acetat e 4 s 0 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h s 3 h δ g 0 39 kj mol there are 69 sulfur reducing genera that have been identified in the bacteria domain affiliated with nine phyla such as aquificiae chrysiogenetes deferribacteres firmicutes proteobacteria thermodesulfobacteria thermotogae spirochaetes and synergistetes in the archaea domain 37 genera affiliated with two phyla euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota have been identified as s0 reducers florentino et al 2016b s0 reducing archaea are generally hyperthermophilic and they have been seldom reported for mesophilic wastewater treatment processes s0rb utilize a broad spectrum of organics such as acetate formate sugars lactate propionate ethanol and yeast extract hedderich et al 1998 besides some s0rb can utilize other electron acceptors such as sulfite thiosulfate oxygen ferric nitrate and nitrite table 1 notably a small fraction of sulfate reducing bacteria srb such as desulfurobacterium desulfuromusa desulfovibrio desulfitibacter and desulfobacter are also capable of s0 reduction table 1 2 1 2 main enzymes associated with s0 reduction the biochemical mechanisms underlying s0 reduction and the nature of the involved enzymes remain incompletely understood three main enzymes polysulfide reductase psr sulfur reductase sre and sulfide dehydrogenase sudh involved in s0 reduction fig 1 have been purified and characterized in a limited number of s0 reducers florentino et al 2016b such as wolinella succinogenes pyrococcus furiosus acidianus ambivalens and desulfurellaceae family ma and adams 1994 hedderich et al 1998 florentino et al 2017 the membrane bound polysulfide reductase consists of three subunits psrabc psra is the catalytic subunit of the psr protein for polysulfide reduction to sulfide psrb on the periplasmic side of the membrane contains several fe s clusters likely mediating the electron transfer from the membrane anchor psrc to the catalytic subunit psra of the psr florentino et al 2016b the psr contains menaquinone which could serve as electron acceptor from hydrogenase and could also be electron donor for polysulfide s0 reduction membrane bound sulfur reductase is analogous to polysulfide reductase and consists of following subunits predicted by the operon sreabcde catalytic subunit srea fe s subunit sreb membrane anchor subunit srec and two subunits srede with unknown functions liu et al 2012 the sre reduces s0 polysulfide to sulfide with hydrogenase quinones cytochromes and nadph as the electron donors florentino et al 2017 when polysulfide is transported to cytoplasmic space it can be reduced to sulfide by the cytoplasmic sudh using nadph as the electron donor ma and adams 2001 this reductase consists of two subunits sudhab and contains two flavins and three different fe s clusters 2fe 2s 3fe 4s and 4fe 4s ma and adams 1994 however how these fe s clusters participate in electron transfers in s0 reduction still remains unknown the enzymes associated with s0 reduction include but not limited to the three discussed above further research can be focused on the s0 reduction functions of these enzymes and discovering new enzymes responsible for s0 reduction 2 2 s0 oxidation 2 2 1 s0 oxidizing bacteria s0 oxidizing bacteria s0ob can reduce oxidative substances nitrate nitrite ferric ion etc using s0 as electron donor with sulfate being the by product taking nitrate as an example eq 2 in principle s0 oxidation can be employed for nitrate perchlorate and oxidative metals removal from water and wastewater phototrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria can oxidize s0 but they are only employed for sulfide instead of s0 oxidation in specific environmental biotechnologies for wastewater treatment pokorna and zabranska 2015 this is not be further discussed in this review 2 s 0 1 2 no 3 0 4 h 2 o so 4 2 0 6 n 2 0 8 h δ g 0 547 6 kj mol most chemotrophic s0ob are affiliated with the phylum proteobacteria particularly distributed in the class γ proteobacteria muyzer et al 2013 the chemotrophic s0ob acidithiobacillus thiobacillus sulfurimonas halothiobacillus etc are also capable of oxidizing sulfide thiosulfate and sulfite table s1 inagaki et al 2003 ito et al 2004 muyzer et al 2013 qiu et al 2020 besides neutrophilic their inhabiting environments also include psychrophilic and thermophilic conditions odintsova et al 1996 muyzer et al 2013 as such the applications of s0ob based environmental technology are not restricted to neutral conditions but include bioleaching of heavy metals under acidic conditions liu et al 2008 and others the detailed information about the typical chemotrophic s0ob is shown in table s1 2 2 2 main enzymes associated with s0 oxidation microbial s0 oxidation is a complicated process that is associated with various enzymes proteins and sulfur intermediates in different cellular compartments and several related genes and proteins have so far been characterized kletzin et al 2004 ghosh and dam 2009 yin et al 2014 wang et al 2019b thus the possible s0 oxidizing pathways have been depicted for some s0ob particularly for acidithiobacillus spp fig 2 such as a thiooxidans and a ferrooxidans yin et al 2014 wang et al 2019b the s0 metabolic process is generally summarized into two different pathways i e sulfur oxidizing enzyme sox dependent i e a thiooxidans and sox independent s0 oxidation i e a ferrooxidans generally extracellular s0 can first be activated by thiol containing omp while forming thiol bound sulfane sulfur atoms r s snh and is then transported to the periplasmic space rohwerder and sand 2003 where various enzymes such as sox system not present in sox independent s0 oxidation pathway tetrathionate hydrolase teth thiosulfate dehydrogenase tsd participate the further oxidation of r s snh fig 2 in the cytoplasmic membrane sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to s0 which may be re oxidized or mobilized into the cytoplasmic space chen et al 2012 in the cytoplasmic space s0 is further oxidized to sulfite by a series of enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase reductase sor rhodanese tst hdr like complex hdr and sulfur dioxygenase sdo wang et al 2019b sulfite is then oxidized to sulfate either via the sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase saor rohwerder and sand 2003 ghosh and dam 2009 or the adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps oxidation pathway kletzin et al 2004 under neutral or alkaline conditions if sulfide is present in the extracellular environments polysulfide involved s0 oxidation may occur polysulfide could cross the cell membrane to the periplasm followed by the complete oxidation to sulfate via a series of enzymes or enzyme complexes and electron transport chain reactions likely similar to those in acidithiobacillus spp ghosh and dam 2009 for more detailed and comprehensive information about s0 oxidation systems and the related electron transfer pathways readers can refer to kletzin et al 2004 dahl and friedrich 2008 wang et al 2019b and yin et al 2014 3 s0 based biotechnologies for water and wastewater treatment over the past few decades biotechnologies driven by s0 reduction and or oxidation have been fruitfully developed for water and wastewater treatment it is vital to notice that such applications are cost efficient and practically feasible these s0 based biotechnologies can be categorized into three groups a s0 used as electron acceptor for organic removal b s0 used as electron donor for nitrate perchlorate and oxidative metals removal and c s0 used to generate sulfide for heavy metal precipitation 3 1 achieving sludge reduction during high rate organic carbon removal the treatment and disposal of excess activated sludge have always been a challenging issue in wastewater treatment plants wwtps minimizing sludge production by anaerobic wastewater treatment processes is a promising approach guo et al 2013 s0 reduction process has recently been demonstrated to be an efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment process with a high organic removal rate of 1 71 kg cod m3 d and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 h cod chemical oxygen demand zhang et al 2018b the sludge yield was 0 16 kg vss kg cod which is much lower than that of conventional activated sludge process 0 35 0 47 kg vss kg cod wei et al 2003 the obtained high rate performance was attributed to the polysulfide involved indirect s0 reduction zhang et al 2018c the s0 reduction during domestic wastewater treatment was mainly mediated by the s0 reducers geobacter and desulfomicrobium zhang et al 2018b the produced sulfide could be further used as the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification which is particularly suitable for the treatment of low c n ratio wastewater show et al 2013 huang et al 2021 however s0 derived compounds i e sulfate still remain in the effluent likely causing secondary sulfate pollution a promising solution is to terminate sulfide oxidation at s0 via controlling the molar ratio of nitrate sulfide n s at an optimal level i e 0 4 lin et al 2018 the biogenic sulfide can also be recovered and recycled via micro aeration zhang et al 2018d developed an internal sulfur cycling isc process consisting of a s0 reducing reactor and a sulfide oxidizing reactor to recover s0 fig 3 the 200 days of stable operation of the lab scale isc system demonstrated that 94 of the influent cod 300 mg l were removed without excessive sludge withdrawal and 76 of the produced sulfide were selectively oxidized to s0 for recycling clostridium played an important role in s0 reduction while halothiobacillus and thiomonas contributed to sulfide oxidation to s0 under micro aerobic conditions 3 2 cost efficient removal of nitrate from low c n ratio wastewater reduced sulfur species i e sulfide s0 and thiosulfate have been often reported to participate in chemolithotrophic denitrification as electron donors cui et al 2019 the denitrification rate with the three types of electron donors follows the order of thiosulfate sulfide s0 considering operational cost and sulfate production elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification sadn has competitive advantages over thiosulfate or sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification for instance thiosulfate driven autotrophic denitrification has the highest operation cost and sulfate production 0 72 kg nitrate and 11 07 g so4 2 g no3 n di capua et al 2019 although the operational cost and sulfate production during sulfide driven denitrification are lower than that of sadn 5 58 g so4 2 g no3 n vs 7 54 g so4 2 g no3 n 0 19 kg nitrate vs 0 43 kg nitrate cui et al 2019 the use of sulfide chemicals induces safety issues and a negative public image s0 oxidation can achieve complete denitrification and partial denitrification under favorable conditions which are discussed further 3 2 1 complete denitrification sadn is an appealing low cost process for nitrogen removal eq 2 from drinking water stormwater runoff groundwater and low c n ratio wastewater sierra alvarez et al 2007 shao et al 2010 wang et al 2016 equally important sadn produces less or similar n2o compared to heterotrophic denitrification 0 01 0 6 vs 0 005 1 2 of the nitrogen load zhang et al 2015b zhu et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 thiobacillus and sulfurimonas are often reported to be two dominant autotrophic denitrifiers in sadn systems table s2 sadn removes one gram nitrate consuming 4 57 g alkalinity as caco3 cui et al 2019 thus it declines system ph and possibly influences nitrogen removal s0 packed bed reactors s0 pbrs supplemented with limestone called s0 limestone autotrophic denitrification slad are often employed in which limestone is served as the neutralizer for balancing ph and inorganic carbon for microbial synthesis solid s0 and limestone can also serve as carriers to support biofilm development which is beneficial for biomass retention and performance improvement of nitrate removal other solid phase buffers calcite crushed oyster shells etc are also used cui et al 2019 in addition membrane bioreactors mbrs with bicarbonate have been applied to achieve high biomass retention and increase effluent quality sahinkaya et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a ucar et al 2020 ucar et al 2021 sadn has been applied at pilot scale for drinking water production from nitrate contaminated groundwater shao et al 2010 wang et al 2019c it has also been applied in pilot and full scale systems for treating wwtp effluent sahinkaya et al 2014 more information about sadn achieved in different systems as well as process performance is presented in table s2 sulfate generation is a major concern during sadn process although sulfate concentration is not regulated by the wastewater discharge standards the maximum sulfate concentration in drinking water set by us epa is 250 mg l zhang et al 2015a which is equivalent to the amount of sulfate produced from complete removal of around 33 mg n l nitrate sahinkaya et al 2011 a high sulfate concentration can result in a noticeable taste 400 mg l or even diarrhea 1000 1200 mg l huang et al 2018 one compromised approach is to couple s0 based autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification to form mixotrophic denitrification as heterotrophic denitrification produces alkalinity and reduces sulfate production zhang et al 2015a integrating sadn with iron based autotrophic denitrification is another solution with more competitive advantages in addition to avoid the secondary pollution caused by residual organics in mixotrophic denitrification zhu et al 2018 demonstrated that a sadn system supplemented with siderite feco3 not only reduced sulfate production but also significantly improved nitrate removal rate eq 3 it was due to the synergistic effects of s0 and feco3 on denitrification this process was also demonstrated in a pilot scale system wang et al 2019c similar with siderite iron sulfides e g pyrrhotite eq 4 can also be used to reduce sulfate production and improve nitrate removal in sadn systems hu et al 2020 li et al 2020a of note the produced fe iii could further remove phosphate via sorption process wilfert et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 3 fec o 3 0 2 no 3 1 6 h 2 o fe oh 3 0 1 n 2 0 8 c o 2 0 2 hco 3 δ g 0 54 3 kj mol 4 fes 1 8 no 3 1 6 h 2 o fe oh 3 0 9 n 2 so 4 2 0 2 h δ g 0 3817 kj mol according to eq 2 a theoretical stoichiometric ratio of sulfur to nitrogen for complete nitrate reduction to n2 gas is 1 9 g s g n however no2 and n2o would be accumulated if this ratio is applied it could be attributed to the limited mass transfer from solid to liquid phase caused by the low aqueous solubility of s0 and or the different competitive capabilities of enzymes associated with nitrogen oxides reduction e g no3 no2 n2o for limited electron donors oberoi et al 2021 biogenic s0 hereafter referred to as bio s0 has higher bioavailability than chemically synthesized s0 hereafter referred to as chem s0 hence bio s0 would result in lower accumulation of intermediates during nitrate reduction to minimize nitrite accumulation s0 is usually present in a large stoichiometric excess to supply sufficient electron donors zhang et al 2015a ucar et al 2020 3 2 2 partial denitrification coupled with anammox process partial denitrification no3 no2 coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process pd a is an attractive autotrophic nitrogen removal process for energy efficient industrial and domestic wastewater treatment du et al 2019 the anammox process inevitably generates 11 of nitrate relative to the influent ammonium concentration heterotrophic denitrification process can be supplemented to remove nitrate from anammox system to apply the right amount of organics for denitrification is very complicated likely leading to secondary pollution alternatively sadn process could replace full denitrification to supplement anammox process with nitrite as only after conversion to nitrite further denitrification to nitrogen gas occurs eqs 5 and 6 chen et al 2018 s n ratio is a critical factor influencing nitrite accumulation during sadn as stated above when s0 is supplied according to the stoichiometric s n ratio nitrite build up can be achieved however it is highly uncertain if efficient conversion of nitrate to nitrite can be obtained thus in practice s0 is excessive in reactors how to optimize the s n ratio to achieve effective nitrite accumulation still needs further investigation feed ph and temperature are the other two key factors weak alkaline conditions could encourage nitrate conversion while minimizing nitrite removal chen et al 2018 although temperature has a minor impact on nitrate and nitrite removal appropriate temperature would be beneficial for denitrifying activity and could result in satisfactory nitrite accumulation owing to the faster rate of nitrate reduction over nitrite reduction for example chen et al 2018 obtained more than 95 of nitrite accumulation with an influent nitrate concentration of 100 mg n l in a sadn system at ph 8 5 and 35 c the feasibility of s0 driven autotrophic pd a process has been further demonstrated by treating fluorine containing semiconductor wastewater rich in ammonia and nitrate li et al 2019 the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 98 with an influent total nitrogen loading rate of 4 19 kg m3 d 5 3 no 3 s 0 h 2 o 3 no 2 so 4 2 2 h δ g 0 277 8 kj mol 6 nh 4 no 2 n 2 2 h 2 o δ g 0 357 8 kj mol 3 3 treating drinking water resources contaminated with nitrate and perchlorate autotrophic s0 oxidation can also be employed to efficiently remove perchlorate from surface water groundwater and drinking water via reduction process with chloride ions being the end product eq 7 ju et al 2007 sahu et al 2009 wan et al 2017 wan et al 2019a perchlorate often co contaminates with nitrate in surface water and groundwater wan et al 2017 microbial community analysis showed that sulfuricella sulfuritalea thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were the effective autotrophic denitrifiers perchlorate reducing bacteria wan et al 2017 observed that a lab scale s0 pbr operated at a low hrt 0 75 h simultaneously removed 97 of the influent nitrate 22 mg n l and perchlorate 472 μg l or 22 mg l however when perchlorate concentration decreased to a low level s0 disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate initiated eq 8 resulting in excessive sulfate production and alkaline consumption wan et al 2019a wan et al 2019b combining heterotrophic denitrification and sadn could be a solution to prohibit s0 disproportionation in which a heterotrophic reactor was followed by a s0 autotrophic reactor chsas wan et al 2019a in the chsas both heterotrophic and autotrophic processes remove perchlorate and nitrate thereby reducing sulfate production lowering the hrt as much as possible without sacrificing the system s performance could also restrict s0 disproportionation however the right amount of organic dosage is difficult to control the feasibility of the chsas still needs to be further demonstrated before practical application 7 3

forming insoluble metal sulfides when treating arsenic and mercury contaminated wastewater s0 reduction exhibited competitive advantages over sulfate reduction discussed separately the immobilization of chromium is also highlighted separately because hexavalent chromium cr vi can be reduced by biogenic sulfide or autotrophic s0 oxidation 3 4 1 s0 driven sulfidogenic process for metal laden wastewater treatment sulfate reduction has been widely applied for metal laden wastewater treatment in practice such as metallurgical wastewater and amd neculita et al 2007 however organic content in metal laden wastewater is generally too low to achieve high rate sulfate reduction process neculita et al 2007 supplementing additional carbon sources would certainly increase the operational cost and in return limit its wide application s0 reduction could be a promising alternative that requires only two electrons per sulfide instead of the eight electrons demanded by sulfate reduction eqs 9 vs 10 this theoretically reduces 75 of organic consumption compared to sulfate reduction an experimental study on the laboratory scale amd system showed the s0 reduction could reduce 25 6 78 9 of the chemical cost for sulfide production compared to sulfate reduction sun et al 2020a desulfomicrobium as a facultative s0rb was found to predominate in the reactor which preferentially utilized s0 rather than sulfate as the electron acceptors in the presence of sulfide it may be due to the presence of polysulfide sn 2 in such scenario where it is rapidly formed by the abiotic reaction between sulfide and s0 eq 11 and the facultative s0 reducers tend to grow on polysulfide instead of sulfate eq 12 it is because the activation of sulfate consumes atp whereas polysulfide does not poser et al 2013 as such even sulfate is more bioaccessible than s0 high rate s0 driven sulfidogenic processes 53 63 mg s l h are still viable table 2 li et al 2021 has recently tested this concept in a pilot scale system treating real cu laden electroplating wastewater however the s0 reduction rate was lower than those obtained in laboratory scale studies table 2 it may be due to the fact that s0rb could only use simple organics which is commonly used in the laboratory scale studies and the hydrolysis fermentation of macromolecular organic compounds in domestic wastewater could a rate limiting step when treating amd without ph amelioration the s0 reduction rate can still be up to 36 mg s l h under extremely acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 sun et al 2020b which is comparable to sulfate reduction processes operated under neutral conditions table 2 the s0 reduction was due to the suppression of sulfate reduction and the flourish of s0rb i e desulfurella sun et al 2020b direct cell s0 contact and extracellular electron transfer eet were proposed to be responsible for s0 utilization under acidic conditions additionally an acidic s0 reducing bioreactor can further reduce chemical needs for alkaline supply and warrants further investigation to verify its feasibility in pilot or full scale applications 9 so 4 2 10 h 8 e h 2 s 4 h 2 o 10 s 0 2 h 2 e h 2 s 11 h s n 1 8 s 8 s n 2 h 12 hco 2

bangladesh hossain 2006 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the most common arsenic species in aquatic environment and the former has much higher mobility and toxicity than the latter straif et al 2009 biogenic sulfide produced from sulfate reduction can remove as iii via the formation of insoluble arsenic sulfide precipitates as2s3 and ass eqs 13 and 14 de matos et al 2018 sulfide can also chemically reduce as v to as iii finally immobilize as as as2s3 and ass gorny et al 2015 however in practice sulfate reduction could not achieve satisfactory and stable removal of arsenic from wastewater owing to the generation of soluble thioarsenite as oh s2 2 it is a result of the elevated ph and excessive hs produced during sulfate reduction which promote the production of thioarsenic complexes eq 15 couture and van cappellen 2011 to minimize the formation of thioarsenic complexes the ph should be less than 6 9 at a high as s molar ratio 0 67 or lower than 5 5 at a low as s molar ratio 0 05 sun et al 2019 s0 reduction under acidic conditions is a promising alternative as this process produces high amount of sulfide without elevating ph sun et al 2019 found that the effluent from a s0 packed reactor operated at ph of approximately 4 3 could efficiently remove arsenic 99 without thioarsenite formation with a wide as s molar ratio range 0 05 0 55 however the produced sulfide is still in surplus even after complete arsenic removal the sulfide likely results in equipment corrosion especially under acidic conditions which means that counteractive measures need to be employed to avoid such corrosion issues additional process such as sulfide oxidation is required to remove or convert the formed sulfide into benign form such as s0 or sulfate zhang et al 2018d 13 2 h

aquatic environments are highly toxic to humans and other organisms although sulfate reduction could remove mercury via forming mercury sulfide precipitate most srb are mercury methylators which means that they can transform mercury ions hg ii to neurotoxic methylmercury mehg in the presence of organics and sulfate fig 4 king et al 2002 s0 reduction has recently achieved efficient mercury removal without mehg accumulation wang et al 2018 a 326 day study of s0 reduction process treating mercury contaminated wastewater showed that such process efficiently removed hg ii with concentration ranging from 0 to 50 mg l without mehg detection wang et al 2019a a significant decrease in the abundance of mercury methylation functional gene hgca was observed over time but it did not completely disappear geobacter and desulfumicrobium were the main identified s0rb and some members of them are mercury methylators podar et al 2015 however the mechanisms accounting for the absence of mehg in the process are still unknown the study proposed that the absence of mehg may be possibly ascribed to the binding between dissolved organic matter dom and hg ii thereby inhibiting mercury methylation fig 4 wang et al 2018 therefore the mechanisms towards the absence of mehg should be further investigated the excessive sulfide should also be removed via additional process as mentioned above 3 4 4 chromium reduction and immobilization chromium is often detected in various industrial wastewaters e g leather tanning mine tailing and electroplating surface water and groundwater cr vi and cr iii are the primary forms of chromium in nature cr vi is soluble in water teratogenic and carcinogenic in contrast cr iii generally exists in the form of insoluble amorphous hydroxide cr oh 3 under neutral conditions the common practice for detoxifying chromium is to reduce cr vi to cr iii followed by immobilization as cr oh 3 sahinkaya et al 2012 sulfide generated from s0 reduction can chemically reduce cr vi to cr iii sahinkaya et al 2012 eq 16 autotrophic s0 oxidation can also be employed to promote the cr vi reduction shi et al 2019 in the process autotrophic bacteria e g thiobacillus ferrovibrio first synthesize volatile fatty acids vfas via bicarbonate reduction with s0 oxidation to sulfate heterotrophic metal reducing microbes e g geobacter then reduce such metals with vfas as the electron donors and carbon sources such process is very promising for oxidative metal removal from contaminated surface water or groundwater without adding organic carbon the same research group also demonstrated that autotrophic s0 oxidation can be employed to reduce vanadium v v to v iv further immobilized as vo oh 2 with similar mechanisms with cr vi bioreduction zhang et al 2018a we could expect that the s0 oxidation could be extended to reduce other oxidative metals such as selenate and antimonite 16 2 cro 4 2 3 h s 7 h 2 cr oh 3 3 s 0 2 h 2 o 4 pathways of s0 respiring bacteria accessing s0 and strengthened strategies the extremely low water solubility of s0 suggests a poor bioaccessibility thereby impairing the applicability of s0 based biotechnologies understanding how microbes access s0 is beneficial for process optimization and scale up so far there are four putative possible mechanisms for making s0 bioavailable to microorganisms fig 5 1 direct cell s0 contact pathways 1 and 2 2 polysulfide involvement pathway 3 and 3 extracellular electron transfer eet pathways 3 and 4 it is of note that all or part of the pathways could occur concomitantly depending on the microbial community and environment 4 1 direct cell s0 contact physical attachment of s0 respiring bacteria to s0 particles is an important way for microbial s0 uptake fig 5 there are two possible pathways for microbial s0 utilization when microorganisms attach onto the surface of s0 particles first the interaction between sulfur particles and the thiol groups present on special outer membrane proteins can generate thiol bound sulfane sulfur atoms which is then transported into the periplasm rohwerder and sand 2003 second s0 respiring bacteria could directly uptake the polymeric sulfur commercial sulfur products consist of thermodynamically stable octasulfane ring s8 and chain like macromolecules of polymeric sulfur the binding energy between s s bonds in s8 rings is 2 4 kj mol stronger than that of polymeric sulfur sulfur chain franz et al 2007 polymeric sulfur may be more bioaccessible than cyclo octasulfur s8 to s0 respiring bacteria s0 type concentration and particle size are important factors influencing the direct s0 cell efficacy mineral sulfur chem s0 bio s0 and colloidal s0 are the most common types of elemental sulfur table 3 mineral sulfur usually contains impurities such as arsenic selenium clay and calcite thus it is not suitable for wastewater treatment in practice chem s0 also called sulfur flower is generally obtained by claus process fischer 1978 or by sublimation and condensation of mineral sulfur or industrial sulfur bio s0 is produced in biological treatment of sulfide containing wastewaters huang et al 2017 huang et al 2021 flue gases lin et al 2018 blázquez et al 2019a or h2s rich biogas pokorna and zabranska 2015 it should be noted that bio s0 produced by sulfide oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus acidithiobacillus etc can be stored intracellularly or extracellularly kleinjan et al 2003 huang et al 2021 when sulfide supply is sufficient the intracellularly produced s0 can be secreted by bacteria to outside the bacterial cells li et al 2020b colloidal s0 is produced via the grinding of s0 particles with a colloidal mill machine or by the acidification of polysulfide or thiosulfate florentino et al 2015 the high cost of colloidal s0 production limits its application in water and wastewater treatment hereinafter we only discuss chem s0 and bio s0 in the context of water and wastewater treatment chem s0 is strongly hydrophobic and not easily dispersed in water limiting mass transfer from the solid to aqueous phase and reducing microbial utilization rate sierra alvarez et al 2007 in contrast bio s0 particles primarily consist of orthorhombic s0 rings surrounded by a layer of long chain polymers i e polysulfide and polythionates with hydrophilic properties di capua et al 2019 due to the microcrystallinity structure high specific surface area and solubility bio s0 particles have higher bioavailability than chem s0 florentino et al 2015 kostrytsia et al 2018 although bio s0 is superior to chem s0 a limited number of batch studies demonstrated its feasibility to support denitrification only two studies so far reported autotrophic denitrification based on bio s0 in mbrs ucar et al 2020 ucar et al 2021 in which bio s0 did not result in a significantly different microbial community from that with chem s0 however it should be noted that bio s0 is not always available at every site considering the local availability of sulfur sources chem s0 has been more frequently utilized in real applications increasing s0 concentration is beneficial for physical attachment of microbes onto s0 particles there is a s0 concentration threshold by which s0 mass transfer is no longer the rate limiting step sierra alvarez et al 2007 such threshold is actually influenced by many factors such as particle size microbial activity indicating that it is case specific for example sierra alvarez et al 2007 found that the denitrification rate had a positive correlation with the concentration of fine s0 particles 10 130 μm only ranging from 0 234 mg l additionally decreasing s0 particle size can increase the specific surface area enhance the mass transfer efficiency and also provide greater area for biofilm growth moon et al 2006 koenig and liu 2001 found that the denitrification rate increased from 0 3 kg no3 n m3 d to 0 77 kg no3 n m3 d when the size of s0 particles decreased from 11 2 16 mm to 2 8 5 6 mm in a s0 pbr the s0 fine powder would be preferably utilized in activated sludge systems and membrane reactors sahinkaya et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b qiu et al 2020 however in s0 pbrs excessively small s0 particles would result in an extremely low bed porosity clogging and channeling as well as limited biofilm development which certainly deteriorate the system performance when used for denitrification n2 entrapment could also occur in practice in order to achieve desirable process performance s0 particle size should be as smaller as it can on the premise of minimizing the risks of the above stated issues according to previous studies s0 particle sizes at mm level 0 5 mm 16 mm have been frequently utilized in laboratory and pilot scale s0 pbrs treating nitrate contaminated water and wastewater di capua et al 2015 wang et al 2019c as for s0 reduction previous studies showed that the particles sizes of 0 6 50 mm were used in pbrs sahinkaya et al 2012 zhang et al 2018d sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020b thus in practice s0 particle size used for s0 reduction can be larger than that for denitrification in pbrs especially under neutral or alkaline conditions where the presence of abundant polysulfide ensures highly efficient system performance 4 2 polysulfide as the electron shuttle under neutral or alkaline conditions the nucleophilic attack of s0 by hs results in the nucleophilic cleavage of s8 rings and the formation of small polysulfide molecules eq 11 florentino et al 2016b polysulfide molecules can pass through the cell membrane via channels or other designated polysulfide binding carrier proteins and react with the cytoplasmic sulfur transferases rabus et al 2013 florentino et al 2019 polysulfide remarkably enhances the bioavailability of s0 and thus greatly accelerates the process rates for sulfur reduction or oxidation for the purpose of water wastewater treatment polysulfide concentration is mainly influenced by solution ph and sulfide concentration at neutral ph the polysulfide concentration at equilibrium does not exceed 10 50 μm when sulfide concentration increases from 1 to 10 mm at ph 10 polysulfide is the main form of sulfide in the presence of sufficient s0 sorokin et al 2010 under neutral alkaline conditions polysulfide is a key electron acceptor donor during s0 metabolism berg et al 2014 liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c zhang et al 2018c observed that analogous to a chain reaction fig 6 eqs 11 and 12 the rate of s0 reduction via polysulfide accelerates until the sulfide concentration inhibits sulfidogenic activity it was observed that with the involvement of polysulfide in sulfur reduction process the sulfur reduction rate was approximately 40 times higher than that in the absence of polysulfide zhang et al 2018c when the ph is below 6 0 under which polysulfide formation is almost completely inhibited the s0 reduction oxidation rate is significantly lower than that under neutral or alkaline conditions sun et al 2019 the ph also influences the biological s0 respiration activity therefore when treating amd ph amelioration could not only improve s0 reducing activity but also enhance s0 bioaccessibility due to the involvement of polysulfide under acidic conditions the s0 could be mainly utilized by eet and direct cell s0 contact fig 6 it should be pointed out that s0 reduction oxidation consumes alkalinity to counteract the decrease in ph addition of alkaline substance is required for instance as stated above during s0 driven autotrophic denitrification bicarbonate limestone or other solid phase buffers calcite crushed oyster shells etc are usually utilized cui et al 2019 increasing sulfide concentration would also increase polysulfide concentration under neutral alkaline conditions since sulfide is produced during s0 reduction process satisfied system performance can be achieved as long as the ph in the systems can be maintained at around neutral alkaline conditions as for s0 oxidation adding exogenous sulfide or organics is a feasible strategy for facilitating s0 oxidizing efficiency for instance in addition to being directly used as electron donor sulfide can result in polysulfide formation thereby enhancing s0 bioavailability and improving nitrogen removal in sadn systems qiu et al 2020 exogenous sulfide addition can be substituted by organics which could be due to the sulfide produced in the deep layer of biofilm growing on s0 particles qiu et al 2020 s0 disproportionation could be another possible strategy for in situ sulfide source eq 8 which merits further study although sulfur disproportionation is endergonic under standard conditions it has been reported to occur in engineered systems and natural environments poser et al 2013 qiu et al 2020 wan et al 2019a wan et al 2019b müller et al 2020 in addition although temperature also influences polysulfide concentration under a certain condition its effect may not be significant during mesophilic wastewater treatment processes as for the mesophilic bacteria low temperature would slow down microbial s0 utilization rate 4 3 extracellular electron transfer eet eet is the process by which microorganisms utilize insoluble electron donors or acceptors eet pathway for biological s0 oxidation has not been reported yet according to the previously acquired knowledge on electroactive bacteria such as metal utilizing bacteria e g shewanella geobacter and srb choi and sang 2016 among which some members of srb shewanella and geobacter can perform dissimilatory s0 reduction eet could likely be applicable for s0 reduction three eet pathways likely involved in s0 reduction could be proposed fig 5 florentino et al 2016b first c type cytochromes extend the respiratory chains to the cell surface to contact with s0 on which they transport respiratory electrons in the cytoplasmic membrane through the periplasm and the outer membrane to the surface of s0 particles the outer membrane cytochromes then catalyze extracellular s0 reduction at the surface of outer membrane of bacteria second extracellular redox mediators such as flavins phenazines humic substances and quinones can function as electron shuttles to transport electrons between the cells and the insoluble s0 polysulfide could also be considered an extracellular redox mediator to shuttle electrons between microorganisms and s0 particles third in the absence of c type cytochromes lovley et al 1995 microbes could form extracellular pili also called nanowires that are composed of protein filaments and anchored on the cell envelope shi et al 2016 these nanowires build an electrical bridge connecting cells and solid materials therefore adding extracellular redox mediators or conductive materials activated carbon carbon nanotube iron oxides etc to enhance electron transfer could be practically feasible strategies for improving s0 bio utilization efficiency which merits further investigation additionally s0 type concentration and particle size also need to be considered when improving eet efficiency 5 future perspectives although the applications of s0 during water and wastewater have drawn increasing attention and substantial progresses have been achieved in recent years many issues related to the basic mechanisms and the applications of s0 based biotechnologies remain unanswered and should be a goal of future research increasing s0 bioavailability is the key step to broaden the applications of s0 based biotechnologies the low bioavailability of s0 due to its extremely low aqueous solubility limits the scale up and wide applications of s0 based biotechnologies despite some viable approaches have been demonstrated to improve s0 bio utilization efficiency more versatile strategies are desired to make them more competitive and robust we propose to focus on understanding and regulation of bio chemical processes during the interface between s0 particle and biofilm exploring s0 surface modification introducing extracellular redox mediators or conductive materials into the s0 based systems and optimizing the polysulfide formation in bioprocesses s0 disproportionation is an important process in the globally biochemical sulfur cycle and s0 disproportionating bacteria have been detected in freshwater and marine sediments as well as bio augmented systems s0 disproportionation could be potentially employed to simultaneously provide readily bioavailable electron donor and acceptor for water and wastewater treatment however the engineering application of s0 disproportionation in water or wastewater treatment processes is yet to be reported future research could direct towards developing novel s0 disproportionation based water and wastewater treatment processes bio s0 is a biological waste product and has higher bioaccessibility than chem s0 more efforts should be dedicated to apply bio s0 in these biotechnologies and to determine whether and how bio s0 affects sulfur metabolism however bio s0 is not universally available the cost caused by transportation should be taken into account within cost benefit analysis to have a more sustainable approach sulfur source could be recovered and recycled via additional processes for example the biogenic sulfide can be re oxidized to s0 via micro aeration or sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification show et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the by product sulfate could also be turned into s0 via bioelectrochemical systems blázquez et al 2016 blázquez et al 2019b the recovery and or recycle of s0 could help in closing the loop thereby boosting the circular economy thus the integrated s0 based biotechnologies with bioelectrochemical systems can be another future research direction interspecific interactions are expected to play a more crucial role in maintaining system functions than individual populations which could contribute to enhance s0 bioavailability and promote system performance for example fermentative bacteria can decompose macromolecular organic substrates to simple ones to support the activity and respiration of s0rb in sadn systems the sulfide produced by sulfidogenic bacteria can improve s0 bioaccessibility therefore improving denitrification mediated by nitrate reducing bacteria accordingly microbial community structure and microbial interactions at the whole community level and molecular level should be further investigated via emerging techniques e g metagenomic transcriptomic and proteomic analysis as well as stable isotope labeling this information will be beneficial for optimizing process performance via calibrating operation parameters and facilitating the preferable microbial pathways a suite of s0 based technologies has recently been proposed in laboratory studies but only s0 driven autotrophic denitrification and s0 reduction for metal laden wastewater treatment have so far been demonstrated in pilot or full scale applications these studies have shown a proof of concept it is now time to establish more demonstrations to bring these technologies to full scale applications development and validation of mathematical modeling to determine the key process parameters can assist their scale up and allow the technologies to be more practically feasible in addition treatment of emerging contaminants pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps biocides nanoparticles and micro nanoplastics etc has been becoming a major challenge during water and wastewater treatment in order to meet increasingly strict effluent quality criteria the fate of emerging contaminants in the s0 based systems and how these emerging contaminants influence the performance of s0 based biotechnologies and s0 related microbial community should not be overlooked 6 conclusions elemental sulfur a non toxic cheap insoluble and easily available chemical has been used as electron donor and or acceptor in s0 based biotechnologies for water and wastewater treatment this study systematically reviews the principles microorganisms mechanisms and applications of s0 based biotechnologies s0 can undergo oxidative and reductive conversion by a wide array of organisms this has been recently explored in water and wastewater treatment targeting various contaminants compared to conventional water and wastewater treatment approaches s0 based biotechnologies could substantially reduce the operational cost caused by the addition of exogenous carbon sources methanol ethanol acetate glucose etc as the operational cost with s0 is much lower in terms of the cost per mol electron donor provided s0 based biotechnologies would not result in secondary pollution caused by residual organics the extremely low aqueous solubility of s0 is a primary bottleneck of achieving high level process performance which could be overcome by shedding more light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying microbes accessibility to s0 and microbial s0 metabolism self generated polysulfide has been proved to be an effective electron shuttle to break the bottleneck and greatly accelerate s0 based biotechnologies future studies on microbial and molecular ecology as well as mathematical modeling are deemed necessary for s0 based biotechnology scale up the fate of emerging pollutants and their interactions with microbial communities in s0 based biosystems should also be investigated certainly the versatility of s0 conversion will lead to new biotechnological processes for water and wastewater treatment in

16749,biochemical oxidation and reduction are the principle of biological water and wastewater treatment in which electron donor and or acceptor shall be provided elemental sulfur s0 as a non toxic and easily available material with low price possesses both reductive and oxidative characteristics suggesting that it is a suitable material for water and wastewater treatment recent advanced understanding of s0 respiring microorganisms and their metabolism further stimulated the development of s0 based technologies as such s0 based biotechnologies have emerged as cost effective and attractive alternatives to conventional biological methods for water and wastewater treatment for instance s0 driven autotrophic denitrification substantially lower the operational cost for nitrogen removal from water and wastewater compared to the conventional process with exogenous carbon source supplementation the introduction of s0 can also avoid secondary pollution commonly caused by overdose of organic carbon s0 reduction processes cost effectively mineralize organic matter with low sludge production biological sulfide production using s0 as electron acceptor is also an attractive technology for metal laden wastewater treatment e g acid mine drainage this paper outlines an overview of the fundamentals characteristics and advances of the s0 based biotechnologies and highlights the functional s0 related microorganisms in particular the mechanisms of microorganisms accessing insoluble s0 and feasibility to improve s0 bio utilization efficiency are critically

elemental sulfur reduction and oxidation sulfur reducing bacteria sulfur oxidizing bacteria acid mine drainage denitrification heavy metal removal 1 introduction elemental sulfur often written as s0 s8 is one of the predominant sulfur forms i e sulfide s0 and sulfate in the terrestrial crust rabus et al 2013 and it is a central intermediate in the geochemical sulfur cycle hao et al 2014 for instance s0 is a crucial intermediate during biological sulfide oxidation to sulfate klok et al 2012 s0 can also be a final product of biological sulfide oxidation by phototrophic bacteria lin et al 2018 or sulfide oxidizing bacteria sob with o2 nitrate or ferric ions as electron acceptors di capua et al 2019 in other words s0 can be bio utilized as either electron acceptor s0 reduction or electron donor s0 oxidation in biological reactions this suggests s0 may have a broad application in water and wastewater treatment processes applying biological s0 reduction and or oxidation in water and wastewater treatment has received increasing attention in the past few decades various s0 based biotechnologies such as sludge reduction denitrification and metal laden wastewater treatment have been developed to solve complicated environmental problems that occur within current water and wastewater treatment processes in a more cost effective approach sahinkaya et al 2015 sun et al 2018 zhang et al 2018b however there is still a lack of comprehensive summary and discussion of the key advances in the emerging s0 biotechnologies on one hand there are substantial distinctions among these s0 based bioprocesses such as microbial communities e g s0 reducing bacteria s0 oxidizing bacteria fundamental mechanisms e g s0 reduction oxidation and scenarios employed e g treatment of domestic wastewater industrial wastewater groundwater agricultural wastewater metallurgical wastewater it is thus necessary to have a clear picture on the fundamental knowledge of respective s0 based biotechnologies on the other hand there are a number of reviews related to sulfur oxidation metabolism e g sulfide s0 sulfite and thiosulfate frigaard and dahl 2008 ghosh and dam 2009 gregersen et al 2011 however we notice that sulfur metabolism especially s0 metabolism has not been used to explain and link with process design and optimization it is known that the water solubility of s0 is extremely low 5 μg l at 25 c boulegue 1978 which limits the bioavailability of s0 this could be a bottleneck for its scale up and wide applications in water and wastewater treatment thus systematical assessment on accessibility of microorganisms to s0 and their corresponding metabolism would help develop feasible strategies that could facilitate s0 bio utilization efficiency thereby substantially improving process performance this review summarizes and critically discusses the s0 related microbiology and the mechanisms how sulfur respiring bacteria access and metabolize the almost insoluble sulfur the present applications of s0 based biotechnologies for water and wastewater treatment are comprehensively reviewed the chemical and biochemical mechanisms involved in specific scenarios and their process optimization are reported this review is expected to enrich the knowledge on the emerging s0 based water and wastewater treatment biotechnologies and to provide technical guidelines for their potential engineering applications the insights gained are used to define a research agenda 2 principles of s0 based biotechnologies and s0 respiring bacteria 2 1 s0 reduction 2 1 1 s0 reducing bacteria s0 reducing bacteria s0rb oxidize organic matter using s0 as electron acceptor with sulfide being the by product eq 1 as such s0 reduction can be employed for organic removal from wastewater the biogenic sulfide can precipitate metals via forming insoluble metals sulfides indicating its feasibility for metal laden wastewater treatment in fact s0rb thrive in a variety of environments from acidic to halo alkaline as well as saline and thermophilic conditions table 1 suggesting their diverse inhabiting environments this versatility allows them to participate in water and wastewater treatment in various environments 1 acetat e 4 s 0 2 h 2 o 2 c o 2 4 h s 3 h δ g 0 39 kj mol there are 69 sulfur reducing genera that have been identified in the bacteria domain affiliated with nine phyla such as aquificiae chrysiogenetes deferribacteres firmicutes proteobacteria thermodesulfobacteria thermotogae spirochaetes and synergistetes in the archaea domain 37 genera affiliated with two phyla euryarchaeota and crenarchaeota have been identified as s0 reducers florentino et al 2016b s0 reducing archaea are generally hyperthermophilic and they have been seldom reported for mesophilic wastewater treatment processes s0rb utilize a broad spectrum of organics such as acetate formate sugars lactate propionate ethanol and yeast extract hedderich et al 1998 besides some s0rb can utilize other electron acceptors such as sulfite thiosulfate oxygen ferric nitrate and nitrite table 1 notably a small fraction of sulfate reducing bacteria srb such as desulfurobacterium desulfuromusa desulfovibrio desulfitibacter and desulfobacter are also capable of s0 reduction table 1 2 1 2 main enzymes associated with s0 reduction the biochemical mechanisms underlying s0 reduction and the nature of the involved enzymes remain incompletely understood three main enzymes polysulfide reductase psr sulfur reductase sre and sulfide dehydrogenase sudh involved in s0 reduction fig 1 have been purified and characterized in a limited number of s0 reducers florentino et al 2016b such as wolinella succinogenes pyrococcus furiosus acidianus ambivalens and desulfurellaceae family ma and adams 1994 hedderich et al 1998 florentino et al 2017 the membrane bound polysulfide reductase consists of three subunits psrabc psra is the catalytic subunit of the psr protein for polysulfide reduction to sulfide psrb on the periplasmic side of the membrane contains several fe s clusters likely mediating the electron transfer from the membrane anchor psrc to the catalytic subunit psra of the psr florentino et al 2016b the psr contains menaquinone which could serve as electron acceptor from hydrogenase and could also be electron donor for polysulfide s0 reduction membrane bound sulfur reductase is analogous to polysulfide reductase and consists of following subunits predicted by the operon sreabcde catalytic subunit srea fe s subunit sreb membrane anchor subunit srec and two subunits srede with unknown functions liu et al 2012 the sre reduces s0 polysulfide to sulfide with hydrogenase quinones cytochromes and nadph as the electron donors florentino et al 2017 when polysulfide is transported to cytoplasmic space it can be reduced to sulfide by the cytoplasmic sudh using nadph as the electron donor ma and adams 2001 this reductase consists of two subunits sudhab and contains two flavins and three different fe s clusters 2fe 2s 3fe 4s and 4fe 4s ma and adams 1994 however how these fe s clusters participate in electron transfers in s0 reduction still remains unknown the enzymes associated with s0 reduction include but not limited to the three discussed above further research can be focused on the s0 reduction functions of these enzymes and discovering new enzymes responsible for s0 reduction 2 2 s0 oxidation 2 2 1 s0 oxidizing bacteria s0 oxidizing bacteria s0ob can reduce oxidative substances nitrate nitrite ferric ion etc using s0 as electron donor with sulfate being the by product taking nitrate as an example eq 2 in principle s0 oxidation can be employed for nitrate perchlorate and oxidative metals removal from water and wastewater phototrophic sulfide oxidizing bacteria can oxidize s0 but they are only employed for sulfide instead of s0 oxidation in specific environmental biotechnologies for wastewater treatment pokorna and

conditions odintsova et al 1996 muyzer et al 2013 as such the applications of s0ob based environmental technology are not restricted to neutral conditions but include bioleaching of heavy metals under acidic conditions liu et al 2008 and others the detailed information about the typical chemotrophic s0ob is shown in table s1 2 2 2 main enzymes associated with s0 oxidation microbial s0 oxidation is a complicated process that is associated with various enzymes proteins and sulfur intermediates in different cellular compartments and several related genes and proteins have so far been characterized kletzin et al 2004 ghosh and dam 2009 yin et al 2014 wang et al 2019b thus the possible s0 oxidizing pathways have been depicted for some s0ob particularly for acidithiobacillus spp fig 2 such as a thiooxidans and a ferrooxidans yin et al 2014 wang et al 2019b the s0 metabolic process is generally summarized into two different pathways i e sulfur oxidizing enzyme sox dependent i e a thiooxidans and sox independent s0 oxidation i e a ferrooxidans generally extracellular s0 can first be activated by thiol containing omp while forming thiol bound sulfane sulfur atoms r s snh and is then transported to the periplasmic space rohwerder and sand 2003 where various enzymes such as sox system not present in sox independent s0 oxidation pathway tetrathionate hydrolase teth thiosulfate dehydrogenase tsd participate the further oxidation of r s snh fig 2 in the cytoplasmic membrane sulfide quinone oxidoreductase sqr oxidizes hydrogen sulfide to s0 which may be re oxidized or mobilized into the cytoplasmic space chen et al 2012 in the cytoplasmic space s0 is further oxidized to sulfite by a series of enzymes such as sulfur oxygenase reductase sor rhodanese tst hdr like complex hdr and sulfur dioxygenase sdo wang et al 2019b sulfite is then oxidized to sulfate either via the sulfite acceptor oxidoreductase saor rohwerder and sand 2003 ghosh and dam 2009 or the adenosine 5 phosphosulfate aps oxidation pathway kletzin et al 2004 under neutral or alkaline conditions if sulfide is present in the extracellular environments polysulfide involved s0 oxidation may occur polysulfide could cross the cell membrane to the periplasm followed by the complete oxidation to sulfate via a series of enzymes or enzyme complexes and electron transport chain reactions likely similar to those in acidithiobacillus spp ghosh and dam 2009 for more detailed and comprehensive information about s0 oxidation systems and the related electron transfer pathways readers can refer to kletzin et al 2004 dahl and friedrich 2008 wang et al 2019b and yin et al 2014 3 s0 based biotechnologies for water and wastewater treatment over the past few decades biotechnologies driven by s0 reduction and or oxidation have been fruitfully developed for water and wastewater treatment it is vital to notice that such applications are cost efficient and practically feasible these s0 based biotechnologies can be categorized into three groups a s0 used as electron acceptor for organic removal b s0 used as electron donor for nitrate perchlorate and oxidative metals removal and c s0 used to generate sulfide for heavy metal precipitation 3 1 achieving sludge reduction during high rate organic carbon removal the treatment and disposal of excess activated sludge have always been a challenging issue in wastewater treatment plants wwtps minimizing sludge production by anaerobic wastewater treatment processes is a promising approach guo et al 2013 s0 reduction process has recently been demonstrated to be an efficient anaerobic wastewater treatment process with a high organic removal rate of 1 71 kg cod m3 d and a hydraulic retention time hrt of 3 h cod chemical oxygen demand zhang et al 2018b the sludge yield was 0 16 kg vss kg cod which is much lower than that of conventional activated sludge process 0 35 0 47 kg vss kg cod wei et al 2003 the obtained high rate performance was attributed to the polysulfide involved indirect s0 reduction zhang et al 2018c the s0 reduction during domestic wastewater treatment was mainly mediated by the s0 reducers geobacter and desulfomicrobium zhang et al 2018b the produced sulfide could be further used as the electron donor for autotrophic denitrification which is particularly suitable for the treatment of low c n ratio wastewater show et al 2013 huang et al 2021 however s0 derived compounds i e sulfate still remain in the effluent likely causing secondary sulfate pollution a promising solution is to terminate sulfide oxidation at s0 via controlling the molar ratio of nitrate sulfide n s at an optimal level i e 0 4 lin et al 2018 the biogenic sulfide can also be recovered and recycled via micro aeration zhang et al 2018d developed an internal sulfur cycling isc process consisting of a s0 reducing reactor and a sulfide oxidizing reactor to recover s0 fig 3 the 200 days of stable operation of the lab scale isc system demonstrated that 94 of the influent cod 300 mg l were removed without excessive sludge withdrawal and 76 of the produced sulfide were selectively oxidized to s0 for recycling clostridium played an important role in s0 reduction while halothiobacillus and thiomonas contributed to sulfide oxidation to s0 under micro aerobic conditions 3 2 cost efficient removal of nitrate from low c n ratio wastewater reduced sulfur species i e sulfide s0 and thiosulfate have been often reported to participate in chemolithotrophic denitrification as electron donors cui et al 2019 the denitrification rate with the three types of electron donors follows the order of thiosulfate sulfide s0 considering operational cost and sulfate production elemental sulfur based autotrophic denitrification sadn has competitive advantages over thiosulfate or sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification for instance thiosulfate driven autotrophic denitrification has the highest operation cost and sulfate production 0 72 kg nitrate and 11 07 g so4 2 g no3 n di capua et al 2019 although the operational cost and sulfate production during sulfide driven denitrification are lower than that of sadn 5 58 g so4 2 g no3 n vs 7 54 g so4 2 g no3 n 0 19 kg nitrate vs 0 43 kg nitrate cui et al 2019 the use of sulfide chemicals induces safety issues and a negative public image s0 oxidation can achieve complete denitrification and partial denitrification under favorable conditions which are discussed further 3 2 1 complete denitrification sadn is an appealing low cost process for nitrogen removal eq 2 from drinking water stormwater runoff groundwater and low c n ratio wastewater sierra alvarez et al 2007 shao et al 2010 wang et al 2016 equally important sadn produces less or similar n2o compared to heterotrophic denitrification 0 01 0 6 vs 0 005 1 2 of the nitrogen load zhang et al 2015b zhu et al 2018 kampschreur et al 2009 thiobacillus and sulfurimonas are often reported to be two dominant autotrophic denitrifiers in sadn systems table s2 sadn removes one gram nitrate consuming 4 57 g alkalinity as caco3 cui et al 2019 thus it declines system ph and possibly influences nitrogen removal s0 packed bed reactors s0 pbrs supplemented with limestone called s0 limestone autotrophic denitrification slad are often employed in which limestone is served as the neutralizer for balancing ph and inorganic carbon for microbial synthesis solid s0 and limestone can also serve as carriers to support biofilm development which is beneficial for biomass retention and performance improvement of nitrate removal other solid phase buffers calcite crushed oyster shells etc are also used cui et al 2019 in addition membrane bioreactors mbrs with bicarbonate have been applied to achieve high biomass retention and increase effluent quality sahinkaya et al 2015 zhang et al 2015a ucar et al 2020 ucar et al 2021 sadn has been applied at pilot scale for drinking water production from nitrate contaminated groundwater shao et al 2010 wang et al 2019c it has also been applied in pilot and full scale systems for treating wwtp effluent sahinkaya et al 2014 more information about sadn achieved in different systems as well as process performance is presented in table s2 sulfate generation is a major concern during sadn process although sulfate concentration is not regulated by the wastewater discharge standards the maximum sulfate concentration in drinking water set by us epa is 250 mg l zhang et al 2015a which is equivalent to the amount of sulfate produced from complete removal of around 33 mg n l nitrate sahinkaya et al 2011 a high sulfate concentration can result in a noticeable taste 400 mg l or even diarrhea 1000 1200 mg l huang et al 2018 one compromised approach is to couple s0 based autotrophic denitrification and heterotrophic denitrification to form mixotrophic denitrification as heterotrophic denitrification produces alkalinity and reduces sulfate production zhang et al 2015a integrating sadn with iron based autotrophic denitrification is another solution with more competitive advantages in addition to avoid the secondary pollution caused by residual organics in mixotrophic denitrification zhu et al 2018 demonstrated that a sadn system supplemented with siderite feco3 not only reduced sulfate production but also significantly improved nitrate removal rate eq 3 it was due to the synergistic effects of s0 and feco3 on denitrification this process was also demonstrated in a pilot scale system wang et al 2019c similar with siderite iron sulfides e g pyrrhotite eq 4 can also be used to reduce sulfate production and improve nitrate removal in sadn systems hu et al 2020 li et al 2020a of note the produced fe iii could further remove phosphate via sorption process wilfert et al 2015 kumar et al 2019 3 fec o 3 0 2 no 3 1 6 h 2 o fe oh 3 0 1 n 2 0 8 c o 2 0 2 hco 3 δ g 0 54 3 kj mol 4 fes 1 8 no 3 1 6 h 2 o fe oh 3 0

accumulated if this ratio is applied it could be attributed to the limited mass transfer from solid to liquid phase caused by the low aqueous solubility of s0 and or the different competitive capabilities of enzymes associated with nitrogen oxides reduction e g no3 no2 n2o for limited electron donors oberoi et al 2021 biogenic s0 hereafter referred to as bio s0 has higher bioavailability than chemically synthesized s0 hereafter referred to as chem s0 hence bio s0 would result in lower accumulation of intermediates during nitrate reduction to minimize nitrite accumulation s0 is usually present in a large stoichiometric excess to supply sufficient electron donors zhang et al 2015a ucar et al 2020 3 2 2 partial denitrification coupled with anammox process partial denitrification no3 no2 coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process pd a is an attractive autotrophic nitrogen removal process for energy efficient industrial and domestic wastewater treatment du et al 2019 the anammox process inevitably generates 11 of nitrate relative to the influent ammonium concentration heterotrophic denitrification process can be supplemented to remove nitrate from anammox system to apply the right amount of organics for denitrification is very complicated likely leading to secondary pollution alternatively sadn process could replace full denitrification to supplement anammox process with nitrite as only after conversion to nitrite further denitrification to nitrogen gas occurs eqs 5 and 6 chen et al 2018 s n ratio is a critical factor influencing nitrite accumulation during sadn as stated above when s0 is supplied according to the stoichiometric s n ratio nitrite build up can be achieved however it is highly uncertain if efficient conversion of nitrate to nitrite can be obtained thus in practice s0 is excessive in reactors how to optimize the s n ratio to achieve effective nitrite accumulation still needs further investigation feed ph and temperature are the other two key factors weak alkaline conditions could encourage nitrate conversion while minimizing nitrite removal chen et al 2018 although temperature has a minor impact on nitrate and nitrite removal appropriate temperature would be beneficial for denitrifying activity and could result in satisfactory nitrite accumulation owing to the faster rate of nitrate reduction over nitrite reduction for example chen et al 2018 obtained more than 95 of nitrite accumulation with an influent nitrate concentration of 100 mg n l in a sadn system at ph 8 5 and 35 c the feasibility of s0 driven autotrophic pd a process has been further demonstrated by treating fluorine containing semiconductor wastewater rich in ammonia and nitrate li et al 2019 the total nitrogen removal efficiency reached 98 with an influent total nitrogen loading rate of 4 19 kg m3 d 5 3 no 3 s 0 h 2 o 3 no 2 so 4 2 2 h δ g 0 277 8 kj mol 6 nh 4 no 2 n 2 2 h 2 o δ g 0 357 8 kj mol 3 3 treating drinking water resources contaminated with nitrate and perchlorate autotrophic s0 oxidation can also be employed to efficiently remove perchlorate from surface water groundwater and drinking water via reduction process with chloride ions being the end product eq 7 ju et al 2007 sahu et al 2009 wan et al 2017 wan et al 2019a perchlorate often co contaminates with nitrate in surface water and groundwater wan et al 2017 microbial community analysis showed that sulfuricella sulfuritalea thiobacillus and sulfurimonas were the effective autotrophic denitrifiers perchlorate reducing bacteria wan et al 2017 observed that a lab scale s0 pbr operated at a low hrt 0 75 h simultaneously removed 97 of the influent nitrate 22 mg n l and perchlorate 472 μg l or 22 mg l however when perchlorate concentration decreased to a low level s0 disproportionation to sulfide and sulfate initiated eq 8 resulting in excessive sulfate production and alkaline consumption wan et al 2019a wan et al 2019b combining heterotrophic denitrification and sadn could be a solution to prohibit s0 disproportionation in which a heterotrophic reactor was followed by a s0 autotrophic reactor chsas wan et al 2019a in the chsas both heterotrophic and autotrophic processes remove perchlorate and nitrate thereby reducing sulfate production lowering the hrt as much as possible without sacrificing the system s performance could also restrict s0 disproportionation however the right amount of organic dosage is difficult to control the feasibility of the chsas still needs to be further demonstrated before practical application 7 3

oxidation can be employed for metal removal from water and wastewater biogenic sulfide produced from s0 reduction can directly precipitate metals cu ii pb ii fe ii cd ii zn ii ni ii hg ii etc via forming insoluble metal sulfides when treating arsenic and mercury contaminated wastewater s0 reduction exhibited competitive advantages over sulfate reduction discussed separately the immobilization of chromium is also highlighted separately because hexavalent chromium cr vi can be reduced by biogenic sulfide or autotrophic s0 oxidation 3 4 1 s0 driven sulfidogenic process for metal laden wastewater treatment sulfate reduction has been widely applied for metal laden wastewater treatment in practice such as metallurgical wastewater and amd neculita et al 2007 however organic content in metal laden wastewater is generally too low to achieve high rate sulfate reduction process neculita et al 2007 supplementing additional carbon sources would certainly increase the operational cost and in return limit its wide application s0 reduction could be a promising alternative that requires only two electrons per sulfide instead of the eight electrons demanded by sulfate reduction eqs 9 vs 10 this theoretically reduces 75 of organic consumption compared to sulfate reduction an experimental study on the laboratory scale amd system showed the s0 reduction could reduce 25 6 78 9 of the chemical cost for sulfide production compared to sulfate reduction sun et al 2020a desulfomicrobium as a facultative s0rb was found to predominate in the reactor which preferentially utilized s0 rather than sulfate as the electron acceptors in the presence of sulfide it may be due to the presence of polysulfide sn 2 in such scenario where it is rapidly formed by the abiotic reaction between sulfide and s0 eq 11 and the facultative s0 reducers tend to grow on polysulfide instead of sulfate eq 12 it is because the activation of sulfate consumes atp whereas polysulfide does not poser et al 2013 as such even sulfate is more bioaccessible than s0 high rate s0 driven sulfidogenic processes 53 63 mg s l h are still viable table 2 li et al 2021 has recently tested this concept in a pilot scale system treating real cu laden electroplating wastewater however the s0 reduction rate was lower than those obtained in laboratory scale studies table 2 it may be due to the fact that s0rb could only use simple organics which is commonly used in the laboratory scale studies and the hydrolysis fermentation of macromolecular organic compounds in domestic wastewater could a rate limiting step when treating amd without ph amelioration the s0 reduction rate can still be up to 36 mg s l h under extremely acidic conditions ph 2 6 3 5 sun et al 2020b which is comparable to sulfate reduction processes operated under neutral conditions table 2 the s0 reduction was due to the suppression of sulfate reduction and the flourish of s0rb i e desulfurella sun et al 2020b direct cell s0 contact and extracellular electron transfer eet were proposed to be responsible for s0 utilization under acidic conditions additionally an acidic s0 reducing bioreactor can further reduce chemical needs for alkaline supply and warrants further investigation to verify its feasibility in pilot or full scale applications 9 so 4 2 10 h 8 e h 2 s 4 h 2 o 10 s 0 2 h 2 e h 2 s 11 h s n 1 8 s 8 s n 2 h 12 hco 2

bangladesh hossain 2006 arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are the most common arsenic species in aquatic environment and the former has much higher mobility and toxicity than the latter straif et al 2009 biogenic sulfide produced from sulfate reduction can remove as iii via the formation of insoluble arsenic sulfide precipitates as2s3 and ass eqs 13 and 14 de matos et al 2018 sulfide can also chemically reduce as v to as iii finally immobilize as as as2s3 and ass gorny et al 2015 however in practice sulfate reduction could not achieve satisfactory and stable removal of arsenic from wastewater owing to the generation of soluble thioarsenite as oh s2 2 it is a result of the elevated ph and excessive hs produced during sulfate reduction which promote the production of thioarsenic complexes eq 15 couture and van cappellen 2011 to minimize the formation of thioarsenic complexes the ph should be less than 6 9 at a high as s molar ratio 0 67 or lower than 5 5 at a low as s molar ratio 0 05 sun et al 2019 s0 reduction under acidic conditions is a promising alternative as this process produces high amount of sulfide without elevating ph sun et al 2019 found that the effluent from a s0 packed reactor operated at ph of approximately 4 3 could efficiently remove arsenic 99 without thioarsenite formation with a wide as s molar ratio range 0 05 0 55 however the produced sulfide is still in surplus even after complete arsenic removal the sulfide likely results in equipment corrosion especially under acidic conditions which means that counteractive measures need to be employed to avoid such corrosion issues additional process such as sulfide oxidation is required to remove or convert the formed sulfide into benign form such as s0 or sulfate zhang et al 2018d 13 2 h

aquatic environments are highly toxic to humans and other organisms although sulfate reduction could remove mercury via forming mercury sulfide precipitate most srb are mercury methylators which means that they can transform mercury ions hg ii to neurotoxic methylmercury mehg in the presence of organics and sulfate fig 4 king et al 2002 s0 reduction has recently achieved efficient mercury removal without mehg accumulation wang et al 2018 a 326 day study of s0 reduction process treating mercury contaminated wastewater showed that such process efficiently removed hg ii with concentration ranging from 0 to 50 mg l without mehg detection wang et al 2019a a significant decrease in the abundance of mercury methylation functional gene hgca was observed over time but it did not completely disappear geobacter and desulfumicrobium were the main identified s0rb and some members of them are mercury methylators podar et al 2015 however the mechanisms accounting for the absence of mehg in the process are still unknown the study proposed that the absence of mehg may be possibly ascribed to the binding between dissolved organic matter dom and hg ii thereby inhibiting mercury methylation fig 4 wang et al 2018 therefore the mechanisms towards the absence of mehg should be further investigated the excessive sulfide should also be removed via additional process as mentioned above 3 4 4 chromium reduction and immobilization chromium is often detected in various industrial wastewaters e g leather tanning mine tailing and electroplating surface water and groundwater cr vi and cr iii are the primary forms of chromium in nature cr vi is soluble in water teratogenic and carcinogenic in contrast cr iii generally exists in the form of insoluble amorphous hydroxide cr oh 3 under neutral conditions the common practice for detoxifying chromium is to reduce cr vi to cr iii followed by immobilization as cr oh 3 sahinkaya et al 2012 sulfide generated from s0 reduction can chemically reduce cr vi to cr iii sahinkaya et al 2012 eq 16 autotrophic s0 oxidation can also be employed to promote the cr vi reduction shi et al 2019 in the process autotrophic bacteria e g thiobacillus ferrovibrio first synthesize volatile fatty acids vfas via bicarbonate reduction with s0 oxidation to sulfate heterotrophic metal reducing microbes e g geobacter then reduce such metals with vfas as the electron donors and carbon sources such process is very promising for oxidative metal removal from contaminated surface water or groundwater without adding organic carbon the same research group also demonstrated that autotrophic s0 oxidation can be employed to reduce vanadium v v to v iv further immobilized as vo oh 2 with similar mechanisms with cr vi bioreduction zhang et al 2018a we could expect that the s0 oxidation could be extended to reduce other oxidative metals such as selenate and antimonite 16 2 cro 4 2 3 h s 7 h 2 cr oh 3 3 s 0 2 h 2 o 4 pathways of s0 respiring bacteria accessing s0 and strengthened strategies the extremely low water solubility of s0 suggests a poor bioaccessibility thereby impairing the applicability of s0 based biotechnologies understanding how microbes access s0 is beneficial for process optimization and scale up so far there are four putative possible mechanisms for making s0 bioavailable to microorganisms fig 5 1 direct cell s0 contact pathways 1 and 2 2 polysulfide involvement pathway 3 and 3 extracellular electron transfer eet pathways 3 and 4 it is of note that all or part of the pathways could occur concomitantly depending on the microbial community and environment 4 1 direct cell s0 contact physical attachment of s0 respiring bacteria to s0 particles is an important way for microbial s0 uptake fig 5 there are two possible pathways for microbial s0 utilization when microorganisms attach onto the surface of s0 particles first the interaction between sulfur particles and the thiol groups present on special outer membrane proteins can generate thiol bound sulfane sulfur atoms which is then transported into the periplasm rohwerder and sand 2003 second s0 respiring bacteria could directly uptake the polymeric sulfur commercial sulfur products consist of thermodynamically stable octasulfane ring s8 and chain like macromolecules of polymeric sulfur the binding energy between s s bonds in s8 rings is 2 4 kj mol stronger than that of polymeric sulfur sulfur chain franz et al 2007 polymeric sulfur may be more bioaccessible than cyclo octasulfur s8 to s0 respiring bacteria s0 type concentration and particle size are important factors influencing the direct s0 cell efficacy mineral sulfur chem s0 bio s0 and colloidal s0 are the most common types of elemental sulfur table 3 mineral sulfur usually contains impurities such as arsenic selenium clay and calcite thus it is not suitable for wastewater treatment in practice chem s0 also called sulfur flower is generally obtained by claus process fischer 1978 or by sublimation and condensation of mineral sulfur or industrial sulfur bio s0 is produced in biological treatment of sulfide containing wastewaters huang et al 2017 huang et al 2021 flue gases lin et al 2018 blázquez et al 2019a or h2s rich biogas pokorna and zabranska 2015 it should be noted that bio s0 produced by sulfide oxidizing bacteria thiobacillus acidithiobacillus etc can be stored intracellularly or extracellularly kleinjan et al 2003 huang et al 2021 when sulfide supply is sufficient the intracellularly produced s0 can be secreted by bacteria to outside the bacterial cells li et al 2020b colloidal s0 is produced via the grinding of s0 particles with a colloidal mill machine or by the acidification of polysulfide or thiosulfate florentino et al 2015 the high cost of colloidal s0 production limits its application in water and wastewater treatment hereinafter we only discuss chem s0 and bio s0 in the context of water and wastewater treatment chem s0 is strongly hydrophobic and not easily dispersed in water limiting mass transfer from the solid to aqueous phase and reducing microbial utilization rate sierra alvarez et al 2007 in contrast bio s0 particles primarily consist of orthorhombic s0 rings surrounded by a layer of long chain polymers i e polysulfide and polythionates with hydrophilic properties di capua et al 2019 due to the microcrystallinity structure high specific surface area and solubility bio s0 particles have higher bioavailability than chem s0 florentino et al 2015 kostrytsia et al 2018 although bio s0 is superior to chem s0 a limited number of batch studies demonstrated its feasibility to support denitrification only two studies so far reported autotrophic denitrification based on bio s0 in mbrs ucar et al 2020 ucar et al 2021 in which bio s0 did not result in a significantly different microbial community from that with chem s0 however it should be noted that bio s0 is not always available at every site considering the local availability of sulfur sources chem s0 has been more frequently utilized in real applications increasing s0 concentration is beneficial for physical attachment of microbes onto s0 particles there is a s0 concentration threshold by which s0 mass transfer is no longer the rate limiting step sierra alvarez et al 2007 such threshold is actually influenced by many factors such as particle size microbial activity indicating that it is case specific for example sierra alvarez et al 2007 found that the denitrification rate had a positive correlation with the concentration of fine s0 particles 10 130 μm only ranging from 0 234 mg l additionally decreasing s0 particle size can increase the specific surface area enhance the mass transfer efficiency and also provide greater area for biofilm growth moon et al 2006 koenig and liu 2001 found that the denitrification rate increased from 0 3 kg no3 n m3 d to 0 77 kg no3 n m3 d when the size of s0 particles decreased from 11 2 16 mm to 2 8 5 6 mm in a s0 pbr the s0 fine powder would be preferably utilized in activated sludge systems and membrane reactors sahinkaya et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b qiu et al 2020 however in s0 pbrs excessively small s0 particles would result in an extremely low bed porosity clogging and channeling as well as limited biofilm development which certainly deteriorate the system performance when used for denitrification n2 entrapment could also occur in practice in order to achieve desirable process performance s0 particle size should be as smaller as it can on the premise of minimizing the risks of the above stated issues according to previous studies s0 particle sizes at mm level 0 5 mm 16 mm have been frequently utilized in laboratory and pilot scale s0 pbrs treating nitrate contaminated water and wastewater di capua et al 2015 wang et al 2019c as for s0 reduction previous studies showed that the particles sizes of 0 6 50 mm were used in pbrs sahinkaya et al 2012 zhang et al 2018d sun et al 2019 sun et al 2020b thus in practice s0 particle size used for s0 reduction can be larger than that for denitrification in pbrs especially under neutral or alkaline conditions where the presence of abundant polysulfide ensures highly efficient system performance 4 2 polysulfide as the electron shuttle under neutral or alkaline conditions the nucleophilic attack of s0 by hs results in the nucleophilic cleavage of s8 rings and the formation of small polysulfide molecules eq 11 florentino et al 2016b polysulfide molecules can pass through the cell membrane via channels or other designated polysulfide binding carrier proteins and react with the cytoplasmic sulfur transferases rabus et al 2013 florentino et al 2019 polysulfide remarkably enhances the bioavailability of s0 and thus greatly accelerates the process rates for sulfur reduction or oxidation for the purpose of water wastewater treatment polysulfide concentration is mainly influenced by solution ph and sulfide concentration at neutral ph the polysulfide concentration at equilibrium does not exceed 10 50 μm when sulfide concentration increases from 1 to 10 mm at ph 10 polysulfide is the main form of sulfide in the presence of sufficient s0 sorokin et al 2010 under neutral alkaline conditions polysulfide is a key electron acceptor donor during s0 metabolism berg et al 2014 liang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018c zhang et al 2018c observed that analogous to a chain reaction fig 6 eqs 11 and 12 the rate of s0 reduction via polysulfide accelerates until the sulfide concentration inhibits sulfidogenic activity it was observed that with the involvement of polysulfide in sulfur reduction process the sulfur reduction rate was approximately 40 times higher than that in the absence of polysulfide zhang et al 2018c when the ph is below 6 0 under which polysulfide formation is almost completely inhibited the s0 reduction oxidation rate is significantly lower than that under neutral or alkaline conditions sun et al 2019 the ph also influences the biological s0 respiration activity therefore when treating amd ph amelioration could not only improve s0 reducing activity but also enhance s0 bioaccessibility due to the involvement of polysulfide under acidic conditions the s0 could be mainly utilized by eet and direct cell s0 contact fig 6 it should be pointed out that s0 reduction oxidation consumes alkalinity to counteract the decrease in ph addition of alkaline substance is required for instance as stated above during s0 driven autotrophic denitrification bicarbonate limestone or other solid phase buffers calcite crushed oyster shells etc are usually utilized cui et al 2019 increasing sulfide concentration would also increase polysulfide concentration under neutral alkaline conditions since sulfide is produced during s0 reduction process satisfied system performance can be achieved as long as the ph in the systems can be maintained at around neutral alkaline conditions as for s0 oxidation adding exogenous sulfide or organics is a feasible strategy for facilitating s0 oxidizing efficiency for instance in addition to being directly used as electron donor sulfide can result in polysulfide formation thereby enhancing s0 bioavailability and improving nitrogen removal in sadn systems qiu et al 2020 exogenous sulfide addition can be substituted by organics which could be due to the sulfide produced in the deep layer of biofilm growing on s0 particles qiu et al 2020 s0 disproportionation could be another possible strategy for in situ sulfide source eq 8 which merits further study although sulfur disproportionation is endergonic under standard conditions it has been reported to occur in engineered systems and natural environments poser et al 2013 qiu et al 2020 wan et al 2019a wan et al 2019b müller et al 2020 in addition although temperature also influences polysulfide concentration under a certain condition its effect may not be significant during mesophilic wastewater treatment processes as for the mesophilic bacteria low temperature would slow down microbial s0 utilization rate 4 3 extracellular electron transfer eet eet is the process by which microorganisms utilize insoluble electron donors or acceptors eet pathway for biological s0 oxidation has not been reported yet according to the previously acquired knowledge on electroactive bacteria such as metal utilizing bacteria e g shewanella geobacter and srb choi and sang 2016 among which some members of srb shewanella and geobacter can perform dissimilatory s0 reduction eet could likely be applicable for s0 reduction three eet pathways likely involved in s0 reduction could be proposed fig 5 florentino et al 2016b first c type cytochromes extend the respiratory chains to the cell surface to contact with s0 on which they transport respiratory electrons in the cytoplasmic membrane through the periplasm and the outer membrane to the surface of s0 particles the outer membrane cytochromes then catalyze extracellular s0 reduction at the surface of outer membrane of bacteria second extracellular redox mediators such as flavins phenazines humic substances and quinones can function as electron shuttles to transport electrons between the cells and the insoluble s0 polysulfide could also be considered an extracellular redox mediator to shuttle electrons between microorganisms and s0 particles third in the absence of c type cytochromes lovley et al 1995 microbes could form extracellular pili also called nanowires that are composed of protein filaments and anchored on the cell envelope shi et al 2016 these nanowires build an electrical bridge connecting cells and solid materials therefore adding extracellular redox mediators or conductive materials activated carbon carbon nanotube iron oxides etc to enhance electron transfer could be practically feasible strategies for improving s0 bio utilization efficiency which merits further investigation additionally s0 type concentration and particle size also need to be considered when improving eet efficiency 5 future perspectives although the applications of s0 during water and wastewater have drawn increasing attention and substantial progresses have been achieved in recent years many issues related to the basic mechanisms and the applications of s0 based biotechnologies remain unanswered and should be a goal of future research increasing s0 bioavailability is the key step to broaden the applications of s0 based biotechnologies the low bioavailability of s0 due to its extremely low aqueous solubility limits the scale up and wide applications of s0 based biotechnologies despite some viable approaches have been demonstrated to improve s0 bio utilization efficiency more versatile strategies are desired to make them more competitive and robust we propose to focus on understanding and regulation of bio chemical processes during the interface between s0 particle and biofilm exploring s0 surface modification introducing extracellular redox mediators or conductive materials into the s0 based systems and optimizing the polysulfide formation in bioprocesses s0 disproportionation is an important process in the globally biochemical sulfur cycle and s0 disproportionating bacteria have been detected in freshwater and marine sediments as well as bio augmented systems s0 disproportionation could be potentially employed to simultaneously provide readily bioavailable electron donor and acceptor for water and wastewater treatment however the engineering application of s0 disproportionation in water or wastewater treatment processes is yet to be reported future research could direct towards developing novel s0 disproportionation based water and wastewater treatment processes bio s0 is a biological waste product and has higher bioaccessibility than chem s0 more efforts should be dedicated to apply bio s0 in these biotechnologies and to determine whether and how bio s0 affects sulfur metabolism however bio s0 is not universally available the cost caused by transportation should be taken into account within cost benefit analysis to have a more sustainable approach sulfur source could be recovered and recycled via additional processes for example the biogenic sulfide can be re oxidized to s0 via micro aeration or sulfide driven autotrophic denitrification show et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 the by product sulfate could also be turned into s0 via bioelectrochemical systems blázquez et al 2016 blázquez et al 2019b the recovery and or recycle of s0 could help in closing the loop thereby boosting the circular economy thus the integrated s0 based biotechnologies with bioelectrochemical systems can be another future research direction interspecific interactions are expected to play a more crucial role in maintaining system functions than individual populations which could contribute to enhance s0 bioavailability and promote system performance for example fermentative bacteria can decompose macromolecular organic substrates to simple ones to support the activity and respiration of s0rb in sadn systems the sulfide produced by sulfidogenic bacteria can improve s0 bioaccessibility therefore improving denitrification mediated by nitrate reducing bacteria accordingly microbial community structure and microbial interactions at the whole community level and molecular level should be further investigated via emerging techniques e g metagenomic transcriptomic and proteomic analysis as well as stable isotope labeling this information will be beneficial for optimizing process performance via calibrating operation parameters and facilitating the preferable microbial pathways a suite of s0 based technologies has recently been proposed in laboratory studies but only s0 driven autotrophic denitrification and s0 reduction for metal laden wastewater treatment have so far been demonstrated in pilot or full scale applications these studies have shown a proof of concept it is now time to establish more demonstrations to bring these technologies to full scale applications development and validation of mathematical modeling to determine the key process parameters can assist their scale up and allow the technologies to be more practically feasible in addition treatment of emerging contaminants pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps biocides nanoparticles and micro nanoplastics etc has been becoming a major challenge during water and wastewater treatment in order to meet increasingly strict effluent quality criteria the fate of emerging contaminants in the s0 based systems and how these emerging contaminants influence the performance of s0 based biotechnologies and s0 related microbial community should not be overlooked 6 conclusions elemental sulfur a non toxic cheap insoluble and easily available chemical has been used as electron donor and or acceptor in s0 based biotechnologies for water and wastewater treatment this study systematically reviews the principles microorganisms mechanisms and applications of s0 based biotechnologies s0 can undergo oxidative and reductive conversion by a wide array of organisms this has been recently explored in water and wastewater treatment targeting various contaminants compared to conventional water and wastewater treatment approaches s0 based biotechnologies could substantially reduce the operational cost caused by the addition of exogenous carbon sources methanol ethanol acetate glucose etc as the operational cost with s0 is much lower in terms of the cost per mol electron donor provided s0 based biotechnologies would not result in secondary pollution caused by residual organics the extremely low aqueous solubility of s0 is a primary bottleneck of achieving high level process performance which could be overcome by shedding more light on the fundamental mechanisms underlying microbes accessibility to s0 and microbial s0 metabolism self generated polysulfide has been proved to be an effective electron shuttle to break the bottleneck and greatly accelerate s0 based biotechnologies future studies on microbial and molecular ecology as well as mathematical modeling are deemed necessary for s0 based biotechnology scale up the fate of emerging pollutants and their interactions with microbial communities in s0 based biosystems should also be investigated certainly the versatility of s0 conversion will lead to new biotechnological processes for water and wastewater treatment in
