2765,a step drawdown test with an increasing pumping rate at each step in a fully penetrating well is a typical procedure for estimating aquifer parameters and well losses however partially penetrating wells in closed aquifers have also been adopted mainly due to economic constraints with a stepwise increase in the pumping rate in this study a new empirical method is proposed based on the stepwise drawdown defined by irregular pumping rates in a partially penetrating well the method was validated by fitting drawdown data from classical works the characteristics of the drawdowns and well losses were discussed for varying pumping scenarios the results indicate that the new empirical method interprets previous works more accurately for a fully penetrating well and also effectively estimates the aquifer and well loss parameters a new coefficient the pumping rate varying index α was introduced to indicate the pumping rate difference δq between the two steps as such a negative pumping rate difference would decrease the well loss and result in a negative α in addition the effect of the ratio of the well s screen length to aquifer thickness demonstrates that a longer screen would cause a larger well loss finally the proposed empirical method was applied to a fieldwork conducted in xiangyang city central china to investigate the aquifer and well loss parameters using the particle swarm optimization pso method keywords step drawdown test aquifer parameters well losses partially penetrating well particle swarm optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the step drawdown test is commonly designed to estimate aquifer parameters and well losses in a single well pumping test jacob 1946 clark 1977 kawecki 1995 a step drawdown is generally defined as a constant rate pumping test starting from an initial constant pumping rate while observing the water level that successively reaches a quasi steady state afterward the water level is allowed to decrease further due to a relatively high constant pumping rate for which the water level is monitored until a new quasi steady state is achieved by standards the process is recommended to be repeated at least three times which means that a step drawdown test commonly contains a minimum of four steps mathias and todman 2010 jacob 1946 suggested that the aquifer loss is proportional to the pumping rate while the well loss is assumed to be proportional to the square of the pumping rate subsequently rorabaugh 1953 proposed an extended equation where the well loss is a power function of the pumping rate with order p detailed information about the classical models is presented in the appendix rorabaugh s 1953 model was later on widely recognized by researchers who made efforts to determine the range of p for instance rorabaugh 1953 proposed that the value of p varies between 2 43 and 2 82 in a high discharge and may be equal to unity in cases of low discharge lennox 1966 reported that the value of p is as high as 3 5 sheahan 1971 presented a set of type curves by simplifying rorabaugh s 1953 solution and suggested p ranges from 1 7 to 4 0 it is notable that most previous research mainly focused on the well loss function and well loss power but they neglected the aquifer properties and the form of step drawdown test in the last few decades several methods have been developed to estimate the parameters of aquifer loss and well loss by analyzing the step drawdown tests based on the empirical equation since jacob 1946 introduced the definition of well loss graphical methods were commonly used to estimate the well loss coefficient rorabaugh 1953 sheahan 1971 birsoy and summers 1980 thereafter numerical methods and optimization methods were introduced into well loss estimation labadie and helweg 1975 sheahan 1975 gupta 1989 avci 1992 singh 2002 presented a new optimization method to estimate well loss by analyzing the variable rate pumping instead of a step drawdown test mathias and todman 2010 also used the forchheimer equation to analyze the step drawdown tests and provided an approximate method to estimate well loss by considering p 2 karami and younger 2002 presented a new transformation method to record the homogenization drawdown data in a confined heterogeneous aquifer during a step drawdown test however a careful review of relevant literature highlights that most of these methods are based on the following two assumptions 1 the well is a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer 2 the pumping rate rises for each step for assumption 1 researchers did have methods of analyzing well losses in a partially penetrating well but these came with limitations for example wang and zhan 2015 2017 discussed the effect of intra wellbore head loss in a partially penetrating well with different boundaries in a vertical well and a horizontal well by the integral method this was done without applying a step drawdown pumping test which made the method hard to apply in fieldwork lyu et al 2021 and wu et al 2021 calculated the groundwater head distribution by analyzing the effects of a close barrier which would significantly affect the head distribution during the pumping test besides there are limited works that consider the well structure when exploring the well losses houben 2015 explained the mechanism of head loss in the well screen by establishing equations associated with the well screen diameter and flow velocity inside the well screen meanwhile the influence of the well structure still has not been well elucidated particularly for a partially penetrating well despite the different methods the common thread is that the linear aquifer loss component is applied for theis s 1935 equation which is well known and established for a fully penetrating well the differences between each method are commonly in the form of the well loss coefficient or the exponent of the well discharge p as a result there is still a need for a more convenient method for well loss estimation for a partially penetrating well in fieldwork as for the second assumption 2 clark 1977 made a step drawdown test in a fully penetrating well with detailed data for six steps that offered experimental data to validate the other methods after that gupta 1989 developed an interactive computer code to estimate aquifer characters based on the procedure of clark 1977 avci 1992 proposed a method considering the time dependency of the aquifer loss coefficient by analyzing two data sets kawecki 1995 proposed a new method to calculate the total well loss by considering the discharge differential δq in two steps as mentioned in assumption 2 the δq must be a positive value otherwise the method cannot be applied although the previous methods can solve most step drawdown problems and get highly accurate parameters of the aquifer there are still some real world problems for instance the existing classical models cannot estimate the well loss parameters in a partially penetrating well or if the pumping rate cannot be increased in each step in this study we propose a new method based on previous empirical equations for estimating aquifer and well loss parameters by a step drawdown test in a partially penetrating well with irregular non linear increased pumping rate which is an extension of the classical models with an increasing pumping rate step in a fully penetrating well the proposed method can be simplified to rorabaugh s 1953 method and it is validated by testing the results from clack 1977 finally the proposed method is applied to the data from actual fieldwork in xiangyang city central china the overall finding shows that the proposed method can provide new insights for the step drawdown tests and extend the application of step drawdown tests in the field 2 materials and methods as shown in fig 1 a partially penetrating well in a confined aquifer is considered several assumptions are adopted in this study 1 the aquifer is homogeneous radially isotropic extends infinitely and is closed with a finite constant thickness 2 the pumping rate changes instantaneously and keeps constant in each step 3 the well partially penetrates the aquifer with an infinitesimal radius 4 the system is hydrostatic before the pumping starts two main factors must be considered when solving the problem of parameter estimation by step drawdown tests in a partially penetrating well with irregularly changing pumping rates the first is the definition of the aquifer loss function a appendix eq a1 since it is not a fully penetrating well in the main aquifer this means that the problem does not fulfill the conditions of the theis 1935 solution the other issue is the components of the well loss function b appendix eq a1 which should reveal the irregular change in pumping rate and the relationship of well screen with the aquifer with these considerations the governing equation for drawdowns in a fully penetrating well is similar to the previous work chang and chen 2003 except for the inner boundary condition which turns the constant pumping rate q to an irregular changing pumping rate with time q t wen et al 2014 due to the complexity of solving a three dimensional flow problem around a partially penetrating well compared to a radial flow in a fully penetrating well most previous works turned the mathematical problems of a partially penetrating well into semi analytical solutions by fourier transform and laplace transform or numerical solutions by finite element method and finite difference method chiu et al 2010 mishra et al 2012 wen et al 2013 however in this study aquifer loss and well loss are considered simultaneously in a partially penetrating well making it hard to derive a mathematical solution hence an empirical equation like jacob 1946 method is commonly used for aquifer and well loss estimation the main innovation of this study is the determination of the aquifer loss function and well loss function in a partially penetrating well with irregular pumping rates as a result the aquifer loss function should conform to the fundamental seepage law and the classical models hantush 1961 proposed systematically the drawdown around a partially penetrating well in different aquifer situations which can be applied in this study for the aquifer head loss part eq a3 47according to hantush 1961 the aquifer loss function a based on the settings of fig 1 could be expressed as 1 a 1 4 π t w u r 2 m π l d n 1 1 n sin n π l m sin n π d m cos n π z m w u r n π r m k z k r where n is the finite cosine fourier transform variable mishra et al 2012 w u r and w u r n π r m k z k r are the well function and partially penetrating well function respectively there are two advantages to adopting eq 1 as aquifer loss function a on one hand a is derived from a partially penetrating well which can cover the fully penetrating well by adjusting the well length l and d on the other hand since it is a step drawdown test a real space domain expression a was easier to calculate by the superposition method in the postprocessing compared with a previous semi analytical solution in laplace domain avci 1992 avci et al 2010 jacob 1946 singh 2002 as for the well loss the commonly used processing method was to make the drawdown divided by a parametric constant such as pumping rate clark 1977 gupta 1989 or time singh 2002 which aims to turn the problem into a problem with a lower order these methods are then implemented by graphical techniques such as the linear graphic method eden and hazel 1973 which complicates the estimation process due to the difficulties in the characterization of a feasible linear relationship between pumping rate and time another way is to define a new expression for the well loss by introducing a coefficient with a certain physical significance mathias and todman 2010 for instance mathias and todman 2010 proposed an approximate solution by introducing a variable involving forchheimer parameter which indicated the flow seepage situation in a well similarly this study considers a new form of temporal pumping rate that is a negative δq value may exist during step drawdown test which is different from the test with a continuously increasing pumping rate in each step nevertheless a negative δq would lead to a negative well loss value which conflicts with its physical meaning as such it is critical to propose an appropriate expression of δq and quantify the influences of both δq and q on the well loss parameter thus a new coefficient referred to as the pumping rate varying index α is introduced to adjust the well loss differences caused by the pumping rate between two steps in order to keep consistent with the form of the pumping rate in the well loss function the power function with the exponent α is also used in the expression of δq the α value is dependent on the δq typically a positive δq would increase the well loss while a negative δq would decrease the well loss this implies that the α would also be a negative value in some cases besides the well loss part should also contain the partially penetrating well factor hence we also considered the influences of the well screen length on well loss parameter overall the expression of well loss in each step should comprise the pumping rate differences well screen length factor and the pumping rate which can be expressed as 2 s w q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α c l d m p q i p where s w is the total well loss q i is the pumping rate during the ith step of the pumping test q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α is the irregular pumping rate variation sign q i q i 1 is the sign function that keeps the well loss as a positive value which is particularly designed to solve a negative well loss problem c is the common well loss coefficient l d m p indicating the influence of well screen length on well loss hence this solution is different from previous ones as it includes a term for variable pumping rate loss and a term for partially penetrated screen loss which have been neglected in most previous studies therefore the ith step drawdown that considers the well loss can be summed up as 3 s 1 4 π t w u r 2 m π l d n 1 1 n sin n π l m sin n π d m cos n π z m w u r n π r m k z k r q i t q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α c l d m p q i t p above all eq 3 is a new empirical approach summarized and innovated from previous studies of step drawdown pumping test models in a fully penetrating well it extends the classical step drawdown pumping test model which accounts for a continuously rising pumping rate in a fully penetrating well by considering an irregularly changed pumping rate in a partially penetrating well finally the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 is employed to validate the model and estimate the aquifer and well loss parameters by comparing the objective function given as 4 r min h 1 n i 1 n s i h s c 2 where r is the objective function which means a lower r indicates a higher accuracy n is the number of the experimental data s i is the observed drawdown s c is the calculated drawdown the advantages of the pso method chen et al 2020 are 1 pso is flexible for a multiple parameters estimation and allows for quick modification of the number of parameters by only changing the initial setting which would not expand the calculations 2 pso method is rapidly convergent because it evolves by comparing the local extremum value with the global extremum value which would reduce the iteration quantity the basic hyperparameters setting of the pso in this study are n 40 60 80 number of particle swarm c 1 c 2 2 learning factors w 0 4 the inertia factor m 50 the iterations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation firstly the field data from clark 1977 was used to validate the model however as mentioned earlier the proposed solution is designed for a partially penetrating well whereas the previous methods were applied to a case where the well was fully penetrating for the case of a fully penetrating well the aquifer part which employed the theis 1935 model implies that the partially penetrating well term l d m would be set as 1 the eq 3 can be transformed as 5 s 1 4 π t w u r q i q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α c q i p the discharge rates from clark 1977 were set as q 1 1306 m3 day q 2 1693 m3 day q 3 2423 m3 day q 4 3261 m3 day q 5 4094 m3 day q 6 5019 m3 day respectively the pumping rate differences between the two steps were δq 1306 387 730 838 833 and 925 m3 d for this case respectively table 1 shows the results of aquifer and well loss parameters estimated by different models for the proposed method in this study the pumping rate varying index α for each step was estimated as α 1 1 68 α 2 9 83 α 3 1 59 α 4 1 50 α 5 0 88 α 6 0 97 respectively table 1 shows that the aquifer parameters t and s are in the same order of magnitude however for the well loss coefficient the results vary because each model considered diverse influencing factors eden and hazel 1973 used the linear graphic method by analyzing the relationship between the ratio of drawdown and flow rate with discharge rate singh 2002 calculated the well loss considering a variable pumping rate at each time step this study takes the pumping rate differentials into account fig 2 illustrates the drawdowns of each solution fitted with the experimental data of clark 1977 it can be concluded that these three models all provided superb fitting curves however it is noteworthy that the results estimated by this study fitted the data better according to the objective function r in table 1 which highlights that the estimation accuracy of the aquifer and well loss parameters would be increased when considering the pumping rate differences fig 2 also proves that this solution can be used for aquifer and well loss estimation in a fully penetrating well table 1 and fig 2 illustrate that this study can be compatible with the previous work and improve the accuracy of aquifer and well loss parameters furthermore the proposed empirical approach could also be applied in common step drawdown cases 3 2 analysis of each influence factor of the new method the following subsections aim to discuss the effects of pumping rate varying index α pumping rate difference δq and well screen length l d m on drawdowns and well losses previous research assumed that the well loss was mainly related to the pumping rate instead of the pumping rate difference δq what is different in this study is that we even account for the case of pumping rate with a non linear temporal variation and the partially penetrating well is also considered according to eq 2 when analyzing the effect of one parameter the other parameters are given constant 3 2 1 pumping rate varying index α when analyzing the effects of α the other parameters are given as k x 5 m d k z 0 5 m d s 10 4 p 2 c 10 6 q n 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 m3 d respectively additionally the aquifer thickness is set as 20 m and the well screen is assumed to be located in the middle of the aquifer with l d m 0 25 the effects of the pumping rate varying index α on the drawdown are shown in fig 3 it is notable that whatever the sign of α is the well loss would objectively exist consequently a larger α causes a larger well loss with the same δq in addition the value of α was calculated from the pumping rate in each step which enables the newly proposed model to characterize an irregularly changed step drawdown test with the consideration of a pumping rate varying index α this new model can be used to solve the problem in an et al 2020 that the well loss parameter could not be estimated with an exceptionally higher δq or a negative δq in fact it would be more precise to give a feasible range of α when it is introduced to improve the calculation accuracy of well loss caused by different δq but there is no previous work considering or deriving the relationship between α and δq meanwhile the current research indicates that the aquifer parameters are determined by the properties of the aquifer formation while the well loss parameters are dependent on the specific operational parameters of the pumping test therefore it is difficult to derive a constitutive relationship between aquifer and well loss parameters besides it can be speculated that α in each step would not vary tremendously because the pumping rate has very limited variation in the field step drawdown test due to pumping equipment 3 2 2 pumping rate difference δq fig 4 shows the well loss differences for increasing and decreasing pumping rate cases where α 0 01 the other parameters are the same to those used in fig 3 except for the pumping rates as shown in fig 4 a the well loss can be represented by the deviation between the curves that consider and those that do not consider well loss denoted in the legends of fig 4 a it is notable that the well loss increases with the increase of δq especially in the higher pumping rate stage since the eq 3 also indicates a direct relationship between the well loss and δq with a positive α however when δq is negative as fig 4 b indicates drawdowns decrease mainly due to the decreasing pumping rate while the well losses also decrease even for larger values of δq in fig 4 c the well losses clearly varied by plus or minus of δq which is different from the continuously increasing pumping rate models hence it can be concluded that the well loss is mainly influenced by the pumping rate in addition an introduction of the δq will improve the estimation accuracy of the step drawdown test with irregular pumping rates 3 2 3 well screen length l d fig 5 illustrates the relationship between well losses and the length of the well screen the parameters here are the same as those used in fig 4 except for l d m 0 25 0 5 0 5 1 it is important to note that regardless of the sign of δq the well loss is inversely proportional to the ratio of the well screen and the aquifer thickness in previous works the well loss in the well screen was generally related to the flow length and flow velocity for the same material chen et al 2003 houben 2015 a longer flow path and a faster velocity increase the well loss but it is hard to evaluate which of these factors has a greater influence hence in this study we treat the ratio of well screen length and aquifer thickness as a whole to discuss the influence of the partially penetrating term on the well loss overall the well loss only increased or decreased evidently for large pumping rate cases l d m 0 75 1 while the well loss varied inconspicuously for low pumping rate cases l d m 0 25 0 5 this suggests that for a water supply well in a high yield aquifer area a shorter well screen could be designed to satisfy the demand if the water supply well is located in a poor yield aquifer a longer well screen is recommended to increase the water extraction capacity 3 3 application of this study to data from a field experiment as mentioned previously there is limited research on aquifer parameter estimation for partially penetrating wells based on a step drawdown test generally it is challenging to perform an increasing pumping rate test with at least four steps in the field especially in the case of large pumping rates hence we conducted an irregular pumping rates step drawdown test with limited equipment in xiangyang city located in central china the proposed model was used to interpret the experimental data obtained from the field the data was obtained from the pumping well numbered xy001 located nearby the hanjiang river the geological formation is fluvial with lacustrine sedimentary conditions according to fig 6 the confined aquifer is composed of coarse sand and gravel with upper and lower clay aquiclude which indicates that the aquifer has a large water yield property hence it can be speculated that the water supply would satisfy a step drawdown test with different pumping rates even in a partially penetrating well the basic information about the test is as follows the testing aquifer begins from a depth of 13 m to 87 m the filter is between 60 and 72 m making it a partially penetrating well the well diameter is 0 3 m and the groundwater level was constant before the test the step drawdown test lasted for 10 h with 5 equal time interval steps with the pumping rates reported as q 1 1803 m3 d q 2 1461 m3 d q 3 899 m3 d q 4 1380 m3 d q 5 1750 m3 d respectively since it is a multi parameters problem we introduced the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to estimate the aquifer loss and well loss parameters the objective function was set according to eq 4 the pso method was designed in matlab version r2014a program and it is freely available upon request from the authors the population size n was set as 40 60 and 80 to avoid a local solution and to ensure accuracy the results of each population size are shown in table 2 fig 7 illustrates the best fitting curve of the proposed method it is notable that the new empirical equation results in a good matching degree for irregularly changed pumping rates according to the calculated parameters the proportions of aquifer loss and well loss can be estimated as 85 06 and 14 94 85 5 and 14 5 for n 40 84 3 and 15 7 for n 60 respectively the results indicate that the new form step drawdown test could also estimate the aquifer loss and well loss parameters accurately it is an extension of the classic step drawdown test which is generally limited to four increasing pumping rates and the new form test would reduce the equipment requirements for field pumping tests this method would give new insights into the step drawdown pumping test design in the later fieldwork 4 limitations theoretically a clear quantitative relationship between α and δq should have been provided in this study however the analyses in the above sections have shown that α changes synergistically with the value of δq similarly the same absolute value of δq does not indicate the same αe because δq would lead to a different pumping rate q as such the range of α also remains a subject for further research it is noteworthy that the evaluation with respect to the α is similar to the approach by mathias et al 2008 eq 3 and wen et al 2017 eq 4 where the parameters related to the pumping rate such as the α in this study are objective but their optimal ranges were not presented nevertheless the α outcomes from the field pumping test in this study are dominant at certain ranges between 10 and 10 based on the iterative and recursive technique of the pso employed in the step drawdown test with irregular pumping rates overall we posit that the range of α would vary for other contexts accordingly further research based on actual field tests should be conducted to evaluate the quantitative relationship between α and δq as well as the optimal range of α in addition although the pso method shows good convergence on the estimated aquifer parameters it may have some uncertainty for the results a monte carlo simulation metropolis and ulam 1949 zhang et al 2017 is recommended to analyze the uncertainty of the estimation results which will be done in the future and reported elsewhere 5 conclusions this study proposed a new step drawdown test model based on an irregularly variable pumping rate with a continuously rising pumping rate which extends the concept of the traditional step drawdown test the new model defines the well loss estimation for a partially penetrating well by considering an additional term the well screen length which significantly increases the applicability of the model in fieldwork as such the new model is more general compared to previous works the model was validated by applying it to interpret pumping test data obtained from the field and comparing the interpretive results with two other models eden and hazel 1973 singh 2002 the results show that the new model performs and produces smaller modeled data finally the method was applied to estimate the aquifer loss and well loss parameters in an actual field test the major conclusions from this study are presented as follows 1 the proposed method extends the concept of the increasing pumping test to that of a step drawdown test with an irregular variable rate also consideration for δq by introducing a pumping rate varying index α increases the accuracy of the aquifer parameter estimation compared to methods from previous studies eden and hazel 1973 singh 2002 2 both positive and negative δq values influence the estimation of well loss for example a positive δq causes more distinct changes than negative δq case particularly where the pumping rate is high meanwhile it is noteworthy that an increasing pumping rate creates a positive α while the α value would tend to be negative when there is a negative δq during the pumping period 3 the well loss value is proportional to the length of the well screen in a partially penetrating well indicating that a larger ratio of the well screen length to aquifer thickness results in a larger well loss 4 through the fitting between the new solution and the observed experimental data in xiangyang city the best parameters obtained are as follows k x 40 09 m d k z 2 78 m d s 9 0 10 3 p 3 12 c 1 2 10 3 α 1 47 2 17 4 80 2 18 1 88 the drawdown is composed of 85 of aquifer loss and 15 well loss the findings of this work provide insight into the form of step drawdown test with non linear increasing pumping rates which would reduce the requirements of pumping power in addition the study elucidates the significance of the well structure suggesting that a partially penetrating well could also result in a high well efficiency compared to a fully penetrating well this also implies that the well screen length can be optimized to be half or a third of the aquifer thickness to save cost especially for a centralized water supply well construction however it is important to highlight that there is room for more improvement and research on the new model for example the optimal range of the α is not elucidated in this work and the applicability of this method in a poor yielding aquifer is untested

2765,a step drawdown test with an increasing pumping rate at each step in a fully penetrating well is a typical procedure for estimating aquifer parameters and well losses however partially penetrating wells in closed aquifers have also been adopted mainly due to economic constraints with a stepwise increase in the pumping rate in this study a new empirical method is proposed based on the stepwise drawdown defined by irregular pumping rates in a partially penetrating well the method was validated by fitting drawdown data from classical works the characteristics of the drawdowns and well losses were discussed for varying pumping scenarios the results indicate that the new empirical method interprets previous works more accurately for a fully penetrating well and also effectively estimates the aquifer and well loss parameters a new coefficient the pumping rate varying index α was introduced to indicate the pumping rate difference δq between the two steps as such a negative pumping rate difference would decrease the well loss and result in a negative α in addition the effect of the ratio of the well s screen length to aquifer thickness demonstrates that a longer screen would cause a larger well loss finally the proposed empirical method was applied to a fieldwork conducted in xiangyang city central china to investigate the aquifer and well loss parameters using the particle swarm optimization pso method keywords step drawdown test aquifer parameters well losses partially penetrating well particle swarm optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the step drawdown test is commonly designed to estimate aquifer parameters and well losses in a single well pumping test jacob 1946 clark 1977 kawecki 1995 a step drawdown is generally defined as a constant rate pumping test starting from an initial constant pumping rate while observing the water level that successively reaches a quasi steady state afterward the water level is allowed to decrease further due to a relatively high constant pumping rate for which the water level is monitored until a new quasi steady state is achieved by standards the process is recommended to be repeated at least three times which means that a step drawdown test commonly contains a minimum of four steps mathias and todman 2010 jacob 1946 suggested that the aquifer loss is proportional to the pumping rate while the well loss is assumed to be proportional to the square of the pumping rate subsequently rorabaugh 1953 proposed an extended equation where the well loss is a power function of the pumping rate with order p detailed information about the classical models is presented in the appendix rorabaugh s 1953 model was later on widely recognized by researchers who made efforts to determine the range of p for instance rorabaugh 1953 proposed that the value of p varies between 2 43 and 2 82 in a high discharge and may be equal to unity in cases of low discharge lennox 1966 reported that the value of p is as high as 3 5 sheahan 1971 presented a set of type curves by simplifying rorabaugh s 1953 solution and suggested p ranges from 1 7 to 4 0 it is notable that most previous research mainly focused on the well loss function and well loss power but they neglected the aquifer properties and the form of step drawdown test in the last few decades several methods have been developed to estimate the parameters of aquifer loss and well loss by analyzing the step drawdown tests based on the empirical equation since jacob 1946 introduced the definition of well loss graphical methods were commonly used to estimate the well loss coefficient rorabaugh 1953 sheahan 1971 birsoy and summers 1980 thereafter numerical methods and optimization methods were introduced into well loss estimation labadie and helweg 1975 sheahan 1975 gupta 1989 avci 1992 singh 2002 presented a new optimization method to estimate well loss by analyzing the variable rate pumping instead of a step drawdown test mathias and todman 2010 also used the forchheimer equation to analyze the step drawdown tests and provided an approximate method to estimate well loss by considering p 2 karami and younger 2002 presented a new transformation method to record the homogenization drawdown data in a confined heterogeneous aquifer during a step drawdown test however a careful review of relevant literature highlights that most of these methods are based on the following two assumptions 1 the well is a fully penetrating well in a confined aquifer 2 the pumping rate rises for each step for assumption 1 researchers did have methods of analyzing well losses in a partially penetrating well but these came with limitations for example wang and zhan 2015 2017 discussed the effect of intra wellbore head loss in a partially penetrating well with different boundaries in a vertical well and a horizontal well by the integral method this was done without applying a step drawdown pumping test which made the method hard to apply in fieldwork lyu et al 2021 and wu et al 2021 calculated the groundwater head distribution by analyzing the effects of a close barrier which would significantly affect the head distribution during the pumping test besides there are limited works that consider the well structure when exploring the well losses houben 2015 explained the mechanism of head loss in the well screen by establishing equations associated with the well screen diameter and flow velocity inside the well screen meanwhile the influence of the well structure still has not been well elucidated particularly for a partially penetrating well despite the different methods the common thread is that the linear aquifer loss component is applied for theis s 1935 equation which is well known and established for a fully penetrating well the differences between each method are commonly in the form of the well loss coefficient or the exponent of the well discharge p as a result there is still a need for a more convenient method for well loss estimation for a partially penetrating well in fieldwork as for the second assumption 2 clark 1977 made a step drawdown test in a fully penetrating well with detailed data for six steps that offered experimental data to validate the other methods after that gupta 1989 developed an interactive computer code to estimate aquifer characters based on the procedure of clark 1977 avci 1992 proposed a method considering the time dependency of the aquifer loss coefficient by analyzing two data sets kawecki 1995 proposed a new method to calculate the total well loss by considering the discharge differential δq in two steps as mentioned in assumption 2 the δq must be a positive value otherwise the method cannot be applied although the previous methods can solve most step drawdown problems and get highly accurate parameters of the aquifer there are still some real world problems for instance the existing classical models cannot estimate the well loss parameters in a partially penetrating well or if the pumping rate cannot be increased in each step in this study we propose a new method based on previous empirical equations for estimating aquifer and well loss parameters by a step drawdown test in a partially penetrating well with irregular non linear increased pumping rate which is an extension of the classical models with an increasing pumping rate step in a fully penetrating well the proposed method can be simplified to rorabaugh s 1953 method and it is validated by testing the results from clack 1977 finally the proposed method is applied to the data from actual fieldwork in xiangyang city central china the overall finding shows that the proposed method can provide new insights for the step drawdown tests and extend the application of step drawdown tests in the field 2 materials and methods as shown in fig 1 a partially penetrating well in a confined aquifer is considered several assumptions are adopted in this study 1 the aquifer is homogeneous radially isotropic extends infinitely and is closed with a finite constant thickness 2 the pumping rate changes instantaneously and keeps constant in each step 3 the well partially penetrates the aquifer with an infinitesimal radius 4 the system is hydrostatic before the pumping starts two main factors must be considered when solving the problem of parameter estimation by step drawdown tests in a partially penetrating well with irregularly changing pumping rates the first is the definition of the aquifer loss function a appendix eq a1 since it is not a fully penetrating well in the main aquifer this means that the problem does not fulfill the conditions of the theis 1935 solution the other issue is the components of the well loss function b appendix eq a1 which should reveal the irregular change in pumping rate and the relationship of well screen with the aquifer with these considerations the governing equation for drawdowns in a fully penetrating well is similar to the previous work chang and chen 2003 except for the inner boundary condition which turns the constant pumping rate q to an irregular changing pumping rate with time q t wen et al 2014 due to the complexity of solving a three dimensional flow problem around a partially penetrating well compared to a radial flow in a fully penetrating well most previous works turned the mathematical problems of a partially penetrating well into semi analytical solutions by fourier transform and laplace transform or numerical solutions by finite element method and finite difference method chiu et al 2010 mishra et al 2012 wen et al 2013 however in this study aquifer loss and well loss are considered simultaneously in a partially penetrating well making it hard to derive a mathematical solution hence an empirical equation like jacob 1946 method is commonly used for aquifer and well loss estimation the main innovation of this study is the determination of the aquifer loss function and well loss function in a partially penetrating well with irregular pumping rates as a result the aquifer loss function should conform to the fundamental seepage law and the classical models hantush 1961 proposed systematically the drawdown around a partially penetrating well in different aquifer situations which can be applied in this study for the aquifer head loss part eq a3 47according to hantush 1961 the aquifer loss function a based on the settings of fig 1 could be expressed as 1 a 1 4 π t w u r 2 m π l d n 1 1 n sin n π l m sin n π d m cos n π z m w u r n π r m k z k r where n is the finite cosine fourier transform variable mishra et al 2012 w u r and w u r n π r m k z k r are the well function and partially penetrating well function respectively there are two advantages to adopting eq 1 as aquifer loss function a on one hand a is derived from a partially penetrating well which can cover the fully penetrating well by adjusting the well length l and d on the other hand since it is a step drawdown test a real space domain expression a was easier to calculate by the superposition method in the postprocessing compared with a previous semi analytical solution in laplace domain avci 1992 avci et al 2010 jacob 1946 singh 2002 as for the well loss the commonly used processing method was to make the drawdown divided by a parametric constant such as pumping rate clark 1977 gupta 1989 or time singh 2002 which aims to turn the problem into a problem with a lower order these methods are then implemented by graphical techniques such as the linear graphic method eden and hazel 1973 which complicates the estimation process due to the difficulties in the characterization of a feasible linear relationship between pumping rate and time another way is to define a new expression for the well loss by introducing a coefficient with a certain physical significance mathias and todman 2010 for instance mathias and todman 2010 proposed an approximate solution by introducing a variable involving forchheimer parameter which indicated the flow seepage situation in a well similarly this study considers a new form of temporal pumping rate that is a negative δq value may exist during step drawdown test which is different from the test with a continuously increasing pumping rate in each step nevertheless a negative δq would lead to a negative well loss value which conflicts with its physical meaning as such it is critical to propose an appropriate expression of δq and quantify the influences of both δq and q on the well loss parameter thus a new coefficient referred to as the pumping rate varying index α is introduced to adjust the well loss differences caused by the pumping rate between two steps in order to keep consistent with the form of the pumping rate in the well loss function the power function with the exponent α is also used in the expression of δq the α value is dependent on the δq typically a positive δq would increase the well loss while a negative δq would decrease the well loss this implies that the α would also be a negative value in some cases besides the well loss part should also contain the partially penetrating well factor hence we also considered the influences of the well screen length on well loss parameter overall the expression of well loss in each step should comprise the pumping rate differences well screen length factor and the pumping rate which can be expressed as 2 s w q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α c l d m p q i p where s w is the total well loss q i is the pumping rate during the ith step of the pumping test q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α is the irregular pumping rate variation sign q i q i 1 is the sign function that keeps the well loss as a positive value which is particularly designed to solve a negative well loss problem c is the common well loss coefficient l d m p indicating the influence of well screen length on well loss hence this solution is different from previous ones as it includes a term for variable pumping rate loss and a term for partially penetrated screen loss which have been neglected in most previous studies therefore the ith step drawdown that considers the well loss can be summed up as 3 s 1 4 π t w u r 2 m π l d n 1 1 n sin n π l m sin n π d m cos n π z m w u r n π r m k z k r q i t q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α c l d m p q i t p above all eq 3 is a new empirical approach summarized and innovated from previous studies of step drawdown pumping test models in a fully penetrating well it extends the classical step drawdown pumping test model which accounts for a continuously rising pumping rate in a fully penetrating well by considering an irregularly changed pumping rate in a partially penetrating well finally the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm chen et al 2020 wang et al 2021 is employed to validate the model and estimate the aquifer and well loss parameters by comparing the objective function given as 4 r min h 1 n i 1 n s i h s c 2 where r is the objective function which means a lower r indicates a higher accuracy n is the number of the experimental data s i is the observed drawdown s c is the calculated drawdown the advantages of the pso method chen et al 2020 are 1 pso is flexible for a multiple parameters estimation and allows for quick modification of the number of parameters by only changing the initial setting which would not expand the calculations 2 pso method is rapidly convergent because it evolves by comparing the local extremum value with the global extremum value which would reduce the iteration quantity the basic hyperparameters setting of the pso in this study are n 40 60 80 number of particle swarm c 1 c 2 2 learning factors w 0 4 the inertia factor m 50 the iterations respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation firstly the field data from clark 1977 was used to validate the model however as mentioned earlier the proposed solution is designed for a partially penetrating well whereas the previous methods were applied to a case where the well was fully penetrating for the case of a fully penetrating well the aquifer part which employed the theis 1935 model implies that the partially penetrating well term l d m would be set as 1 the eq 3 can be transformed as 5 s 1 4 π t w u r q i q i q i 1 sign q i q i 1 α c q i p the discharge rates from clark 1977 were set as q 1 1306 m3 day q 2 1693 m3 day q 3 2423 m3 day q 4 3261 m3 day q 5 4094 m3 day q 6 5019 m3 day respectively the pumping rate differences between the two steps were δq 1306 387 730 838 833 and 925 m3 d for this case respectively table 1 shows the results of aquifer and well loss parameters estimated by different models for the proposed method in this study the pumping rate varying index α for each step was estimated as α 1 1 68 α 2 9 83 α 3 1 59 α 4 1 50 α 5 0 88 α 6 0 97 respectively table 1 shows that the aquifer parameters t and s are in the same order of magnitude however for the well loss coefficient the results vary because each model considered diverse influencing factors eden and hazel 1973 used the linear graphic method by analyzing the relationship between the ratio of drawdown and flow rate with discharge rate singh 2002 calculated the well loss considering a variable pumping rate at each time step this study takes the pumping rate differentials into account fig 2 illustrates the drawdowns of each solution fitted with the experimental data of clark 1977 it can be concluded that these three models all provided superb fitting curves however it is noteworthy that the results estimated by this study fitted the data better according to the objective function r in table 1 which highlights that the estimation accuracy of the aquifer and well loss parameters would be increased when considering the pumping rate differences fig 2 also proves that this solution can be used for aquifer and well loss estimation in a fully penetrating well table 1 and fig 2 illustrate that this study can be compatible with the previous work and improve the accuracy of aquifer and well loss parameters furthermore the proposed empirical approach could also be applied in common step drawdown cases 3 2 analysis of each influence factor of the new method the following subsections aim to discuss the effects of pumping rate varying index α pumping rate difference δq and well screen length l d m on drawdowns and well losses previous research assumed that the well loss was mainly related to the pumping rate instead of the pumping rate difference δq what is different in this study is that we even account for the case of pumping rate with a non linear temporal variation and the partially penetrating well is also considered according to eq 2 when analyzing the effect of one parameter the other parameters are given constant 3 2 1 pumping rate varying index α when analyzing the effects of α the other parameters are given as k x 5 m d k z 0 5 m d s 10 4 p 2 c 10 6 q n 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800 m3 d respectively additionally the aquifer thickness is set as 20 m and the well screen is assumed to be located in the middle of the aquifer with l d m 0 25 the effects of the pumping rate varying index α on the drawdown are shown in fig 3 it is notable that whatever the sign of α is the well loss would objectively exist consequently a larger α causes a larger well loss with the same δq in addition the value of α was calculated from the pumping rate in each step which enables the newly proposed model to characterize an irregularly changed step drawdown test with the consideration of a pumping rate varying index α this new model can be used to solve the problem in an et al 2020 that the well loss parameter could not be estimated with an exceptionally higher δq or a negative δq in fact it would be more precise to give a feasible range of α when it is introduced to improve the calculation accuracy of well loss caused by different δq but there is no previous work considering or deriving the relationship between α and δq meanwhile the current research indicates that the aquifer parameters are determined by the properties of the aquifer formation while the well loss parameters are dependent on the specific operational parameters of the pumping test therefore it is difficult to derive a constitutive relationship between aquifer and well loss parameters besides it can be speculated that α in each step would not vary tremendously because the pumping rate has very limited variation in the field step drawdown test due to pumping equipment 3 2 2 pumping rate difference δq fig 4 shows the well loss differences for increasing and decreasing pumping rate cases where α 0 01 the other parameters are the same to those used in fig 3 except for the pumping rates as shown in fig 4 a the well loss can be represented by the deviation between the curves that consider and those that do not consider well loss denoted in the legends of fig 4 a it is notable that the well loss increases with the increase of δq especially in the higher pumping rate stage since the eq 3 also indicates a direct relationship between the well loss and δq with a positive α however when δq is negative as fig 4 b indicates drawdowns decrease mainly due to the decreasing pumping rate while the well losses also decrease even for larger values of δq in fig 4 c the well losses clearly varied by plus or minus of δq which is different from the continuously increasing pumping rate models hence it can be concluded that the well loss is mainly influenced by the pumping rate in addition an introduction of the δq will improve the estimation accuracy of the step drawdown test with irregular pumping rates 3 2 3 well screen length l d fig 5 illustrates the relationship between well losses and the length of the well screen the parameters here are the same as those used in fig 4 except for l d m 0 25 0 5 0 5 1 it is important to note that regardless of the sign of δq the well loss is inversely proportional to the ratio of the well screen and the aquifer thickness in previous works the well loss in the well screen was generally related to the flow length and flow velocity for the same material chen et al 2003 houben 2015 a longer flow path and a faster velocity increase the well loss but it is hard to evaluate which of these factors has a greater influence hence in this study we treat the ratio of well screen length and aquifer thickness as a whole to discuss the influence of the partially penetrating term on the well loss overall the well loss only increased or decreased evidently for large pumping rate cases l d m 0 75 1 while the well loss varied inconspicuously for low pumping rate cases l d m 0 25 0 5 this suggests that for a water supply well in a high yield aquifer area a shorter well screen could be designed to satisfy the demand if the water supply well is located in a poor yield aquifer a longer well screen is recommended to increase the water extraction capacity 3 3 application of this study to data from a field experiment as mentioned previously there is limited research on aquifer parameter estimation for partially penetrating wells based on a step drawdown test generally it is challenging to perform an increasing pumping rate test with at least four steps in the field especially in the case of large pumping rates hence we conducted an irregular pumping rates step drawdown test with limited equipment in xiangyang city located in central china the proposed model was used to interpret the experimental data obtained from the field the data was obtained from the pumping well numbered xy001 located nearby the hanjiang river the geological formation is fluvial with lacustrine sedimentary conditions according to fig 6 the confined aquifer is composed of coarse sand and gravel with upper and lower clay aquiclude which indicates that the aquifer has a large water yield property hence it can be speculated that the water supply would satisfy a step drawdown test with different pumping rates even in a partially penetrating well the basic information about the test is as follows the testing aquifer begins from a depth of 13 m to 87 m the filter is between 60 and 72 m making it a partially penetrating well the well diameter is 0 3 m and the groundwater level was constant before the test the step drawdown test lasted for 10 h with 5 equal time interval steps with the pumping rates reported as q 1 1803 m3 d q 2 1461 m3 d q 3 899 m3 d q 4 1380 m3 d q 5 1750 m3 d respectively since it is a multi parameters problem we introduced the particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to estimate the aquifer loss and well loss parameters the objective function was set according to eq 4 the pso method was designed in matlab version r2014a program and it is freely available upon request from the authors the population size n was set as 40 60 and 80 to avoid a local solution and to ensure accuracy the results of each population size are shown in table 2 fig 7 illustrates the best fitting curve of the proposed method it is notable that the new empirical equation results in a good matching degree for irregularly changed pumping rates according to the calculated parameters the proportions of aquifer loss and well loss can be estimated as 85 06 and 14 94 85 5 and 14 5 for n 40 84 3 and 15 7 for n 60 respectively the results indicate that the new form step drawdown test could also estimate the aquifer loss and well loss parameters accurately it is an extension of the classic step drawdown test which is generally limited to four increasing pumping rates and the new form test would reduce the equipment requirements for field pumping tests this method would give new insights into the step drawdown pumping test design in the later fieldwork 4 limitations theoretically a clear quantitative relationship between α and δq should have been provided in this study however the analyses in the above sections have shown that α changes synergistically with the value of δq similarly the same absolute value of δq does not indicate the same αe because δq would lead to a different pumping rate q as such the range of α also remains a subject for further research it is noteworthy that the evaluation with respect to the α is similar to the approach by mathias et al 2008 eq 3 and wen et al 2017 eq 4 where the parameters related to the pumping rate such as the α in this study are objective but their optimal ranges were not presented nevertheless the α outcomes from the field pumping test in this study are dominant at certain ranges between 10 and 10 based on the iterative and recursive technique of the pso employed in the step drawdown test with irregular pumping rates overall we posit that the range of α would vary for other contexts accordingly further research based on actual field tests should be conducted to evaluate the quantitative relationship between α and δq as well as the optimal range of α in addition although the pso method shows good convergence on the estimated aquifer parameters it may have some uncertainty for the results a monte carlo simulation metropolis and ulam 1949 zhang et al 2017 is recommended to analyze the uncertainty of the estimation results which will be done in the future and reported elsewhere 5 conclusions this study proposed a new step drawdown test model based on an irregularly variable pumping rate with a continuously rising pumping rate which extends the concept of the traditional step drawdown test the new model defines the well loss estimation for a partially penetrating well by considering an additional term the well screen length which significantly increases the applicability of the model in fieldwork as such the new model is more general compared to previous works the model was validated by applying it to interpret pumping test data obtained from the field and comparing the interpretive results with two other models eden and hazel 1973 singh 2002 the results show that the new model performs and produces smaller modeled data finally the method was applied to estimate the aquifer loss and well loss parameters in an actual field test the major conclusions from this study are presented as follows 1 the proposed method extends the concept of the increasing pumping test to that of a step drawdown test with an irregular variable rate also consideration for δq by introducing a pumping rate varying index α increases the accuracy of the aquifer parameter estimation compared to methods from previous studies eden and hazel 1973 singh 2002 2 both positive and negative δq values influence the estimation of well loss for example a positive δq causes more distinct changes than negative δq case particularly where the pumping rate is high meanwhile it is noteworthy that an increasing pumping rate creates a positive α while the α value would tend to be negative when there is a negative δq during the pumping period 3 the well loss value is proportional to the length of the well screen in a partially penetrating well indicating that a larger ratio of the well screen length to aquifer thickness results in a larger well loss 4 through the fitting between the new solution and the observed experimental data in xiangyang city the best parameters obtained are as follows k x 40 09 m d k z 2 78 m d s 9 0 10 3 p 3 12 c 1 2 10 3 α 1 47 2 17 4 80 2 18 1 88 the drawdown is composed of 85 of aquifer loss and 15 well loss the findings of this work provide insight into the form of step drawdown test with non linear increasing pumping rates which would reduce the requirements of pumping power in addition the study elucidates the significance of the well structure suggesting that a partially penetrating well could also result in a high well efficiency compared to a fully penetrating well this also implies that the well screen length can be optimized to be half or a third of the aquifer thickness to save cost especially for a centralized water supply well construction however it is important to highlight that there is room for more improvement and research on the new model for example the optimal range of the α is not elucidated in this work and the applicability of this method in a poor yielding aquifer is untested

2766,for mitigating human induced river alterations and reviving the dying rivers to preserve natural ecosystem services the assessment of environmental flow e flow is essential however e flow estimation under data scarce conditions for the rivers being heavily regulated has become a major issue worldwide under changing environmental conditions particularly in developing countries to address this challenge this study was carried out for estimating time varying e flows for a heavily regulated river of eastern india under data scarce conditions in the absence of any pre impact streamflow data and tributary inflow to the main river reach this study proposes a framework integrating three methods to estimate e flow for river reaches a hydrologic model first method was employed to estimate tributary inflows to the main river which was used in the mass balance based naturalization approach second method for reconstructing the daily long term natural streamflow from the observed post impact streamflows at two gauging stations on the main river thereafter the naturalized streamflow was used for estimating e flows by the ga optimization technique third method for two pragmatic scenarios low hydrologic alteration and moderate hydrologic alteration at the two stations analysis of the results revealed that the major impounding and diversion infrastructures built on the river have caused profound alteration to the river reach having an overall degree of hydrologic alteration index greater than 70 the mean post impact streamflows tend to vary less and have decreased by 35 50 with 2 3 times reduction in the peak flow as compared to the pre impact condition the estimated monthly e flows for the river basin range from 1 2 to 185 m3 s 50 60 of the natural flow and 0 5 to 80 m3 s 22 to 30 of the natural flow for the low and moderate alteration scenarios respectively results of this study can aid in formulating efficient strategies for sustainable water resources management in the river basin keywords environmental flow hydrological modeling flow naturalization regulated river system ecosystem protection data availability data will be made available on reasonable request 1 introduction although rivers cover less than 1 of the earth s surface they are regarded as the most productive and diverse ecosystems on the planet opperman et al 2015 they often provide vital ecosystem services to the human society and other habitats modifications in the river regimes lead to the degradation of ecosystems and the consequent loss of biodiversity which can greatly affect aquatic ecosystem services benefitting humanity such as natural water purification natural flood protection and water supply for agricultural and allied activities wwdr 2020 the freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems have been negatively impacted by climate induced changes in the water cycle arias et al 2021 much of these climate change induced impacts are likely to be concentrated in the tropical zones encompassing most of the developing nations däll and zhang 2010 predicted significant alteration of the seasonal streamflows due to climate change on almost 90 of the global land area by 2050 apart from the climate change impacts human induced causes such as increased and reckless water use also pose a serious threat to the sustenance of riverine ecosystems the modification of the river flows by constructing hydraulic structures viz dams diversions and flood control structures significantly affects downstream river ecosystems dudgeon et al 2006 pumo et al 2018 ta et al 2016 as a result some important rivers of the world have already stopped flowing and are dying a slow death rawat and rawat 2020 in the present circumstances 60 of the major rivers across the globe are affected and fragmented due to the river regulation and consequent hydrologic alterations revenga et al 2000 this figure is likely to increase to 70 by 2025 zhang et al 2012 climate and anthropogenic driven water problems quantity and quality will continue to aggravate in the future and will become more acute in the business as usual scenario which will severely affect the socio economic development of a country and ecosystems therefore water managers and policy makers must take this threat seriously and improve current management strategies for ensuring sustainable water management to this end the assessment of environmental flows in river reaches is an important step for maintaining the health of river ecosystems and thereby avoiding environmental degradation in the downstream reaches of rivers hua and cui 2018 although the definitions of environmental flow e flow vary with the purpose and target species the most widely accepted definition is the quantity quality and timing of the water flow required to ensure the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems and associated living beings acreman 2016 ta et al 2016 however the water available for environmental purposes has been ignored or insufficient in many river basins to meet all ecological flow requirements because of already vying water users i e domestic industrial agricultural and recreational sectors arthington et al 2006 given the rising water demands and the finite water supply the judicious use of scarce water resources coupled with water conservation measures is a must for ensuring sustainable management of water and ecosystems the studies on environmental flow assessment and allocation have been conceived more and more in natural rivers as well as in regulated rivers during past few decades acreman and dunbar 2004 caissie et al 2015 jain and kumar 2014 tharme 2003 which is due to the growing awareness for the protection of degrading environment and the concern for water conflicts many studies have been carried out worldwide regarding development of methodologies for estimating environmental flow these methodologies approaches are categorized into four major classes based on the characteristics of the input data tharme 2003 they are i hydrological approach which is based on the study of historical streamflow data e g alcázar and palau 2010 shaeri karimi et al 2012 caissie et al 2015 amrit et al 2018a amrit et al 2018b ii hydraulic approach which is based on the hydraulic properties of river reaches e g nikghalb et al 2016 papadaki et al 2017 iii habitat simulationapproach which is based on the simulation of physical habitats and iv holisticapproach which includes interdisciplinary concept and addresses most of the components of the riverine ecosystem while assessing the ecological flow requirement e g arthington et al 2003 prucha et al 2016 often the hydrologic approaches are subjected to frequent criticism due to the arbitrarily set thresholds and the lack of temporal variability and scientific significance of their implementations the well established holistic approach is less adopted by the researchers as it requires a huge amount of interdisciplinary expertise inputs and hydrological and biological datasets which are often lacking in many developing countries in fact the type of the approach adopted mostly depends on the available data and the desirable accuracy alcázar and palau 2010 thus the studies pertaining to the e flow assessment often face data constraints generally the environmental flow to be maintained in a river reach should follow natural or pre development flow regime patterns for e flow estimation the streamflow data at different spatial locations are primarily important among other datasets however the availability of these hydrologic data from the existing gauging stations and previously studied cross sections with unimpaired flow regimes at required spatio temporal scales is rare furthermore environmental flow assessment studies are mostly limited to those rivers which are either natural or less human intervened headwater catchments e g pastor et al 2014 amrit et al 2018a mishra et al 2019 myronidis and ivanova 2020 karimi et al 2021 although some studies have estimated environmental flow for the regulated rivers e g alcázar and palau 2010 shaeri karimi et al 2012 peres and cancelliere 2016 those were possible due to the measured long term or at least few years of pre impact streamflow data for instance peres and cancelliere 2016 used a multi regression model for estimating long term natural streamflows which was calibrated using the streamflow data measured prior to any development additionally some of these studies such as alcázar and palau 2010 recommended a single minimum flow that does not represent natural flow variations and hence it is not adequate for reviving and preserving natural ecosystems in the absence of pre development data information about tributary inflows and water diversions can be utilized for deriving natural or near natural streamflow from the measured post impact streamflow data however the hydrologic data of different tributary channels are sometimes unknown which makes it essential to estimate beforehand to the best of the authors knowledge hardly any studies exist in the literature dealing with the assessment of environmental flows for the regulated river reaches deprived of historical streamflow data prior to human interventions as well as adequate streamflow measurements at the confluence of the tributaries and the main river given the above facts and research gaps this study was carried out with an overall aim of estimating e flow for a regulated river lacking in essential hydrologic information and data pertaining to the biodiversity or ecological responses in fact the adequacy of hydro climatic and ecological data availability in the basin under study is not satisfactory for carrying out comprehensive hydrologic studies required to properly address the sustainability of river systems for instance the river basin under study lacks any kind of measurement before the construction of dams and diversion structures on the river together with any data related to ecological responses and biodiversity these data are essential for the estimation of e flow in a holistic manner also streamflow information is not available at the confluence points of the tributaries and the main river which could be utilized for reconstructing the natural streamflow series that is useful for estimating the e flow of a regulated river the issue of such data unavailability poses a serious challenge for carrying out comprehensive scientific assessment to this end the present study demonstrates a scientific framework coupling three methods hydrologic modeling naturalization and optimization to compute e flow for the above mentioned problematic river systems which is a novel contribution of this study to the literature pertaining to e flow assessment this study is the first of its kind in the developing world in general and indian subcontinent in particular this scientific framework can be useful to the decision makers and water managers for the judicious allocation of available water resources among different sectors including ecosystems as well as for minimizing human induced detrimental impacts on the river ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the area selected for the present study is rushikulya river basin rrb located in the eastern part of india fig 1 the rushikulya river originates at an elevation of about 1200 m above the mean sea level msl along the eastern slope of the eastern ghats and drains into the bay of bengal in the east this river basin lies between 19 07 n and 20 19 n latitude 84 01 e and 85 06 e longitude having a total geographical area of 7 012 53 km2 the rushikulya river has a length of 175 km there are five tributaries of the river namely baghua dhanei bada nadi joro and ghodahada fig 2 the reservoirs and anicuts fig 2 existing in the study area mainly supply water for agricultural purposes the basin is characterized by sub tropical climate with an average annual rainfall of 1336 mm about 80 of the annual rainfall is received during mid june to october end the maximum and minimum temperatures of the basin are 45 c and 12 c respectively and the relative humidity ranges from 80 to 90 a major part of the basin is covered by forest and agricultural land fig 3 the soils in the study area are mostly clay and loam 2 2 data for this study the hydrological meteorological and geographical data were collected from different sources daily streamflow data for the period 2000 2016 were collected from the central water commission cwc and hydrometry bhubaneswar odisha india daily gauge based gridded precipitation 0 25⁰ 0 25⁰ and temperature 1⁰ 1⁰ data were collected from india meteorological department imd across the rushikulya river basin rrb these gridded rainfall and temperature data have been generated by imd srivastava et al 2009 pai et al 2015 for the entire india using evenly distributed rain gauges and weather stations mondal et al 2018 the land use land cover lulc data was obtained from the national remote sensing centre nrsc india while a soil map of 1 km 1 km spatial resolution was obtained from food and agriculture organization fao in addition the storage capacity and release data for the reservoirs were collected from the department of water resources dowr odisha india the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was used in this study 2 3 methodology generally environmental flow assessment methods consider the natural flow of a river alcázar and palau 2010 the environmental flow maintained in a reach should follow the natural pre development streamflow pattern to maintain the river eco system intact the natural flow of a river denotes the flow prior to any significant hydrologic modifications caused by the construction of major hydraulic structures or other human interventions the extensive data required for e flow assessment is rarely available in developing countries like india and the rushikulya river basin rrb located in the eastern part of the country is no exception for estimating the e flow of a highly regulated river basin under such data scarce conditions this study combines three methods in a single framework as the rushikulya river lacks natural streamflow information a mass balance based equation was used to estimate the natural flow from the observed post impact streamflow this equation requires storage water diversion for irrigation or other purposes data along with major tributary channel inflow information along the main river which is absent in the study area due to lack of gauging stations at the confluence point of tributaries and the main river for deriving the ungauged major tributary inflow information relatively less influenced by anthropogenic interventions to the main river a hydrological model was set up before application of the naturalization procedure in past hydrological models have been proven useful tools for the quantification of ungauged flow guo et al 2021 in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat model was employed for this purpose as it has been popularly used across the world in different river basins thus the swat model outputs were used to generate naturalized streamflow data thereafter the naturalized streamflow data were used in an optimization method for estimating the environmental flow at a given location in the river reach the overall methodology adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 4 and the detailed procedures are described in the following sub sections 2 3 1 hydrological modeling for ungauged streamflow estimation swat is a process based semi distributed model and can simulate runoff efficiently at daily monthly and annual scales in complicated river basins having multiple reservoirs swat model was selected because of its broad applicability in large agriculture dominated river basins and easy incorporation of agricultural management practices in swat the modeled area was divided into 77 sub basins these sub basins were delineated from the 30 m srtm dem with a threshold area of 40 km2 subsequently these sub basins were divided into 1 360 hydrologic response units hrus by overlaying elevation land cover soil and slope maps information on the storage capacity daily water release from the reservoirs and the maximum irrigation water diverted to individual sub basin were provided as model input in the agricultural area the cropping pattern of all major crops grown in the study was also defined as the data on wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity are not available for the study area the hargreaves method was used in swat for computing potential evapotranspiration this is a relatively less data intensive method and it is used by several researchers in the absence of meteorological data required for using the standard potential evapotranspiration method fao penman monteith equation the surface runoff was simulated using the scs curve number cn method the runoff from each sub basin was routed through the river network to the main basin outlet using the muskingum routing method the model was calibrated and validated against daily observed streamflow data at the outlet of the river basin i e purushottampur using the sufi 2 technique of swat cup software before the calibration and validation the model parameters were subjected to all at a time sensitivity analysis also known as global sensitivity analysis for identifying the significant parameters contributing to the streamflow simulation in the river basin and for reducing the number of parameters at the calibration stage global sensitivity analysis was preferred in this study as it produces more reliable results than the local sensitivity analysis zarrineh et al 2018 the sensitivity analysis was carried out using the in built global sensitivity option of sufi 2 where the statistical significance of a parameter was determined by the t stat and p value the model parameter values were also adjusted manually for understanding their impact on the streamflow generation process and for the best representation of the real world situation prior to the model calibration using sufi 2 the model was calibrated using the data of 2000 2010 period of which initial two years were used as a warm up period for initializing and keeping reasonable starting values of the model parameters the model was validated using the data of 2011 2016 period the performance of the model for predicting daily streamflow was assessed using both statistical and graphical indicators the selected statistical indicators such as coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 were used the lower values of mae and rmse as well as the nse and kge values closer to 1 indicate a better agreement between the observed and simulated streamflows additionally graphical indicators such as 1 1 plots and the simultaneous plots of daily observed versus simulated streamflows were also used for evaluating the model performance thereafter the ungauged tributary river inflows to the main river were derived by the calibrated and validated swat model 2 3 2 reconstruction of natural streamflow as there are no pre development streamflow data available for the rrb a mass balance approach similar to that proposed by blythe et al 2018 was applied to naturalize the streamflow at the gauging stations located over the main rushikulya river generally there are two major factors related to river flow alterations caused by human activities i changes in the streamflow due to a change in the land use land cover and ii changes in the streamflow because of human interventions such as flow diversion or storage structures in this case only the latter has been considered assuming that the land use land cover remains the same during the study period this approach can be applied to any long standing developed river system where the information such as tributary streamflow main river streamflow and reservoir storage change are available blythe and schmidt 2018 the approach considers the mass balance equations based on changes in storage within a control volume with the basic equation given as follows 1 i o ds dt where i inflow to a control volume o outflow from a control volume s storage volume and t time the inflow to the system consists of the upstream discharge qus tributary inflow tf to the main river groundwater inflow gi rainfall r and irrigation return flow irrf the outflow from the system consists of the downstream discharge qds groundwater outflow go evapotranspiration et and diverted flow from the control volume d replacing these in eqn 1 results in 2 q us t f g i r ir rf q ds g o e t d d s d t eqn 2 can also be presented as 3 ε ds dt q ds q us t f where ε is a function of gi go p et irrf and d in case the diversion data are available it was included in the equation separately change in the storage was assumed to be zero in the absence of a reservoir within a control volume thus ε reflects the gains or losses occurring between two gauging stations if the value is positive it represents a gain in the water volume and if the value is negative it represents a loss in the segment including both anthropogenic and natural causes when the ε values were negative for consecutively more than 15 days it was assumed to be anthropogenic losses from the segment because of water diversions where diversion data were absent for the reach this assumption is supported by the facts shared by the field engineers and farmers during the field visits in the study area that irrigation or other water diversions from the reaches continues for at least 15 days duration consecutively to remove the anthropogenic losses ε was taken as zero in those cases in the reaches where diversion data were available the value of ε are taken as zero for those periods where the diversion from the reach is greater than zero and there is a loss ε less than 0 from the channel to remove anthropogenic losses all the calculations were carried out at a daily scale finally naturalized streamflow q i at a given gauging station was calculated using the following equation 4 q i ε i t f i q us i where i denotes the day of a particular year as the naturalization was done at a daily temporal resolution the travel time of the flood peaks comes into the picture and they play an important role hence they were also considered while doing all the calculations by shifting q i by the mean time of travel in days to obtain the final naturalized streamflow series the above approach was applied to the main rushikulya river reach having three gauging stations namely pipalankha nandigarh and purushottampur the streamflow at the upstream gauging station pipalankha represents natural conditions as there are no diversion or storage structures upstream of the station in the 1st step the above approach was applied to the reach between pipalankha and nandigarh to obtain the naturalized flow at nandigarh the tributary inflow joro river as shown in fig 2 to this reach was derived from the calibrated swat model the sorada reservoir release which also joins the reach for sometimes was added to the calculation as an inflow tf in eqn 3 4 a similar approach was also followed for estimating naturalized streamflow at purushottampur station in the second reach between nandigarh and purushottampur stations three tributary inflows obtained from the calibrated swat model were used the mean travel time of flow to reach up to the outlet purushottampur gauging station is taken as one day in this study 2 3 3 estimation of environmental flow the effect of streamflow modification on the biodiversity or the eco system services is proportional to the magnitude of alteration from pre impact streamflow condition rolls and arthington 2014 it can be expected that limiting the streamflow regime alteration to minimum ranges will not have much impact or very low impact on the dependent biodiversity or the river ecosystem services thus an optimization based e flow method has been adopted in this study due to lack of any data related to the biodiversity or any published data on the ecological response to streamflow alteration in the study area to compute the monthly environmental flow requirement the naturalized streamflow pre impact series was used in the optimization method the core assumption of this method was that for sustaining the eco system services the post impact flow regime should attain the target ranges at the same frequency as that occurred in the natural or pre impact flow regime in this study the first group of the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha as proposed in the range of variability approach rva by ritcher et al 1998 representing the magnitudes of monthly mean streamflow values were taken into consideration a range of variation for the ihas estimated from the pre impact here naturalized flows is set as the flow restoration target for maintaining environmental flow while also leaving certain amount of streamflow available for abstraction or other utilization the range of variation target range for each indicator was bracketed by 25th and 75th percentile values of naturalized monthly flow similar to other studies e g shiau and wu 2004 2007 peres and cancelliere 2016 the objective function and the constraints of this specific optimization problem are presented in the subsequent sections 2 3 3 1 objective function to determine the optimal environmental flow for the river reach at a given stream gauging station the streamflow available for human utilization was maximized for this the following objective function was used 5 maximize sau my m 1 12 q my ef my h k m 1 2 3 12 a n d y 1 2 3 16 where saumy streamflow available for human utilization in the m th month of the y th year qmy is the naturalized streamflow in the m th month of the y th year and efmy environmental flow in the m th month of the y th year as a function of parameters h and k defined in eqn 6 in eqn 5 efmy was calculated using eqn 6 similar to that adopted by principato and viggiani 2009 and peres and cancelliere 2016 6 ef my h k q my i f q my k q mean m k q mean m h q my k q mean m i f q my k q mean m where qmean m is the mean of monthly naturalized streamflow for the m th month 2 3 3 2 constraints the above objective function was subjected to the following constraints i streamflow alteration constraint while allocating streamflow for different users alteration in the river flow regime should be minimized for this the degree of hydrologic alteration index d0 developed by richter et al 1998 was adopted which quantifies the deviation of the post development flow regime from the natural streamflow it was computed using the following equation 7 d 0 1 m m 1 m n o i p n t 100 p n t 2 where no i observed number of years with post impact monthly streamflow an indicator of hydrologic alteration iha values falling within a target range defined as the 25th and 75th percentile values of the naturalized pre impact streamflow p width of the target range 50 and nt total number of observed years the values of d0 are usually classified into 3 classes of equal ranges richter et al 1998 a 0 33 little or no alteration b 34 67 moderate alteration c 68 100 high degree of alteration as the desirable streamflow regime alteration for a particular river reach was restricted to the low to moderate alteration conditions the values of d0 was considered as 0 33 and 34 67 for the low and moderate alteration scenarios respectively the streamflow alteration constraint was defined as follows 8a for t

genetic algorithm ga with the help of ms excel solver 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow characteristics the daily variation of streamflow in the rushikulya river at three gauging stations i e pipalankha nandigarh and purushottampur are shown in fig 5 the streamflow varies from 0 12 to 408 m3 s mean 8 75 20 35 median 3 18 m3 s 0 to 956 m3 s mean 11 30 42 79 median 0 m3 s 0 to 2279 m3 s mean 69 53 187 58 median 8 18 m3 s at the pipalankha nandigarh and purushottampur gauging stations respectively fig 5 a it is also obvious from fig 5 b that the river is perennial at the pipalankha gauging station for the location see fig 1 with 100 exceedance streamflow whereas the river flows intermittently at the other locations the flow duration curves fdcs of the nandigarh and purushottampur gauging stations are steeper than pipalankha indicating the river is highly variable at former two gauging stations the streamflow observed at the pipalankha gauging station is less variable as compared to other two stations the river has a long term lean flow during mid december to mid june especially at both nandigarh and purushottampur stations with no flow for 30 of the time during 2001 to 2016 3 2 results of swat calibration and validation to identify the most influential parameters affecting the streamflow process a pre calibration sensitivity analysis was carried out the values of statistics t stat and p value obtained during pre calibration sensitivity analysis for daily streamflow simulations are summarized in table 1 based on these statistics values the eleven most influential parameters having significant effects on streamflow simulation of the basin were selected and were used for calibration channel hydraulic conductivity ch k2 manning s roughness coefficient ch n2 and curve number cn are the three most sensitive parameters among all the parameters having a p value equal to zero table 1 in a nearby basin pati et al 2018 also found ch k2 and ch n2 to be the most sensitive for simulating daily streamflow in their study area thereafter the swat model was calibrated and validated at a daily time scale using the most influential parameters identified from the sensitivity analysis the best fit model parameter values and their uncertainty ranges are presented in table 2 from the statistical indicators table 3 it is clear that the model is able to predict daily streamflow satisfactorily during both calibration and validation periods with good and very good nse values of 0 73 and 0 88 respectively as per the evaluation guidelines of moriasi et al 2007 and arnold et al 2012 this indicates that the parameters obtained during calibration are well capable of simulating streamflow during the validation period also during calibration the mae rmse and kge were obtained as 38 4 m3 s 102 1 m3 s and 0 80 respectively while they were 34 7 m3 s 89 9 m3 s 0 91 respectively during validation this shows that the model is able to predict daily streamflow better during the validation period with lesser error values and higher nse and kge values table 3 the p factor and r factor values also suggest that the amount of observed data within a narrower 95 prediction band 95ppu is more during validation as compared to the calibration period indicating better prediction confidence in the modeling results the superior performance of the model during validation might be due to the fact that the calibration period consists of dry and normal years only while the model validation period includes a wet year also year 2013 annual rainfall of 1 889 mm the model can predict high streamflow more accurately during the wet year as compared to medium range streamflows further observed vs simulated daily streamflow hydrographs during calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 6 a b it is apparent that although the simulated daily streamflow series closely follows the corresponding observed streamflow series pattern during calibration and validation periods their peaks are somewhat under predicting the medium range streamflow values about 700 2000 m3 s during calibration fig 6 a this is also corroborated in the 1 1 plots of the observed and simulated streamflow fig 7 a b the possible reason could be poor rainfall representation pereira et al 2016 and the inherent measurement uncertainty 3 3 characteristics of the estimated naturalized streamflow utilizing the ungauged tributary inflow derived from the calibrated swat model in the mass balance approach the observed streamflow at two gauging stations on the main river reach i e nandigarh and purushottampur were naturalized from 2001 to 2016 the basic statistics of the current observed and naturalized streamflow at two gauging stations are listed in table 4 the analysis of the results showed that the mean daily naturalized flow at the nandigarh station is estimated to be 28 02 m3 s sd 98 m3 s which is 1 5 times higher 50 higher than the average daily streamflow observed at the station after naturalization the daily median streamflow has increased to 7 43 m3 s against the measured daily median streamflow 0 m3 s at the nandigarh station table 4 similarly the mean daily naturalized streamflow 98 21 m3 s at the purushottampur station has increased by 1 3 times 35 higher as compared to the observed daily streamflow because of the flow regulations imposed by the dams and the anicuts in the basin the post impact flow regimes observed flow series tend to be less variable which can be noticed from their lower values of standard deviation as compared to daily natural flow series furthermore the monthly variation of the naturalized and observed streamflow along with corresponding box plots for both the stations are illustrated in fig 8 comparison of the monthly naturalized and measured flows during the study period fig 8 a demonstrates that the peak flows in monthly post impact flow series have been decreased about 2 3 times indicating the impacts of reservoir and diversions on the current flow regime also the interquartile range iqr of the estimated natural flow is wider as compared to the observed post impact streamflow at the two stations fig 8 b for instance at purushottampur station the iqr for monthly natural streamflow is 132 9 m3 s while the iqr for that at nandigarh station is 32 13 m3 s nearly two times wider than that for monthly observed post impact streamflow series at both the stations the mean monthly averaged over the years natural flow at purushottampur varies from about 2 16 in april to 316 48 m3 s in october while the mean monthly post impact streamflow observed varies from about 1 77 to 255 m3 s similarly at nandigarh the mean monthly natural streamflow varies from 2 79 to 82 73 m3 s while the mean monthly post impact streamflow varies from 0 59 to 62 99 m3 s furthermore a visual comparison of monthly median naturalized streamflow over all the years along with their interquartile range and median values of observed monthly streamflow are illustrated in fig 8 c this also corroborates with the previous statement that the presence of reservoirs and diversion structures has resulted in a significant reduction in the streamflow particularly during monsoon seasons because the reservoirs mainly store floodwater and divert them to fulfill the high irrigation water demands of paddy in the basin 3 4 optimal environmental flow requirements under different scenarios based on the obtained naturalized streamflow series at the two gauging stations the monthly environmental flow requirement was estimated at nandigarh and purushottampur stations the observed streamflow at the current condition post impacted was found to be highly altered with the estimated overall alteration index d0 of 72 100 d0 67 for the high alternation condition therefore the desirable scenarios for both river gauging stations are moderate and low alteration scenarios where the degree of hydrologic alteration is 0 33 and 33 67 respectively the optimal environmental flow requirement at the gauging stations was estimated for these desirable scenarios for the nandigarh station the optimized values of the parameters h and k are found to be 0 23 and 0 46 respectively for the low alteration scenario while h and k for the moderate alteration scenario are 0 29 and 0 03 respectively for the purushottampur station the optimal values of the parameters h and k are found to be 0 45 and 0 25 respectively for the low alteration scenario while h and k for the moderate alteration scenario are 0 18 and 0 10 respectively using these optimized parameter values the mean monthly environmental flow was estimated at the two sites which are illustrated in fig 9 a b apparently the environmental flow series obtained imitates the natural flow variability the estimated monthly environmental flow at purushottampur and nandigarh varies from 1 2 to 185 6 m3 s and from 1 6 to 44 8 m3 s respectively for the low alteration scenario for the moderate alteration scenario the monthly efr varies from 0 5 to 84 m3 s and 0 8 to 24 4 m3 s at purushottampur and nandigarh stations respectively the low alteration scenario is more demanding in terms of environmental flow requirement as compared to the moderate alteration condition which is obvious in the former case about 50 60 of the natural flow is required as the environmental flow against the 22 30 of the natural flow estimated to be the required environmental flow in the latter scenario our results are in concurrence with the recommendations of smakhtin 2006 for 13 different indian rivers in his study smakhtin 2006 assessed environmental flow to be about 25 85 of the mean annual streamflow to attain the near natural condition of the rivers while he estimated about 16 41 of the mean annual streamflow as the environmental flow requirements for moderate to heavily modified scenarios in another study conducted for the mahanadi river nearer to the current study basin in india sahoo et al 2016 recommended an average environmental flow of about 33 of the mean annual streamflow assessed using different basic hydrology based methods however peres and cancelliere 2016 recommended lower ranges especially for the low alteration scenario in southeastern sicily italy they estimated 30 40 of the natural flow to be the environmental flow for the low alteration scenario while 15 25 of the natural flow as the environmental flow for their study basins in fact the allocation of environmental flow depends on the basin s hydrologic condition as well as the degree of hydrologic alterations in the post impact period 4 conclusions maintaining the environmental flow in the river systems is essential to mitigate human induced river alterations as well as to preserve the natural ecosystem services and revive dying rivers however environmental flow assessment in the heavily regulated rivers under data scarce condition poses a major challenge for the hydrologists and water managers of developing countries to date very limited studies are reported in the literature dealing with environmental flow assessment of such river systems this study was carried out to demonstrate a scientific framework to estimate environmental flow for a regulated river system of india under data scarce condition the reconstructed natural flow series using the data of tributary inflow into the main river obtained by a hydrological model was used to estimate e flows at two gauging stations on the main river the e flows were computed for two pragmatic hydrologic alteration scenarios using the ga based optimization model the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the results of this study are as follows the developed hydrologic model predicted daily streamflow satisfactorily with the values of nse and kge greater than 0 7 and narrower uncertainty bands the reconstructed natural streamflow series revealed that the major impounding and diversion structures built on the river have caused a profound alteration in river reaches overall degree of hydrologic alteration index greater than 70 the mean post impact streamflow has decreased by 35 50 with 2 3 times peak flow reduction as compared to the pre impact condition it was also revealed that the post impact streamflow series tend to have lesser flow variability compared to the natural flow the estimated monthly environmental flow varies from 1 6 to 44 8 m3 s and 0 6 to 24 4 m3 s at the nandigarh gauging station for the low and moderate alteration scenarios respectively in contrast it varies from 1 2 to 185 m3 s and 0 5 to 80 m3 s respectively for the two scenarios at the purushottampur station to achieve the low alteration scenario about 50 60 of natural flow is needed as e flow whereas about 22 30 of the natural flow is required as e flow for the moderate alteration scenario the results obtained in this study should be further verified and or improved with the availability of related ecological sociological and biophysical data also the results of this study could be verified by using a higher resolution dataset of observed rainfall and temperature if these data are made available in the future nevertheless the results of this study can serve as a first step for the decision makers for the development of an efficient and sustainable water management plan the e flow assessment framework demonstrated in this study can serve as a useful approach for tackling data scarcity problem prevalent in the developing nations it can provide a high resolution estimate of natural streamflow series as well as time varying e flow estimates for highly modified rivers lacking in essential hydrologic information and the data pertaining to biodiversity or ecological responses the proposed framework can be easily replicated in other river systems located in different hydro climatic regions of the world with varying anthropogenic impacts especially in the developing world where data scarcity poses challenges for scientific research the findings of this study can be useful to the hydrologists water managers and policymakers for protecting river ecosystems under looming climate change and growing anthropogenic impacts credit authorship contribution statement smaranika mahapatra conceptualization methodology investigation

2766,for mitigating human induced river alterations and reviving the dying rivers to preserve natural ecosystem services the assessment of environmental flow e flow is essential however e flow estimation under data scarce conditions for the rivers being heavily regulated has become a major issue worldwide under changing environmental conditions particularly in developing countries to address this challenge this study was carried out for estimating time varying e flows for a heavily regulated river of eastern india under data scarce conditions in the absence of any pre impact streamflow data and tributary inflow to the main river reach this study proposes a framework integrating three methods to estimate e flow for river reaches a hydrologic model first method was employed to estimate tributary inflows to the main river which was used in the mass balance based naturalization approach second method for reconstructing the daily long term natural streamflow from the observed post impact streamflows at two gauging stations on the main river thereafter the naturalized streamflow was used for estimating e flows by the ga optimization technique third method for two pragmatic scenarios low hydrologic alteration and moderate hydrologic alteration at the two stations analysis of the results revealed that the major impounding and diversion infrastructures built on the river have caused profound alteration to the river reach having an overall degree of hydrologic alteration index greater than 70 the mean post impact streamflows tend to vary less and have decreased by 35 50 with 2 3 times reduction in the peak flow as compared to the pre impact condition the estimated monthly e flows for the river basin range from 1 2 to 185 m3 s 50 60 of the natural flow and 0 5 to 80 m3 s 22 to 30 of the natural flow for the low and moderate alteration scenarios respectively results of this study can aid in formulating efficient strategies for sustainable water resources management in the river basin keywords environmental flow hydrological modeling flow naturalization regulated river system ecosystem protection data availability data will be made available on reasonable request 1 introduction although rivers cover less than 1 of the earth s surface they are regarded as the most productive and diverse ecosystems on the planet opperman et al 2015 they often provide vital ecosystem services to the human society and other habitats modifications in the river regimes lead to the degradation of ecosystems and the consequent loss of biodiversity which can greatly affect aquatic ecosystem services benefitting humanity such as natural water purification natural flood protection and water supply for agricultural and allied activities wwdr 2020 the freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems have been negatively impacted by climate induced changes in the water cycle arias et al 2021 much of these climate change induced impacts are likely to be concentrated in the tropical zones encompassing most of the developing nations däll and zhang 2010 predicted significant alteration of the seasonal streamflows due to climate change on almost 90 of the global land area by 2050 apart from the climate change impacts human induced causes such as increased and reckless water use also pose a serious threat to the sustenance of riverine ecosystems the modification of the river flows by constructing hydraulic structures viz dams diversions and flood control structures significantly affects downstream river ecosystems dudgeon et al 2006 pumo et al 2018 ta et al 2016 as a result some important rivers of the world have already stopped flowing and are dying a slow death rawat and rawat 2020 in the present circumstances 60 of the major rivers across the globe are affected and fragmented due to the river regulation and consequent hydrologic alterations revenga et al 2000 this figure is likely to increase to 70 by 2025 zhang et al 2012 climate and anthropogenic driven water problems quantity and quality will continue to aggravate in the future and will become more acute in the business as usual scenario which will severely affect the socio economic development of a country and ecosystems therefore water managers and policy makers must take this threat seriously and improve current management strategies for ensuring sustainable water management to this end the assessment of environmental flows in river reaches is an important step for maintaining the health of river ecosystems and thereby avoiding environmental degradation in the downstream reaches of rivers hua and cui 2018 although the definitions of environmental flow e flow vary with the purpose and target species the most widely accepted definition is the quantity quality and timing of the water flow required to ensure the sustainability of freshwater ecosystems and associated living beings acreman 2016 ta et al 2016 however the water available for environmental purposes has been ignored or insufficient in many river basins to meet all ecological flow requirements because of already vying water users i e domestic industrial agricultural and recreational sectors arthington et al 2006 given the rising water demands and the finite water supply the judicious use of scarce water resources coupled with water conservation measures is a must for ensuring sustainable management of water and ecosystems the studies on environmental flow assessment and allocation have been conceived more and more in natural rivers as well as in regulated rivers during past few decades acreman and dunbar 2004 caissie et al 2015 jain and kumar 2014 tharme 2003 which is due to the growing awareness for the protection of degrading environment and the concern for water conflicts many studies have been carried out worldwide regarding development of methodologies for estimating environmental flow these methodologies approaches are categorized into four major classes based on the characteristics of the input data tharme 2003 they are i hydrological approach which is based on the study of historical streamflow data e g alcázar and palau 2010 shaeri karimi et al 2012 caissie et al 2015 amrit et al 2018a amrit et al 2018b ii hydraulic approach which is based on the hydraulic properties of river reaches e g nikghalb et al 2016 papadaki et al 2017 iii habitat simulationapproach which is based on the simulation of physical habitats and iv holisticapproach which includes interdisciplinary concept and addresses most of the components of the riverine ecosystem while assessing the ecological flow requirement e g arthington et al 2003 prucha et al 2016 often the hydrologic approaches are subjected to frequent criticism due to the arbitrarily set thresholds and the lack of temporal variability and scientific significance of their implementations the well established holistic approach is less adopted by the researchers as it requires a huge amount of interdisciplinary expertise inputs and hydrological and biological datasets which are often lacking in many developing countries in fact the type of the approach adopted mostly depends on the available data and the desirable accuracy alcázar and palau 2010 thus the studies pertaining to the e flow assessment often face data constraints generally the environmental flow to be maintained in a river reach should follow natural or pre development flow regime patterns for e flow estimation the streamflow data at different spatial locations are primarily important among other datasets however the availability of these hydrologic data from the existing gauging stations and previously studied cross sections with unimpaired flow regimes at required spatio temporal scales is rare furthermore environmental flow assessment studies are mostly limited to those rivers which are either natural or less human intervened headwater catchments e g pastor et al 2014 amrit et al 2018a mishra et al 2019 myronidis and ivanova 2020 karimi et al 2021 although some studies have estimated environmental flow for the regulated rivers e g alcázar and palau 2010 shaeri karimi et al 2012 peres and cancelliere 2016 those were possible due to the measured long term or at least few years of pre impact streamflow data for instance peres and cancelliere 2016 used a multi regression model for estimating long term natural streamflows which was calibrated using the streamflow data measured prior to any development additionally some of these studies such as alcázar and palau 2010 recommended a single minimum flow that does not represent natural flow variations and hence it is not adequate for reviving and preserving natural ecosystems in the absence of pre development data information about tributary inflows and water diversions can be utilized for deriving natural or near natural streamflow from the measured post impact streamflow data however the hydrologic data of different tributary channels are sometimes unknown which makes it essential to estimate beforehand to the best of the authors knowledge hardly any studies exist in the literature dealing with the assessment of environmental flows for the regulated river reaches deprived of historical streamflow data prior to human interventions as well as adequate streamflow measurements at the confluence of the tributaries and the main river given the above facts and research gaps this study was carried out with an overall aim of estimating e flow for a regulated river lacking in essential hydrologic information and data pertaining to the biodiversity or ecological responses in fact the adequacy of hydro climatic and ecological data availability in the basin under study is not satisfactory for carrying out comprehensive hydrologic studies required to properly address the sustainability of river systems for instance the river basin under study lacks any kind of measurement before the construction of dams and diversion structures on the river together with any data related to ecological responses and biodiversity these data are essential for the estimation of e flow in a holistic manner also streamflow information is not available at the confluence points of the tributaries and the main river which could be utilized for reconstructing the natural streamflow series that is useful for estimating the e flow of a regulated river the issue of such data unavailability poses a serious challenge for carrying out comprehensive scientific assessment to this end the present study demonstrates a scientific framework coupling three methods hydrologic modeling naturalization and optimization to compute e flow for the above mentioned problematic river systems which is a novel contribution of this study to the literature pertaining to e flow assessment this study is the first of its kind in the developing world in general and indian subcontinent in particular this scientific framework can be useful to the decision makers and water managers for the judicious allocation of available water resources among different sectors including ecosystems as well as for minimizing human induced detrimental impacts on the river ecosystem 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the area selected for the present study is rushikulya river basin rrb located in the eastern part of india fig 1 the rushikulya river originates at an elevation of about 1200 m above the mean sea level msl along the eastern slope of the eastern ghats and drains into the bay of bengal in the east this river basin lies between 19 07 n and 20 19 n latitude 84 01 e and 85 06 e longitude having a total geographical area of 7 012 53 km2 the rushikulya river has a length of 175 km there are five tributaries of the river namely baghua dhanei bada nadi joro and ghodahada fig 2 the reservoirs and anicuts fig 2 existing in the study area mainly supply water for agricultural purposes the basin is characterized by sub tropical climate with an average annual rainfall of 1336 mm about 80 of the annual rainfall is received during mid june to october end the maximum and minimum temperatures of the basin are 45 c and 12 c respectively and the relative humidity ranges from 80 to 90 a major part of the basin is covered by forest and agricultural land fig 3 the soils in the study area are mostly clay and loam 2 2 data for this study the hydrological meteorological and geographical data were collected from different sources daily streamflow data for the period 2000 2016 were collected from the central water commission cwc and hydrometry bhubaneswar odisha india daily gauge based gridded precipitation 0 25⁰ 0 25⁰ and temperature 1⁰ 1⁰ data were collected from india meteorological department imd across the rushikulya river basin rrb these gridded rainfall and temperature data have been generated by imd srivastava et al 2009 pai et al 2015 for the entire india using evenly distributed rain gauges and weather stations mondal et al 2018 the land use land cover lulc data was obtained from the national remote sensing centre nrsc india while a soil map of 1 km 1 km spatial resolution was obtained from food and agriculture organization fao in addition the storage capacity and release data for the reservoirs were collected from the department of water resources dowr odisha india the shuttle radar topography mission srtm digital elevation model dem of 30 m resolution was used in this study 2 3 methodology generally environmental flow assessment methods consider the natural flow of a river alcázar and palau 2010 the environmental flow maintained in a reach should follow the natural pre development streamflow pattern to maintain the river eco system intact the natural flow of a river denotes the flow prior to any significant hydrologic modifications caused by the construction of major hydraulic structures or other human interventions the extensive data required for e flow assessment is rarely available in developing countries like india and the rushikulya river basin rrb located in the eastern part of the country is no exception for estimating the e flow of a highly regulated river basin under such data scarce conditions this study combines three methods in a single framework as the rushikulya river lacks natural streamflow information a mass balance based equation was used to estimate the natural flow from the observed post impact streamflow this equation requires storage water diversion for irrigation or other purposes data along with major tributary channel inflow information along the main river which is absent in the study area due to lack of gauging stations at the confluence point of tributaries and the main river for deriving the ungauged major tributary inflow information relatively less influenced by anthropogenic interventions to the main river a hydrological model was set up before application of the naturalization procedure in past hydrological models have been proven useful tools for the quantification of ungauged flow guo et al 2021 in this study the soil and water assessment tool swat model was employed for this purpose as it has been popularly used across the world in different river basins thus the swat model outputs were used to generate naturalized streamflow data thereafter the naturalized streamflow data were used in an optimization method for estimating the environmental flow at a given location in the river reach the overall methodology adopted in this study is illustrated in fig 4 and the detailed procedures are described in the following sub sections 2 3 1 hydrological modeling for ungauged streamflow estimation swat is a process based semi distributed model and can simulate runoff efficiently at daily monthly and annual scales in complicated river basins having multiple reservoirs swat model was selected because of its broad applicability in large agriculture dominated river basins and easy incorporation of agricultural management practices in swat the modeled area was divided into 77 sub basins these sub basins were delineated from the 30 m srtm dem with a threshold area of 40 km2 subsequently these sub basins were divided into 1 360 hydrologic response units hrus by overlaying elevation land cover soil and slope maps information on the storage capacity daily water release from the reservoirs and the maximum irrigation water diverted to individual sub basin were provided as model input in the agricultural area the cropping pattern of all major crops grown in the study was also defined as the data on wind speed solar radiation and relative humidity are not available for the study area the hargreaves method was used in swat for computing potential evapotranspiration this is a relatively less data intensive method and it is used by several researchers in the absence of meteorological data required for using the standard potential evapotranspiration method fao penman monteith equation the surface runoff was simulated using the scs curve number cn method the runoff from each sub basin was routed through the river network to the main basin outlet using the muskingum routing method the model was calibrated and validated against daily observed streamflow data at the outlet of the river basin i e purushottampur using the sufi 2 technique of swat cup software before the calibration and validation the model parameters were subjected to all at a time sensitivity analysis also known as global sensitivity analysis for identifying the significant parameters contributing to the streamflow simulation in the river basin and for reducing the number of parameters at the calibration stage global sensitivity analysis was preferred in this study as it produces more reliable results than the local sensitivity analysis zarrineh et al 2018 the sensitivity analysis was carried out using the in built global sensitivity option of sufi 2 where the statistical significance of a parameter was determined by the t stat and p value the model parameter values were also adjusted manually for understanding their impact on the streamflow generation process and for the best representation of the real world situation prior to the model calibration using sufi 2 the model was calibrated using the data of 2000 2010 period of which initial two years were used as a warm up period for initializing and keeping reasonable starting values of the model parameters the model was validated using the data of 2011 2016 period the performance of the model for predicting daily streamflow was assessed using both statistical and graphical indicators the selected statistical indicators such as coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean square rmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 were used the lower values of mae and rmse as well as the nse and kge values closer to 1 indicate a better agreement between the observed and simulated streamflows additionally graphical indicators such as 1 1 plots and the simultaneous plots of daily observed versus simulated streamflows were also used for evaluating the model performance thereafter the ungauged tributary river inflows to the main river were derived by the calibrated and validated swat model 2 3 2 reconstruction of natural streamflow as there are no pre development streamflow data available for the rrb a mass balance approach similar to that proposed by blythe et al 2018 was applied to naturalize the streamflow at the gauging stations located over the main rushikulya river generally there are two major factors related to river flow alterations caused by human activities i changes in the streamflow due to a change in the land use land cover and ii changes in the streamflow because of human interventions such as flow diversion or storage structures in this case only the latter has been considered assuming that the land use land cover remains the same during the study period this approach can be applied to any long standing developed river system where the information such as tributary streamflow main river streamflow and reservoir storage change are available blythe and schmidt 2018 the approach considers the mass balance equations based on changes in storage within a control volume with the basic equation given as follows 1 i o ds dt where i inflow to a control volume o outflow from a control volume s storage volume and t time the inflow to the system consists of the upstream discharge qus tributary inflow tf to the main river groundwater inflow gi rainfall r and irrigation return flow irrf the outflow from the system consists of the downstream discharge qds groundwater outflow go evapotranspiration et and diverted flow from the control volume d replacing these in eqn 1 results in 2 q us t f g i r ir rf q ds g o e t d d s d t eqn 2 can also be presented as 3 ε ds dt q ds q us t f where ε is a function of gi go p et irrf and d in case the diversion data are available it was included in the equation separately change in the storage was assumed to be zero in the absence of a reservoir within a control volume thus ε reflects the gains or losses occurring between two gauging stations if the value is positive it represents a gain in the water volume and if the value is negative it represents a loss in the segment including both anthropogenic and natural causes when the ε values were negative for consecutively more than 15 days it was assumed to be anthropogenic losses from the segment because of water diversions where diversion data were absent for the reach this assumption is supported by the facts shared by the field engineers and farmers during the field visits in the study area that irrigation or other water diversions from the reaches continues for at least 15 days duration consecutively to remove the anthropogenic losses ε was taken as zero in those cases in the reaches where diversion data were available the value of ε are taken as zero for those periods where the diversion from the reach is greater than zero and there is a loss ε less than 0 from the channel to remove anthropogenic losses all the calculations were carried out at a daily scale finally naturalized streamflow q i at a given gauging station was calculated using the following equation 4 q i ε i t f i q us i where i denotes the day of a particular year as the naturalization was done at a daily temporal resolution the travel time of the flood peaks comes into the picture and they play an important role hence they were also considered while doing all the calculations by shifting q i by the mean time of travel in days to obtain the final naturalized streamflow series the above approach was applied to the main rushikulya river reach having three gauging stations namely pipalankha nandigarh and purushottampur the streamflow at the upstream gauging station pipalankha represents natural conditions as there are no diversion or storage structures upstream of the station in the 1st step the above approach was applied to the reach between pipalankha and nandigarh to obtain the naturalized flow at nandigarh the tributary inflow joro river as shown in fig 2 to this reach was derived from the calibrated swat model the sorada reservoir release which also joins the reach for sometimes was added to the calculation as an inflow tf in eqn 3 4 a similar approach was also followed for estimating naturalized streamflow at purushottampur station in the second reach between nandigarh and purushottampur stations three tributary inflows obtained from the calibrated swat model were used the mean travel time of flow to reach up to the outlet purushottampur gauging station is taken as one day in this study 2 3 3 estimation of environmental flow the effect of streamflow modification on the biodiversity or the eco system services is proportional to the magnitude of alteration from pre impact streamflow condition rolls and arthington 2014 it can be expected that limiting the streamflow regime alteration to minimum ranges will not have much impact or very low impact on the dependent biodiversity or the river ecosystem services thus an optimization based e flow method has been adopted in this study due to lack of any data related to the biodiversity or any published data on the ecological response to streamflow alteration in the study area to compute the monthly environmental flow requirement the naturalized streamflow pre impact series was used in the optimization method the core assumption of this method was that for sustaining the eco system services the post impact flow regime should attain the target ranges at the same frequency as that occurred in the natural or pre impact flow regime in this study the first group of the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha as proposed in the range of variability approach rva by ritcher et al 1998 representing the magnitudes of monthly mean streamflow values were taken into consideration a range of variation for the ihas estimated from the pre impact here naturalized flows is set as the flow restoration target for maintaining environmental flow while also leaving certain amount of streamflow available for abstraction or other utilization the range of variation target range for each indicator was bracketed by 25th and 75th percentile values of naturalized monthly flow similar to other studies e g shiau and wu 2004 2007 peres and cancelliere 2016 the objective function and the constraints of this specific optimization problem are presented in the subsequent sections 2 3 3 1 objective function to determine the optimal environmental flow for the river reach at a given stream gauging station the streamflow available for human utilization was maximized for this the following objective function was used 5 maximize sau my m 1 12 q my ef my h k m 1 2 3 12 a n d y 1 2 3 16 where saumy streamflow available for human utilization in the m th month of the y th year qmy is the naturalized streamflow in the m th month of the y th year and efmy environmental flow in the m th month of the y th year as a function of parameters h and k defined in eqn 6 in eqn 5 efmy was calculated using eqn 6 similar to that adopted by principato and viggiani 2009 and peres and cancelliere 2016 6 ef my h k q my i f q my k q mean m k q mean m h q my k q mean m i f q my k q mean m where qmean m is the mean of monthly naturalized streamflow for the m th month 2 3 3 2 constraints the above objective function was subjected to the following constraints i streamflow alteration constraint while allocating streamflow for different users alteration in the river flow regime should be minimized for this the degree of hydrologic alteration index d0 developed by richter et al 1998 was adopted which quantifies the deviation of the post development flow regime from the natural streamflow it was computed using the following equation 7 d 0 1 m m 1 m n o i p n t 100 p n t 2 where no i observed number of years with post impact monthly streamflow an indicator of hydrologic alteration iha values falling within a target range defined as the 25th and 75th percentile values of the naturalized pre impact streamflow p width of the target range 50 and nt total number of observed years the values of d0 are usually classified into 3 classes of equal ranges richter et al 1998 a 0 33 little or no alteration b 34 67 moderate alteration c 68 100 high degree of alteration as the desirable streamflow regime alteration for a particular river reach was restricted to the low to moderate alteration conditions the values of d0 was considered as 0 33 and 34 67 for the low and moderate alteration scenarios respectively the streamflow alteration constraint was defined as follows 8a for t

genetic algorithm ga with the help of ms excel solver 3 results and discussion 3 1 streamflow characteristics the daily variation of streamflow in the rushikulya river at three gauging stations i e pipalankha nandigarh and purushottampur are shown in fig 5 the streamflow varies from 0 12 to 408 m3 s mean 8 75 20 35 median 3 18 m3 s 0 to 956 m3 s mean 11 30 42 79 median 0 m3 s 0 to 2279 m3 s mean 69 53 187 58 median 8 18 m3 s at the pipalankha nandigarh and purushottampur gauging stations respectively fig 5 a it is also obvious from fig 5 b that the river is perennial at the pipalankha gauging station for the location see fig 1 with 100 exceedance streamflow whereas the river flows intermittently at the other locations the flow duration curves fdcs of the nandigarh and purushottampur gauging stations are steeper than pipalankha indicating the river is highly variable at former two gauging stations the streamflow observed at the pipalankha gauging station is less variable as compared to other two stations the river has a long term lean flow during mid december to mid june especially at both nandigarh and purushottampur stations with no flow for 30 of the time during 2001 to 2016 3 2 results of swat calibration and validation to identify the most influential parameters affecting the streamflow process a pre calibration sensitivity analysis was carried out the values of statistics t stat and p value obtained during pre calibration sensitivity analysis for daily streamflow simulations are summarized in table 1 based on these statistics values the eleven most influential parameters having significant effects on streamflow simulation of the basin were selected and were used for calibration channel hydraulic conductivity ch k2 manning s roughness coefficient ch n2 and curve number cn are the three most sensitive parameters among all the parameters having a p value equal to zero table 1 in a nearby basin pati et al 2018 also found ch k2 and ch n2 to be the most sensitive for simulating daily streamflow in their study area thereafter the swat model was calibrated and validated at a daily time scale using the most influential parameters identified from the sensitivity analysis the best fit model parameter values and their uncertainty ranges are presented in table 2 from the statistical indicators table 3 it is clear that the model is able to predict daily streamflow satisfactorily during both calibration and validation periods with good and very good nse values of 0 73 and 0 88 respectively as per the evaluation guidelines of moriasi et al 2007 and arnold et al 2012 this indicates that the parameters obtained during calibration are well capable of simulating streamflow during the validation period also during calibration the mae rmse and kge were obtained as 38 4 m3 s 102 1 m3 s and 0 80 respectively while they were 34 7 m3 s 89 9 m3 s 0 91 respectively during validation this shows that the model is able to predict daily streamflow better during the validation period with lesser error values and higher nse and kge values table 3 the p factor and r factor values also suggest that the amount of observed data within a narrower 95 prediction band 95ppu is more during validation as compared to the calibration period indicating better prediction confidence in the modeling results the superior performance of the model during validation might be due to the fact that the calibration period consists of dry and normal years only while the model validation period includes a wet year also year 2013 annual rainfall of 1 889 mm the model can predict high streamflow more accurately during the wet year as compared to medium range streamflows further observed vs simulated daily streamflow hydrographs during calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 6 a b it is apparent that although the simulated daily streamflow series closely follows the corresponding observed streamflow series pattern during calibration and validation periods their peaks are somewhat under predicting the medium range streamflow values about 700 2000 m3 s during calibration fig 6 a this is also corroborated in the 1 1 plots of the observed and simulated streamflow fig 7 a b the possible reason could be poor rainfall representation pereira et al 2016 and the inherent measurement uncertainty 3 3 characteristics of the estimated naturalized streamflow utilizing the ungauged tributary inflow derived from the calibrated swat model in the mass balance approach the observed streamflow at two gauging stations on the main river reach i e nandigarh and purushottampur were naturalized from 2001 to 2016 the basic statistics of the current observed and naturalized streamflow at two gauging stations are listed in table 4 the analysis of the results showed that the mean daily naturalized flow at the nandigarh station is estimated to be 28 02 m3 s sd 98 m3 s which is 1 5 times higher 50 higher than the average daily streamflow observed at the station after naturalization the daily median streamflow has increased to 7 43 m3 s against the measured daily median streamflow 0 m3 s at the nandigarh station table 4 similarly the mean daily naturalized streamflow 98 21 m3 s at the purushottampur station has increased by 1 3 times 35 higher as compared to the observed daily streamflow because of the flow regulations imposed by the dams and the anicuts in the basin the post impact flow regimes observed flow series tend to be less variable which can be noticed from their lower values of standard deviation as compared to daily natural flow series furthermore the monthly variation of the naturalized and observed streamflow along with corresponding box plots for both the stations are illustrated in fig 8 comparison of the monthly naturalized and measured flows during the study period fig 8 a demonstrates that the peak flows in monthly post impact flow series have been decreased about 2 3 times indicating the impacts of reservoir and diversions on the current flow regime also the interquartile range iqr of the estimated natural flow is wider as compared to the observed post impact streamflow at the two stations fig 8 b for instance at purushottampur station the iqr for monthly natural streamflow is 132 9 m3 s while the iqr for that at nandigarh station is 32 13 m3 s nearly two times wider than that for monthly observed post impact streamflow series at both the stations the mean monthly averaged over the years natural flow at purushottampur varies from about 2 16 in april to 316 48 m3 s in october while the mean monthly post impact streamflow observed varies from about 1 77 to 255 m3 s similarly at nandigarh the mean monthly natural streamflow varies from 2 79 to 82 73 m3 s while the mean monthly post impact streamflow varies from 0 59 to 62 99 m3 s furthermore a visual comparison of monthly median naturalized streamflow over all the years along with their interquartile range and median values of observed monthly streamflow are illustrated in fig 8 c this also corroborates with the previous statement that the presence of reservoirs and diversion structures has resulted in a significant reduction in the streamflow particularly during monsoon seasons because the reservoirs mainly store floodwater and divert them to fulfill the high irrigation water demands of paddy in the basin 3 4 optimal environmental flow requirements under different scenarios based on the obtained naturalized streamflow series at the two gauging stations the monthly environmental flow requirement was estimated at nandigarh and purushottampur stations the observed streamflow at the current condition post impacted was found to be highly altered with the estimated overall alteration index d0 of 72 100 d0 67 for the high alternation condition therefore the desirable scenarios for both river gauging stations are moderate and low alteration scenarios where the degree of hydrologic alteration is 0 33 and 33 67 respectively the optimal environmental flow requirement at the gauging stations was estimated for these desirable scenarios for the nandigarh station the optimized values of the parameters h and k are found to be 0 23 and 0 46 respectively for the low alteration scenario while h and k for the moderate alteration scenario are 0 29 and 0 03 respectively for the purushottampur station the optimal values of the parameters h and k are found to be 0 45 and 0 25 respectively for the low alteration scenario while h and k for the moderate alteration scenario are 0 18 and 0 10 respectively using these optimized parameter values the mean monthly environmental flow was estimated at the two sites which are illustrated in fig 9 a b apparently the environmental flow series obtained imitates the natural flow variability the estimated monthly environmental flow at purushottampur and nandigarh varies from 1 2 to 185 6 m3 s and from 1 6 to 44 8 m3 s respectively for the low alteration scenario for the moderate alteration scenario the monthly efr varies from 0 5 to 84 m3 s and 0 8 to 24 4 m3 s at purushottampur and nandigarh stations respectively the low alteration scenario is more demanding in terms of environmental flow requirement as compared to the moderate alteration condition which is obvious in the former case about 50 60 of the natural flow is required as the environmental flow against the 22 30 of the natural flow estimated to be the required environmental flow in the latter scenario our results are in concurrence with the recommendations of smakhtin 2006 for 13 different indian rivers in his study smakhtin 2006 assessed environmental flow to be about 25 85 of the mean annual streamflow to attain the near natural condition of the rivers while he estimated about 16 41 of the mean annual streamflow as the environmental flow requirements for moderate to heavily modified scenarios in another study conducted for the mahanadi river nearer to the current study basin in india sahoo et al 2016 recommended an average environmental flow of about 33 of the mean annual streamflow assessed using different basic hydrology based methods however peres and cancelliere 2016 recommended lower ranges especially for the low alteration scenario in southeastern sicily italy they estimated 30 40 of the natural flow to be the environmental flow for the low alteration scenario while 15 25 of the natural flow as the environmental flow for their study basins in fact the allocation of environmental flow depends on the basin s hydrologic condition as well as the degree of hydrologic alterations in the post impact period 4 conclusions maintaining the environmental flow in the river systems is essential to mitigate human induced river alterations as well as to preserve the natural ecosystem services and revive dying rivers however environmental flow assessment in the heavily regulated rivers under data scarce condition poses a major challenge for the hydrologists and water managers of developing countries to date very limited studies are reported in the literature dealing with environmental flow assessment of such river systems this study was carried out to demonstrate a scientific framework to estimate environmental flow for a regulated river system of india under data scarce condition the reconstructed natural flow series using the data of tributary inflow into the main river obtained by a hydrological model was used to estimate e flows at two gauging stations on the main river the e flows were computed for two pragmatic hydrologic alteration scenarios using the ga based optimization model the conclusions drawn from the analysis of the results of this study are as follows the developed hydrologic model predicted daily streamflow satisfactorily with the values of nse and kge greater than 0 7 and narrower uncertainty bands the reconstructed natural streamflow series revealed that the major impounding and diversion structures built on the river have caused a profound alteration in river reaches overall degree of hydrologic alteration index greater than 70 the mean post impact streamflow has decreased by 35 50 with 2 3 times peak flow reduction as compared to the pre impact condition it was also revealed that the post impact streamflow series tend to have lesser flow variability compared to the natural flow the estimated monthly environmental flow varies from 1 6 to 44 8 m3 s and 0 6 to 24 4 m3 s at the nandigarh gauging station for the low and moderate alteration scenarios respectively in contrast it varies from 1 2 to 185 m3 s and 0 5 to 80 m3 s respectively for the two scenarios at the purushottampur station to achieve the low alteration scenario about 50 60 of natural flow is needed as e flow whereas about 22 30 of the natural flow is required as e flow for the moderate alteration scenario the results obtained in this study should be further verified and or improved with the availability of related ecological sociological and biophysical data also the results of this study could be verified by using a higher resolution dataset of observed rainfall and temperature if these data are made available in the future nevertheless the results of this study can serve as a first step for the decision makers for the development of an efficient and sustainable water management plan the e flow assessment framework demonstrated in this study can serve as a useful approach for tackling data scarcity problem prevalent in the developing nations it can provide a high resolution estimate of natural streamflow series as well as time varying e flow estimates for highly modified rivers lacking in essential hydrologic information and the data pertaining to biodiversity or ecological responses the proposed framework can be easily replicated in other river systems located in different hydro climatic regions of the world with varying anthropogenic impacts especially in the developing world where data scarcity poses challenges for scientific research the findings of this study can be useful to the hydrologists water managers and policymakers for protecting river ecosystems under looming climate change and growing anthropogenic impacts credit authorship contribution statement smaranika mahapatra conceptualization methodology investigation

2014 the networks formed by fractures are the key conduits for migration of contaminants in groundwater systems and oil in petroleum reservoirs berkowitz et al 2000 renshaw 1999 zheng et al 2022 guo et al 2022 the radioactive and toxic industrial wastes can also escape from underground repositories through the fracture networks berkowitz et al 2000 therefore the connectivity of fractures embedded in impermeable or low permeability rock matrix i e granite and basalt is an important feature which control the fluid and chemical movement in above system liu et al 2016 smith et al 2011 zheng et al 2020 connectivity reflects whether fractures tend to be isolated as individual fractures or whether they interconnect to form network of fractures dershowitz 1984 to quantify the tendency of fractures to interconnect to form networks many measures of connectivity are defined for example the average number of intersections per unit area or volume dershowitz 1984 starzec and tsang 2002 xu et al 2006 and average number of intersections per fracture berkowitz et al 2000 robinson 1984 1983 for rock masses with impermeable rock matrix one can also use the effective hydraulic conductivity to measure the connectivity of fracture network which is directly applicable to many problems of geohydrology dershowitz 1984 judging the connecting status connected or disconnected is important in many geohydrology engineering wang et al 2022 for water sealed underground oil storage it is necessary to ensure that the rock mass between the water curtain holes is connected to ensure the water curtain effect wang et al 2015 as for the radioactive and toxic industrial wastes the rock mass in underground repositories should be disconnected to prevent leakage dershowitz 1984 based on percolation theory one can use the average number of intersections per fracture to judging the connecting status of isotropic fractured rock masses balberg et al 1991 bour and davy 1998 1997 researchers studied the critical average number of intersections per fracture when the fracture network become connected in three dimensional 3 d or two dimensional 2 d space the 3 d fracture network achieves the percolation threshold and becomes connected when the average number of intersections per fracture larger than 2 26 huseby et al 1997 and the 2 d fracture network become connected when the average number of intersections per fracture larger than 3 57 balberg et al 1984 wang et al 2022 it should be noted that the percolation threshold of 3 d and 2 d fracture networks are isolate independently wang et al 2022 quantitatively studied the connecting status between the 3 d fractured rock mass and its 2 d cutting planes they found that the corresponding value of the number of fractures in per sampled volume p 30 when the 2 d fracture network in cutting planes achieve the percolation threshold is 6 5 times of the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d fractured network achieve the percolation threshold obviously the connectivity measure on cutting planes can not directly reflect the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses this paper studies the connectivity of a rock mass with impermeable rock matrix the main aim of this study is to investigate the corresponding geometric properties of 2 d trace lines on cutting planes when the 3 d fractured rock masses achieve the percolation threshold for isotropic fractured rock masses we theoretically developed a method to identify the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses based on the 2 d geometric information of cutting planes numerical experiments are conducted to verify the developed method 2 percolation theory and theoretical derivation percolation theory is adopted in this study which is an effective mathematical means to study the connecting status of fractured rock masses in this theory a percolation parameter p is an average measure of geometric properties and links the connectivity of a discrete fracture network dfn bour and davy 1997 when the percolation parameter is in a small value the rock masses are not permeable however with the increasing of percolation parameter the fractures connect to others more frequently and form a bigger fracture cluster which makes an impervious rock mass begins to be permeable li et al 2020 a percolation threshold p c is a corresponding value of percolation parameter for a critical state where the unconnected system begins to become connected it should be noted that there are two different connected definition one is that the fracture cluster links all the boundary of the dfn model and the other is that the fracture cluster links a pair of opposite boundaries of the dfn model for isotropic fractured rock masses the percolation parameters are very close in these two conditions robinson 1984 in this paper the connected status is defined with the latter for a determined inflow boundary when the fracture cluster links the opposite boundary the system is connected fig 1 there are several different indexes of percolation parameters are proposed by different researchers among them the average number of intersections per fracture i which was proposed by robinson 1983 is widely used in studies huseby et al 1997 the average number of intersections per fractures at percolation threshold which is denoted as i c has a relatively fixed value for isotropic fractured rock masses and equals to 2 26 for 3 d dfns huseby et al 1997 in this study the following assumptions are adopted a the fractured rock masses are isotropic b all the fractures are considered as thin and flat discs c the fracture centers are randomly and independently distributed in the 3 d space following a poisson process and d the distribution of fracture orientation and fracture diameters are independent as stated above when the average number of intersections per fracture i equals to 2 27 the 3 d isotropic fractured rock mass will achieve the percolation threshold and become connected some researchers conducted a further study on the influence factors of i wang et al 2022 gives an equation to calculate i of a 3 d dfn 1 i 1 8 p 30 π 2 e 3 d where p 30 is the fracture intensity representing the number of fractures in per sampled volume d is the diameter of fracture discs and e is the expected value of the function within the parentheses from eq 1 it can be seen that the value of i is influenced by p 30 and the fracture diameter d however both p 30 and d are 3 d geometric properties it is not easy to obtain the 3 d geometric properties since the geometric information are usually from cutting planes or boreholes which are 2 d or even one dimensional 1 d data due to this difficulty some researchers use 2 d dfns on cutting planes to study the hydraulic properties of its original 3 d fractured rock masses however lang et al 2014 found that the 2 d cut planes are shown to underestimate the magnitude of permeability by up to 3 orders of magnitude near the percolation threshold wang et al 2022 found that the corresponding value of p 30 when the 2 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold is 6 5 times larger than the corresponding value of p 30 when its original 3 d dfn achieves the percolation threshold to have a better understanding fig 2 shows two different cases about the connecting status for 3 d dfns and their corresponding 2 d cutting planes in fig 2 a the 3 d dfn model achieves the percolation threshold and begins to be connected but the 2 d dfn on its cutting plane is obviously disconnected fig 2 b shows the case where the 2 d dfns on the cutting plane achieve the percolation threshold and begin to be connected at that moment its original 3 d dfn model is already connected as we can see in fig 2 a and b it is easy to identify the connecting status of a 3 d dfn when its 2 d cutting plane is connected however when its 2 d cutting plane is disconnected the connecting status of a 2 d cutting plane can t reflect the connecting status of its original 3 d dfn therefore the main aim in this study is to find the rule of the 2 d geometric parameters on the cutting planes when the 3 d dfn is connected in this case it is necessary to transform the 3 d influencing factors in eq 1 p 30 and d to 2 d geometric data once so it can be easy to judge the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses directly from observed 2 d geometric information to calculate i of 3 d fractured rock masses from 2 d geometric data the main focus is to transform p 30 and d into 2 d geometric properties in the past study p 30 and d have been found related to number of fractures in per sampled area p 20 and trace length l on cutting planes which are represented by eqs 2 and 3 the details can be seen in wang et al 2022 2 e l 3 2 e d 3 p 20 2 π p 30 e d substitution of eqs 2 and 3 into eq 1 gives 4 i 1 12 p 20 π 2 e 2 l from eq 4 we can calculate the average number of intersections per fracture of 3 d dfns directly from 2 d geometric properties on cutting planes in order to better describe the impact of 2 d geometric properties to i we define a connecting parameter p as an overall representation of 2 d geometric parameters as followed 5 p p 20 e 2 l thus the effect of 2 d geometric parameters on the average number of intersections per fracture of 3 d dfns can be expressed from a single parameter p combining eq 4 eq 5 and i c 2 26 gives 6 p c 0 88 where pc is the critical value of p where the 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold and begin to be connected in this case one can identify the connecting status of 3 d isotropic fractured rock masses by calculating the connecting parameter p when p pc the 3 d fractured rock masses is not permeable and when p pc the fractured rock masses are connected and permeable 3 numerical experiments the main aim of the numerical experiments is to compare the corresponding 2 d geometric information when the 3 d dfns achieve the percolation threshold with the theoretical results different fracture diameter d with respect to different standard derivation σ d are used in the numerical experiments to test the reliability of the theoretical results under different fracture sizes in this study we use the numerical code proposed by wang at al 2022 to verify our theoretical results the numerical code is based on particle flow code and matlab the length of block and the size of fractures are the necessary input parameters in this code and the fracture orientation follows the spherical uniform distribution three different cutting planes are set on the top the middle and the bottom of the block in order to obtain the 2 d geometric information once the mean value and the standard derivation of fracture discs are determined 3 d dfns are generated with an increasing p 30 with respect to each p 30 the 3 d dfn model are repeatedly generated with five different random seed and three different 2 d dfn models are obtained with respect to each 3 d dfn model with the increasement of p 30 the average number of intersections per fracture grows and lends the 3 d dfn model becoming connected li et al 2020 suggested the percolation threshold is defined as the situation when the proportion of connected model to all the models become 50 however since there are only five 3 d dfn models which is not large we decide the percolation threshold is the situation where all the 3 d models become connected the details of the numerical code can be seen in wang et al 2022 in this study the length of analysis zone l is assigned as 10 m different fracture sizes are adopt in the numerical experiment the fracture diameters in each group of models satisfy the normal distribution the mean values of fracture diameters d 1 1 5 and 2 m with respect to the standard deviation σ d 0 0 05 d 0 10 d 0 15 d and 0 20 d the parameters for 3 d dfn models are summarized in table 1 once the 3 d dfn models achieve the percolation threshold we calculate the geometric information on the 2 d cutting planes i e p 20 and the mean value of trace length as stated above there are three different cutting planes with respect to a 3 d dfn when the percolation threshold has been achieved and all five 3 d dfn models begin to be connected there are fifteen different 2 d dfns total since the percolation threshold for 3 d dfns is defined as the situation where all the 3 d models become connected the corresponding value of connecting parameter p is defined as the mean value of all fifteen 2 d dfns the standard derivation of connecting parameter σ p of the fifteen 2 d dfns are also calculated it should be noted that a the calculated value of p is obtained from eq 8 and equals to 0 88 b the mean of real values of p is obtained from numerical experiments and c the standard derivation of real values is the standard derivation of p which is obtained from numerical experiments in this case the comparison between real and calculated values is shown in fig 3 from fig 3 a b and c it can be seen that standard derivation of connecting parameter σ p is within a small value which means that the mean of real values of connecting parameter can represent overall situation compared with the calculated values real values are slightly larger the reason for this situation is that the percolation threshold in our numerical experiments is defined as the situation where all 3 d models become connected instead of only 50 models connected which makes our results more conservative and the percolation threshold a little larger to have a better measurement for the comparison we calculate the error rates for the theoretical connecting parameter based on the following equation 7 errorrate calculated v a l u e m e a n o f r e a l v a l u e s mean o f r e a l v a l u e s 100 as we can see in fig 4 the error rates are generally 20 for different fracture diameters d and standard deviation σ d the error rate remains at a low level which shows that our theoretical analysis is reliable for rock masses with different fracture sizes 4 discussion on application of connecting parameter since the connecting parameter p is able to reflect the connecting status of 3 d isotropic fractured rock masses based on its 2 d geometric information the application and extension of p will be discussed in this chapter firstly we discuss the application of the relationship between p 20 and trace length l based on eq 5 after that we expand it into more forms based on the original equation i e linear frequency p 10 and rock quality designation rqd in order to apply this method more effectively it is necessary to restrict its application conditions a this method is only applicable to isotropic rock masses and b the size of the rock mass should be times larger than the size of fractures so that the size effect of fractured can be avoid 4 1 application based on p 20 and l as described in eq 5 the value of connecting parameter p is calculated as the product of p 20 and e2 l when p 20e2 l 0 88 the fractured rock mass is disconnected when p 20e2 l 0 88 even the 2 d cutting plane is disconnected the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space in order to show the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses under different l and p 20 an intuitive figure is given in fig 5 there is a critical line in fig 5 representing the percolation threshold of 3 d isotropic fractured rock masses when the mean value of trace length l is certain we can judge the connecting status in 3 d space by observing the relationship between the position of the value of p 20 and the critical line if the value of p 20 is above the critical line the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space otherwise it is disconnected as shown in fig 5 when the mean value of trace length is small for example smaller than 0 25 m it is more common for the fractured rock mass to be disconnected since it requires a large value of p 20 to achieve the percolation threshold critical line on the other hand when the mean value of trace length is large for example larger than 1 5 m the fractured rock mass can be connected in a small intensity 4 2 application based on p 10 and l linear frequency p 10 is defined as the number of fractures in per sampled length which is an important parameter for rock engineering p 20 can reflect the information of the whole ourcrop however it can t directly reflect whether the rock mass is isotropic or anisotropic unlike p 20 comparing p 10 in different directions researchers can obtain the anisotropic properties of rock masses zheng et al 2017 on the other hand when there is no significant difference in p 10 in all direction we can judge that the rock mass is isotropic once the rock mass is identified as isotropic the connecting parameter can be used to judge the 3 d connecting status the connecting parameter p can be calculated by eq 5 which is the product of p 20 and e2 l zheng et al 2020 provide the relationship between p 10 and p 20 as follow 8 p 10 p 20 e l e cos α where l is the trace length and α is the angle between scanline and normal vector of trace line in our study the distribution of trace orientation is considered and the probability density function of α is denoted as g α according to eq 8 p 10 can be expressed as 9 p 10 p 20 e l 0 2 π cos α g α d α since the fractured rock mass is isotropic the trace lines follow the uniform distribution therefore eq 9 can be derived as 10 p 10 2 π p 20 e l eq 10 shows the relationship between p 10 and p 20 for an isotropic fractured rock mass by bring eq 10 into eq 5 a new form of the connecting parameter can be expressed as 11 p 2 π p 10 e 3 l therefore it can be easy to identify the connecting status of isotropic fractured rock masses by the values of p 10 and e l as stated above when p 0 88 the fractured rock mass is disconnected when p 0 88 the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space note that eq 11 can only used when the linear frequency p 10 has little difference in all directions in order to show the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses under different trace length and p 10 more intuitively fig 6 is draw as follows when the mean value of trace length is certain we can judge the connecting status in 3 d space by observing the relationship between the position of the value of p 10 and the critical line if the value of p 10 is above the critical line the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space otherwise it is disconnected 4 3 application based on rqd and l the rqd index is defined as the percentage of the borehole core or scanline that consist of intact lengths 0 1 m and has been widely used as an engineering measure of the jointing degree of a rock mass zheng et al 2018 once the rock mass is considered as isotropic it would be useful if engineers can judge the connecting status of rock masses directly by rqd therefore we discuss the application of the connecting parameter based on rqd in this chapter priest and hudson 1976 derived an analytical relationship between the expected value of rqd and 1 d density p 10 of the fractures as follow 12 rqd 100 e 0 1 p 10 0 1 p 10 1 due to the complexity of eq 12 it is difficult to directly establish the relationship between connecting parameter p and rqd so we draw the corresponding critical line of rqd when e l is 0 3 m based on eqs 11 and 12 as follow when the mean value of trace length is certain we can judge the connecting status in 3 d space by observing the relationship between the position of the value of rqd and the critical line if the value of rqd is below the critical line the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space otherwise it is disconnected 5 conclusion reducing the 3 d hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses to 2 d problems may underestimate the actual connectivity real fractured rock masses can be connected even if the 2 d cutting planes are disconnected this study provides an analytical method to identify the connecting status of isotropic fractured rock masses based on 2 d geometric information on cutting planes based on the relationship between p 30 and p 20 as well as the relationship between fracture diameter d and trace length l we theoretical derive the average number of intersections per fracture i of 3 d isotropic rock mass based on 2 d geometric information eq 4 we provide a connecting parameter p eq 5 to measure the average 2 d information related to the connectivity of 3 d dfn combining the critical value of i at percolation threshold one can identify the connecting status of 3 d dfns by the value of p when p 0 88 the 3 d fractured rock masses are not permeable while when p 0 88 the fractured rock masses are connected and permeable numerical experiments are conducted and the experiments results validate the proposed method the basic form of p is related to p 20 and mean value of trace line l in order to apply the method intuitively we provide an interval graph to judge the connecting status based on values of p 20 and l fig 5 when the mean value of l is small for example smaller than 0 25 m it is more common for the fractured rock mass to be disconnected since it requires a large value of p 20 to be connected on the other hand when the mean value of l is large for example larger than 1 5 m the fractured rock mass can be easily connected in a small intensity different forms of connecting parameter p have been produced for better application once engineers obtain the mean value of trace length they can also identify the connecting status of rock masses by p 10 fig 6 or rqd fig 7 it should be noted that the rock matrix in our study is considered as tight and is not permeable and the flow can only transport in fractures fractures are isotropic in our study and we will extend our research to anisotropic fractured rock masses in further study credit authorship contribution statement xiaohong wang data

threshold has been achieved and all five 3 d dfn models begin to be connected there are fifteen different 2 d dfns total since the percolation threshold for 3 d dfns is defined as the situation where all the 3 d models become connected the corresponding value of connecting parameter p is defined as the mean value of all fifteen 2 d dfns the standard derivation of connecting parameter σ p of the fifteen 2 d dfns are also calculated it should be noted that a the calculated value of p is obtained from eq 8 and equals to 0 88 b the mean of real values of p is obtained from numerical experiments and c the standard derivation of real values is the standard derivation of p which is obtained from numerical experiments in this case the comparison between real and calculated values is shown in fig 3 from fig 3 a b and c it can be seen that standard derivation of connecting parameter σ p is within a small value which means that the mean of real values of connecting parameter can represent overall situation compared with the calculated values real values are slightly larger the reason for this situation is that the percolation threshold in our numerical experiments is defined as the situation where all 3 d models become connected instead of only 50 models connected which makes our results more conservative and the percolation threshold a little larger to have a better measurement for the comparison we calculate the error rates for the theoretical connecting parameter based on the following equation 7 errorrate calculated v a l u e m e a n o f r e a l v a l u e s mean o f r e a l v a l u e s 100 as we can see in fig 4 the error rates are generally 20 for different fracture diameters d and standard deviation σ d the error rate remains at a low level which shows that our theoretical analysis is reliable for rock masses with different fracture sizes 4 discussion on application of connecting parameter since the connecting parameter p is able to reflect the connecting status of 3 d isotropic fractured rock masses based on its 2 d geometric information the application and extension of p will be discussed in this chapter firstly we discuss the application of the relationship between p 20 and trace length l based on eq 5 after that we expand it into more forms based on the original equation i e linear frequency p 10 and rock quality designation rqd in order to apply this method more effectively it is necessary to restrict its application conditions a this method is only applicable to isotropic rock masses and b the size of the rock mass should be times larger than the size of fractures so that the size effect of fractured can be avoid 4 1 application based on p 20 and l as described in eq 5 the value of connecting parameter p is calculated as the product of p 20 and e2 l when p 20e2 l 0 88 the fractured rock mass is disconnected when p 20e2 l 0 88 even the 2 d cutting plane is disconnected the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space in order to show the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses under different l and p 20 an intuitive figure is given in fig 5 there is a critical line in fig 5 representing the percolation threshold of 3 d isotropic fractured rock masses when the mean value of trace length l is certain we can judge the connecting status in 3 d space by observing the relationship between the position of the value of p 20 and the critical line if the value of p 20 is above the critical line the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space otherwise it is disconnected as shown in fig 5 when the mean value of trace length is small for example smaller than 0 25 m it is more common for the fractured rock mass to be disconnected since it requires a large value of p 20 to achieve the percolation threshold critical line on the other hand when the mean value of trace length is large for example larger than 1 5 m the fractured rock mass can be connected in a small intensity 4 2 application based on p 10 and l linear frequency p 10 is defined as the number of fractures in per sampled length which is an important parameter for rock engineering p 20 can reflect the information of the whole ourcrop however it can t directly reflect whether the rock mass is isotropic or anisotropic unlike p 20 comparing p 10 in different directions researchers can obtain the anisotropic properties of rock masses zheng et al 2017 on the other hand when there is no significant difference in p 10 in all direction we can judge that the rock mass is isotropic once the rock mass is identified as isotropic the connecting parameter can be used to judge the 3 d connecting status the connecting parameter p can be calculated by eq 5 which is the product of p 20 and e2 l zheng et al 2020 provide the relationship between p 10 and p 20 as follow 8 p 10 p 20 e l e cos α where l is the trace length and α is the angle between scanline and normal vector of trace line in our study the distribution of trace orientation is considered and the probability density function of α is denoted as g α according to eq 8 p 10 can be expressed as 9 p 10 p 20 e l 0 2 π cos α g α d α since the fractured rock mass is isotropic the trace lines follow the uniform distribution therefore eq 9 can be derived as 10 p 10 2 π p 20 e l eq 10 shows the relationship between p 10 and p 20 for an isotropic fractured rock mass by bring eq 10 into eq 5 a new form of the connecting parameter can be expressed as 11 p 2 π p 10 e 3 l therefore it can be easy to identify the connecting status of isotropic fractured rock masses by the values of p 10 and e l as stated above when p 0 88 the fractured rock mass is disconnected when p 0 88 the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space note that eq 11 can only used when the linear frequency p 10 has little difference in all directions in order to show the connecting status of 3 d fractured rock masses under different trace length and p 10 more intuitively fig 6 is draw as follows when the mean value of trace length is certain we can judge the connecting status in 3 d space by observing the relationship between the position of the value of p 10 and the critical line if the value of p 10 is above the critical line the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space otherwise it is disconnected 4 3 application based on rqd and l the rqd index is defined as the percentage of the borehole core or scanline that consist of intact lengths 0 1 m and has been widely used as an engineering measure of the jointing degree of a rock mass zheng et al 2018 once the rock mass is considered as isotropic it would be useful if engineers can judge the connecting status of rock masses directly by rqd therefore we discuss the application of the connecting parameter based on rqd in this chapter priest and hudson 1976 derived an analytical relationship between the expected value of rqd and 1 d density p 10 of the fractures as follow 12 rqd 100 e 0 1 p 10 0 1 p 10 1 due to the complexity of eq 12 it is difficult to directly establish the relationship between connecting parameter p and rqd so we draw the corresponding critical line of rqd when e l is 0 3 m based on eqs 11 and 12 as follow when the mean value of trace length is certain we can judge the connecting status in 3 d space by observing the relationship between the position of the value of rqd and the critical line if the value of rqd is below the critical line the fractured rock mass is connected in 3 d space otherwise it is disconnected 5 conclusion reducing the 3 d hydraulic properties of fractured rock masses to 2 d problems may underestimate the actual connectivity real fractured rock masses can be connected even if the 2 d cutting planes are disconnected this study provides an analytical method to identify the connecting status of isotropic fractured rock masses based on 2 d geometric information on cutting planes based on the relationship between p 30 and p 20 as well as the relationship between fracture diameter d and trace length l we theoretical derive the average number of intersections per fracture i of 3 d isotropic rock mass based on 2 d geometric information eq 4 we provide a connecting parameter p eq 5 to measure the average 2 d information related to the connectivity of 3 d dfn combining the critical value of i at percolation threshold one can identify the connecting status of 3 d dfns by the value of p when p 0 88 the 3 d fractured rock masses are not permeable while when p 0 88 the fractured rock masses are connected and permeable numerical experiments are conducted and the experiments results validate the proposed method the basic form of p is related to p 20 and mean value of trace line l in order to apply the method intuitively we provide an interval graph to judge the connecting status based on values of p 20 and l fig 5 when the mean value of l is small for example smaller than 0 25 m it is more common for the fractured rock mass to be disconnected since it requires a large value of p 20 to be connected on the other hand when the mean value of l is large for example larger than 1 5 m the fractured rock mass can be easily connected in a small intensity different forms of connecting parameter p have been produced for better application once engineers obtain the mean value of trace length they can also identify the connecting status of rock masses by p 10 fig 6 or rqd fig 7 it should be noted that the rock matrix in our study is considered as tight and is not permeable and the flow can only transport in fractures fractures are isotropic in our study and we will extend our research to anisotropic fractured rock masses in further study credit authorship contribution statement xiaohong wang data

2768,in 2019 the mississippi river experienced the longest and largest flood that surpassed by far the 1927 1973 and 2011 mega floods this unprecedented event provided an unique opportunity to test the hypotheses that summer floods increase not only lateral dissolved carbon transport but also carbon dioxide co2 degassing and that the increase in co2 outgassing from river surface occurs mainly due to higher terrestrial carbon inputs and warmer temperatures to test the hypotheses we conducted intensive river sampling and in situ measurements on partial pressure of co2 pco2 and other water physical chemical and biological parameters in 6 day intervals throughout the entire flood period january 6th to august 5th 2019 water samples were analyzed for the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and their carbon 13 isotopes compared to reported average pco2 measured at the same place from the recent past 1500 μatm 743 we found significantly elevated pco2 in the river water during the flood period 2217 μatm 805 max 3359 μatm which was positively correlated with water temperature ρ 0 83 during the flood with sustained high pco2 the lower mississippi river released 230 gg c from its last 357 km river reach which is 18 greater than the annual co2 emission 195 gg c reported for 2016 2018 a total of 3 73 tg c doc and 14 14 tg c dic was laterally transported into the gulf of mexico during the flood period which were close to or greater than the previously reported annual averages the findings support the initial hypotheses and strongly suggest that future climate change will intensify carbon cycling in world s rivers our study adds firsthand results on land sea carbon transport from by far the largest mississippi river flood and helps constrain uncertainties in carbon budgeting of global rivers keywords continental carbon export dissolved carbon fluxes riverine co2 outgassing extreme precipitation climate change mississippi river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction draining a land surface area of approximately 3 2 million square kilometers the mississippi river discharges

demonstrate not only how gigantic mass such a large river system can transport and transform from terrestrial to coastal systems but also show how large the mass transport can vary annually while it is important to quantify the large mass and variation of carbon transport for the global river carbon flux and budget field measurements in large rivers are rather very limited when compared to

river discharge has been predicted to continue increasing by another 11 60 by the end of the 21st century tao et al 2014 but our knowledge about the effect of climate change on river carbon transport and transformation is rather limited coastal louisiana receives the largest quantity of discharge of any estuarine and coastal section of the north american continent anthropogenic controls such as intensive agriculture urbanization industrial development and population increase in the upper mississippi river basin have resulted in downstream coastal areas suffering the highest riverine loads of

mexico during every summer alexander et al 2000 rabalais et al 2002 carbon is the main component of biological compounds playing a vital role in coastal waters and ecosystems dissolved carbon often constitutes the major carbon reservoir in rivers with dic being the most abundant inorganic carbon phase in rivers cole and prairie 2014 and doc being the dominant organic carbon form in the total fluvial organic carbon flux prairie and cole 2022 therefore understanding erratic dissolved carbon transport and transformation during extreme floods from one of the world s largest river systems to one of the world s largest hypoxic zones is integral for developing effective strategies and management plans to help protect coastal ecological and environmental integrity in 2019 the mississippi river experienced the longest and largest flood surpassing the mega floods in 1927 1973 and 2011 river water at baton rouge in south louisiana located 368 km upstream of the river s mouth at the gulf

the 6th of january through the 5th of august this unprecedented event provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of large river floods on carbon transport and transformation during this 212 day flood period we conducted weekly river sampling and in stream measurements to monitor changes in partial pressure of co2 pco2 doc and dic of river waters field observations from this intensive campaign would be very valuable which can not only serve a reference but also have implications for predicting future climate extremes on terrestrial carbon transport specifically we intended to test two hypotheses for this study 1 summer floods not only increase lateral dissolved carbon transport but also degassing of co2 and 2 increase in co2 outgassing from river surface occurs mainly due to higher terrestrial carbon inputs and warmer temperatures 2 material and methods 2 1 study site field measurements and sampling were conducted in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge 30 26 44 4 n 91 11 29 6 w louisiana in the southern united states fig 1 the sampling site was approximately 368 river kilometers upstream of the river s outlet to the northern gulf of mexico and 140 river kilometers downstream of the old river control structure in tarbert landing mississippi which diverts 25 of the discharge from the levee confined mississippi river into the atchafalaya river swamp the site was strategically selected for several reasons first the river at the study location receives runoff from a land surface area of 2 92 million km2 capturing drainage from nearly the entire mississippi river basin making it an ideal location for quantifying total dissolved carbon export from the nearly half of the u s continent second this site is not affected by tidal interference or hydraulic pooling that could occur when sampling at the river s mouth as previous studies have cai 2003 bianchi et al 2004 shen et al 2012 lastly focusing field collection on one single site rather than across the basin enabled compilation of a large dataset for seasonal analysis the average width of the mississippi river at baton rouge is about 1200 m wang xu 2018 the width is about 600 m at the sampling site all fieldwork in our study was taken only at times when no shipping activity was observed in situ measurements and water sample collection were conducted on a river dock approximately 50 m from the river bank which was operated by shamrock marine port company paired field trips were also conducted at belle chasse at river kilometer 122 29 51 19 8 n 89 58 51 3 w to check whether significant differences existed in parameters of interest between the lower mississippi river at baton rouge and head of the passes hourly climatic records were gathered for the study period from a nearby weather station ben hur station the louisiana agriclimatic information system located approximately 5 km southeast of the study site 2 2 river water sampling and measurements intensive water sample collection and in situ measurements were conducted between january 28th to august 1st 2019 in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge for the 2019 spring flood fig 1 specifically thirty two field trips were conducted with an average sampling interval of six days fig 2 to keep consistency all in situ measurements were taken at all field trips at around 10 00 am us central standard time cst while water samples were collected in twenty nine field trips the in situ measurements included instream pco2 of river water by a c sensetm sensor accuracy 3 of full scale

factory calibrated and did not need any manual calibration during the study period we conducted lab testing before each use 450 500 ppm in air for urban areas and proper sensor maintenance e g biofilm cleaning right after each use all water samples were gathered from the above mentioned river dock using a 3 7 meter aluminum pole with a high density polyethylene bottle attached to the end of the pole in each field trip three samples were collected in well flowing water at three different locations and at a depth of 30 50 cm below the surface and mixed for a representative composite sample which was then distributed to appropriate containers for further analysis specifically doc samples were filtered by 0 25 μm nylon syringe filters environmental express south carolina usa and stored in 60 ml acid rinsed high density polyethylene bottles while dic samples were stored in 20 ml glass vials with gas impermeable butyl rubber septa and filled with no headspace all water samples were transported in an ice filled cooler after back to the laboratory doc samples were frozen at or below 17 7 c and dic samples were kept refrigerated 1 7 to 3 3 c until analyses duplicate dic and doc samples were also collected for quality control purposes 2 3 dissolved carbon concentration and δ13c isotope analysis all water samples were shipped to the stable isotope facility sif at university of

ucdavis edu 2 4 doc and dic mass transport and co2 emission flux daily mass transport of dic and doc was calculated for the lower mississippi river at baton rouge as the product of daily discharge from the usgs gauge station 07372200 fig 1 and dissolved carbon concentrations from water sample analysis although water samples were not collected on a daily basis across the flood period no dramatic hydrologic and meteorological change was observed between any two sampling dates so it was assumed that there was no change in dic and doc concentrations between each two collection dates table a1 estimated daily dissolved carbon loads were summed up for total loads during the entire flood period as well as during the three different flood stages the details on which are presented in the appendix since in our study we conducted 6 day river sampling over 212 days showing a relatively high sampling intensity we insist that using our field measurements in this study gives more confidence and least uncertainties over a statistical regression equation that was developed 1 with much coarse data 2 not from the same location and 3 not under large flood conditions however regression methods were also implemented for dic and doc load estimates through the commonly used usgs software package loadest for comparison purposes default model number of 0 was used in the setting runkel et al 2004 the rate of co2 efflux fco2 in g c m 2 d 1 was calculated using the stagnant layer model by cai and wang 1998 2 f co 2 k t k h pco 2 water pco 2 air where k t is the gas transfer velocity in m d 1 k h is the solubility constant in mol l 1 atm pco2water is partial pressure of carbon dioxide in water in μatm and pco2air is partial pressure of carbon dioxide in air in μatm which is set as 410 in μatm in this work tans and keeling 2021 k h was calculated using the following equation developed by weiss 1974 3 lnk h a 1 a 2 100 t a 3 l n t 100 s b 1 b 2 t 100 b 3 t 100 2 where a1 58 0931 a2 90 5069

entirely fresh an s of 0 was used for calculating kh a k t value of 4 3 m d was used which has been reported to be representative for large tropical lowland rivers alin et al 2011 this value is higher than the one used by the only two previously pco2 studies 3 9 m d conducted in the lower mississippi river dubois et al 2010 reiman and xu 2019b as a flood event would most likely lead to greater turbulence which has been reported as the main driver of outgassing raymond et al 2013 there is another study reiman and xu 2019a that investigated diel co2 outgassing at the same site which also used a kt of 4 3 m d in addition raymond et al 2013 predicted a gas transfer velocity of 3 4 m d for large rivers which is close to the value used in this study as a result we believe that it is acceptable to use 4 3 m d for kt here and consider the corresponding result a conservative outgassing estimate to identify the uncertainties associated with the use of a constant kt we conducted a monte carlo uncertainty analysis that repeatedly calculated co2 efflux using a kt randomly selected from a value range of 3 9 4 7 we ran a total of 5 000 iterations and calculated the mean median and standard deviation of the corresponding co2 effluxes we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using a kt value in the range from 3 9 to 4 7 with a reference kt value of 4 3 results of sensitivity analysis were presented as change rates of co2 efflux which were calculated by the following equation 4 δ f c o 2 i 1 n f c o 2 i c f c o 2 i b f c o 2 i b 100 n where fco2i c is ith simulated co2 efflux when a tested kt 3 9 or 4 7 was used fco2i b is ith baseline co2 efflux estimated with a kt of 4 3 and n is the total number of observations in the flood period since pco2water was not measured on a daily basis during the flood daily rates of co2 efflux were estimated using the same approach for doc and dic mass transport assuming that there was no change in pco2water between two dates of in situ measurements daily efflux rates were then summed to obtain the cumulative efflux rates at different flood stages and across the whole flood period no significant difference was found in in situ measured pco2 between baton rouge and belle chasse the cumulative co2 flux during the flood 212 days was therefore calculated using the average daily flux rate and the total river surface area 298 687 907 m2 wang and xu 2018 from baton rouge to head of the passes the mouth of the mr fig 1 because the other two studies on the lower mississippi river dubois et al 2010 reiman and xu 2019b used a kt of 3 9 m d for co2 flux estimates we also chose the kt value in order to make our estimates comparable with the others 2 5 pco2 estimation and correction the c sensetm sensor was not working properly on five field trips 5 31 2019 6 5 2019 6 12 2019 6 18 2019 6 24 2019 and pco2 estimations were therefore conducted as a surrogate for these days an equation developed by cai and wang 1998 was firstly used to estimate pco2 using measured ph and dic data 5 pco 2 c o 2 k h c t h 2 h 2 h k 1 k 1 k 2 k h where ct is the dic concentration in mg l h 10 ph kh is the solubility constant mentioned above weiss 1974 and k1 and k 2 are the dissociation constants of carbonic acid harned and davis 1943 the sets of constants used above have been successfully applied for riverine pco2 estimation in studies conducted in the same region e g cai and wang 1998 xu and delduco 2017 then the derived pco2 estimates for the five days were further corrected by the linear relationship between estimated pco2 and in situ pco2 measured at the rest of sampling days fig a1 it is worth mentioning that corrected pco2 may still be underestimated values for the five missing trips so the correction conducted above represents a conservative estimation 2 6 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficients spearman s ρ were developed among parameters of interest including doc concentration dic concentration δ13cdoc and δ13cdic pco2 river discharge water temperature specific conductivity dissolved oxygen concentration ph fco2 and fluorescence of freshwater cyanobacteria chlorophyll a and

in the mississippi river at baton rouge during the flood period showed a clear increasing trend rising from 6 2 c in january to 29 3 c in august with an average of 18 1 c while dissolved oxygen demonstrated a strong inverse relationship with water temperature r2 0 96 declining from 11 6 to 5 3 mg l through the flood period averaging at 8 0 mg l table 1 and fig 3 chlorophyll a and turbidity

contrast dic concentration displayed an increase with a much higher average of 22 55 mg l 2 11 ranging from 18 12 to 25 90 mg l δ13cdic ranged from 12 70 to 11 02 with a mean of 11 43 fig a2 while δ13cdoc varied from 28 10 to 26 06 averaging at 27 17 0 42 showing a clear difference in carbon source between dic and doc within the 212 flood days the lower mississippi river at baton rouge discharged a total of 3 73 tg c doc and a total of 14 14 tg c dic to the northern gulf of mexico table a3 main uncertainties for the field based load estimates may come from usgs discharge measurements which is usually around 5 8 approximately 74 of the total dic and 75 of the total doc were exported when the river stage was above the major flood stage these percentages were consistent with river flow volume where 74 of the total river flow occurred at the major flood stage in comparison the dic export during the flood period was nearly 4 times that of the doc export results from the loadest regression model showed an average daily doc and dic load of 20 9 and 73 9c gg respectively leading to a total of 4 43 tg c doc and 15 67 tg c dic loads at the mississippi river at baton rouge for the entire flood period 3 3 partial pressure of dissolved co2 and co2 outgassing partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge fluctuated from 1074 to 3359 µatm with an average of 2217 µatm 805 during the 2019 flood fig 4 showing a constant supersaturation of pco2 when compared to the atmosphere co2 of 410 μatm tans and keeling 2021 the riverine pco2 increased rapidly with the increasing river discharge over the spring months and stayed relatively little changed during the following three summer months fig 4 no significant difference was founded in pco2 between mississippi river at baton rouge and belle chasse co2 outgassing showed a similar trend to that of the pco2 fig 4 using a kt of 4 3 the outgassing rates ranged from 174 7 to 491 4 mmol m 2 d 1 averaging at 305 1 90 7 mmol m 2 d 1 for the entire flood period we estimated a total of 777 g c m 2 co2 carbon outgassed into the atmosphere from the lower mississippi river the outgassing was highest 568 g c m 2 when the river was above the major flood stage accounting approximate 73 of the total at flood stage and moderate flood stage total co2 outgassing was 123 and 86 g c m 2 respectively the mean median and standard deviation of 5000 fco2 estimates generated from the monte carlo uncertainty test are 777 776 and 42 g c m 2 respectively as for the sensitivity analysis for all observations across the entire flood period δfco2 are 9 3 and 9 3 for kt values of 3 9 and 4 7 respectively 3 4 correlations among parameters of interest based on spearman s rank correlation coefficients most chemical and biological parameters in the river water during the 2019 flood were closely correlated with temperature table 1 dic pco2 and fco2 were positively correlated with river water temperature spearman s ρ 0 81 0 83 and 0 68 respectively while doc and do concentration showed a significantly negative correlation spearman s ρ 0 67 and 0 97 with water temperature pco2 showed significantly negative correlations with dissolved oxygen concentration ρ 0 84 and δ13cdic ρ 0 64 across the flood period table 1 interestingly pco2 also showed a negative correlation with doc ρ 0 56 and chlorophyll a ρ 0 59 additionally a strong linear relationship was found between pco2 and δ13cdic p 0 0008 fig 5 based on the spearman s rank correlation analysis no parameter except for dic ρ 0 54 and δ13cdic ρ 0 41 had a significant correlation with river discharge a linear trend is also found between δ13cdic doc and river discharge of the mississippi river at baton rouge although its p value is slightly above the boundary of a significant level of 0 05 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 effects of flood on lateral transport of dissolved carbon the large quantity of dissolved carbon transported during the 2019 mississippi river flood is unprecedented if using the mass transports estimated by the measurement based approach table a1 the doc and dic exports 3 73 and 14 14 tg respectively within the 212 flood days are comparable to those annual averages reported by previous studies table 2 for instance reiman and xu 2019b reported an annual export of 3 95 tg c doc and 12 25 tg c dic for 2015 2018 which were among the wet years cai et al 2015 reported annual export of 1 88 tg c doc and 13 6 tg c dic for 2006 2008 which were the years with long term average discharge of the lower mississippi river at baton rouge joshi and xu 2017 discharge during the river s 2019 flood 634 km3 is 15 70 higher than those annual mean discharge reported from the past it is apparently clear that the massive quantity of river discharge has played the key role in the lateral transport of dissolved carbon such effects would look even more significant if the regression based loadest estimates are used for comparison which is about 10 18 higher than the field measurement based approach the 2019 mississippi river flood progressed from the winter months to the summer months hence accompanying with a steady increase of temperature fig 3 the rising temperature can increase soil mineralization causing greater production of doc in soils e g borken et al 1999 moore and dalva 2001 sobek et al 2005 wallenstein and weintraub 2008 which can be laterally transported to rivers this theory has also been strongly supported by previous modeling work in which case greater temperatures are shown to predict higher doc leaching to the tributaries of the mississippi river leading to higher concentrations tian et al 2015 also increase in runoff volume has been reported to produce significant higher quantity of soil doc in headwater catchments raymond and saiers 2010 inamdar et al 2011 however in this study the concentrations of doc show a negative relation with temperature spearman s ρ 0 67 table 1 two reasons may explain 1 dilutional effect of the large flood water and 2 increased instream mineralization of organic matter to dic in the lower river reaches of the mississippi river basin as evidenced by the positive relation of dic concentrations with water temperature ρ 0 81 both arguments are also supported by the doc hysteresis loop with river discharge as shown in fig 6 specifically doc concentration and discharge increased rapidly together at the beginning of the flood from january to early march then a sharp drop in doc was found when river discharge went above 38 000 cm3 s 1 right after that river discharge receded back to around 34 000 cm3 s 1 while doc increased to another crest at mid april these changing trends show a typical scenario of dilutional effects on doc levels fig 7 in addition water temperature started to rose above 15 c at min april fig 3 which may lead to active instream mineralization of organic matter as a result doc concentration dropped again with an increase in river discharge in may and remained relatively low until the end of the flood fig 7 in general in large river systems the relationship between doc concentration and discharge has been found to be weak this can be due to several factors alone or combined including variable source areas voss et al 2017 time difference in the dissolved carbon delivery from headwaters to downstream locations creed et al 2015 raymond et al 2016 and instream processing that can modulate carbon availability hosen et al 2020 under extreme flood events the influence of these factors may be reduced because of rapid flow and largely reduced residence time for instance duan and bianchi 2006 argued that damming rivers in the upper mississippi river basin may have caused high diatom dominated phytoplankton biomass in the lower mississippi river as the result of decreasing total suspended solids and the longer water residence time the extreme flooding in 2019 could mostly have weaken the damming effect on the phytoplankton growth and hence the autochthonous doc production 4 2 indication of doc and dic isotopes a depleted δ13cdoc may indicate that erosive rainfall events play a vital role in dic and doc export as well as their ratio during floods the stable isotopic compositions δ13c of dissolved carbon are mostly determined by their external sources with specific δ13c signatures in stream biological activities e g photosynthesis and respiration and atmospheric exchange dubois et al 2009 specifically soils are often considered the main source of riverine doc billett et al 2006 evans et al 2007 the average δ13cdoc found in this study 27 2 is more depleted than the theoretical value of organic material across the mississippi river basin 23 5 by dubois et al 2010 based on the relative abundance of 73 c3 plants and of 27 c4 plants across the basin estimated by lee and veizer 2003 this is likely due to extreme precipitation and high runoff occurred in the basin data retrieved from noaa national centers for environmental information show that the winter of december 2018 february 2019 is the wettest meteorological winter during the 1895 2019 period of record with an average of 231 mm of precipitation for the conterminous united states which was then followed by the fifth wettest meteorological spring march 2019 may 2019 an average of 252 mm of precipitation noaa 2022 intensive precipitation and the rainfall accelerated snowmelt could cause a significant increase of doc derived from surface litter the lixiviation of the soil surface layers as well as channel erosion such as gully erosion and bank collapses to the aquatic ecosystem soil organic carbon from surface layers has been reported to be more depleted in 13c which can be progressively enriched with soil depth owing to selective preservation of plant lignin and lipids lichtfouse et al 1995 in contrast plankton derived 13c depleted doc in the lower reaches of the mississippi river may contribute less to the observed depletion of δ13cdoc as the extreme flooding could mostly weaken the damming effect on the phytoplankton growth in the upstream tributary basins and result in less autochthonous doc production duan and bianchi 2006 in addition the ratio of doc to dic mass transport in relative percentages of the total dissolved carbon export 21 to 79 is much higher than that estimated in another recent study 8 to 92 comparing lateral dissolved carbon fluxes from many rivers in the world chaplot and mutema 2021 suggesting higher erosional fluxes of doc from upper tributary basins during the 2019 historic flood similarly lower δ13c doc values have also been recorded in the amazon river basin during high and falling water periods as compared to the values during low waters alberic et al 2018 the depletion of δ13cdic during the 2019 mississippi river mega flood is indicative of an increase in dic derived from 13c depleted sources δ13cdic found in the study 11 43 is more depleted than those reported by cai et al 2015 7 53 for 2006 2008 and dubois 2010 10 0 for 2000 2001 and comparable to that reported by reiman and xu 2019b for 2015 2018 the above mentioned intensive precipitation during the flood period could wash out highly 13c depleted soil co2 accumulated in the pore spaces from the catchment areas and add a significant amount of 13c depleted c to the inorganic carbon pool which is evidenced by the negative correlation between δ13cdic and pco2 p 0 0008 fig 5 this argument is further supported by the significant inverse relationship between δ13cdic and river discharge ρ 0 41 table 1 and the linear trend of δ13cdic doc versus river discharge fig 6 which was also reported by others such as cai et al 2015 reiman and xu 2019b also reported in their study that δ13cdic measurements were significantly more depleted during the wet season january to july as compared to those during the dry season and the authors attributed the depletion of δ13cdic to increased dic derived from organic material across the basin except for terrestrially derived organic matter doc in water could also be an influential dic source as doc accounts for most of the net respiration as well as most of the respired non sinking organic carbon santana falcon et al 2017 mayorga and others 2005 found highly depleted δ13c dic values in the amazon river and attributed it to flushing of terrigenous soil co2 and the autochthonous respiration of plentiful organic material in the water column however we cannot determine the relative importance of the contribution of doc decomposition to dic for this mega flood with current data which may merit further investigations it is also worth mentioning that a negative correlation was found between pco2 and do during the flood indicating that in stream photosynthesis and respiration may play a role as well however this role is likely to be less impactful than the terrestrially derived carbon sources due to constant high discharges throughout the study period 4 3 water air co2 fluxes during the 2019 flood this study found a significant increase in co2 efflux at the water air interface during the flood period fig 4 as well as compared to the previously reported field measurements the quantity of co2 outgassed in the lower mississippi river during the 212 day flood of 2019 777 and 705 g c m 2 212 d 1 for a kt of 4 3 and 3 9 respectively exceeds the annual total co2 outgassing reported by reiman and xu 2019b for 2015 2018 654 g c m 2 yr 1 table 2 extrapolating the outgassing rate for a year i e 365 days the rate 1337 and 1213 g c m 2 yr 1 for a kt of 4 3 and 3 9 respectively exceeds the only other annual estimate 1036 g c m 2 yr 1 reported by dubois et al 2010 for 2000 2001 few studies have looked into co2 outgassing during river floods especially for large rivers but the existing studies show records in agreement with ours for instance in a study investigating the effect of the 2011 mississippi river flood on carbon dynamics bianchi and others 2013 reported much higher pco2 concentrations during the flood causing co2 fluxes reversed from a net influx to an efflux to the atmosphere in the lower and inner shelf waters in another study on the impact of floods on co2 outgassing of the amazonian rivers almeida and others 2017 found a 50 higher co2 outgassing per unit area from the madeira river a large tributary to the amazon river during a flood in 2014 the authors also reconstructed co2 fluxes since 1968 and found that extreme flood years outgas 20 more co2 than those years without reported occurrence of extreme floods almeida et al 2017 the elevated water air co2 fluxes can be attributed to a combined effect of discharge and temperature making it uneasy to distinguish which of the two factors is more dominant the 2019 mississippi river long lasting flood was accompanying with steadily increasing temperature showing a close relationship between co2 outgassing rate and river water temperature fig 8 however co2 effluxes were not hydrologically responsive showing no clear trend of co2 outgassing rate with discharge in the high flow range fig 8 a constant kt used in this study may be part of the reason for this as it may not fully reveal the impacts of flow dynamics through the flooding period however it should not be the main reason as our monte carlo uncertainty analysis demonstrated based on the monte carlo uncertainty analysis with a kt ranging from 3 9 to 4 9 kt could make an impact of about 9 on estimated fco2 this error is relatively small when compared with the large changes occurred in fco2 with the temperature range from 6 to 29 c i e 100 fig 8 instead the mississippi river at baton rouge is completely confined with no floodplain area in interaction with river water at high flows which is likely the main reason for the weak relation between discharge and pco2 this study was carried out during an unprecedented flood year where discharge was constantly above 29 000 m3 s 1 fig 2 i e nearly the double the average discharge of the river in the study by reiman and xu 2019b where pco2 was measured across a much broader range of discharge 6 000 36 000 m3 s 1 a closer positive relationship could be seen between discharge and pco2 especially when discharge was below 20 000 m3 s 1 there is likely a threshold of discharge influence on pco2 in this highly engineered river additionally the influence of flood on co2 outgassing is likely conceived and or incorporated with temperature as temperature directly affects anaerobic metabolism and floods transport large quantities of organic matter and respiration products from the inundated floodplains other studies investigating flood effect on carbon pco2 dynamics are also normally carried during the time period when temperatures rise up for instance the study by vorobyev et al 2021 on co2 emission from the artic lena river was conducted in the spring of 2016 when snow and frozen soils started rapid thawing regardless river size and geographical region peak flows and floods in the lower river reaches are typically associated with temperature increase in the drainage basin making it difficult to separate temperature and flood contributions it is worth mentioning that some previous studies have reported positive linear relationships between river discharge and co2 evasion and considered it an important control on gas efflux long et al 2015 ruiz halpern et al 2015 gu et al 2021 in this regard future fco2 estimates may benefit from a field data derived kt through a direct flux measuring technique such as the floating chamber approach 4 4 implications for riverine carbon transport under future climate this study presents the firsthand results on dissolved carbon transport and co2 degassing from by far the largest mississippi river flood in terms of duration and total volume based on our literature review except for some modeling attempts to estimate dic transport from the mississippi river basin ran et al 2016 wei et al 2021 table 2 there are only two previous studies dubois et al 2010 reiman and xu 2019b that conducted field measurements of dic and pco2 in the lower mississippi river table 2 and two additional studies that recorded riverine doc bianchi et al 2004 shen et al 2012 table 2 hanley et al 2013 estimated an average annual doc export of approximately 1 92 tg for the lower mississippi river at belle chasse for the period 2008 2010 however this estimate is not included in table 2 because 1 river water at belle chasse can be influenced by tides from the gulf of mexico and 2 the estimate was made using a regression model loadest i e not actual field measurements the fluxes of dic doc and co2 found in this study during the 212 day flood in 2019 are mostly higher than their annual values serving as a warning sign on how extreme weather events could significantly affect global carbon cycling under future climate additionally estimated dic and doc loads of the mississippi river at baton rouge 14 14 and 3 73 tg respectively during the 212 day flood are comparable or higher than the annual dic and doc exports 18 8 and 2 6 tg respectively for 365 days estimated by the dynamic land ecosystem model for the entire basin in the 2000 s which considered effects of climate extremes tian et al 2015 in addition to providing the most complete quantity of transport and transformation of dissolved carbon from a large river system during a unique flood event findings of this study will be also useful for future modeling research especially the prediction of carbon transport and transformation under weather extremes from the mississippi river and beyond global climate change has been expected to play a critical role in carbon cycling e g canuel et al 2012 naylor et al 2020 the report on climate change recently released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change https www ipcc ch has projected accelerated increases in both extreme precipitation and total precipitation for the coming decades with such drastic changes in earth s climate system more extreme floods are expected and the discharge of global rivers is certain to increase both gradually and erratically due to temporal and logistical constraints most studies are limited to monthly or even seasonal sampling regimes lee et al 2017 which might be adequate for normal flow conditions but not for high magnitude flood events current estimates generally overlook these events due to the absence of high temporal resolution sampling marx et al 2017 ruiz halpern et al 2015 whereas such events play a disproportionate important role in lateral riverine carbon transport and co2 outgassing as shown in this study while previous research indicates that mobilization of terrestrial carbon into drainage networks by low magnitude flood events could be reduced by effective protection of surface soil such as vegetation restoration e g wang et al 2016 shi et al 2019 this study amplifies the role of extreme floods in controlling riverine carbon transport incorporating flood events into the estimations of continental and global riverine carbon flux is therefore critically important which remains a knowledge gap in most current studies as climate change is to cause more extreme events such as extreme precipitation and flood events westra et al 2013 cai et al 2014 understanding the effects of these extremes on terrestrial carbon fluxes from land to sea and atmosphere is necessary to improve our global carbon budgeting extreme floods are erratic and their effects on riverine carbon transport are disproportionate which may increase co2 evasion by not allowing enough time for organic carbon to be buried permanently at the geological timescale ruiz halpern et al 2015 and increasing near surface turbulence to enhance gas effluxes from surface water long et al 2015 nowadays exports of water and sediment from many rivers in the world have been routinely measured allowing to assess their fluxes from an increasing number of world s river basins however flux estimates of lateral and vertical riverine carbon transport are subject to great uncertainties due to the lack of high temporal resolution measurements to capture erratic extreme flood events due to the significant dependence of riverine carbon transport on large flood events taking consideration of these erratic high magnitude flood events in future sampling campaigns is strongly suggested for an accurate description of riverine carbon cycles 5 conclusions this study conducted an intensive river sampling and measurements on riverine dissolved carbon transport and co2 outgassing during a historically large and long lasting flood of the mississippi river to our knowledge this is the longest flood assessment of dissolved carbon transport and transformation in the world field observations of dissolved carbon transport during this historic flood period are valuable and can not only serve a reference but also have implications for predicting future climate extremes on terrestrial carbon transport we found that during this 212 day flood the lower mississippi river exported a total of 17 87 tg c dissolved carbon laterally into the gulf of mexico and released 230 gg c from its last 357 km river reach vertically into the atmosphere this mass transport and transformation of carbon is much higher than the average annual rate reported from the past while the massive quantity of river discharge clearly played the key role in the lateral transport of dissolved carbon the depleted δ13cdoc found in the flood waters suggested that erosive rainfall events are influential in dic and doc export and their ratio whereas the depletion of δ13cdic during the mega flood is indicative of an increase in dic derived from 13c depleted sources water air co2 fluxes were greatly enhanced during the flood but this change was not linearly responsive to hydraulics this can be attributed to the combined effect of discharge and temperature as well as the use of a constant gas transfer velocity that may not reveal impacts of flow dynamics through the flooding period these findings support the initial hypotheses and suggest that future climate change will intensify terrestrial aquatic atmospheric transfers of carbon in world s rivers although the frequency and magnitude of large floods are likely to increase as climate change continues current estimations of riverine carbon flux e g 0 9 and 1 06 pg c yr 1 from land to oceans by cole et al 2007 li et al 2017 respectively often exclude effects of flood events due to the absence of high temporal resolution sampling we therefore suggest take into account these erratic high magnitude flood events in future sampling strategies especially for co2 emission that is less commonly monitored for carbon flux

2768,in 2019 the mississippi river experienced the longest and largest flood that surpassed by far the 1927 1973 and 2011 mega floods this unprecedented event provided an unique opportunity to test the hypotheses that summer floods increase not only lateral dissolved carbon transport but also carbon dioxide co2 degassing and that the increase in co2 outgassing from river surface occurs mainly due to higher terrestrial carbon inputs and warmer temperatures to test the hypotheses we conducted intensive river sampling and in situ measurements on partial pressure of co2 pco2 and other water physical chemical and biological parameters in 6 day intervals throughout the entire flood period january 6th to august 5th 2019 water samples were analyzed for the concentration of dissolved organic carbon doc dissolved inorganic carbon dic and their carbon 13 isotopes compared to reported average pco2 measured at the same place from the recent past 1500 μatm 743 we found significantly elevated pco2 in the river water during the flood period 2217 μatm 805 max 3359 μatm which was positively correlated with water temperature ρ 0 83 during the flood with sustained high pco2 the lower mississippi river released 230 gg c from its last 357 km river reach which is 18 greater than the annual co2 emission 195 gg c reported for 2016 2018 a total of 3 73 tg c doc and 14 14 tg c dic was laterally transported into the gulf of mexico during the flood period which were close to or greater than the previously reported annual averages the findings support the initial hypotheses and strongly suggest that future climate change will intensify carbon cycling in world s rivers our study adds firsthand results on land sea carbon transport from by far the largest mississippi river

mississippi river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction draining a land surface area of approximately 3 2 million square kilometers the mississippi river discharges annually a total of 1 88 3 95 teragram tg dissolved organic carbon doc and 12 25 13 60 tg dissolved inorganic carbon dic into the northern gulf of mexico cai et al 2015 reiman and xu 2019b the river has been also reported to be a large source of carbon dioxide co2 with a mean annual outgassing from 654 g c m 2 yr 1 reiman and xu 2019b to 1 077 g c m 2 yr 1 dubois et al 2010 the findings demonstrate not only how gigantic mass such a large river system can transport and transform from terrestrial to coastal systems but also show how large the mass transport can vary annually while it is important to quantify the large mass and variation of carbon transport for the global river carbon flux and budget field measurements in large rivers are rather very limited when compared to headwaters and low order streams gómez gener et al 2021 climate has been changing in many river basins over the last century warming climate intensifies hydrological cycle resulting in extreme

river discharge has been predicted to continue increasing by another 11 60 by the end of the 21st century tao et al 2014 but our knowledge about the effect of climate change on river carbon transport and transformation is rather limited coastal louisiana receives the largest quantity of discharge of any estuarine and coastal section of the north american continent anthropogenic controls such as intensive agriculture urbanization industrial development and population increase in the upper mississippi river basin have resulted in downstream coastal areas suffering the highest riverine loads of

mexico during every summer alexander et al 2000 rabalais et al 2002 carbon is the main component of biological compounds playing a vital role in coastal waters and ecosystems dissolved carbon often constitutes the major carbon reservoir in rivers with dic being the most abundant inorganic carbon phase in rivers cole and prairie 2014 and doc being the dominant organic carbon form in the total fluvial organic carbon flux prairie and cole 2022 therefore understanding erratic dissolved carbon transport and transformation during extreme floods from one of the world s largest river systems to one of the world s largest hypoxic zones is integral for developing effective strategies and management plans to help protect coastal ecological and environmental integrity in 2019 the mississippi

the 6th of january through the 5th of august this unprecedented event provided a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of large river floods on carbon transport and transformation during this 212 day flood period we conducted weekly river sampling and in stream measurements to monitor changes in partial pressure of co2 pco2 doc and dic of river waters field observations from this intensive campaign would be very valuable which can not only serve a reference but also have implications for predicting future climate extremes on terrestrial carbon transport specifically we intended to test two hypotheses for this study 1 summer floods not only increase lateral dissolved carbon transport but also degassing of co2 and 2 increase in co2 outgassing from river surface occurs mainly due to higher terrestrial carbon inputs and warmer temperatures 2 material and methods 2 1 study site field measurements and sampling were conducted in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge 30 26 44 4 n 91 11 29 6 w louisiana in the southern united states fig 1 the sampling site was approximately 368 river kilometers upstream of the river s outlet to the northern gulf of mexico and 140 river kilometers downstream of the old river control structure in tarbert landing mississippi which diverts 25 of the discharge from the levee confined mississippi river into the atchafalaya river swamp the site was strategically selected for several reasons first the river at the study location receives runoff from a land surface area of 2 92 million km2 capturing drainage from nearly the entire mississippi river basin making it an ideal location for quantifying total dissolved carbon export from the nearly half of the u s continent second this site is not affected by tidal interference or hydraulic pooling that could occur when sampling at the river s mouth as previous studies have cai 2003 bianchi et al 2004 shen et al 2012 lastly focusing field collection on one single site rather than across the basin enabled compilation of a large dataset for seasonal analysis the average width of the mississippi river at baton rouge is about 1200 m wang xu 2018 the width is about 600 m at the sampling site all fieldwork in our study was taken only at times when no shipping activity was observed in situ measurements and water sample collection were conducted on a river dock approximately 50 m from the river bank which was operated by shamrock marine port company paired field trips were also conducted at belle chasse at river kilometer 122 29 51 19 8 n 89 58 51 3 w to check whether significant differences existed in parameters of interest between the lower mississippi river at baton rouge and head of the passes hourly climatic records were gathered for the study

intensive water sample collection and in situ measurements were conducted between january 28th to august 1st 2019 in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge for the 2019 spring flood fig 1 specifically thirty two field trips were conducted with an average sampling interval of six days fig 2 to keep consistency all in situ measurements were taken at all field trips at around 10 00 am us central standard time cst while water samples were collected in twenty nine field trips the in situ measurements included instream pco2 of river water by a c sensetm sensor accuracy 3 of full scale

factory calibrated and did not need any manual calibration during the study period we conducted lab testing before each use 450 500 ppm in air for urban areas and proper sensor maintenance e g biofilm cleaning right after each use all water samples were gathered from the above mentioned river dock using a 3 7 meter aluminum pole with a high density polyethylene bottle attached to the end of the pole in each field trip three samples were collected in well flowing water at three different locations and at a depth of 30 50 cm below the surface and mixed for a representative composite sample which was then distributed to appropriate containers for further analysis specifically doc samples were filtered by 0 25 μm nylon syringe filters environmental express south carolina usa and stored in 60 ml acid rinsed high density polyethylene bottles while dic samples were stored in 20 ml glass vials with gas impermeable butyl rubber septa and filled with no headspace all water samples were transported in an ice filled cooler after back to the laboratory doc samples were frozen at or below 17 7 c and dic samples were kept refrigerated 1 7 to 3 3 c until analyses duplicate dic and doc samples were also collected for quality control purposes 2 3 dissolved carbon concentration and δ13c isotope analysis all water samples were shipped to the stable isotope facility sif at university of california davis california at an average shipping frequency of every 6 6 weeks for doc and dic concentrations and respective stable isotopic composition δ13c doc samples were analyzed using an o i

deviations of δ13cdic as co2 were approximately 150 nmol and 0 1 respectively while the analytical precision of δ13cdoc at doc concentration of more than 0 5 ppm was 0 4 https stableisotopefacility ucdavis edu 2 4 doc and dic mass transport and co2 emission flux daily mass transport of dic and doc was calculated for the lower mississippi river at baton rouge as the product of daily discharge from the usgs gauge station 07372200 fig 1 and dissolved carbon concentrations from water sample analysis although water samples were not collected on a daily basis across the flood period no dramatic hydrologic and meteorological change was observed between any two sampling dates so it was assumed that there was no change in dic and doc concentrations between each two collection dates table a1 estimated daily dissolved carbon loads were summed up for total loads during the entire flood period as well as during the three different flood stages the details on which are presented in the appendix since in our study we conducted 6 day river sampling over 212 days showing a relatively high sampling intensity we insist that using our field measurements in this study gives more confidence and least uncertainties over a statistical regression equation that was developed 1 with much coarse data 2 not from the same location and 3 not under large flood conditions however regression methods were also implemented for dic and doc load estimates through the commonly used usgs software package loadest for comparison purposes default model number of 0 was used in the setting runkel et al 2004 the rate of co2 efflux fco2 in g c m 2 d 1 was calculated using the stagnant layer model by cai and wang 1998 2 f co 2 k t k h pco 2 water pco 2 air where k t is the gas transfer velocity in m d 1 k h is the solubility constant in mol l 1 atm pco2water is partial pressure of carbon dioxide in water in μatm and pco2air is partial pressure of carbon dioxide in air in μatm which is set as 410 in μatm in this work tans and keeling 2021 k h was calculated using the following equation developed by weiss 1974 3 lnk h a 1 a 2 100 t a 3 l n t 100 s b 1 b 2 t 100 b 3 t 100 2 where a1 58 0931 a2 90 5069

entirely fresh an s of 0 was used for calculating kh a k t value of 4 3 m d was used which has been reported to be representative for large tropical lowland rivers alin et al 2011 this value is higher than the one used by the only two previously pco2 studies 3 9 m d conducted in the lower mississippi river dubois et al 2010 reiman and xu 2019b as a flood event would most likely lead to greater turbulence which has been reported as the main driver of outgassing raymond et al 2013 there is another study reiman and xu 2019a that investigated diel co2 outgassing at the same site which also used a kt of 4 3 m d in addition raymond et al 2013 predicted a gas transfer velocity of 3 4 m d for large rivers which is close to the value used in this study as a result we believe that it is acceptable to use 4 3 m d for kt here and consider the corresponding result a conservative outgassing estimate to identify the uncertainties associated with the use of a constant kt we conducted a monte carlo uncertainty analysis that repeatedly calculated co2 efflux using a kt randomly selected from a value range of 3 9 4 7 we ran a total of 5 000 iterations and calculated the mean median and standard deviation of the corresponding co2 effluxes we also conducted a sensitivity analysis using a kt value in the range from 3 9 to 4 7 with a reference kt value of 4 3 results of sensitivity analysis were presented as change rates of co2 efflux which were calculated by the following equation 4 δ f c o 2 i 1 n f c o 2 i c f c o 2 i b f c o 2 i b 100 n where fco2i c is ith simulated co2 efflux when a tested kt 3 9 or 4 7 was used fco2i b is ith baseline co2 efflux estimated with a kt of 4 3 and n is the total number of observations in the flood period since pco2water was not measured on a daily basis during the flood daily rates of co2 efflux were estimated using the same approach for doc and dic mass transport assuming that there was no change in pco2water between two dates of in situ measurements daily efflux rates were then summed to obtain the cumulative efflux rates at different flood stages and across the whole flood period no significant difference was found in in situ measured pco2 between baton rouge and belle chasse the cumulative co2 flux during the flood 212 days was therefore calculated using the average daily flux rate and the total river surface area 298 687 907 m2 wang and xu 2018 from baton rouge to head of the passes the mouth of the mr fig 1 because the other two studies on the lower mississippi river dubois et al 2010 reiman and xu 2019b used a kt of 3 9 m d for co2 flux estimates we also chose the kt value in order to make our estimates comparable with the others 2 5 pco2 estimation and correction the c sensetm sensor was not working properly on five field trips 5 31 2019 6 5 2019 6 12 2019 6 18 2019 6 24 2019 and pco2 estimations were therefore conducted as a surrogate for these days an equation developed by cai and wang 1998 was firstly used to estimate pco2 using measured ph and dic data 5 pco 2 c o 2 k h c t h 2 h 2 h k 1 k 1 k 2 k h where ct is the dic concentration in mg l h 10 ph kh is the solubility constant mentioned above weiss 1974 and k1 and k 2 are the dissociation constants of carbonic acid harned and davis 1943 the sets of constants used above have been successfully applied for riverine pco2 estimation in studies conducted in the same region e g cai and wang 1998 xu and delduco 2017 then the derived pco2 estimates for the five days were further corrected by the linear relationship between estimated pco2 and in situ pco2 measured at the rest of sampling days fig a1 it is worth mentioning that corrected pco2 may still be underestimated values for the five missing trips so the correction conducted above represents a conservative estimation 2 6 statistical analysis spearman s rank correlation coefficients spearman s ρ were developed among parameters of interest including doc concentration dic concentration δ13cdoc and δ13cdic pco2 river discharge water temperature specific conductivity dissolved oxygen concentration ph fco2 and fluorescence of freshwater cyanobacteria chlorophyll a and cdom linear regressions were developed to further confirm relationships between pairs of parameters including δ13cdic and pco2 the ratio of dic doc carbon 13 isotope δ13cdic doc and river discharge fco2 and river discharge and fco2 and water temperature parameters including chlorophyll a fluorescence cdom turbidity specific conductivity dissolved oxygen concentration and ph were compared for statistically significant differences between the rising and recession limbs of the flood by randomization tests edgington and onghena 2007 specifically data for the rising limb were collected on 2 28

results 3 1 flood and physiochemical conditions during the 212 day flood from january 6th to october 5th in 2019 the mississippi river discharged a total of 634 km3 of water with an average daily flow of 34 635 m3 s 1 ranging from 24 281 to 38 930 m3 s 1 and exceeding double that of the average in the past four decades 15 027 m3 s 1 joshi and xu 2015 this large flow volume within seven months was about 134 that of the long term annual average of the river at tarbert landing from 1973 to 2013 474 km3 joshi and xu 2015 and exceeded those historical large floods in 1927 1973 and 2011 the river water was above the major flood stage 12 19 m for 148 days and remained above moderate flood stage 11 58 12 19 m and flood stage 10 67 11 58 m for 21 and 43 days respectively fig 2 water temperature in the mississippi river at baton rouge during the flood period showed a clear increasing trend rising from 6 2 c in january to 29 3 c in august with an average of 18 1 c while dissolved oxygen demonstrated a strong inverse relationship with water temperature r2 0 96 declining from 11 6 to 5 3 mg l through the flood period averaging at 8 0 mg l table 1 and fig 3 chlorophyll a and turbidity in the river fluctuated respectively from 89 7 to 287 7 afu and from 13 9 to 74 4 ntu and the two parameters had a generally declining trend fig 3 river water had moderate variations in specific conductivity varying from 247 8 to 434 9 µs cm 1 the temporal trend of which mirrored that of the water temperature r2 0 83 table 1 and fig 3 ph changed very little over the 212 day flood period ranging from 7 70 to 8 02 with an average at 7 81 no significant difference was found between the rising and recessing limbs in the environmental parameters except for dissolved oxygen the average of which was significantly higher on the rising limb than that on the recession limb table a2 3 2 dissolved carbon concentration and mass transport during the 212 day historic flood of the mississippi river in 2019 doc concentrations in the river water at baton rouge showed a slightly steady decrease with an average of 5 90 mg l 1 12 and a moderate range between 4 59 and 8 48 mg l fig a2 in contrast dic concentration displayed an increase with a much higher average of 22 55 mg l 2 11 ranging from 18 12 to 25 90 mg l δ13cdic ranged from 12 70 to 11 02 with a mean of 11 43 fig a2 while δ13cdoc varied from 28 10 to 26 06 averaging at 27 17 0 42 showing a clear difference in carbon source between dic and doc within the 212 flood days the lower mississippi river at baton rouge discharged a total of 3 73 tg c doc and a total of 14 14 tg c dic to the northern gulf of mexico table a3 main uncertainties for the field based load estimates may come from usgs discharge measurements which is usually around 5 8 approximately 74 of the total dic and 75 of the total doc were exported when the river stage was above the major flood stage these percentages were consistent with river flow volume where 74 of the total river flow occurred at the major flood stage in comparison the dic export during the flood period was nearly 4 times that of the doc export results from the loadest regression model showed an average daily doc and dic load of 20 9 and 73 9c gg respectively leading to a total of 4 43 tg c doc and 15 67 tg c dic loads at the mississippi river at baton rouge for the entire flood period 3 3 partial pressure of dissolved co2 and co2 outgassing partial pressure of dissolved carbon dioxide in the lower mississippi river at baton rouge fluctuated from 1074 to 3359 µatm with an average of 2217 µatm 805 during the 2019 flood fig 4 showing a constant supersaturation of pco2 when compared to the atmosphere co2 of 410 μatm tans and keeling 2021 the riverine pco2 increased rapidly with the increasing river discharge over the spring months and stayed relatively little changed during the following three summer months fig 4 no significant difference was founded in pco2 between mississippi river at baton rouge and belle chasse co2 outgassing showed a similar trend to that of the pco2 fig 4 using a kt of 4 3 the outgassing rates ranged from 174 7 to 491 4 mmol m 2 d 1 averaging at 305 1 90 7 mmol m 2 d 1 for the entire flood period we estimated a total of 777 g c m 2 co2 carbon outgassed into the atmosphere from the lower mississippi river the outgassing was highest 568 g c m 2 when the river was above the major flood stage accounting approximate 73 of the total at flood stage and moderate flood stage total co2 outgassing was 123 and 86 g c m 2 respectively the mean median and standard deviation of 5000 fco2 estimates generated from the monte carlo uncertainty test are 777 776 and 42 g c m 2 respectively as for the sensitivity analysis for all observations across the entire flood period δfco2 are 9 3 and 9 3 for kt values of 3 9 and 4 7 respectively 3 4 correlations among parameters of interest based on spearman s rank correlation coefficients most chemical and biological parameters in the river water during the 2019 flood were closely correlated with temperature table 1 dic pco2 and fco2 were positively correlated with river water temperature spearman s ρ 0 81 0 83 and 0 68 respectively while doc and do concentration showed a significantly negative correlation spearman s ρ 0 67 and 0 97 with water temperature pco2 showed significantly negative correlations with dissolved oxygen concentration ρ 0 84 and δ13cdic ρ 0 64 across the flood period table 1 interestingly pco2 also showed a negative correlation with doc ρ 0 56 and chlorophyll a ρ 0 59 additionally a strong linear relationship was found between pco2 and δ13cdic p 0 0008 fig 5 based on the spearman s rank correlation analysis no parameter except for dic ρ 0 54 and δ13cdic ρ 0 41 had a significant correlation with river discharge a linear trend is also found between δ13cdic doc and river discharge of the mississippi river at baton rouge although its p value is slightly above the boundary of a significant level of 0 05 fig 6 4 discussion 4 1 effects of flood on lateral transport of dissolved carbon the large quantity of dissolved carbon transported during the 2019 mississippi river flood is unprecedented if using the mass transports estimated by the measurement based approach table a1 the doc and dic exports 3 73 and 14 14 tg respectively within the 212 flood days are comparable to those annual averages reported by previous studies table 2 for instance reiman and xu 2019b reported an annual export of 3 95 tg c doc and 12 25 tg c dic for 2015 2018 which were among the wet years cai et al 2015 reported annual export of 1 88 tg c doc and 13 6 tg c dic for 2006 2008 which were the years with long term average discharge of the lower mississippi river at baton rouge joshi and xu 2017 discharge during the river s 2019 flood 634 km3 is 15 70 higher than those annual mean discharge reported from the past it is apparently clear that the massive quantity of river discharge has played the key role in the lateral transport of dissolved carbon such effects would look even more significant if the regression based loadest estimates are used for comparison which is about 10 18 higher than the field measurement based approach the 2019 mississippi river flood progressed from the winter months to the summer months hence accompanying with a steady increase of temperature fig 3 the rising temperature can increase soil mineralization causing greater production of doc in soils e g borken et al 1999 moore and dalva 2001 sobek et al 2005 wallenstein and weintraub 2008 which can be laterally transported to rivers this theory has also been strongly supported by previous modeling work in which case greater temperatures are shown to predict higher doc leaching to the tributaries of the mississippi river leading to higher concentrations tian et al 2015 also increase in runoff volume has been reported to produce significant higher quantity of soil doc in headwater catchments raymond and saiers 2010 inamdar et al 2011 however in this study the concentrations of doc show a negative relation with temperature spearman s ρ 0 67 table 1 two reasons may explain 1 dilutional effect of the large flood water and 2 increased instream mineralization of organic matter to dic in the lower river reaches of the mississippi river basin as evidenced by the positive relation of dic concentrations with water temperature ρ 0 81 both arguments are also supported by the doc hysteresis loop with river discharge as shown in fig 6 specifically doc concentration and discharge increased rapidly together at the beginning of the flood from january to early march then a sharp drop in doc was found when river discharge went above 38 000 cm3 s 1 right after that river discharge receded back to around 34 000 cm3 s 1 while doc increased to another crest at mid april these changing trends show a typical scenario of dilutional effects on doc levels fig 7 in addition water temperature started to rose above 15 c at min april fig 3 which may lead to active instream mineralization of organic matter as a result doc concentration dropped again with an increase in river discharge in may and remained relatively low until the end of the flood fig 7 in general in large river systems the relationship between doc concentration and discharge has been found to be weak this can be due to several factors alone or combined including variable source areas voss et al 2017 time difference in the dissolved carbon delivery from headwaters to downstream locations creed et al 2015 raymond et al 2016 and instream processing that can modulate carbon availability hosen et al 2020 under extreme flood events the influence of these factors may be reduced because of rapid flow and largely reduced residence time for instance duan and bianchi 2006 argued that damming rivers in the upper mississippi river basin may have caused high diatom dominated phytoplankton biomass in the lower mississippi river as the result of decreasing total suspended solids and the longer water residence time the extreme flooding in 2019 could mostly have weaken the damming effect on the phytoplankton growth and hence the autochthonous doc production 4 2 indication of doc and dic isotopes a depleted δ13cdoc may indicate that erosive rainfall events play a vital role in dic and doc export as well as their ratio during floods the stable isotopic compositions δ13c of dissolved carbon are mostly determined by their external sources with specific δ13c signatures in stream biological activities e g photosynthesis and respiration and atmospheric exchange dubois et al 2009 specifically soils are often considered the main source of riverine doc billett et al 2006 evans et al 2007 the average δ13cdoc found in this study 27 2 is more depleted than the theoretical value of organic material across the mississippi river basin 23 5 by dubois et al 2010 based on the relative abundance of 73 c3 plants and of 27 c4 plants across the basin estimated by lee and veizer 2003 this is likely due to extreme precipitation and high runoff occurred in the basin data retrieved from noaa national centers for environmental information show that the winter of december 2018 february 2019 is the wettest meteorological winter during the 1895 2019 period of record with an average of 231 mm of precipitation for the conterminous united states which was then followed by the fifth wettest meteorological spring march 2019 may 2019 an average of 252 mm of precipitation noaa 2022 intensive precipitation and the rainfall accelerated snowmelt could cause a significant increase of doc derived from surface litter the lixiviation of the soil surface layers as well as channel erosion such as gully erosion and bank collapses to the aquatic ecosystem soil organic carbon from surface layers has been reported to be more depleted in 13c which can be progressively enriched with soil depth owing to selective preservation of plant lignin and lipids lichtfouse et al 1995 in contrast plankton derived 13c depleted doc in the lower reaches of the mississippi river may contribute less to the observed depletion of δ13cdoc as the extreme flooding could mostly weaken the damming effect on the phytoplankton growth in the upstream tributary basins and result in less autochthonous doc production duan and bianchi 2006 in addition the ratio of doc to dic mass transport in relative percentages of the total dissolved carbon export 21 to 79 is much higher than that estimated in another recent study 8 to 92 comparing lateral dissolved carbon fluxes from many rivers in the world chaplot and mutema 2021 suggesting higher erosional fluxes of doc from upper tributary basins during the 2019 historic flood similarly lower δ13c doc values have also been recorded in the amazon river basin during high and falling water periods as compared to the values during low waters alberic et al 2018 the depletion of δ13cdic during the 2019 mississippi river mega flood is indicative of an increase in dic derived from 13c depleted sources δ13cdic found in the study 11 43 is more depleted than those reported by cai et al 2015 7 53 for 2006 2008 and dubois 2010 10 0 for 2000 2001 and comparable to that reported by reiman and xu 2019b for 2015 2018 the above mentioned intensive precipitation during the flood period could wash out highly 13c depleted soil co2 accumulated in the pore spaces from the catchment areas and add a significant amount of 13c depleted c to the inorganic carbon pool which is evidenced by the negative correlation between δ13cdic and pco2 p 0 0008 fig 5 this argument is further supported by the significant inverse relationship between δ13cdic and river discharge ρ 0 41 table 1 and the linear trend of δ13cdic doc versus river discharge fig 6 which was also reported by others such as cai et al 2015 reiman and xu 2019b also reported in their study that δ13cdic measurements were significantly more depleted during the wet season january to july as compared to those during the dry season and the authors attributed the depletion of δ13cdic to increased dic derived from organic material across the basin except for terrestrially derived organic matter doc in water could also be an influential dic source as doc accounts for most of the net respiration as well as most of the respired non sinking organic carbon santana falcon et al 2017 mayorga and others 2005 found highly depleted δ13c dic values in the amazon river and attributed it to flushing of terrigenous soil co2 and the autochthonous respiration of plentiful organic material in the water column however we cannot determine the relative importance of the contribution of doc decomposition to dic for this mega flood with current data which may merit further investigations it is also worth mentioning that a negative correlation was found between pco2 and do during the flood indicating that in stream photosynthesis and respiration may play a role as well however this role is likely to be less impactful than the terrestrially derived carbon sources due to constant high discharges throughout the study period 4 3 water air co2 fluxes during the 2019 flood this study found a significant increase in co2 efflux at the water air interface during the flood period fig 4 as well as compared to the previously reported field measurements the quantity of co2 outgassed in the lower mississippi river during the 212 day flood of 2019 777 and 705 g c m 2 212 d 1 for a kt of 4 3 and 3 9 respectively exceeds the annual total co2 outgassing reported by reiman and xu 2019b for 2015 2018 654 g c m 2 yr 1 table 2 extrapolating the outgassing rate for a year i e 365 days the rate 1337 and 1213 g c m 2 yr 1 for a kt of 4 3 and 3 9 respectively exceeds the only other annual estimate 1036 g c m 2 yr 1 reported by dubois et al 2010 for 2000 2001 few studies have looked into co2 outgassing during river floods especially for large rivers but the existing studies show records in agreement with ours for instance in a study investigating the effect of the 2011 mississippi river flood on carbon dynamics bianchi and others 2013 reported much higher pco2 concentrations during the flood causing co2 fluxes reversed from a net influx to an efflux to the atmosphere in the lower and inner shelf waters in another study on the impact of floods on co2 outgassing of the amazonian rivers almeida and others 2017 found a 50 higher co2 outgassing per unit area from the madeira river a large tributary to the amazon river during a flood in 2014 the authors also reconstructed co2 fluxes since 1968 and found that extreme flood years outgas 20 more co2 than those years without reported occurrence of extreme floods almeida et al 2017 the elevated water air co2 fluxes can be attributed to a combined effect of discharge and temperature making it uneasy to distinguish which of the two factors is more dominant the 2019 mississippi river long lasting flood was accompanying with steadily increasing temperature showing a close relationship between co2 outgassing rate and river water temperature fig 8 however co2 effluxes were not hydrologically responsive showing no clear trend of co2 outgassing rate with discharge in the high flow range fig 8 a constant kt used in this study may be part of the reason for this as it may not fully reveal the impacts of flow dynamics through the flooding period however it should not be the main reason as our monte carlo uncertainty analysis demonstrated based on the monte carlo uncertainty analysis with a kt ranging from 3 9 to 4 9 kt could make an impact of about 9 on estimated fco2 this error is relatively small when compared with the large changes occurred in fco2 with the temperature range from 6 to 29 c i e 100 fig 8 instead the mississippi river at baton rouge is completely confined with no floodplain area in interaction with river water at high flows which is likely the main reason for the weak relation between discharge and pco2 this study was carried out during an unprecedented flood year where discharge was constantly above 29 000 m3 s 1 fig 2 i e nearly the double the average discharge of the river in the study by reiman and xu 2019b where pco2 was measured across a much broader range of discharge 6 000 36 000 m3 s 1 a closer positive relationship could be seen between discharge and pco2 especially when discharge was below 20 000 m3 s 1 there is likely a threshold of discharge influence on pco2 in this highly engineered river additionally the influence of flood on co2 outgassing is likely conceived and or incorporated with temperature as temperature directly affects anaerobic metabolism and floods transport large quantities of organic matter and respiration products from the inundated floodplains other studies investigating flood effect on carbon pco2 dynamics are also normally carried during the time period when temperatures rise up for instance the study by vorobyev et al 2021 on co2 emission from the artic lena river was conducted in the spring of 2016 when snow and frozen soils started rapid thawing regardless river size and geographical region peak flows and floods in the lower river reaches are typically associated with temperature increase in the drainage basin making it difficult to separate temperature and flood contributions it is worth mentioning that some previous studies have reported positive linear relationships between river discharge and co2 evasion and considered it an important control on gas efflux long et al 2015 ruiz halpern et al 2015 gu et al 2021 in this regard future fco2 estimates may benefit from a field data derived kt through a direct flux measuring technique such as the floating chamber approach 4 4 implications for riverine carbon transport under future climate this study presents the firsthand results on dissolved carbon transport and co2 degassing from by far the largest mississippi river flood in terms of duration and total volume based on our literature review except for some modeling attempts to estimate dic transport from the mississippi river basin ran et al 2016 wei et al 2021 table 2 there are only two previous studies dubois et al 2010 reiman and xu 2019b that conducted field measurements of dic and pco2 in the lower mississippi river table 2 and two additional studies that recorded riverine doc bianchi et al 2004 shen et al 2012 table 2 hanley et al 2013 estimated an average annual doc export of approximately 1 92 tg for the lower mississippi river at belle chasse for the period 2008 2010 however this estimate is not included in table 2 because 1 river water at belle chasse can be influenced by tides from the gulf of mexico and 2 the estimate was made using a regression model loadest i e not actual field measurements the fluxes of dic doc and co2 found in this study during the 212 day flood in 2019 are mostly higher than their annual values serving as a warning sign on how extreme weather events could significantly affect global carbon cycling under future climate additionally estimated dic and doc loads of the mississippi river at baton rouge 14 14 and 3 73 tg respectively during the 212 day flood are comparable or higher than the annual dic and doc exports 18 8 and 2 6 tg respectively for 365 days estimated by the dynamic land ecosystem model for the entire basin in the 2000 s which considered effects of climate extremes tian et al 2015 in addition to providing the most complete quantity of transport and transformation of dissolved carbon from a large river system during a unique flood event findings of this study will be also useful for future modeling research especially the prediction of carbon transport and transformation under weather extremes from the mississippi river and beyond global climate change has been expected to play a critical role in carbon cycling e g canuel et al 2012 naylor et al 2020 the report on climate change recently released by the intergovernmental panel on climate change https www ipcc ch has projected accelerated increases in both extreme precipitation and total precipitation for the coming decades with such drastic changes in earth s climate system more extreme floods are expected and the discharge of global rivers is certain to increase both gradually and erratically due to temporal and logistical constraints most studies are limited to monthly or even seasonal sampling regimes lee et al 2017 which might be adequate for normal flow conditions but not for high magnitude flood events current estimates generally overlook these events due to the absence of high temporal resolution sampling marx et al 2017 ruiz halpern et al 2015 whereas such events play a disproportionate important role in lateral riverine carbon transport and co2 outgassing as shown in this study while previous research indicates that mobilization of terrestrial carbon into drainage networks by low magnitude flood events could be reduced by effective protection of surface soil such as vegetation restoration e g wang et al 2016 shi et al 2019 this study amplifies the role of extreme floods in controlling riverine carbon transport incorporating flood events into the estimations of continental and global riverine carbon flux is therefore critically important which remains a knowledge gap in most current studies as climate change is to cause more extreme events such as extreme precipitation and flood events westra et al 2013 cai et al 2014 understanding the effects of these extremes on terrestrial carbon fluxes from land to sea and atmosphere is necessary to improve our global carbon budgeting extreme floods are erratic and their effects on riverine carbon transport are disproportionate which may increase co2 evasion by not allowing enough time for organic carbon to be buried permanently at the geological timescale ruiz halpern et al 2015 and increasing near surface turbulence to enhance gas effluxes from surface water long et al 2015 nowadays exports of water and sediment from many rivers in the world have been routinely measured allowing to assess their fluxes from an increasing number of world s river basins however flux estimates of lateral and vertical riverine carbon transport are subject to great uncertainties due to the lack of high temporal resolution measurements to capture erratic extreme flood events due to the significant dependence of riverine carbon transport on large flood events taking consideration of these erratic high magnitude flood events in future sampling campaigns is strongly suggested for an accurate description of riverine carbon cycles 5 conclusions this study conducted an intensive river sampling and measurements on riverine dissolved carbon transport and co2 outgassing during a historically large and long lasting flood of the mississippi river to our knowledge this is the longest flood assessment of dissolved carbon transport and transformation in the world field observations of dissolved carbon transport during this historic flood period are valuable and can not only serve a reference but also have implications for predicting future climate extremes on terrestrial carbon transport we found that during this 212 day flood the lower mississippi river exported a total of 17 87 tg c dissolved carbon laterally into the gulf of mexico and released 230 gg c from its last 357 km river reach vertically into the atmosphere this mass transport and transformation of carbon is much higher than the average annual rate reported from the past while the massive quantity of river discharge clearly played the key role in the lateral transport of dissolved carbon the depleted δ13cdoc found in the flood waters suggested that erosive rainfall events are influential in dic and doc export and their ratio whereas the depletion of δ13cdic during the mega flood is indicative of an increase in dic derived from 13c depleted sources water air co2 fluxes were greatly enhanced during the flood but this change was not linearly responsive to hydraulics this can be attributed to the combined effect of discharge and temperature as well as the use of a constant gas transfer velocity that may not reveal impacts of flow dynamics through the flooding period these findings support the initial hypotheses and suggest that future climate change will intensify terrestrial aquatic atmospheric transfers of carbon in world s rivers although the frequency and magnitude of large floods are likely to increase as climate change continues current estimations of riverine carbon flux e g 0 9 and 1 06 pg c yr 1 from land to oceans by cole et al 2007 li et al 2017 respectively often exclude effects of flood events due to the absence of high temporal resolution sampling we therefore suggest take into account these erratic high magnitude flood events in future sampling strategies especially for co2 emission that is less commonly monitored for carbon flux

2769,human activities can have substantial impacts on watersheds yet a major but understudied impact on many urban watersheds is the inflow and infiltration i i of water into sewage infrastructure i i is important because it is a major cause of sewer overflows increases wastewater treatment plant costs and reduces base flows of urban streams unfortunately i i information is deficient at the watershed scale therefore this study uses a water budget approach to quantify the magnitude of i i for 90 watersheds in the atlanta georgia usa region during 2013 2020 i i for each watershed is calculated by subtracting outflows i e stream discharge water withdrawn by public water systems and actual evapotranspiration aet from inflows i e precipitation water supply pipe leakage and non i i effluent from wastewater treatment plants included in the aet estimates is irrigation water from public water systems and water withdrawals for agriculture results show that i i is a major contributor to the total outflow in urban watersheds the mean annual i i total for the 15 most urbanized watersheds is 138 mm constituting 25 of stream discharge the mean annual i i total from the watersheds with the five highest totals is 216 mm which is 40 of stream discharge these annual i i totals align well with totals calculated for urban catchments in europe where most of the previous research has been conducted regression analyses show that the density of older housing which is a proxy for deteriorating sewage infrastructure is the most important predictor of i i across the atlanta region despite the uncertainties in estimating annual totals for all components especially aet for urban watersheds of the water budget we conclude that estimating i i using the water budget approach is a useful

budget for reference watersheds i e watersheds with minimal anthropogenic modifications over a robust number of years i e enough years to minimize the change in water storage that have negligible net groundwater exchange has three components precipitation as an inflow and actual evapotranspiration aet and stream discharge as outflows healy et al 2007 human alterations of the landscape can alter precipitation shepherd 2005 aet grimmond and oke 1999 and stream discharge booth and jackson 1997 in urban watersheds anthropogenic water inputs to watersheds include inter basin transfers of water in the form of leaking water supply pipes irrigation water and effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps townsend small et al 2013 anthropogenic outputs include the withdrawal of surface water and groundwater kampf et al 2020 one important anthropogenic outflow that has largely been overlooked in watershed analyses is inflow and infiltration i i inflow is rainwater and surface water that enters a sewer system from above ground through direct connections e g downspouts yard drains sump pumps manhole covers etc cahoon and hanke 2017 pawlowski et al 2014 while infiltration is groundwater seeping into the sewers typically through defective pipes pipe joints connections or manholes kracht et al 2007 u s epa 2014 infiltration is the dominant process in humid regions karpf and krebs 2011 pangle et al 2022 staufer et al 2012 zhang and parolari 2022 sewer systems deteriorate over time malek mohammadi et al 2020 therefore older systems have been shown to have more i i than newer systems prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 i i is important because it is a major cause of sewer overflows increases wwtp costs and impacts water budgets in previous i i studies bareš et al 2012 diem et al 2021

pumping costs at the treatment plant and collection system and likely reduces treatment efficiency dirckx et al 2016 finally i i can be a major outflow in urban watersheds bhaskar and welty 2012 thereby making it a major contributor to reduced baseflows in urban streams bhaskar et al 2016 diem et al 2021 despite the importance of i i especially its environmental impacts few studies have provided sufficient i i information to determine the magnitude of i i with respect to the water budget much i i information pertains to infiltration rates into sewer pipes e g karpf and krebs 2013 schulz et al 2005 and the aforementioned percentage of wastewater flow that is i i what is known regarding i i as a water budget component is shown below for multiple studies and all studies examined either wastewater flow within individual pipes or effluent from wwtps using variations in pollutant load and continuous water quality and quantity monitoring bareš et al 2009 2012 quantifies i i for six catchments in prague czech republic over a variety of months long periods during multiple years and the annual equivalent i i total is approximately 204 mm staufer et al 2012 uses hydrograph separation to estimate i i at two catchments in western germany over 103 weeks and the annual mean i i total is approximately 232 mm bhaskar and welty 2012 uses results from wastewater flow analyses for a 10 year period to estimate 530 mm as the mean annual i i for the two heavily urbanized watersheds in baltimore md usa a similar value is found when solving for i i using the water budget approach bhaskar and welty 2012 diem et al 2021 uses monthly wwtp effluent totals over seven years to estimate a mean annual i i of 37 mm for three suburban watersheds near atlanta ga usa for the three watersheds in diem et al 2021 and an additional nearby watershed pangle et al 2022 uses precipitation and sewer flow data for one year to estimate a mean annual i i of 41 mm from the small number of studies that have examined multiple catchments in a region it is known that older or unrehabilitated sewer systems have increased i i totals in rome italy it has been shown that a catchment with a 14 yr old sewer system has negligible infiltration while a catchment with a 40 year old system has 50 infiltration prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 a rehabilitated sewer system in a catchment in germany has 24 less groundwater infiltration than a system in a catchment with similar pipe density and land cover to the rehabilitated catchment staufer et al 2012 based on the information in the preceding paragraphs there is a strong need for an examination of i i in a region across many catchments watersheds with varying sewer infrastructure and land cover characteristics although most previous studies have quantified i i using measured flows within pipes or entering or leaving wwtps these measurements are not widely available and therefore cannot support a broad scale comparative analysis of many different watersheds an alternative approach that may be more widely applicable is to infer magnitudes of i i based on water budget calculations where i i is the residual unknown term in the water budget equation while the water budget approach has disadvantages due to uncertainties in the terms kampf et al 2020 if the magnitude of i i is as large as previous studies show then using the water budget approach to estimate i i is a worthwhile endeavor our overarching research question is as follows how do the magnitudes of watershed level i i vary across a metropolitan area the major objectives are to 1 estimate all inflows and non i i outflows for a wide variety of watersheds 2 determine the degree to which land cover population density and housing density variables impact i i and 3 explore how uncertainties in water budget terms impact i i estimates 2 material and methods the methods involved producing estimates for all components of the water budget except for i i that is exported out of the watershed i e the unknown outflow term and then estimating and analyzing i i since eight years of data are used in this study it is assumed that changes in water storage over time are negligible performing the analyses with only a few years might violate the assumption aulenbach and peters 2018 the equation below which is based on the water budget equation in bhaskar and welty 2012 was used to estimate i i 1 i i p l q e i p w q t aet t where p is precipitation l is water supply pipe leakage qe is non i i effluent i e treated potable water discharged by

evapotranspiration in this paper aett is calculated as follows 2 aet t aet b e aet i where aetb is biome aet e is evaporation from impervious surfaces and aeti is additional aet from irrigation water aetb is calculated using models in fang et al 2016 aeti is calculated as follows 3 aet i i p i a where ip which was presented earlier as an inflow is irrigation from public water systems and i a is irrigation water withdrawn from the watershed for agriculture which includes golf courses and farms it was assumed that all irrigation water went towards aet this assumption is supported by the lack of excessive irrigation by households in the atlanta region deoreo et al 2016 2 1 study region the chosen study region the atlanta sandy springs gainesville combined statistical area in the southeastern united states was an ideal locale for using water budgets to examine i i fig 1 the atlanta region had 90 suitable gaged watersheds with data for 2013 2020 of the 90 watersheds used in diem et al 2021 89 were used in this study among the 90 watersheds were three reference watersheds r1 r3 and r4 fig 1 one more reference watershed r2 was added for the aet component of this study all watersheds had a humid subtropical climate cfa which is characterized by hot humid summers and no seasonal differences in precipitation trewartha and horn 1980 typical annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration totals in the atlanta region are approximately 1248 mm and 1183 mm respectively aulenbach and peters 2018 in addition all watersheds existed entirely within the piedmont physiographic province which is characterized by rolling hills underlain by metamorphic and igneous rocks miller 1990 the atlanta region is served almost entirely by sanitary sewers i e separate pipes for sewage and stormwater with combined sewer pipes i e pipes that transport both sewage and stormwater existing only in the city of atlanta and those pipes representing only 4 of the city s sewage system piping city of atlanta 2011 i i has been recognized as a serious environmental problem in the region the water diverted by i i has contributed to both ssos and combined sewer overflows in the city of atlanta and ssos in dekalb county that have ultimately led to federal consent decrees aimed at improving sewage infrastructure in those municipalities u s district court 1998 1999 2011 finally as is shown in the next section there was an abundance of data in the atlanta region for estimating water budget components 2 2 land cover land cover and associated variables were essential for the estimation of most water budget terms high resolution gridded land cover imperviousness and tree canopy data were obtained from the national land cover database of the multi resolution land characteristics consortium all three datasets had a spatial resolution of 30 m the land cover product had 15 classes for the atlanta region fig 1 the imperviousness product had for each grid cell the percentage of developed surface that was impervious surfaces and the tree canopy product had for each grid cell the percentage that was tree canopy over the 2013 2020 period of this study land cover and imperviousness data existed for 2013 2016 and 2019 while tree canopy data only existed for 2016 land cover proportions for each watershed i e the proportional coverage of each land cover class for 2014 2015 2017 2018 and 2020 were estimated using a weighted interpolation of land cover proportions from 2013 2016 and 2019 all three 2016 datasets were combined to determine the percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy for all land cover classes forest was assumed to be the tree canopy for all classes but shrub scrub and woody wetlands shrub was the canopy cover for shrub scrub and a mixture of forest and shrub was the canopy cover for woody wetlands the following assumptions were made for the land cover classes regarding the remaining portion of grid cells that were not impervious or forest 1 water for open water woody wetlands and emergent herbaceous woodlands 2 grass for the developed classes barren grassland herbaceous and pasture hay and 3 crops for cultivated crops in addition mixed forest was assumed to be the forest cover for all land cover classes that were not deciduous forest or evergreen forest 2 3 population and housing population data were used to estimate values for some of the water budget terms and both population and housing data were used in the analyses of estimated i i totals both population and housing data at the block group level were obtained from the u s census bureau s american community survey 5 year estimates for 2010 2014 and 2015 2019 while only total population was used in this analysis the following categories of housing totals i e number of units which denote when a structure was built were used 2014 2010 2013 2000 2009 1990 1999 1980 1989 1970 1979 1960 1969 1950 1959 1940 1949 and 1939 population and housing totals were converted to density values and weighted means based on area of a block group within a watershed were used to estimate population and housing densities within the watersheds the density estimates from the 2010 2014 data were used for 2013 and 2014 while the density estimates from the 2015 2019 data were used for the subsequent years 2 4 precipitation p gridded daily precipitation data from 2013 to 2020 were obtained from the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model climate group prism calculates a climate elevation regression for each grid cell of a digital elevation model and precipitation gauges entering the regressions are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the gauge to the grid cell daly et al 2008 radar data also are used to improve the estimates daly et al 2021 these serially complete data had a 4 km spatial resolution precipitation totals for the watersheds were weighted means of grid cell values with the weights derived from the areas of the grid cells within the watersheds prism precipitation totals have been shown to be 3 25 higher than those measured at u s climate monitoring stations buban et al 2020 therefore all monthly totals for the 90 watersheds were divided by 1 0325 2 5 pipe leakage l estimating water inflows via pipe leakage relied on annual water loss audits from 65 public water systems serving populations within the 90 watersheds those audits include estimates of water supplied population served and real losses i e pipe leakage georgia environmental protection division 2022 water supply rates for each water system for each of the eight years were calculated by dividing water supplied by the population served pipe leakage rates for each water system for each of the eight years were calculated by dividing real losses by water supplied mean pipe leakage and water supply rates over the eight year period were calculated for each system if multiple water systems existed in a watershed the water supply and pipe leakage rates used for the watershed were a weighted average of all the rates applicable to the watershed the weighting factor was the area of the water supplying municipality within each watershed water use was calculated by multiplying the per capita water use by the population total and then the total pipe leakage was water use multiplied by the pipe leakage rate frequency distributions of per capita water use and leakage rates for the 65 public water systems are shown in fig s1 2 6 wwtp effluent qe monthly effluent data from 2013 to 2020 were acquired for 32 wwtps that discharged effluent into one or more of the 90 watersheds these data were extracted from the u s environmental protection agency s icis npdes permit limit and discharge monitoring report data sets from previous studies bareš et al 2012 diem et al 2021 dirckx et al 2019 kracht et al 2007 pangle et al 2022 prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 rödel et al 2017 shehab and moselhi 2005 weiβ et al 2002 the mean percentage of sewage water that that is not precipitation or groundwater is approximately 30 therefore to approximate the portion of wwtp effluent totals that is an inflow of water from public water systems effluent totals in this study were multiplied by 0 70 2 7 landscape water from public water systems ip monthly water use data from the city of atlanta and dekalb county were the main data used to estimate water inflows via irrigation with municipal water fig 2 those two municipalities are in the center of the study region and intersect with 30 of the 90 watersheds it was assumed that the intra annual variability of water use in those municipalities was representative of the intra annual variability in the remaining watersheds the city of atlanta provided monthly water use data for customers within the city limits dekalb county provided daily outflow data from its filtration plant and those values were multiplied by the proportion of water not lost through pipe leakage i e one minus the leakage rate to yield estimates of water use by customers mean daily water use values for both the city of atlanta and dekalb county were calculated for each month and the mean daily values from the two water systems were summed irrigation water ip was calculated by applying outdoor water use to grass in developed areas the following major assumptions were made 1 all outdoor water was used for irrigation and 2 there was negligible groundwater recharge from irrigation water using mean daily water use data per month the average of the three lowest use months was assumed to represent indoor use and all differences in water use between the other months and the mean value from the lowest use months was considered to be outdoor use gleick et al 2003 the daily differences were converted to monthly totals and the monthly totals were summed to yield an annual irrigation total the irrigation rate i e amount of water applied annually to grass was calculated as follows 4 r i 1000 t i a g where ri is the irrigation rate in mm yr 1 ti is total irrigation water in m3 and ag is the area in m2 of grass in low intensity medium intensity and high intensity developed areas in the city of atlanta and dekalb county the annual irrigation rate was then multiplied by the proportion of developed land grass i e the proportion of watershed that was grass in low intensity medium intensity and high intensity developed areas in each watershed to yield watershed specific estimates of annual irrigation totals 2 8 stream discharge qt daily mean streamflow from 2013 to 2020 was acquired from the united states geological survey usgs for 91 gauges the entire streamflow dataset for the 91 gauges was missing only 0 01 of daily values only 15 of the gauges were missing values and the percentage of missing values for those gauges ranged from 0 03 to 0 21 predicted values from linear regression equations were used to replace missing values the independent variables were daily values from a gauge with a time series that had the strongest correlation with the time series of the gauge having the missing values the serially complete daily streamflow values were normalized by watershed area to produce discharge values in millimeters 2 9 public water system withdrawals w estimates of surface water withdrawal within the 90 watersheds by public water systems were made using lists of non agricultural permits along with water supplied data from the aforementioned annual water audits there were 25 intake locations within the 90 watersheds fig 1 and these intakes were identified from an analysis of a geospatial database provided by the southern environmental law center southern environmental law center 2014 water withdrawal totals for each intake were estimated by multiplying total water supplied by the water system of the intake by the ratio of the permitted total for the intake to the permitted total for the water system 2 10 agricultural water withdrawals ia estimates of water withdrawal for agricultural use were made using lists of permits along with irrigation prediction information from the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources relevant information for each permit included the permit holder county of the permitted location and area of land to be irrigated the locations of all permitted locations that had information for permit holders that were not individuals were determined those permits typically had names of golf courses or farms as permit holders there were at least 44 golf courses and 11 farms with water withdrawal permits within the 90 watersheds fig 1 the only geographic information for permits that only had individuals as permit holders were counties and all irrigated land from those permits was summed for each county using the environmental protections division s golf course prediction and estimation worksheet georgia environmental protection division 2014 along with monthly reference et from the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 and precipitation totals from prism irrigation rates for the april november period were calculated separately for golf courses and farms golf courses were assumed to be 54 rough 43 fairways and 3 greens golf course superintendents association of america 2007 which have separate water requirements farms were assumed to have vegetative cover similar to golf course rough irrigation rates were multiplied by areas to yield total annual water withdrawals and those withdrawals were assigned to the watershed within which the permitted golf course or farm was located for the remaining permits for which only county location was known total annual water withdrawals were calculated at the county level i e irrigation rate multiplied by irrigated area and the proportion of each watershed within a county was multiplied by the county total to obtain an additional annual water withdrawal value for that watershed therefore a watershed could have irrigation totals from specific golf courses specific farms and estimated totals from farms that were not geo located 2 11 aet mean monthly aetb totals i e aet that did not include impervious surfaces or account for irrigation for shrubland cropland deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest were estimated for the 91 watersheds i e the 90 watersheds and the additional reference watershed over the 2013 2020 period using regression models in fang et al 2016 which uses precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and leaf area index lai to predict aet totals derived from eddy covariance measurements table s1 water was not a land cover in that study therefore for this study monthly aet for water was assumed to be equal to pet monthly aetb totals for a watershed were a weighted mean of the land cover aet values with the weight for a land cover being the proportion of the watershed that was that specific land cover the precipitation data used in the aet regression models were the aforementioned prism data monthly pet was calculated using the hamon method hamon 1963 which is what fang et al 2016 used when developing the regression equations this pet estimation method also is recommended for the southeastern united states lu et al 2005 the hamon equation predicts daily pet and is as follows 5 pet k 0 165 216 7 n e s t 273 3 where k is the calibration coefficient unitless n is the daytime length in multiples of 12 h es is the saturation vapor pressure hpa and t is mean monthly temperature c fang et al 2016 uses a calibration coefficient of 1 0 i e no calibration therefore the same coefficient was used in this study monthly temperature and dew point temperature from prism and daily sunlight duration were used to calculate pet lai data which were 8 day composites at 500 m resolution were extracted from the modis mcd15a2h leaf area index product myneni et al 2015 for large 1 km2 homogeneous areas of deciduous forest evergreen forest shrubland and combined herbaceous and pasture hay areas in the atlanta region the last group was used for grassland and crops annual aetb estimates i e the sum of the 12 monthly values were adjusted based on comparisons between observed and estimated aet totals at the four reference watersheds the reference watersheds were located in or near the northern eastern southern and western portions of the atlanta msa fig 1 observed aet was calculated using the water budget approach discharge was subtracted from precipitation an adjustment factor was calculated for each reference watershed and these factors were the ratio of observed aetb to estimated aetb these factors were used to adjust aetb totals at all 90 watersheds with the factor used at a specific watershed being a weighted mean of the adjustment factors at the four reference watersheds it was assumed that there was strong positive spatial autocorrelation in aetb therefore inverse distance weighting was used to produce the adjustment factors specific to the 90 watersheds with the distance being the distance from a watershed centroid to the centroids of the four reference watersheds annual impervious evaporation e was estimated using evaporation rates found in the literature table s2 for this study it was initially assumed that 20 of precipitation that fell on impervious surfaces was evaporated this value was the mean evaporation rate from five studies cohard et al 2018 ragab et al 2003a ragab et al 2003b ramier et al 2004 ramier et al 2011 that measured evaporation rates for paved surfaces plates and roofs in temperate oceanic climates since the rates had a relatively large range of 10 to 38 evaporation rates of 10 and 30 also were used to calculate evaporation totals from impervious surfaces aett was the sum of biome aet aetb irrigation aet aeti and evaporation from impervious surfaces e aetb i e fang et al 2016 models and e are discussed in the preceding paragraphs as shown in eq 3 aeti was the sum of landscape water from public water systems and agricultural water withdrawn from the watershed it was assumed that all irrigation water went towards aet i e a negligible amount of irrigation water went towards groundwater recharge this assumption is verified by the lack of excessive irrigation by households in the atlanta region deoreo et al 2016 finally unless noted otherwise all aett values presented in the paper are based on the 20 evaporation rate from impervious surfaces 2 12 watershed groups to better elucidate differences in inflow and outflow terms for various types of watersheds the 90 watersheds were divided into six groups of 15 watersheds based on the degree of urbanization an urbanization score was developed for each watershed by using principal component analysis pca to produce a component score from the following multi collinear variables percent developed land percent imperviousness population density and housing density general watershed characteristics i e land cover population density and housing density as well as values of inflow terms outflow terms and urbanization variables were determined for each group 2 13 modeling of i i pca also was used to screen 13 land cover population and housing variables that were potential predictor variables in regression models predicting i i and i i q i i as a percentage of stream discharge the screening was performed to ensure that the regression models did not have multicollinearity kachigan 1991 the land cover variables were percent imperviousness percent all developed land percent low intensity to high intensity developed land and percent medium intensity and high intensity developed land the population and housing variables were population density total housing unit density and density of housing units built prior to the following years 2000 1990 1980 1970 1960 1950 and 1940 each of the 13 variables was associated with the component on which it loaded the highest multiple linear regression models were developed using all combinations of variables with only variables that loaded highly on different components being included in a combination jackknife cross validation was used to produce a nash sutcliffe e value hereafter shown as nse for each model nse values range from to 1 with higher values indicating better agreement between observations and estimates nash and sutcliffe 1970 an nse 0 5 was used as the criterion for satisfactorily accurate model moriasi et al 2007 and only those models were retained residuals from the models were examined to ensure that the models were stable and to better understand controls of i i observed vs predicted scatter plots provided insights into the severity of overpredictions and underpredictions spatial autocorrelation analyses of residuals via moran s i tests were used to determine if important spatial variables were missing in the regression models 2 14 analysis of impacts of uncertainties of water budget terms on i i totals all water budget terms have uncertainties and those uncertainties contribute to the uncertainty of i i estimates therefore the impacts on i i totals from uncertainties in the terms were calculated for each watershed group each water budget term was adjusted by 10 and new i i totals were generated the absolute difference between the new i i total and the original i i total represented the impact of the water budget term on i i 3 results 3 1 composition of land cover classes most land cover types were comprised of a mixture of forest and grass while impervious surfaces had substantial coverage in the developed classes fig s2 forest was the majority vegetative cover in most of the non developed classes except for herbaceous and pasture hay among the developed classes open space developed land and low intensity developed land had substantial vegetative cover open space developed land was only 8 impervious surfaces low intensity developed had more grass than forest compared to open space developed land and was 33 impervious surfaces impervious surfaces accounted for 63 and 91 of medium intensity developed land and high intensity developed land respectively for both those classes grass was more prevalent than forest the six groups of watersheds ranged from strongly rural to strongly urban fig 3 the least urbanized watersheds i e group a were located on the periphery of the study region developed land and impervious surfaces constituted approximately 9 and 2 respectively of those watersheds population and housing densities also were very low with mean values of 40 persons km 2 and 16 units km 2 respectively the most urbanized watersheds i e group f were located in the center of the study region developed land and impervious surfaces constituted approximately 85 and 39 respectively of those watersheds forest cover declined with increasing urbanization forest was 62 of the least urbanized group and 32 of the most urbanized group grass remained relatively constant with increasing urbanization finally there was negligible coverage by shrub water and crops not shown in fig 3 of any watershed group 3 2 precipitation precipitation not only was the largest inflow variable but also the largest water budget variable for all watersheds fig 4 a annual precipitation totals ranged from 1 257 mm to 1 609 mm thus precipitation was immensely larger than all the anthropogenic inflows combined for example even for the watershed with the largest total of anthropogenic inflows the precipitation total was ten times larger there was little difference among the watershed groups with respect to precipitation totals the least urbanized group and the most urbanized group had the largest and smallest variability respectively due to as noted earlier the least urbanized watersheds located farthest from each other on the periphery of the study region and the most urbanized watersheds clustered in the center of the region fig 3 3 3 anthropogenic inflows l ip and qe pipe leakage l was reported by all 65 public water systems fig s1 but the magnitude of water added to watersheds via leaking pipes was extremely small compared to precipitation fig 4b annual totals of leaking pipe water ranged from 0 mm to 53 mm the mean values for the two most urbanized watershed groups were 20 mm and 32 mm respectively there was considerable variability for the most urbanized group since water inflow from pipe leakage depended on leakage rates per capita consumption and population density and was less strongly linked to imperviousness and developed land similar to pipe leakage inflows via irrigation from public water ip was relatively small compared to precipitation fig 4c the annual irrigation rate applied to grass in low intensity medium intensity and high intensity developed lands was 106 mm the irrigation rate for lawns in clayton county which is in the south central portion of the atlanta region is 94 mm deoreo et al 2016 therefore the rate of 106 mm is probably appropriate for most of the watersheds annual totals of public water irrigation for the 90 watersheds ranged from 0 mm to 20 mm there was a steady increase with increased urbanization of the watersheds with the mean values for the three most urbanized groups approximately 16 mm only 33 of the 90 watersheds received wwtp effluent qe and this low number of receiving watersheds caused the over all magnitude of effluent for the 90 watersheds to be small fig 4d wwtp effluent did not exist for the most urbanized watersheds since treated wastewater from many urbanized watersheds is released into the chattahoochee river fig 1 the two largest annual totals of effluent among the 90 watersheds were 70 mm and 110 mm therefore for those watersheds effluent was a substantial inflow especially when compared to pipe leakage and irrigation using public water 3 4 aet aetb estimates from the fang et al 2016 models were upwardly adjusted and those totals for the watersheds decreased with increasing urbanization fig 4e adjustment factors that were applied to each of the 90 watersheds were weighted means of the adjustment factors at the reference watersheds and those factors ranged from 1 089 to 1 201 table 1 evaporation totals from impervious surfaces e were negligible for the least urbanized watersheds and substantial for the most urbanized watersheds fig 4f annual totals of evaporation from impervious surfaces ranged from 1 mm to 180 mm the mean annual evaporation total for group f which as noted earlier had a mean imperviousness of 39 was 115 mm the remaining aet term aeti was considerably smaller than aetb for all watersheds and smaller than e for the more urbanized watersheds fig 4g aeti was the sum of water from public water systems fig 4c and irrigation water withdrawn from the watershed for agriculture which includes golf courses annual totals of aeti ranged from 0 mm to 36 mm while aett decreased with increasing urbanization of the watersheds it was still the largest outflow variable for nearly all watersheds fig 4 and s3 aett among the 90 watersheds ranged from 584 mm to 992 mm group f watersheds had approximately 37 less aett than group a watersheds when increasing evaporation rates to 30 there was minimal change in aett for group a watersheds while aett for group f watersheds increased from 741 mm to 796 mm fig s3b c evaporation rates of 10 led to aett of 686 mm for group f watersheds fig s3a 3 5 water withdrawal w the mean values of water withdrawals by public water systems were low for the watershed groups since only 14 of the 90 watersheds had withdrawals fig 4h the maximum value for a watershed was 52 mm similar to wttp effluent water withdrawals did not exist in the most urbanized watersheds 3 6 stream discharge qt annual stream discharge qt generally increased with urbanization fig 4i values for the 90 watersheds ranged from 259 mm to 863 mm for the least urbanized watersheds as whole i e group a qt was less than half of aett conversely four of the most urbanized watersheds i e group f had qt larger than aett 3 7 i i i i which as noted in section 2 was calculated by subtracting the sum of the other outflow totals from the sum of the inflow totals was a major contributor to outflow in urbanized watersheds fig 4j and 5a c group a and group f watersheds had mean i i totals of 2 mm and 138 mm respectively the histogram of i i totals for the 90 watersheds was slightly positively skewed with a majority of the watersheds having values within 40 mm of zero fig 5 c all watersheds with i i totals exceeding 100 mm were urbanized watersheds located in the center of the study region fig 5a more specifically those watersheds encompassed parts of the city of atlanta and central and western dekalb county this is not unexpected since as noted in section 1 both the city of atlanta and dekalb county have been under consent decrees to reduce sewer overflows the evaporation rate used for impervious surfaces had a large effect on i i totals of the most urbanized watersheds the i i total for group f watersheds increased from 138 mm to 194 mm when the 10 evaporation rate was used and decreased from 138 mm to 83 mm when the 30 evaporation rate was used fig s3d e f the spatial pattern and frequency distribution of i i q i e i i as a percentage of stream discharge closely matched those for i i totals fig 5b d the values for the 90 watersheds ranged from 21 to 44 urbanized watersheds in the center of the region had large i i q values four watersheds there had values larger than 40 two components were produced from the pca of the 13 potential predictor variables for regression modeling and all variables were strongly and significantly α 0 01 one tailed correlated with both i i variables table s3 the first component represented urbanization in general and the correlations ranged from 0 57 to 0 71 for i i and from 0 52 to 0 70 for i i q total housing unit density had the largest correlations the second component represented density of older housing which was a proxy for infrastructure age and the correlations ranged from 0 58 to 0 77 for i i and from 0 56 to 0 76 for i i q density of housing units built prior to either 1980 or 1970 had the largest correlations out of the 40 models developed to predict i i there were 33 satisfactorily accurate models i e nse 0 50 and those models had the anticipated overprediction of small i i totals and underprediction of large i i totals fig 6 there were 27 satisfactorily accurate i i q models and the scatterplot and residuals map for those models were nearly identical to those for i i and thus are not shown the largest absolute residual occurred at rottenwood creek usgs 02335910 in cobb county and this watershed was in the most urban group rottenwood creek had the largest overprediction for all models an important spatial variable was not excluded from the models since there was no significant spatial autocorrrelation among the residuals fig 6b infrastructure age variables produced the most accurate models for i i table 2 the top three models in terms of nse values had nse values of either 0 59 or 0 60 and r2 values of either 0 61 or 0 62 the predictor variables were hd70 i e density of housing units built prior to 1970 along with either population density density of all housing units or percent imperviousness based on the standardized slope coefficients hd70 was the more impactful predictor in all models the most accurate models for i i q were similar to the models for i i table 2 nse values for the three models were either 0 57 or 0 58 and r2 values were either 0 59 or 0 60 the predictor variables were nearly the same as those in the i i models and hd70 was again the more impactful predictor 3 8 impacts of uncertainties of water budget terms on i i totals there was considerable variation among the water budget terms with respect to impacts of uncertainties on i i totals table s4 p was the largest term in the water budget and if p were not connected to aetb a 10 change in precipitation could produce extremely large changes 140 mm in i i however this is a greatly exaggerated impact on i i p was used to estimate values of two outflow terms aetb and e therefore the impacts of a systematic overestimation or underestimation of p were buffered by corresponding changes to aetb and e in addition p uncertainty was more likely 5 rather than 10 mcmillan et al 2012 the two other large terms besides p were aetb and qt and similar to p small changes in those terms would have large impacts on i i those two terms most likely had uncertainties of at least 10 baffaut et al 2020 mcmillan et al 2012 e definitely had an uncertainty larger than 10 due to uncertainties in evaporation rates from impervious surfaces thus the impact of e on i i totals was much larger than what is shown in table s4 the remaining terms l ip qe ia and w had either no impacts or minimal impacts on i i for a watershed group 4 discussion 4 1 urban watershed i i totals in this study are realistic annual i i totals for urban watersheds in this study are similar to i i totals found for urban catchments in europe where much of the existing i i analyses have been conducted the comparisons with results from european studies are few since as noted in section 1 most studies do not provide enough information for calculating area normalized depths of i i the mean i i total from the watersheds in this study with the five largest totals i e top 6 is 216 mm which is 40 of stream discharge these i i totals are comparable to what has been found for monitored urban catchments in prague czech republic and western germany where annual i i totals are between 200 mm and 250 mm bareš et al 2009 bareš et al 2012 staufer et al 2012 these are the only known published european studies that provide all the information needed to calculate i i as an area normalized depth i i in the six catchments in bareš et al 2009 2012 are only measured for several months at a time over several years and after upscaling each of the six sub annual i i totals to an annual total the mean total for those catchments is 206 mm the mean i i total for the two catchments in western germany measured over 73 months prior to the rehabilitation of one of the sewer networks is 246 mm staufer et al 2012 differences in population and housing density seem to explain why i i totals for urban watersheds in the atlanta region are substantially less than totals for two urban watersheds in baltimore baltimore is a good comparison with atlanta because both locales have cfa climates and are located wholly or partially in the piedmont physiographic province of the eastern united states the urban watersheds in bhaskar and welty 2012 have a mean annual i i total of 565 mm which is 120 of stream discharge the baltimore i i total which is the largest value in the literature is 2 4 times larger than the largest i i total in this study that total was at peachtree creek usgs 02336300 the difference in i i magnitude might be explained by the much higher degree of urbanization and thus increased sewer pipe density in the baltimore watersheds the mean population and housing densities of the baltimore watersheds were twice that of peachtree creek a comparison of results with previous i i studies involving the same watersheds in the atlanta region indicates that this study might overestimate i i in suburban watersheds the same three watersheds are examined in diem et al 2021 pangle et al 2022 and in this study and those watersheds exist within the south river watershed fig 1 the mean i i totals for those watersheds from those three studies are 37 mm 45 mm and 121 mm respectively it is possible that diem et al 2021 has a conservative estimate of i i totals because it relies on monthly wwtp effluent data and the method used has the assumption that the month with the lowest effluent total has no i i it also is possible that i i estimates reported by pangle et al 2022 may be lower than average considering the results are reported for a calendar year that was relatively dry the precipitation total for the year was greater than 100 mm less than the climatological mean aulenbach and peters 2018 diem et al 2018 pangle et al 2022 also included an underlying assumption that groundwater infiltration becomes negligibly small during the driest time of the year the modeling results in this study support previous findings that aging infrastructure is a major control of i i the most accurate regression models all have density of housing units built prior to 1970 as the most important predictor of i i among the 90 watersheds this variable which is a proxy for sewage infrastructure age has a standardized slope coefficient that is larger than the coefficient for the other variable in the models the other variable is either imperviousness percent all developed land population density or total housing density sewage infrastructure that is 40 years old has been shown to have much higher groundwater infiltration than infrastructure that is several decades newer prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 the regression modeling may have discovered significant sewage system repair in an urban watershed rottenwood creek in eastern cobb county appears to have negligible i i and thus has the largest i i overprediction of all the watersheds sewer replacement is a likely reason for the negligible i i approximately 1 7 km of interceptor sewer pipe that was constructed over 60 years ago was replaced and relocated gilman 2019 4 2 uncertainties in water budget terms are in issue for both rural and urban watersheds except for large imbalances in the water budget that occurred for several watersheds the water budgets for rural watersheds in general are almost fully closed there was strong agreement between inflow totals and outflow totals since the mean i i totals for the most rural watersheds is approximately zero which is the expected i i total this agreement is enabled by the adjustment of aetb totals based on aetb totals at reference watersheds that are derived from precipitation and stream discharge however even with the adjustment of aetb there are large negative i i totals i e 40 mm which are unrealistic at several watersheds it is likely that those large negative totals are caused by one or more of the following underestimated precipitation overestimated stream discharge and overestimated aet for example 5 adjustments in any combination of terms at those watersheds would increase i i totals to close to zero while considerable effort is involved in estimating anthropogenic flows such as pipe leakage rates and irrigation water use in urban watersheds those terms have minor impacts on i i in the atlanta region rather aet probably has the largest magnitude of uncertainty and thus the largest impact on i i totals in urban watersheds among all water budget components the accuracy of the urban aet estimates in this study are unknown no previous studies have estimated urban aet totals in the southeastern united states and there is a large range 350 mm to 613 mm in published aet estimates for urban areas in general bhaskar and welty 2012 claessens et al 2006 fang et al 2020 grimmond and oke 1986 jia et al 2001 kokkonen et al 2018 litvak et al 2017 mitchell et al 2003 sloto and buxton 2005 urban aet totals in this study which are initially estimated using a 20 evaporation rate for impervious surfaces are higher than the totals above the minimum aet total in this study is 584 mm and the mean value for the most urbanized group of watersheds i e group f is 741 mm aet totals should be relatively high in this study for the following reasons 1 the southeastern united states has high annual totals of both precipitation hijmans et al 2005 and potential evapotranspiration weiß and menzel 2008 2 many urban watersheds in the atlanta region have substantial vegetative cover see section 3 1 and 3 this study accounted for evaporation from impervious surfaces in the atlanta region and other places with wet climates the choice of evaporation rate can change aet greatly and in turn i i if a 30 evaporation rate is used instead of a 10 evaporation rate aet for the group f watersheds increases from 686 mm to 796 mm and i i totals thus decrease from 194 mm to 84 mm i e a 57 decrease 4 3 i i can be a major anthropogenic flow in humid climates i i is among the largest anthropogenic flows occurring in urban watersheds in the atlanta region and probably most other urban watersheds in the eastern united states in the atlanta region annual i i totals in urban watersheds i e group f in this study are four and eight times larger than water system pipe leakage and irrigation with municipal water respectively i i also is much larger than both pipe leakage and irrigation in urban watersheds in baltimore bhaskar and welty 2012 the two other relevant piped flows wwtp effluent and water withdrawal by water systems do not occur in urban watersheds in the atlanta region water use which increases with irrigation and is a control of pipe leakage is relatively low in the atlanta region the mean per capita rate for 65 water systems in this study is 160 m3 y 1 while the mean rate for the united states as a whole is 190 m3 y 1 dieter et al 2018 the atlanta region has an irrigation rate of approximately 100 mm per lawn while urban areas with arid semi arid and mediterranean climates in the western united states and canada can have annual irrigation rates approaching 2000 mm deoreo et al 2016 5 conclusions through the calculation of water budgets for 90 watersheds in the atlanta region this study has shown that i i is an important outflow component for urban watersheds the magnitude of i i in the watersheds is comparable to findings for urbanized catchments in germany and the czech republic as should be expected the largest i i totals in the atlanta region occur for the most part in municipalities that are under consent decrees to improve their sewer infrastructure there are several suburban watersheds in this study that have i i estimated in previous studies and the i i estimates in this study are substantially larger this suggests that i i totals for suburban watersheds in this study might be overestimates this study shows that i i is controlled primarily by the density of older housing a proxy for older sewer infrastructure i i also is strongly correlated with imperviousness the presence of developed land population density and housing density in general nevertheless watersheds with similar land cover population densities and housing densities can have widely varying i i totals for example recently replaced sewage infrastructure in an urbanized watershed greatly reduces i i the i i totals in this study should be treated as approximations since estimating i i using the water budget approach involves uncertainties for all water budget components accurate estimates of aet are crucial to obtaining valid estimates of i i however obtaining accurate aet estimates for a large number of watersheds is difficult one way this study attempts to minimize aet errors is by using results from reference watersheds to produce adjustment factors for the other watersheds however the choice of evaporation rate for impervious surface greatly impacts aet totals for urban watersheds despite the uncertainties involved with using the water budget approach to estimate i i this study shows that is a suitable exploratory procedure for a large number of watersheds major drawbacks of the water budget approach are the aforementioned uncertainties and the data extensive nature e g many geo spatial data sets of the procedure nevertheless annual totals for anthropogenic components e g water supply pipe leakage which do require involved methods have small impacts on the water budget compared to precipitation aet and stream discharge estimating i i using the water budget approach is a useful initial approach to estimating i i throughout a region 6 data statement land cover population housing and water budget data for the 90 watersheds are available at https data mendeley com

2769,human activities can have substantial impacts on watersheds yet a major but understudied impact on many urban watersheds is the inflow and infiltration i i of water into sewage infrastructure i i is important because it is a major cause of sewer overflows increases wastewater treatment plant costs and reduces base flows of urban streams unfortunately i i information is deficient at the watershed scale therefore this study uses a water budget approach to quantify the magnitude of i i for 90 watersheds in the atlanta georgia usa region during 2013 2020 i i for each watershed is calculated by subtracting outflows i e stream discharge water withdrawn by public water systems and actual evapotranspiration aet from inflows i e precipitation water supply pipe leakage and non i i effluent from wastewater treatment plants included in the aet estimates is irrigation water from public water systems and water withdrawals for agriculture results show that i i is a major contributor to the total outflow in urban watersheds the mean annual i i total for the 15 most urbanized watersheds is 138 mm constituting 25 of stream discharge the mean annual i i total from the watersheds with the five highest totals is 216 mm which is 40 of stream discharge these annual i i totals align well with totals calculated for urban catchments in europe where most of the previous research has been conducted regression analyses show that the density of older housing which is a proxy for deteriorating sewage infrastructure is the most important predictor of i i across the atlanta region despite the uncertainties in estimating annual totals for all components especially aet for urban watersheds of the water budget we conclude that estimating i i using the water budget approach is a useful

budget for reference watersheds i e watersheds with minimal anthropogenic modifications over a robust number of years i e enough years to minimize the change in water storage that have negligible net groundwater exchange has three components precipitation as an inflow and actual evapotranspiration aet and stream discharge as outflows healy et al 2007 human alterations of the landscape can alter precipitation shepherd 2005 aet grimmond and oke 1999 and stream discharge booth and jackson 1997 in urban watersheds anthropogenic water inputs to watersheds include inter basin transfers of water in the form of leaking water supply pipes irrigation water and effluent from wastewater treatment plants wwtps townsend small et al 2013 anthropogenic outputs include the withdrawal of surface water and groundwater kampf et al 2020 one important anthropogenic outflow that has largely been overlooked in watershed analyses is inflow and infiltration i i inflow is rainwater and surface water that enters a sewer system from above ground through direct connections e g downspouts yard drains sump pumps manhole covers etc cahoon and hanke 2017 pawlowski et al 2014 while infiltration is groundwater seeping into the sewers typically through defective pipes pipe joints connections or manholes kracht et al 2007 u s epa 2014 infiltration is the dominant process in humid regions karpf and krebs 2011 pangle et al 2022 staufer et al 2012 zhang and parolari 2022 sewer systems deteriorate over time malek mohammadi et al 2020 therefore older systems have been shown to have more i i than newer systems

pumping costs at the treatment plant and collection system and likely reduces treatment efficiency dirckx et al 2016 finally i i can be a major outflow in urban watersheds bhaskar and welty 2012 thereby making it a major contributor to reduced baseflows in urban streams bhaskar et al 2016 diem et al 2021 despite the importance of i i especially its environmental impacts few studies have provided sufficient i i information to determine the magnitude of i i with respect to the water budget much i i information pertains to infiltration rates into sewer pipes e g karpf and krebs 2013 schulz et al 2005 and the aforementioned percentage of wastewater flow that is i i what is known regarding i i as a water budget component is shown below for multiple studies and all studies examined either wastewater flow within individual pipes or effluent from wwtps using variations in pollutant load and continuous water quality and quantity monitoring bareš et al 2009 2012 quantifies i i for six catchments in prague czech republic over a variety of months long periods during multiple years and the annual equivalent i i total is approximately 204 mm staufer et al 2012 uses hydrograph separation to estimate i i at two catchments in western germany over 103 weeks and the annual mean i i total is approximately 232 mm bhaskar and welty 2012 uses results from wastewater flow analyses for a 10 year period to estimate 530 mm as the mean annual i i for the two heavily urbanized watersheds in baltimore md usa a similar value is found when solving for i i using the water budget approach bhaskar and welty 2012 diem et al 2021 uses monthly wwtp effluent totals over seven years to estimate a mean annual i i of 37 mm for three suburban watersheds near atlanta ga usa for the three watersheds in diem et al 2021 and an additional nearby watershed pangle et al 2022 uses precipitation and sewer flow data for one year to estimate a mean annual i i of 41 mm from the small number of studies that have examined multiple catchments in a region it is known that older or unrehabilitated sewer systems have increased i i totals in rome italy it has been shown that a catchment with a 14 yr old sewer system has negligible infiltration while a catchment with a 40 year old system has 50 infiltration prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 a rehabilitated sewer system in a catchment in germany has 24 less groundwater infiltration than a system in a catchment with similar pipe density and land cover to the rehabilitated catchment staufer et al 2012 based on the information in the preceding paragraphs there is a strong need for an examination of i i in a region across many catchments watersheds with varying sewer infrastructure and land cover characteristics although most previous studies have quantified i i using measured flows within pipes or entering or leaving wwtps these measurements are not widely available and therefore cannot support a broad scale comparative analysis of many different watersheds an alternative approach that may be more widely applicable is to infer magnitudes of i i based on water budget calculations where i i is the residual unknown term in the water budget equation while the water budget approach has disadvantages due to uncertainties in the terms kampf et al 2020 if the magnitude of i i is as large as previous studies show then using the water budget approach to estimate i i is a worthwhile endeavor our overarching research question is as follows how do the magnitudes of watershed level i i vary across a metropolitan area the major objectives are to 1 estimate all inflows and non i i outflows for a wide variety of watersheds 2 determine the degree to which land cover population density and housing density variables impact i i and 3 explore how uncertainties in water budget terms impact i i estimates 2 material and methods the methods involved producing estimates for all components of the water budget except for i i that is exported out of the watershed i e the unknown outflow term and then estimating and analyzing i i since eight years of data are used in this study it is assumed that changes in water storage over time are negligible performing the analyses with only a few years might violate the assumption aulenbach and peters 2018 the equation below which is based on the water budget equation in bhaskar and welty 2012 was used to estimate i i 1 i i p l q e i p w q t aet t where p is precipitation l is water supply pipe leakage qe is non i i effluent i e treated potable water discharged by

evapotranspiration in this paper aett is calculated as follows 2 aet t aet b e aet i where aetb is biome aet e is evaporation from impervious surfaces and aeti is additional aet from irrigation water aetb is calculated using models in fang et al 2016 aeti is calculated as follows 3 aet i i p i a where ip which was presented earlier as an inflow is irrigation from public water systems and i a is irrigation water withdrawn from the watershed for agriculture which includes golf courses and farms it was assumed that all irrigation water went towards aet this assumption is supported by the lack of excessive irrigation by households in the atlanta region deoreo et al 2016 2 1 study region the chosen study region the atlanta sandy springs gainesville combined statistical area in the southeastern united states was an ideal locale for using water budgets to examine i i fig 1 the atlanta region had 90 suitable gaged watersheds with data for 2013 2020 of the 90 watersheds used in diem et al 2021 89 were used in this study among the 90 watersheds were three reference watersheds r1 r3 and r4 fig 1 one more reference watershed r2 was added for the aet component of this study all watersheds had a humid subtropical climate cfa which is characterized by hot humid summers and no seasonal differences in precipitation trewartha and horn 1980 typical annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration totals in the atlanta region are approximately 1248 mm and 1183 mm respectively aulenbach and peters 2018 in addition all watersheds existed entirely within the piedmont physiographic province which is characterized by rolling hills underlain by metamorphic and igneous rocks miller 1990 the atlanta region is served almost entirely by sanitary sewers i e separate pipes for sewage and stormwater with combined sewer pipes i e pipes that transport both sewage and stormwater existing only in the city of atlanta and those pipes representing only 4 of the city s sewage system piping city of atlanta 2011 i i has been recognized as a serious environmental problem in the region the water diverted by i i has contributed to both ssos and combined sewer overflows in the city of atlanta and ssos in dekalb county that have ultimately led to federal consent decrees aimed at improving sewage infrastructure in those municipalities u s district court 1998 1999 2011 finally as is shown in the next section there was an abundance of data in the atlanta region for estimating water budget components 2 2 land cover land cover and associated variables were essential for the estimation of most water budget terms high resolution gridded land cover imperviousness and tree canopy data were obtained from the national land cover database of the multi resolution land characteristics consortium all three datasets had a spatial resolution of 30 m the land cover product had 15 classes for the atlanta region fig 1 the imperviousness product had for each grid cell the percentage of developed surface that was impervious surfaces and the tree canopy product had for each grid cell the percentage that was tree canopy over the 2013 2020 period of this study land cover and imperviousness data existed for 2013 2016 and 2019 while tree canopy data only existed for 2016 land cover proportions for each watershed i e the proportional coverage of each land cover class for 2014 2015 2017 2018 and 2020 were estimated using a weighted interpolation of land cover proportions from 2013 2016 and 2019 all three 2016 datasets were combined to determine the percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy for all land cover classes forest was assumed to be the tree canopy for all classes but shrub scrub and woody wetlands shrub was the canopy cover for shrub scrub and a mixture of forest and shrub was the canopy cover for woody wetlands the following assumptions were made for the land cover classes regarding the remaining portion of grid cells that were not impervious or forest 1 water for open water woody wetlands and emergent herbaceous woodlands 2 grass for the developed classes barren grassland herbaceous and pasture hay and 3 crops for cultivated crops in addition mixed forest was assumed to be the forest cover for all land cover classes that were not deciduous forest or evergreen forest 2 3 population and housing population data were used to estimate values for some of the water budget terms and both population and housing data were used in the analyses of estimated i i totals both population and housing data at the block group level were obtained from the u s census bureau s american community survey 5 year estimates for 2010 2014 and 2015 2019 while only total population was used in this analysis the following categories of housing totals i e number of units which denote when a structure was built were used 2014 2010 2013 2000 2009 1990 1999 1980 1989 1970 1979 1960 1969 1950 1959 1940 1949 and 1939 population and housing totals were converted to density values and weighted means based on area of a block group within a watershed were used to estimate population and housing densities within the watersheds the density estimates from the 2010 2014 data were used for 2013 and 2014 while the density estimates from the 2015 2019 data were used for the subsequent years 2 4 precipitation p gridded daily precipitation data from 2013 to 2020 were obtained from the prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model climate group prism calculates a climate elevation regression for each grid cell of a digital elevation model and precipitation gauges entering the regressions are assigned weights based primarily on the physiographic similarity of the gauge to the grid cell daly et al 2008 radar data also are used to improve the estimates daly et al 2021 these serially complete data had a 4 km spatial resolution precipitation totals for the watersheds were weighted means of grid cell values with the weights derived from the areas of the grid cells within the watersheds prism precipitation totals have been shown to be 3 25 higher than those measured at u s climate monitoring stations buban et al 2020 therefore all monthly totals for the 90 watersheds were divided by 1 0325 2 5 pipe leakage l estimating water inflows via pipe leakage relied on annual water loss audits from 65 public water systems serving populations within the 90 watersheds those audits include estimates of water supplied population served and real losses i e pipe leakage georgia environmental protection division 2022 water supply rates for each water system for each of the eight years were calculated by dividing water supplied by the population served pipe leakage rates for each water system for each of the eight years were calculated by dividing real losses by water supplied mean pipe leakage and water supply rates over the eight year period were calculated for each system if multiple water systems existed in a watershed the water supply and pipe leakage rates used for the watershed were a weighted average of all the rates applicable to the watershed the weighting factor was the area of the water supplying municipality within each watershed water use was calculated by multiplying the per capita water use by the population total and then the total pipe leakage was water use multiplied by the pipe leakage rate frequency distributions of per capita water use and leakage rates for the 65 public water systems are shown in fig s1 2 6 wwtp effluent qe monthly effluent data from 2013 to 2020 were acquired for 32 wwtps that discharged effluent into one or more of the 90 watersheds these data were extracted from the u s environmental protection agency s icis npdes permit limit and discharge monitoring report data sets from previous studies bareš et al 2012 diem et al 2021 dirckx et al 2019 kracht et al 2007 pangle et al 2022 prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 rödel et al 2017 shehab and moselhi 2005 weiβ et al 2002 the mean percentage of sewage water that that is not precipitation or groundwater is approximately 30 therefore to approximate the portion of wwtp effluent totals that is an inflow of water from public water systems effluent totals in this study were multiplied by 0 70 2 7 landscape water from public water systems ip monthly water use data from the city of atlanta and dekalb county were the main data used to estimate water inflows via irrigation with municipal water fig 2 those two municipalities are in the center of the study region and intersect with 30 of the 90 watersheds it was assumed that the intra annual variability of water use in those municipalities was representative of the intra annual variability in the remaining watersheds the city of atlanta provided monthly water use data for customers within the city limits dekalb county provided daily outflow data from its filtration plant and those values were multiplied by the proportion of water not lost through pipe leakage i e one minus the leakage rate to yield estimates of water use by customers mean daily water use values for both the city of atlanta and dekalb county were calculated for each month and the mean daily values from the two water systems were summed irrigation water ip was calculated by applying outdoor water use to grass in developed areas the following major assumptions were made 1 all outdoor water was used for irrigation and 2 there was negligible groundwater recharge from irrigation water using mean daily water use data per month the average of the three lowest use months was assumed to represent indoor use and all differences in water use between the other months and the mean value from the lowest use months was considered to be outdoor use gleick et al 2003 the daily differences were converted to monthly totals and the monthly totals were summed to yield an annual irrigation total the irrigation rate i e amount of water applied annually to grass was calculated as follows 4 r i 1000 t i a g where ri is the irrigation rate in mm yr 1 ti is total irrigation water in m3 and ag is the area in m2 of grass in low intensity medium intensity and high intensity developed areas in the city of atlanta and dekalb county the annual irrigation rate was then multiplied by the proportion of developed land grass i e the proportion of watershed that was grass in low intensity medium intensity and high intensity developed areas in each watershed to yield watershed specific estimates of annual irrigation totals 2 8 stream discharge qt daily mean streamflow from 2013 to 2020 was acquired from the united states geological survey usgs for 91 gauges the entire streamflow dataset for the 91 gauges was missing only 0 01 of daily values only 15 of the gauges were missing values and the percentage of missing values for those gauges ranged from 0 03 to 0 21 predicted values from linear regression equations were used to replace missing values the independent variables were daily values from a gauge with a time series that had the strongest correlation with the time series of the gauge having the missing values the serially complete daily streamflow values were normalized by watershed area to produce discharge values in millimeters 2 9 public water system withdrawals w estimates of surface water withdrawal within the 90 watersheds by public water systems were made using lists of non agricultural permits along with water supplied data from the aforementioned annual water audits there were 25 intake locations within the 90 watersheds fig 1 and these intakes were identified from an analysis of a geospatial database provided by the southern environmental law center southern environmental law center 2014 water withdrawal totals for each intake were estimated by multiplying total water supplied by the water system of the intake by the ratio of the permitted total for the intake to the permitted total for the water system 2 10 agricultural water withdrawals ia estimates of water withdrawal for agricultural use were made using lists of permits along with irrigation prediction information from the environmental protection division of the georgia department of natural resources relevant information for each permit included the permit holder county of the permitted location and area of land to be irrigated the locations of all permitted locations that had information for permit holders that were not individuals were determined those permits typically had names of golf courses or farms as permit holders there were at least 44 golf courses and 11 farms with water withdrawal permits within the 90 watersheds fig 1 the only geographic information for permits that only had individuals as permit holders were counties and all irrigated land from those permits was summed for each county using the environmental protections division s golf course prediction and estimation worksheet georgia environmental protection division 2014 along with monthly reference et from the terraclimate dataset abatzoglou et al 2018 and precipitation totals from prism irrigation rates for the april november period were calculated separately for golf courses and farms golf courses were assumed to be 54 rough 43 fairways and 3 greens golf course superintendents association of america 2007 which have separate water requirements farms were assumed to have vegetative cover similar to golf course rough irrigation rates were multiplied by areas to yield total annual water withdrawals and those withdrawals were assigned to the watershed within which the permitted golf course or farm was located for the remaining permits for which only county location was known total annual water withdrawals were calculated at the county level i e irrigation rate multiplied by irrigated area and the proportion of each watershed within a county was multiplied by the county total to obtain an additional annual water withdrawal value for that watershed therefore a watershed could have irrigation totals from specific golf courses specific farms and estimated totals from farms that were not geo located 2 11 aet mean monthly aetb totals i e aet that did not include impervious surfaces or account for irrigation for shrubland cropland deciduous forest evergreen forest and mixed forest were estimated for the 91 watersheds i e the 90 watersheds and the additional reference watershed over the 2013 2020 period using regression models in fang et al 2016 which uses precipitation potential evapotranspiration pet and leaf area index lai to predict aet totals derived from eddy covariance measurements table s1 water was not a land cover in that study therefore for this study monthly aet for water was assumed to be equal to pet monthly aetb totals for a watershed were a weighted mean of the land cover aet values with the weight for a land cover being the proportion of the watershed that was that specific land cover the precipitation data used in the aet regression models were the aforementioned prism data monthly pet was calculated using the hamon method hamon 1963 which is what fang et al 2016 used when developing the regression equations this pet estimation method also is recommended for the southeastern united states lu et al 2005 the hamon equation predicts daily pet and is as follows 5 pet k 0 165 216 7 n e s t 273 3 where k is the calibration coefficient unitless n is the daytime length in multiples of 12 h es is the saturation vapor pressure hpa and t is mean monthly temperature c fang et al 2016 uses a calibration coefficient of 1 0 i e no calibration therefore the same coefficient was used in this study monthly temperature and dew point temperature from prism and daily sunlight duration were used to calculate pet lai data which were 8 day composites at 500 m resolution were extracted from the modis mcd15a2h leaf area index product myneni et al 2015 for large 1 km2 homogeneous areas of deciduous forest evergreen forest shrubland and combined herbaceous and pasture hay areas in the atlanta region the last group was used for grassland and crops annual aetb estimates i e the sum of the 12 monthly values were adjusted based on comparisons between observed and estimated aet totals at the four reference watersheds the reference watersheds were located in or near the northern eastern southern and western portions of the atlanta msa fig 1 observed aet was calculated using the water budget approach discharge was subtracted from precipitation an adjustment factor was calculated for each reference watershed and these factors were the ratio of observed aetb to estimated aetb these factors were used to adjust aetb totals at all 90 watersheds with the factor used at a specific watershed being a weighted mean of the adjustment factors at the four reference watersheds it was assumed that there was strong positive spatial autocorrelation in aetb therefore inverse distance weighting was used to produce the adjustment factors specific to the 90 watersheds with the distance being the distance from a watershed centroid to the centroids of the four reference watersheds annual impervious evaporation e was estimated using evaporation rates found in the literature table s2 for this study it was initially assumed that 20 of precipitation that fell on impervious surfaces was evaporated this value was the mean evaporation rate from five studies cohard et al 2018 ragab et al 2003a ragab et al 2003b ramier et al 2004 ramier et al 2011 that measured evaporation rates for paved surfaces plates and roofs in temperate oceanic climates since the rates had a relatively large range of 10 to 38 evaporation rates of 10 and 30 also were used to calculate evaporation totals from impervious surfaces aett was the sum of biome aet aetb irrigation aet aeti and evaporation from impervious surfaces e aetb i e fang et al 2016 models and e are discussed in the preceding paragraphs as shown in eq 3 aeti was the sum of landscape water from public water systems and agricultural water withdrawn from the watershed it was assumed that all irrigation water went towards aet i e a negligible amount of irrigation water went towards groundwater recharge this assumption is verified by the lack of excessive irrigation by households in the atlanta region deoreo et al 2016 finally unless noted otherwise all aett values presented in the paper are based on the 20 evaporation rate from impervious surfaces 2 12 watershed groups to better elucidate differences in inflow and outflow terms for various types of watersheds the 90 watersheds were divided into six groups of 15 watersheds based on the degree of urbanization an urbanization score was developed for each watershed by using principal component analysis pca to produce a component score from the following multi collinear variables percent developed land percent imperviousness population density and housing density general watershed characteristics i e land cover population density and housing density as well as values of inflow terms outflow terms and urbanization variables were determined for each group 2 13 modeling of i i pca also was used to screen 13 land cover population and housing variables that were potential predictor variables in regression models predicting i i and i i q i i as a percentage of stream discharge the screening was performed to ensure that the regression models did not have multicollinearity kachigan 1991 the land cover variables were percent imperviousness percent all developed land percent low intensity to high intensity developed land and percent medium intensity and high intensity developed land the population and housing variables were population density total housing unit density and density of housing units built prior to the following years 2000 1990 1980 1970 1960 1950 and 1940 each of the 13 variables was associated with the component on which it loaded the highest multiple linear regression models were developed using all combinations of variables with only variables that loaded highly on different components being included in a combination jackknife cross validation was used to produce a nash sutcliffe e value hereafter shown as nse for each model nse values range from to 1 with higher values indicating better agreement between observations and estimates nash and sutcliffe 1970 an nse 0 5 was used as the criterion for satisfactorily accurate model moriasi et al 2007 and only those models were retained residuals from the models were examined to ensure that the models were stable and to better understand controls of i i observed vs predicted scatter plots provided insights into the severity of overpredictions and underpredictions spatial autocorrelation analyses of residuals via moran s i tests were used to determine if important spatial variables were missing in the regression models 2 14 analysis of impacts of uncertainties of water budget terms on i i totals all water budget terms have uncertainties and those uncertainties contribute to the uncertainty of i i estimates therefore the impacts on i i totals from uncertainties in the terms were calculated for each watershed group each water budget term was adjusted by 10 and new i i totals were generated the absolute difference between the new i i total and the original i i total represented the impact of the water budget term on i i 3 results 3 1 composition of land cover classes most land cover types were comprised of a mixture of forest and grass while impervious surfaces had substantial coverage in the developed classes fig s2 forest was the majority vegetative cover in most of the non developed classes except for herbaceous and pasture hay among the developed classes open space developed land and low intensity developed land had substantial vegetative cover open space developed land was only 8 impervious surfaces low intensity developed had more grass than forest compared to open space developed land and was 33 impervious surfaces impervious surfaces accounted for 63 and 91 of medium intensity developed land and high intensity developed land respectively for both those classes grass was more prevalent than forest the six groups of watersheds ranged from strongly rural to strongly urban fig 3 the least urbanized watersheds i e group a were located on the periphery of the study region developed land and impervious surfaces constituted approximately 9 and 2 respectively of those watersheds population and housing densities also were very low with mean values of 40 persons km 2 and 16 units km 2 respectively the most urbanized watersheds i e group f were located in the center of the study region developed land and impervious surfaces constituted approximately 85 and 39 respectively of those watersheds forest cover declined with increasing urbanization forest was 62 of the least urbanized group and 32 of the most urbanized group grass remained relatively constant with increasing urbanization finally there was negligible coverage by shrub water and crops not shown in fig 3 of any watershed group 3 2 precipitation precipitation not only was the largest inflow variable but also the largest water budget variable for all watersheds fig 4 a annual precipitation totals ranged from 1 257 mm to 1 609 mm thus precipitation was immensely larger than all the anthropogenic inflows combined for example even for the watershed with the largest total of anthropogenic inflows the precipitation total was ten times larger there was little difference among the watershed groups with respect to precipitation totals the least urbanized group and the most urbanized group had the largest and smallest variability respectively due to as noted earlier the least urbanized watersheds located farthest from each other on the periphery of the study region and the most urbanized watersheds clustered in the center of the region fig 3 3 3 anthropogenic inflows l ip and qe pipe leakage l was reported by all 65 public water systems fig s1 but the magnitude of water added to watersheds via leaking pipes was extremely small compared to precipitation fig 4b annual totals of leaking pipe water ranged from 0 mm to 53 mm the mean values for the two most urbanized watershed groups were 20 mm and 32 mm respectively there was considerable variability for the most urbanized group since water inflow from pipe leakage depended on leakage rates per capita consumption and population density and was less strongly linked to imperviousness and developed land similar to pipe leakage inflows via irrigation from public water ip was relatively small compared to precipitation fig 4c the annual irrigation rate applied to grass in low intensity medium intensity and high intensity developed lands was 106 mm the irrigation rate for lawns in clayton county which is in the south central portion of the atlanta region is 94 mm deoreo et al 2016 therefore the rate of 106 mm is probably appropriate for most of the watersheds annual totals of public water irrigation for the 90 watersheds ranged from 0 mm to 20 mm there was a steady increase with increased urbanization of the watersheds with the mean values for the three most urbanized groups approximately 16 mm only 33 of the 90 watersheds received wwtp effluent qe and this low number of receiving watersheds caused the over all magnitude of effluent for the 90 watersheds to be small fig 4d wwtp effluent did not exist for the most urbanized watersheds since treated wastewater from many urbanized watersheds is released into the chattahoochee river fig 1 the two largest annual totals of effluent among the 90 watersheds were 70 mm and 110 mm therefore for those watersheds effluent was a substantial inflow especially when compared to pipe leakage and irrigation using public water 3 4 aet aetb estimates from the fang et al 2016 models were upwardly adjusted and those totals for the watersheds decreased with increasing urbanization fig 4e adjustment factors that were applied to each of the 90 watersheds were weighted means of the adjustment factors at the reference watersheds and those factors ranged from 1 089 to 1 201 table 1 evaporation totals from impervious surfaces e were negligible for the least urbanized watersheds and substantial for the most urbanized watersheds fig 4f annual totals of evaporation from impervious surfaces ranged from 1 mm to 180 mm the mean annual evaporation total for group f which as noted earlier had a mean imperviousness of 39 was 115 mm the remaining aet term aeti was considerably smaller than aetb for all watersheds and smaller than e for the more urbanized watersheds fig 4g aeti was the sum of water from public water systems fig 4c and irrigation water withdrawn from the watershed for agriculture which includes golf courses annual totals of aeti ranged from 0 mm to 36 mm while aett decreased with increasing urbanization of the watersheds it was still the largest outflow variable for nearly all watersheds fig 4 and s3 aett among the 90 watersheds ranged from 584 mm to 992 mm group f watersheds had approximately 37 less aett than group a watersheds when increasing evaporation rates to 30 there was minimal change in aett for group a watersheds while aett for group f watersheds increased from 741 mm to 796 mm fig s3b c evaporation rates of 10 led to aett of 686 mm for group f watersheds fig s3a 3 5 water withdrawal w the mean values of water withdrawals by public water systems were low for the watershed groups since only 14 of the 90 watersheds had withdrawals fig 4h the maximum value for a watershed was 52 mm similar to wttp effluent water withdrawals did not exist in the most urbanized watersheds 3 6 stream discharge qt annual stream discharge qt generally increased with urbanization fig 4i values for the 90 watersheds ranged from 259 mm to 863 mm for the least urbanized watersheds as whole i e group a qt was less than half of aett conversely four of the most urbanized watersheds i e group f had qt larger than aett 3 7 i i i i which as noted in section 2 was calculated by subtracting the sum of the other outflow totals from the sum of the inflow totals was a major contributor to outflow in urbanized watersheds fig 4j and 5a c group a and group f watersheds had mean i i totals of 2 mm and 138 mm respectively the histogram of i i totals for the 90 watersheds was slightly positively skewed with a majority of the watersheds having values within 40 mm of zero fig 5 c all watersheds with i i totals exceeding 100 mm were urbanized watersheds located in the center of the study region fig 5a more specifically those watersheds encompassed parts of the city of atlanta and central and western dekalb county this is not unexpected since as noted in section 1 both the city of atlanta and dekalb county have been under consent decrees to reduce sewer overflows the evaporation rate used for impervious surfaces had a large effect on i i totals of the most urbanized watersheds the i i total for group f watersheds increased from 138 mm to 194 mm when the 10 evaporation rate was used and decreased from 138 mm to 83 mm when the 30 evaporation rate was used fig s3d e f the spatial pattern and frequency distribution of i i q i e i i as a percentage of stream discharge closely matched those for i i totals fig 5b d the values for the 90 watersheds ranged from 21 to 44 urbanized watersheds in the center of the region had large i i q values four watersheds there had values larger than 40 two components were produced from the pca of the 13 potential predictor variables for regression modeling and all variables were strongly and significantly α 0 01 one tailed correlated with both i i variables table s3 the first component represented urbanization in general and the correlations ranged from 0 57 to 0 71 for i i and from 0 52 to 0 70 for i i q total housing unit density had the largest correlations the second component represented density of older housing which was a proxy for infrastructure age and the correlations ranged from 0 58 to 0 77 for i i and from 0 56 to 0 76 for i i q density of housing units built prior to either 1980 or 1970 had the largest correlations out of the 40 models developed to predict i i there were 33 satisfactorily accurate models i e nse 0 50 and those models had the anticipated overprediction of small i i totals and underprediction of large i i totals fig 6 there were 27 satisfactorily accurate i i q models and the scatterplot and residuals map for those models were nearly identical to those for i i and thus are not shown the largest absolute residual occurred at rottenwood creek usgs 02335910 in cobb county and this watershed was in the most urban group rottenwood creek had the largest overprediction for all models an important spatial variable was not excluded from the models since there was no significant spatial autocorrrelation among the residuals fig 6b infrastructure age variables produced the most accurate models for i i table 2 the top three models in terms of nse values had nse values of either 0 59 or 0 60 and r2 values of either 0 61 or 0 62 the predictor variables were hd70 i e density of housing units built prior to 1970 along with either population density density of all housing units or percent imperviousness based on the standardized slope coefficients hd70 was the more impactful predictor in all models the most accurate models for i i q were similar to the models for i i table 2 nse values for the three models were either 0 57 or 0 58 and r2 values were either 0 59 or 0 60 the predictor variables were nearly the same as those in the i i models and hd70 was again the more impactful predictor 3 8 impacts of uncertainties of water budget terms on i i totals there was considerable variation among the water budget terms with respect to impacts of uncertainties on i i totals table s4 p was the largest term in the water budget and if p were not connected to aetb a 10 change in precipitation could produce extremely large changes 140 mm in i i however this is a greatly exaggerated impact on i i p was used to estimate values of two outflow terms aetb and e therefore the impacts of a systematic overestimation or underestimation of p were buffered by corresponding changes to aetb and e in addition p uncertainty was more likely 5 rather than 10 mcmillan et al 2012 the two other large terms besides p were aetb and qt and similar to p small changes in those terms would have large impacts on i i those two terms most likely had uncertainties of at least 10 baffaut et al 2020 mcmillan et al 2012 e definitely had an uncertainty larger than 10 due to uncertainties in evaporation rates from impervious surfaces thus the impact of e on i i totals was much larger than what is shown in table s4 the remaining terms l ip qe ia and w had either no impacts or minimal impacts on i i for a watershed group 4 discussion 4 1 urban watershed i i totals in this study are realistic annual i i totals for urban watersheds in this study are similar to i i totals found for urban catchments in europe where much of the existing i i analyses have been conducted the comparisons with results from european studies are few since as noted in section 1 most studies do not provide enough information for calculating area normalized depths of i i the mean i i total from the watersheds in this study with the five largest totals i e top 6 is 216 mm which is 40 of stream discharge these i i totals are comparable to what has been found for monitored urban catchments in prague czech republic and western germany where annual i i totals are between 200 mm and 250 mm bareš et al 2009 bareš et al 2012 staufer et al 2012 these are the only known published european studies that provide all the information needed to calculate i i as an area normalized depth i i in the six catchments in bareš et al 2009 2012 are only measured for several months at a time over several years and after upscaling each of the six sub annual i i totals to an annual total the mean total for those catchments is 206 mm the mean i i total for the two catchments in western germany measured over 73 months prior to the rehabilitation of one of the sewer networks is 246 mm staufer et al 2012 differences in population and housing density seem to explain why i i totals for urban watersheds in the atlanta region are substantially less than totals for two urban watersheds in baltimore baltimore is a good comparison with atlanta because both locales have cfa climates and are located wholly or partially in the piedmont physiographic province of the eastern united states the urban watersheds in bhaskar and welty 2012 have a mean annual i i total of 565 mm which is 120 of stream discharge the baltimore i i total which is the largest value in the literature is 2 4 times larger than the largest i i total in this study that total was at peachtree creek usgs 02336300 the difference in i i magnitude might be explained by the much higher degree of urbanization and thus increased sewer pipe density in the baltimore watersheds the mean population and housing densities of the baltimore watersheds were twice that of peachtree creek a comparison of results with previous i i studies involving the same watersheds in the atlanta region indicates that this study might overestimate i i in suburban watersheds the same three watersheds are examined in diem et al 2021 pangle et al 2022 and in this study and those watersheds exist within the south river watershed fig 1 the mean i i totals for those watersheds from those three studies are 37 mm 45 mm and 121 mm respectively it is possible that diem et al 2021 has a conservative estimate of i i totals because it relies on monthly wwtp effluent data and the method used has the assumption that the month with the lowest effluent total has no i i it also is possible that i i estimates reported by pangle et al 2022 may be lower than average considering the results are reported for a calendar year that was relatively dry the precipitation total for the year was greater than 100 mm less than the climatological mean aulenbach and peters 2018 diem et al 2018 pangle et al 2022 also included an underlying assumption that groundwater infiltration becomes negligibly small during the driest time of the year the modeling results in this study support previous findings that aging infrastructure is a major control of i i the most accurate regression models all have density of housing units built prior to 1970 as the most important predictor of i i among the 90 watersheds this variable which is a proxy for sewage infrastructure age has a standardized slope coefficient that is larger than the coefficient for the other variable in the models the other variable is either imperviousness percent all developed land population density or total housing density sewage infrastructure that is 40 years old has been shown to have much higher groundwater infiltration than infrastructure that is several decades newer prigiobbe and giulianelli 2009 the regression modeling may have discovered significant sewage system repair in an urban watershed rottenwood creek in eastern cobb county appears to have negligible i i and thus has the largest i i overprediction of all the watersheds sewer replacement is a likely reason for the negligible i i approximately 1 7 km of interceptor sewer pipe that was constructed over 60 years ago was replaced and relocated gilman 2019 4 2 uncertainties in water budget terms are in issue for both rural and urban watersheds except for large imbalances in the water budget that occurred for several watersheds the water budgets for rural watersheds in general are almost fully closed there was strong agreement between inflow totals and outflow totals since the mean i i totals for the most rural watersheds is approximately zero which is the expected i i total this agreement is enabled by the adjustment of aetb totals based on aetb totals at reference watersheds that are derived from precipitation and stream discharge however even with the adjustment of aetb there are large negative i i totals i e 40 mm which are unrealistic at several watersheds it is likely that those large negative totals are caused by one or more of the following underestimated precipitation overestimated stream discharge and overestimated aet for example 5 adjustments in any combination of terms at those watersheds would increase i i totals to close to zero while considerable effort is involved in estimating anthropogenic flows such as pipe leakage rates and irrigation water use in urban watersheds those terms have minor impacts on i i in the atlanta region rather aet probably has the largest magnitude of uncertainty and thus the largest impact on i i totals in urban watersheds among all water budget components the accuracy of the urban aet estimates in this study are unknown no previous studies have estimated urban aet totals in the southeastern united states and there is a large range 350 mm to 613 mm in published aet estimates for urban areas in general bhaskar and welty 2012 claessens et al 2006 fang et al 2020 grimmond and oke 1986 jia et al 2001 kokkonen et al 2018 litvak et al 2017 mitchell et al 2003 sloto and buxton 2005 urban aet totals in this study which are initially estimated using a 20 evaporation rate for impervious surfaces are higher than the totals above the minimum aet total in this study is 584 mm and the mean value for the most urbanized group of watersheds i e group f is 741 mm aet totals should be relatively high in this study for the following reasons 1 the southeastern united states has high annual totals of both precipitation hijmans et al 2005 and potential evapotranspiration weiß and menzel 2008 2 many urban watersheds in the atlanta region have substantial vegetative cover see section 3 1 and 3 this study accounted for evaporation from impervious surfaces in the atlanta region and other places with wet climates the choice of evaporation rate can change aet greatly and in turn i i if a 30 evaporation rate is used instead of a 10 evaporation rate aet for the group f watersheds increases from 686 mm to 796 mm and i i totals thus decrease from 194 mm to 84 mm i e a 57 decrease 4 3 i i can be a major anthropogenic flow in humid climates i i is among the largest anthropogenic flows occurring in urban watersheds in the atlanta region and probably most other urban watersheds in the eastern united states in the atlanta region annual i i totals in urban watersheds i e group f in this study are four and eight times larger than water system pipe leakage and irrigation with municipal water respectively i i also is much larger than both pipe leakage and irrigation in urban watersheds in baltimore bhaskar and welty 2012 the two other relevant piped flows wwtp effluent and water withdrawal by water systems do not occur in urban watersheds in the atlanta region water use which increases with irrigation and is a control of pipe leakage is relatively low in the atlanta region the mean per capita rate for 65 water systems in this study is 160 m3 y 1 while the mean rate for the united states as a whole is 190 m3 y 1 dieter et al 2018 the atlanta region has an irrigation rate of approximately 100 mm per lawn while urban areas with arid semi arid and mediterranean climates in the western united states and canada can have annual irrigation rates approaching 2000 mm deoreo et al 2016 5 conclusions through the calculation of water budgets for 90 watersheds in the atlanta region this study has shown that i i is an important outflow component for urban watersheds the magnitude of i i in the watersheds is comparable to findings for urbanized catchments in germany and the czech republic as should be expected the largest i i totals in the atlanta region occur for the most part in municipalities that are under consent decrees to improve their sewer infrastructure there are several suburban watersheds in this study that have i i estimated in previous studies and the i i estimates in this study are substantially larger this suggests that i i totals for suburban watersheds in this study might be overestimates this study shows that i i is controlled primarily by the density of older housing a proxy for older sewer infrastructure i i also is strongly correlated with imperviousness the presence of developed land population density and housing density in general nevertheless watersheds with similar land cover population densities and housing densities can have widely varying i i totals for example recently replaced sewage infrastructure in an urbanized watershed greatly reduces i i the i i totals in this study should be treated as approximations since estimating i i using the water budget approach involves uncertainties for all water budget components accurate estimates of aet are crucial to obtaining valid estimates of i i however obtaining accurate aet estimates for a large number of watersheds is difficult one way this study attempts to minimize aet errors is by using results from reference watersheds to produce adjustment factors for the other watersheds however the choice of evaporation rate for impervious surface greatly impacts aet totals for urban watersheds despite the uncertainties involved with using the water budget approach to estimate i i this study shows that is a suitable exploratory procedure for a large number of watersheds major drawbacks of the water budget approach are the aforementioned uncertainties and the data extensive nature e g many geo spatial data sets of the procedure nevertheless annual totals for anthropogenic components e g water supply pipe leakage which do require involved methods have small impacts on the water budget compared to precipitation aet and stream discharge estimating i i using the water budget approach is a useful initial approach to estimating i i throughout a region 6 data statement land cover population housing and water budget data for the 90 watersheds are available at https data mendeley com
