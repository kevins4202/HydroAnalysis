16105,warm weather and excess nutrients from agricultural runoff trigger harmful algal blooms which can affect drinking water safety due to the presence of algal toxins and the formation of disinfection by products dbps during drinking water treatment in this study 66 priority unregulated and regulated dbps were quantified in chlorinated controlled laboratory reactions of harmful algae microseira wollei formerly known as lyngbya wollei and phormidium using gas chromatography gc mass spectrometry ms live algae samples collected from algae impacted lakes in south carolina were chlorinated in both ultrapure water and real source waters containing natural organic matter dbps were also measured in finished water from a real drinking water plant impacted by a microseira bloom results show that the presence of microseira and phormidium more than doubles total concentrations of dbps formed by chlorination with levels up to 586 μg l formed in natural lake waters toxic nitrogen containing dbps also more than doubled in concentration with levels up to 36 1 3 6 and 37 9 μg l for haloacetamides halonitromethanes and haloacetonitriles respectively in ultrapure water dbps also formed up to 314 μg l when algae was chlorinated demonstrating their ability to serve as direct precursors for these dbps when environmentally relevant levels of bromide and iodide were added to chlorination reactions total dbps increased 144 51 and 24 for drinking water reservoir lake marion and lake wateree microseira respectively and 29 for phormidium iodo dbps bromochloroiodomethane chloroiodoacetic acid bromoiodoacetic acid and diiodoacetic acid were observed in finished water from a drinking water plant impacted by microseira and bromochloroiodomethane and dibromoiodomethane were observed in chlorinated ultrapure water containing algae bromide and iodide notably total calculated cytotoxicity tripled in microseira impacted waters and doubled for phormidium impacted waters calculated genotoxicity doubled for microseira impacted waters and more than doubled in phormidium impacted waters haloacetonitriles were major drivers of calculated cytotoxicity in algae impacted waters while haloacetic acids were major drivers of calculated genotoxicity in algae impacted waters these results provide the most extensive assessment of dbps formed from chlorination of algae impacted waters and highlight potential impacts to drinking water and human health results from this study are particularly applicable to drinking water treatment plants that employ pre chlorination which can cause the release of algal organic matter aom precursors to form dbps key words algae disinfection by products dbps gas chromatography mass spectrometry microseira phormidium lyngbya 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs are a major concern worldwide for public health and safety in 2019 alone 242 hab events were reported by 14 states in the u s cdc 2019 resulting in 63 cases of human illness and 364 cases of animal illness of the 364 animal illness cases reported 56 died as a result of their exposure in 2002 a teenager from wisconsin died after suffering from hab related illness after swimming in an anabaena flos aquae impacted pond known to produce neurotoxic anatoxin a also known as very fast death factor behm 2003 habs are not only a concern for human exposure during recreational use of impacted waters such as swimming or fishing but they have also been shown to impact drinking water safety drinking water treatment plants in the u s rely heavily on surface waters and about 75 of reported hab events occur in fresh waters cdc 2019 in 2014 toledo ohio s water supply was shut down due to a harmful microcystis aeruginosa bloom in lake erie affecting 400 000 residents eos 2021 microseira wollei is also of major concern for lakes around the world including lake wateree and lake marion in south carolina sc and several drinking water treatment plants that use these waters as their source for drinking water microseira wollei is a filamentous benthic and perennial algae which produces toxic saxitoxin analogues known as microseira wollei toxins carmichael et al 1997 foss et al 2012 onodera et al 1997 smith et al 2019 yin et al 1997 phormidium which is another filamentous harmful algae known to produce the acute neurotoxin anatoxin a gugger et al 2005 teneva et al 2005 wood et al 2007 borges et al 2015 was also found in lake wateree these algal species release intracellular organic matter iom and extracellular organic matter eom into the water column which includes carbohydrates proteins amino acids aliphatic amines and peptides fang et al 2010 baroni et al 2020 algal organic matter aom also contains more organic nitrogen and hydrophilic carbon material than natural organic matter nom widrig et al 1996 nguyen et al 2005 her et al 2004 ma et al 2006 which mostly contains humic substances with more aromatic carbon and low nitrogen content as a result algal organic matter has a lower specific uv absorbance suva and higher heterogeneity compared to nom neither coagulation nor pre oxidation mediated coagulation processes can remove iom and eom in drinking water treatment ma et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 when algae impacted source water is disinfected iom and eom can react with the disinfectant e g cl2 nh2cl o3 or uv and produce toxic carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps c dbps and n dbps richardson et al 2007 2011 dbps have been linked to adverse human health effects such as bladder cancer colorectal cancer and birth defects richardson et al 2007 cantor et al 2010 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 savitz et al 2005 villanueva et al 2004 2007 waller et al 1998 costet et al 2011 rahman et al 2007 currently only 11 dbps are regulated by the u s environmental protection agency epa us epa 2006 despite the identification of more than 700 dbps to date richardson et al 2007 richardson and plewa 2020 richardson 2011 many of these priority unregulated dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic carcinogenic or mutagenic and most are more toxic than the dbps currently regulated richardson et al 2007 richardson and plewa 2020 previous research has reported dbp formation from aom eom and sometimes intact algal cells including material from microcystis aeruginosa oscillatoria sp microseira sp scenedesmus quadricauda nitzschia palea dolichospermum circinale cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and chlorella vulgaris fang et al 2010 liu et al 2022 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 zhou et al 2015 bond et al 2011 2012 hoehn 1980 hong et al 2008 huang et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2020 a new study by liu also shows preferential halogenation of aom by iodine over chlorine and bromine when iodide is present in chloraminated waters liu et al 2022 however only a relatively small number of dbps have been investigated to date up to 33 and a comprehensive understanding of the broad range of dbps is missing in addition dbps from phormidium have not previously been investigated therefore the goal of this research was to investigate the formation of 66 priority and regulated dbps following the chlorination of live algae microseira wollei and phormidium which impact not only drinking water sources in south carolina but also many regions throughout the u s and the world these results provide a more complete assessment of dbps formed from algae during chlorination chlorine was chosen because it is the most common disinfectant in the u s cuthbertson et al 2020 the 66 priority and regulated dbps quantified include 10 trihalomethanes thms 13 haloacetic acids haas 4 haloaldehydes hals 9 haloketones hks 13 haloacetamides hams 7 halonitromethanes hnms and 10 haloacetonitriles hans among them the n dbps hams hnms and hans and iodo dbps iodo thms and iodoacetic acids are considered high priority dbps due to their significantly higher toxicity richardson et al 2007 krasner et al 2006 and they were recently reported as important drivers of toxicity in u s drinking waters allen et al 2022 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents individual

solution 5 65 6 were purchased from fisher scientific pittsburg pa sodium bromide and sodium iodide standards were purchased from sigma aldrich 2 2 sampling live microseira wollei grab samples surface floating mat were collected from lake wateree lake marion and a small drinking water reservoir dwr in south carolina sc live phormidium samples were collected from lake wateree sc samples were collected in 500 ml polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe bottles and stored on ice 0 c in a cooler during transportation live algae samples were cleaned immediately upon arrival and refrigerated raw lake water samples were also collected from the sites where algae were collected finished chlorinated drinking water 2 l was collected from a drinking water plant in a small city in sc whose water reservoir was experiencing a microseira bloom in september 2020 residual chlorine of 1 3 mg l raw water samples were filtered with 5 μm filters vacuum filtration and stored at 4 c until extractions residual chlorine in finished drinking water samples was quenched immediately with ammonium chloride 1 1 3 molar ratio of cl nh2cl and extracted to quantify dbps 2 3 experimental design live algae samples were carefully separated physical separation to remove dirt and small aquatic animals once cleaned the algae samples were then washed with their corresponding source water several times to remove any remaining dirt and then pressed by hand to remove extraneous water each type of algae was chlorinated in 250 ml amber bottles headspace free in ultrapure water and source water at ph 7 1 mm phosphate buffer at a ratio of approximately 15 mg l cellular mass to 4 0 25 0 mg l free chlorine standard sodium hypochlorite solution based on chlorine demand experiments to achieve 1 2 mg l residual chlorine after 24 hr reaction table s6 the active cellular mass of algae was calculated to contain 15 mg l of microseira wollei to determine the amount of algae to add to each reactor the percent of cell bound water and unreactive sheath mass was subtracted from the mass of the pressed wet algae the same amount of phormidium was reacted in order to allow for a direct comparison between the two algae species the calculation described above is given in the supporting information text s1 the concentration of algae used 15 mg l for reactions was chosen because it is similar to high doc levels observed in drinking water source waters in the u s richardson et al 2008 samples were also chlorinated following the addition of 500 µg l bromide and 100 µg l iodide to represent elevated levels of these salts that can be found in surface waters richardson et al 2008 bromide and iodide are of interest because they can form hobr and hoi in the presence of chlorine which can then react with natural organic matter and other contaminants e g toxins or algal organic matter to form brominated and iodinated dbps which are more toxic than chlorine containing dbps richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 the residual chlorine was then quenched after 24 hr using ammonium chloride and the samples were then filtered using 5 µm filters to remove reacted algae the reactions were carried out at room temperature 25 c and in duplicate with chlorinated ultrapure water was used for blank measurements 2 4 extraction and sample preparation to explore the potential for dbp formation 100 ml filtered with 5 µm filters from each reactor in duplicate was extracted and analyzed to quantify 66 regulated and priority unregulated dbps including 10 thms trichloromethane

conducted following previously methods published from our laboratory cuthbertson et al 2020 2019 allen et al 2017 2022 briefly 100 ml samples were transferred into a 125 ml amber bottle ph adjusted to 1 using concentrated sulfuric acid and spiked with 30 g of na2so4 and 5 ml of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe samples were then shaken for 15 min using a mechanical shaker then allowed to settle to 10 min before the organic layer was removed and collected into a glass test tube using glass pasteur pipettes the process of adding mtbe was repeated two more times for a total organic extract volume of approximately 15 ml the organic layer was then passed through an anhydrous na2so4 column to remove any excess water and concentrated to 200 μl using a gentle stream of nitrogen four μl of 30 mg l 1 2 dibromopropane was added to the concentrated extract as an internal standard the sample was then divided into 2 aliquots 100 μl each one aliquot was used to quantify thms hals hks hams hnms and hans and the other aliquot was derivatized using diazomethane for the quantification of haas and iaas briefly 0 0367 g of diazald and 1 ml of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether carbitol were placed into the inner portion of a sigma aldrich diazomethane generator apparatus then 3 ml of mtbe was added to the outer portion of the apparatus and both portions were assembled then the apparatus was place in ice and 1 5 ml of 37 koh was added into the inner part slowly using a syringe to pierce the septum after 1 hr 50 μl of the diazomethane dissolved in mtbe was spiked into 100 μl of the extracted samples and allowed to react for 30 min and quenched using silica gel derivatized samples were then transferred into new gc vials and analyzed using gc ms 2 5 gc ms analysis internal calibration was used to quantify 66 dbps as described by cuthbertson et al 2020 for the analysis of thms hals hks hams hnms and hans instrumental analysis was performed on a single quadrupole gc mass spectrometer agilent 7890 gc 5977a mass spectrometer agilent technologies santa clara ca with electron ionization ei in selected ion monitoring sim mode briefly 1 0 μl of sample was injected into a multimode inlet mmi in pulsed splitless mode and the separation performed using a rtx 200 column 30 m 0 25 mm 0 25 μm restek corporation bellefonte pa the gc temperature program was as follows 35 c for 5 min increased to 200 c at 9 c min then ramped to 280 c and held for 20 min the source temperature was 200 c quadrupole temperature was 150 c and an ionization energy of 70 ev was used for bromodichloroacetonitrile bromodichloronitromethane dibromochloroacetonitrile dibromochloronitromethane tribromoacetonitrile and tribromonitromethane the same gc program was used with the exception of the inlet and transfer line temperatures which were kept at 125 and 250 c respectively due to their thermal instability for the analysis of haas and iaas samples were analyzed using both a thermo trace 1310 gc coupled to a tsq 9000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific corporation waltham ma and an agilent 7890 gc coupled to a 5977a mass spectrometer the gc temperature program was as follows 35 c for 2 min increased to 280 c rate 9 c min and held for 20 min the transfer line and source temperature were 280 and 200 c respectively and ionization energy was 70 ev selected ions and limits of quantification loqs for the 66 dbps quantified are listed in table s1 2 6 water quality parameters water quality parameters including ph uv absorbance dissolved organic carbon doc specific uv absorbance suva chloride bromide and iodide are listed in table 1 to determine the doc content in the raw water samples they were first filtered through nylon syringe filters 0 45 µm to remove insoluble particles prior to instrumental analysis a calibration curve was made 1 20 mg l using monobasic potassium phthalate sigma aldrich usa as carbon samples were then analyzed using a shimadzu total organic carbon analyzer kyoto japan and were blank ultrapure water subtracted specific ultraviolet absorbance suva was calculated by dividing the uv254 values cm 1 by doc mg l and then multiplied by 100 cm m uv absorbance at 254 nm was measured using a spectramax m5 uv spectrometer molecular devices san jose ca bromide br and iodide i were measured in raw water samples using a dionex integrion high performance ion chromatography hpic system dionex corporation sunnyvale ca with a 500 µl sample loop separation was performed using an ionpac as20 analytical column which was attached to an ionpac as20 guard column with 50 mm naoh as the eluent external calibration was used with standards prepared in ultrapure water 1 750 µg l using sodium chloride as cl sodium bromide as br and sodium iodide as i the limits of quantification loqs for all three are 1 0 µg l 2 7 calculated toxicity calculated toxicity associated with dbps in each sample was based on the tic tox method plewa et al 2017 where molar concentrations of each dbp are multiplied by their reported cyto or genotoxicity index values in chinese hamster ovary cells wagner and plewa 2017 and summed together eq 1 and 2 haloketones are not included because no cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data are available for them thms are not genotoxic except chlorodiiodomethane 1 total calculated cytotoxicity d b p l c 50 1 10 6 2 total calculated genotoxicity d b p 50 t d n a 1 10 6 dbp is the molar concentration of each dbp the cytotoxicity index is the inverse of the lethal concentration at 50 lc50 in m the genotoxicity index is the inverse of the 50 tail dna 50 tdna measurement in m and 106 is a normalization factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of algae upon chlorination of microseira the green cells intracellular material inside the outer sheaths fig 1 reacted with chlorine but the outer sheaths remained intact after 24 hr reaction with chlorine fig 2 in contrast both the intracellular material and the outer sheaths of phormidium visibly reacted with chlorine fig 3 both microseira and phormidium have polysaccharide sheaths burkholder 2009 and hoiczyk 1998 a comprehensive listing of individual dbp concentrations measured in all waters can be found in tables s2 s5 3 2 phormidium dbps several dbps were observed in chlorination reactions of phormidium in ultrapure water table 2 and table s2 demonstrating that the algal organic matter contained in phormidium can directly contribute to dbp formation and can impact chlorinated drinking water individual dbp levels ranged from 0 1 70 µg l with trichloromethane dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid dichloroacetamide dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetaldehyde forming at the highest levels up to 314 µg l dichloroacetamide 19 5 µg l and dichloroacetonitrile 17 9 µg l are among the more toxic n dbps when bromide and iodide were added to reactions forming hobr total dbps increased from 314 to 406 µg l fig 4 when compared to algae in ultrapure water with chlorine brominated dbps include dibromochloromethane 39 8 µg l bromodichloromethane 41 7 µg l bromodichloroacetic acid 28 7 µg l and dibromochloroacetic acid 24 7 µg l which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 no iodinated dbps were observed from chlorinated phomidium samples likely due to iodide reacting quickly with hocl to form iodate io3 a sink for iodide richardson et al 2008 bichsel and gunten 1999 the impact of phormidium on drinking water is even more apparent when comparing dbps formed in natural lake waters to those with added phormidium the presence of phormidium more than doubled the levels of dbps upon chlorination with total dbps increasing from 254 µg l in chlorinated lake water to 586 µg l in chlorinated lake water containing phormidium thus while nom is often recognized as a primary precursor to dbp formation it is evident that algal organic matter is also a significant precursor to dbp formation 3 3 microseira wollei dbps higher levels of dbps were also observed in chlorinated reactions in lake wateree microseira samples with algae present 452 µg l when compared to chlorinated source water 135 µg l table 2 and fig 4 which is 3 3x higher when comparing the different microseira chlorination reactions in ultrapure water microseira wollei collected from the dwr formed lower levels of dbps 66 7 µg l the microseira in this reservoir was believed to be at an early stage of growth which may have rendered it less reactive than the more mature forms which produced 146 and 167 µg l total dbps for microseira collected from lake marion and lake wateree respectively fig 2 presents a visual comparison of microseira from these three different locations before and after chlorination which indicates that microseira from the dwr was somewhat different than the others light green and viscous dbps formed from the dwr lake marion and lake wateree samples are provided in table s3 s5 a variety of dbps formed ranging individually from 0 1 to 34 5 0 1 to 172 and 0 1 to 140 µg l for dwr lake marion and lake wateree microseira samples respectively haas were the most abundant class of dbps formed at all three sampling locations with an average total value of 122 µg l table 2 fig 4 in every chlorinated sample containing algae in ultrapure water total dbps were higher when compared to chlorinated lake water for dwr 2 4x for lake wateree microseira 1 2x for lake wateree phormidium 1 2x with the exception of lake marion raw water fig 4 in chlorinated lake marion water trichloroacetaldehyde 87 2 µg l and trichloroacetic acid 172 µg l were formed at the highest levels at a total of 422 µg l as with phormidium total dbps were higher for every sample spiked with bromide and iodide vs not spiked 2 4x for dwr 1 5x for lake marion and 1 2x for lake wateree microseira fig 4 as expected the addition of bromide and iodide led to an increase in species variation for dbps no iodinated dbps were observed in controlled lab reactions of lake marion and lake wateree samples but four i dbps were observed in the real drinking water sample bromochloroiodomethane 0 2 µg l chloroiodoacetic acid 0 3 µg l bromoiodoacetic acid 0 1 µg l and diiodoacetic acid 0 3 µg l and two from chlorinated algae in ultrapure water when bromide and iodide ions were present bromochloroiodomethane 0 1 µg l and dibromoiodomethane 0 2 µg l table s3 the formation of i dbps is of concern because they generally have much higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity when compared to brominated or chlorinated dbps wagner and plewa 2017 a total of 30 dbps were measured in the real drinking water sample including the i dbps mentioned above levels ranged from 0 1 to 6 5 µg l with a total concentration of 28 1 µg l for dbps which is significantly lower than controlled laboratory reactions likely due to the difference in the microseira in this real reservoir and lower doc in its source water 0 9 mg l table 1 table s3 among them bromodichloromethane 2 9 µg l dichloroacetic acid 6 2 µg l and trichloroacetic acid 6 5 µg l were formed at the highest concentrations 3 4 n dbps when comparing chlorinated algae in ultrapure water vs lake water containing nom and no algae higher levels of nitrogenous dbps n dbps formed when phormidium and microseira algae were present except the dwr samples fig 4 for example total hams increased from 8 3 to 18 9 µg l and total hans increased from 8 9 to 17 0 µg l for chlorinated lake water vs chlorinated microseira in ultrapure water similarly total hams increased from 3 6 to 25 9 µg l and total hans increased from 7 1 to 21 4 µg l for chlorinated lake water vs chlorinated phormidium in ultrapure water table 2 these increases in n dbps are likely because algae contain more nitrogen up to 45 of organic nitrogen can be excreted by algae westerhoff and mash 2002 compared to natural organic matter e g 1 3 in humic acid found in surface waters boggs et al 1985 total n dbps in chlorination reactions containing algae in ultrapure water were 22 1 36 3 and 48 9 µg l for lake marion microseira lake wateree microseira and lake wateree phormidium respectively fig 4 when comparing phormidium to microseira higher levels of n dbps were formed from phormidium than microseira upon chlorination likely due to a greater release of intracellular organic matter from phormidium compared to microseira as phormidium s outer sheaths degrade much more readily with chlorine fig 3 than those of microseira which do not degrade fig 2 dwr microseira samples produced lower amounts of n dbps compared to that from lake wateree and lake marion highest levels of n dbps formed when algae samples were chlorinated in lake water 77 2 and 63 1 µg l for lake wateree microseira and phormidium in lake water respectively due to the presence of both algal organic matter and nom fang et al 2010 reported higher levels of dichloroacetonitrile and cyanogen chloride from chlorination of microcystis aeruginosa cells vs chlorinated nom total n dbps in the real drinking water sample was 6 1 µg l including chloroacetonitrile 1 2 µg l bromodichloronitromethane 1 3 µg l and dibromochloronitromethane 1 6 µg l which were significantly lower than the controlled laboratory reactions of algae as mentioned earlier n dbps are especially important because their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are generally higher than dbps that do not contain nitrogen c dbps plewa et al 2008 therefore if algae impacted source water is disinfected increased algal organic matter may contribute to the formation of higher n dbp levels which can affect drinking water quality and safety 3 5 calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity total calculated cytotoxicity tripled when microseira was present in chlorinated lake wateree source water compared to chlorinated source water without algae and it doubled for phormidium fig 5 table s7 hans 48 and hnms 26 were the main toxicity drivers for chlorinated source waters without algae while hans 68 dominated calculated cytotoxicity when algae microseira was present in chlorinated phormidium impacted source water hans 45 and hams 20 were the main drivers of calculated cytotoxicity while hans 56 were the main drivers when phormidium was added when bromide and iodide were present calculated cytotoxicity of algae reacted in ultrapure water was 16x 13x 8x and 12x higher for dwr microseira lake marion microseira lake wateree microseira and lake wateree phormidium respectively compared to no halide addition similarly calculated genotoxicity was 2x higher in lake wateree source water when microseira was present and 3x higher for phormidium fig 6 table s8 in both cases calculated genotoxicity was driven by haas 24 and 47 and hnms 54 and 23 respectively when source waters no algae added were chlorinated when algae was added to these source waters haas 56 and 59 for microseira and phormidium respectively contributed most to the calculated genotoxicity calculated genotoxicity values followed the same trend as cytotoxicity when bromide and iodide were added to algae reactions in ultrapure water with 6 7x 37 4x 6 1x and 8 7x higher values for dwr microseira lake marion microseira lake wateree microseira and lake wateree phormidium respectively compared to no halide addition 4 conclusions and environmental implications this study reports the most comprehensive study of algal dbps to date with 66 dbps measured results show that microseira and phormidium can have a profound impact on dbps formed in chlorinated drinking water which is especially relevant for plants that use pre chlorination key take home messages from this study include total dbp and n dbp concentrations double when microseira and phormidium algae are present presence of bromide and iodide further increase the dbp levels and produce more toxic dbp species notably microseira and phormidium result in a 2 3 fold increase in calculated cytotoxicity and a 2 fold increase in calculated genotoxicity haloacetonitriles are a major driver of calculated cytotoxicity in algae impacted waters while haloacetic acids are major drivers of calculated genotoxicity in algae impacted waters most research on algae focuses on the algal toxins including microcystins saxitoxins and microseira wollei toxins which are very important but exposure to increased levels of dbps also pose a major human health risk that has not been fully investigated three of the 14 phormidium impacted samples exceed thm regulations 80 µg l and 7 exceed haa regulations 60 µg l in the u s for both phormidium and microseira impacted waters thus increasing presence of algae in source waters may necessitate changes in drinking water treatment including improved methods to remove algae and algal organic matter before disinfection in addition it will be important to investigate dbp formation from chloramination of algae impacted waters as chloramine has become a popular disinfectant in the u s and in many other countries and there is the possibility for increased toxic iodo dbp formation finally future studies should investigate the formation of high molecular weight dbps and highly polar dbps using liquid chromatography lc ms that

16105,warm weather and excess nutrients from agricultural runoff trigger harmful algal blooms which can affect drinking water safety due to the presence of algal toxins and the formation of disinfection by products dbps during drinking water treatment in this study 66 priority unregulated and regulated dbps were quantified in chlorinated controlled laboratory reactions of harmful algae microseira wollei formerly known as lyngbya wollei and phormidium using gas chromatography gc mass spectrometry ms live algae samples collected from algae impacted lakes in south carolina were chlorinated in both ultrapure water and real source waters containing natural organic matter dbps were also measured in finished water from a real drinking water plant impacted by a microseira bloom results show that the presence of microseira and phormidium more than doubles total concentrations of dbps formed by chlorination with levels up to 586 μg l formed in natural lake waters toxic nitrogen containing dbps also more than doubled in concentration with levels up to 36 1 3 6 and 37 9 μg l for haloacetamides halonitromethanes and haloacetonitriles respectively in ultrapure water dbps also formed up to 314 μg l when algae was chlorinated demonstrating their ability to serve as direct precursors for these dbps when environmentally relevant levels of bromide and iodide were added to chlorination reactions total dbps increased 144 51 and 24 for drinking water reservoir lake marion and lake wateree microseira respectively and 29 for phormidium iodo dbps bromochloroiodomethane chloroiodoacetic acid bromoiodoacetic acid and diiodoacetic acid were observed in finished water from a drinking water plant impacted by microseira and bromochloroiodomethane and dibromoiodomethane were observed in chlorinated ultrapure water containing algae bromide and iodide notably total calculated cytotoxicity tripled in microseira impacted waters and doubled for phormidium impacted waters calculated genotoxicity doubled for microseira impacted waters and more than doubled in phormidium impacted waters haloacetonitriles were major drivers of calculated cytotoxicity in algae impacted waters while haloacetic acids were major drivers of calculated genotoxicity in algae impacted waters these results provide the most extensive assessment of dbps formed from chlorination of algae impacted waters and highlight potential impacts to drinking water and human health results from this study are particularly applicable to drinking water treatment plants

2019 resulting in 63 cases of human illness and 364 cases of animal illness of the 364 animal illness cases reported 56 died as a result of their exposure in 2002 a teenager from wisconsin died after suffering from hab related illness after swimming in an anabaena flos aquae impacted pond known to produce neurotoxic anatoxin a also known as very fast death factor behm 2003 habs are not only a concern for human exposure during recreational use of impacted waters such as swimming or fishing but they have also been shown to impact drinking water safety drinking water treatment plants in the u s rely heavily on surface waters and about 75 of reported hab events occur in fresh waters cdc 2019 in 2014 toledo ohio s water supply was shut down due to a harmful microcystis aeruginosa bloom in lake erie affecting 400 000 residents eos 2021 microseira wollei is also of major concern for lakes around the world including lake wateree and lake marion in south carolina sc and several drinking water treatment plants that use these waters as their source for drinking water microseira wollei is a filamentous benthic and perennial algae which produces toxic saxitoxin analogues known as microseira wollei toxins carmichael et al 1997 foss et al 2012 onodera et al 1997 smith et al 2019 yin et al 1997 phormidium which is another filamentous harmful algae known to produce the acute neurotoxin anatoxin a gugger et al 2005 teneva et al 2005 wood et al 2007 borges et al 2015 was also found in lake wateree these algal species release intracellular organic matter iom and extracellular organic matter eom into the water column which includes carbohydrates proteins amino acids aliphatic amines and peptides fang et al 2010 baroni et al 2020 algal organic matter aom also contains more organic nitrogen and hydrophilic carbon material than natural organic matter nom widrig et al 1996 nguyen et al 2005 her et al 2004 ma et al 2006 which mostly contains humic substances with more aromatic carbon and low nitrogen content as a result algal organic matter has a lower specific uv absorbance suva and higher heterogeneity compared to nom neither coagulation nor pre oxidation mediated coagulation processes can remove iom and eom in drinking water treatment ma et al 2006 richardson et al 2007 when algae impacted source water is disinfected iom and eom can react with the disinfectant e g cl2 nh2cl o3 or uv and produce toxic carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps c dbps and n dbps richardson et al 2007 2011 dbps have been linked to adverse human health effects such as bladder cancer colorectal cancer and birth defects richardson et al 2007 cantor et al 2010 nieuwenhuijsen et al 2000 savitz et al 2005 villanueva et al 2004 2007 waller et al 1998 costet et al 2011 rahman et al 2007 currently only 11 dbps are regulated by the u s environmental protection agency epa us epa 2006 despite the identification of more than 700 dbps to date richardson et al 2007 richardson and plewa 2020 richardson 2011 many of these priority unregulated dbps are cytotoxic genotoxic carcinogenic or mutagenic and most are more toxic than the dbps currently regulated richardson et al 2007 richardson and plewa 2020 previous research has reported dbp formation from aom eom and sometimes intact algal cells including material from microcystis aeruginosa oscillatoria sp microseira sp scenedesmus quadricauda nitzschia palea dolichospermum circinale cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and chlorella vulgaris fang et al 2010 liu et al 2022 wert and rosario ortiz 2013 zhou et al 2015 bond et al 2011 2012 hoehn 1980 hong et al 2008 huang et al 2009 zhang et al 2017 li et al 2020 a new study by liu also shows preferential halogenation of aom by iodine over chlorine and bromine when iodide is present in chloraminated waters liu et al 2022 however only a relatively small number of dbps have been investigated to date up to 33 and a comprehensive understanding of the broad range of dbps is missing in addition dbps from phormidium have not previously been investigated therefore the goal of this research was to investigate the formation of 66 priority and regulated dbps following the chlorination of live algae microseira wollei and phormidium which impact not only drinking water sources in south carolina but also many regions throughout the u s and the world these results provide a more complete assessment of dbps formed from algae during chlorination chlorine was chosen because it is the most common disinfectant in the u s cuthbertson et al 2020 the 66 priority and regulated dbps quantified include 10 trihalomethanes thms 13 haloacetic acids haas 4 haloaldehydes hals 9 haloketones hks 13 haloacetamides hams 7 halonitromethanes hnms and 10 haloacetonitriles hans among them the n dbps hams hnms and hans and iodo dbps iodo thms and iodoacetic acids are considered high priority dbps due to their significantly higher toxicity richardson et

floating mat were collected from lake wateree lake marion and a small drinking water reservoir dwr in south carolina sc live phormidium samples were collected from lake wateree sc samples were collected in 500 ml polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe bottles and stored on ice 0 c in a cooler during transportation live algae samples were cleaned immediately upon arrival and refrigerated raw lake water samples were also collected from the sites where algae were collected finished chlorinated drinking water 2 l was collected from a drinking water plant in a small city in sc whose water reservoir was experiencing a microseira bloom in september 2020 residual chlorine of 1 3 mg l raw water samples were filtered with 5 μm filters vacuum filtration and stored at 4 c until extractions residual chlorine in finished drinking water samples was quenched immediately with ammonium chloride 1 1 3 molar ratio of cl nh2cl and extracted to quantify dbps 2 3 experimental design live algae samples were carefully separated physical separation to remove dirt and small aquatic animals once cleaned the algae samples were then washed with their corresponding source water several times to remove any remaining dirt and then pressed by hand to remove extraneous water each type of algae was chlorinated in 250 ml amber bottles headspace free in ultrapure water and source water at ph 7 1 mm phosphate buffer at a ratio of approximately 15 mg l cellular mass to 4 0 25 0 mg l free chlorine standard sodium hypochlorite solution based on chlorine demand experiments to achieve 1 2 mg l residual chlorine after 24 hr reaction table s6 the active cellular mass of algae was calculated to contain 15 mg l of microseira wollei to determine the amount of algae to add to each reactor the percent of cell bound water and unreactive sheath mass was subtracted from the mass of the pressed wet algae the same amount of phormidium was reacted in order to allow for a direct comparison between the two algae species the calculation described above is given in the supporting information text s1 the concentration of algae used 15 mg l for reactions was chosen because it is similar to high doc levels observed in drinking water source waters in the u s richardson et al 2008 samples were also chlorinated following the addition of 500 µg l bromide and 100 µg l iodide to represent elevated levels of these salts that can be found in surface waters richardson et al 2008 bromide and iodide are of interest because they can form hobr and hoi in the presence of chlorine which can then react with natural organic matter and other contaminants e g toxins or algal organic matter to form brominated and iodinated dbps which are more toxic than chlorine containing dbps richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 the residual chlorine was then quenched after 24 hr using ammonium chloride and the samples were then filtered using 5 µm filters to remove reacted algae the reactions were carried out at room temperature 25 c and in duplicate with chlorinated ultrapure water was used for blank measurements 2 4 extraction and sample preparation to explore the potential for dbp formation

conducted following previously methods published from our laboratory cuthbertson et al 2020 2019 allen et al 2017 2022 briefly 100 ml samples were transferred into a 125 ml amber bottle ph adjusted to 1 using concentrated sulfuric acid and spiked with 30 g of na2so4 and 5 ml of methyl tert butyl ether mtbe samples were then shaken for 15 min using a mechanical shaker then allowed to settle to 10 min before the organic layer was removed and collected into a glass test tube using glass pasteur pipettes the process of adding mtbe was repeated two more times for a total organic extract volume of approximately 15 ml the organic layer was then passed through an anhydrous na2so4 column to remove any excess water and concentrated to 200 μl using a gentle stream of nitrogen four μl of 30 mg l 1 2 dibromopropane was added to the concentrated extract as an internal standard the sample was then divided into 2 aliquots 100 μl each one aliquot was used to quantify thms hals hks hams hnms and hans and the other aliquot was derivatized using diazomethane for the quantification of haas and iaas briefly 0 0367 g of diazald and 1 ml of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether carbitol were placed into the inner portion of a sigma aldrich diazomethane generator apparatus then 3 ml of mtbe was added to the outer portion of the apparatus and both portions were assembled then the apparatus was place in ice and 1 5 ml of 37 koh was added into the inner part slowly using a syringe to pierce the septum after 1 hr 50 μl of the diazomethane dissolved in mtbe was spiked into 100 μl of the extracted samples

bromodichloronitromethane dibromochloroacetonitrile dibromochloronitromethane tribromoacetonitrile and tribromonitromethane the same gc program was used with the exception of the inlet and transfer line temperatures which were kept at 125 and 250 c respectively due to their thermal instability for the analysis of haas and iaas samples were analyzed using both a thermo trace 1310 gc coupled to a

attached to an ionpac as20 guard column with 50 mm naoh as the eluent external calibration was used with standards prepared in ultrapure water 1 750 µg l using sodium chloride as cl sodium bromide as br and sodium iodide as i the limits of quantification loqs for all three are 1 0 µg l 2 7 calculated toxicity calculated toxicity associated with dbps in each sample was based on the tic tox method plewa et al 2017 where molar concentrations of each dbp are multiplied by their reported cyto or genotoxicity index values in chinese hamster ovary cells wagner and plewa 2017 and summed together eq 1 and 2 haloketones are not included because no cytotoxicity and genotoxicity data are available for them thms are not genotoxic except chlorodiiodomethane 1 total calculated cytotoxicity d b p l c 50 1 10 6 2 total calculated genotoxicity d b p 50 t d n a 1 10 6 dbp is the molar concentration of each dbp the cytotoxicity index is the inverse of the lethal concentration at 50 lc50 in m the genotoxicity index is the inverse of the 50 tail dna 50 tdna measurement in m and 106 is a normalization factor 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of algae upon chlorination of microseira the green cells intracellular material inside the outer sheaths fig 1 reacted with chlorine but the outer sheaths remained intact after 24 hr reaction with chlorine fig 2 in contrast both the intracellular material and the outer sheaths of phormidium visibly reacted with chlorine fig 3 both microseira and phormidium have polysaccharide sheaths burkholder 2009 and hoiczyk 1998 a comprehensive listing of individual dbp concentrations measured in all waters can be found in tables s2 s5 3 2 phormidium dbps several dbps were observed in chlorination reactions of phormidium in ultrapure water table 2 and table s2 demonstrating that the algal organic matter contained in phormidium can directly contribute to dbp formation and can impact chlorinated drinking water individual dbp levels ranged from 0 1 70 µg l with trichloromethane dichloroacetic acid trichloroacetic acid dichloroacetamide dichloroacetonitrile and trichloroacetaldehyde forming at the highest levels up to 314 µg l dichloroacetamide 19 5 µg l and dichloroacetonitrile 17 9 µg l are among the more toxic n dbps when bromide and iodide were added to reactions forming hobr total dbps increased from 314 to 406 µg l fig 4 when compared to algae in ultrapure water with chlorine brominated dbps include dibromochloromethane 39 8 µg l bromodichloromethane 41 7 µg l bromodichloroacetic acid 28 7 µg l and dibromochloroacetic acid 24 7 µg l which are more cytotoxic and genotoxic than their chlorinated analogues richardson et al 2007 wagner and plewa 2017 no iodinated dbps were observed from chlorinated phomidium samples likely due to iodide reacting quickly with hocl to form iodate io3 a sink for iodide richardson et al 2008 bichsel and gunten 1999 the impact of phormidium on drinking water is even more apparent when comparing dbps formed in natural lake waters to those with added phormidium the presence of phormidium more than doubled the levels of dbps upon chlorination with total dbps increasing from 254 µg l in chlorinated lake water to 586 µg l in chlorinated lake water containing phormidium thus while nom is often recognized as a primary precursor to dbp formation it is evident that algal organic matter is also a significant precursor to dbp formation 3 3 microseira wollei dbps higher levels of dbps were also observed in chlorinated reactions in lake wateree microseira samples with algae present 452 µg l when compared to chlorinated source water 135 µg l table 2 and fig 4 which is 3 3x higher when comparing the different microseira chlorination reactions in ultrapure water microseira wollei collected from the dwr formed lower levels of dbps 66 7 µg l the microseira in this reservoir was believed to be at an early stage of growth which may have rendered it less reactive than the more mature forms which produced 146 and 167 µg l total dbps for microseira collected from lake marion and lake wateree respectively fig 2 presents a visual comparison of microseira from these three different locations before and after chlorination which indicates that microseira from the dwr was somewhat different than the others light green and viscous dbps formed from the dwr lake marion and lake wateree samples are provided in table s3 s5 a variety of dbps formed ranging individually from 0 1 to 34 5 0 1 to 172 and 0 1 to 140 µg l for dwr lake marion and lake wateree microseira samples respectively haas were the most abundant class of dbps formed at all three sampling locations with an average total value of 122 µg l table 2 fig 4 in every chlorinated sample containing algae in ultrapure water total dbps were higher when compared to chlorinated lake water for dwr 2 4x for lake wateree microseira 1 2x for lake wateree phormidium 1 2x with the exception of lake marion raw water fig 4 in chlorinated lake marion water trichloroacetaldehyde 87 2 µg l and trichloroacetic acid 172 µg l were formed at the highest levels at a total of 422 µg l as with phormidium total dbps were higher for every sample spiked with bromide and iodide vs not spiked 2 4x for dwr 1 5x for lake marion and 1 2x for lake wateree microseira fig 4 as expected the addition of bromide and iodide led to an increase in species variation for dbps no iodinated dbps were observed in controlled lab reactions of lake marion and lake wateree samples but four i dbps were observed in the real drinking water sample bromochloroiodomethane 0 2 µg l chloroiodoacetic acid 0 3 µg l bromoiodoacetic acid 0 1 µg l and diiodoacetic acid 0 3 µg l and two from chlorinated algae in ultrapure water when bromide and iodide ions were present bromochloroiodomethane 0 1 µg l and dibromoiodomethane 0 2 µg l table s3 the formation of i dbps is of concern because they generally have much higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity when compared to brominated or chlorinated dbps wagner and plewa 2017 a total of 30 dbps were measured in the real drinking water sample including the i dbps mentioned above levels ranged from 0 1 to 6 5 µg l with a total concentration of 28 1 µg l for dbps which is significantly lower than controlled laboratory reactions likely due to the difference in the microseira in this real reservoir and lower doc in its source water 0 9 mg l table 1 table s3 among them bromodichloromethane 2 9 µg l dichloroacetic acid 6 2 µg l and trichloroacetic acid 6 5 µg l were formed at the highest concentrations 3 4 n dbps when comparing chlorinated algae in ultrapure water vs lake water containing nom and no algae higher levels of nitrogenous dbps n dbps formed when phormidium and microseira algae were present except the dwr samples fig 4 for example total hams increased from 8 3 to 18 9 µg l and total hans increased from 8 9 to 17 0 µg l for chlorinated lake water vs chlorinated microseira in ultrapure water similarly total hams increased from 3 6 to 25 9 µg l and total hans increased from 7 1 to 21 4 µg l for chlorinated lake water vs chlorinated phormidium in ultrapure water table 2 these increases in n dbps are likely because algae contain more nitrogen up to 45 of organic nitrogen can be excreted by algae westerhoff and mash 2002 compared to natural organic matter e g 1 3 in humic acid found in surface waters boggs et al 1985 total n dbps in chlorination reactions containing algae in ultrapure water were 22 1 36 3 and 48 9 µg l for lake marion microseira lake wateree microseira and lake wateree phormidium respectively fig 4 when comparing phormidium to microseira higher levels of n dbps were formed from phormidium than microseira upon chlorination likely due to a greater release of intracellular organic matter from phormidium compared to microseira as phormidium s outer sheaths degrade much more readily with chlorine fig 3 than those of microseira which do not degrade fig 2 dwr microseira samples produced lower amounts of n dbps compared to that from lake wateree and lake marion highest levels of n dbps formed when algae samples were chlorinated in lake water 77 2 and 63 1 µg l for lake wateree microseira and phormidium in lake water respectively due to the presence of both algal organic matter and nom fang et al 2010 reported higher levels of dichloroacetonitrile and cyanogen chloride from chlorination of microcystis aeruginosa cells vs chlorinated nom total n dbps in the real drinking water sample was 6 1 µg l including chloroacetonitrile 1 2 µg l bromodichloronitromethane 1 3 µg l and dibromochloronitromethane 1 6 µg l which were significantly lower than the controlled laboratory reactions of algae as mentioned earlier n dbps are especially important because their cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are generally higher than dbps that do not contain nitrogen c dbps plewa et al 2008 therefore if algae impacted source water is disinfected increased algal organic matter may contribute to the formation of higher n dbp levels which can affect drinking water quality and safety 3 5 calculated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity total calculated cytotoxicity tripled when microseira was present in chlorinated lake wateree source water compared to chlorinated source water without algae and it doubled for phormidium fig 5 table s7 hans 48 and hnms 26 were the main toxicity drivers for chlorinated source waters without algae while hans 68 dominated calculated cytotoxicity when algae microseira was present in chlorinated phormidium impacted source water hans 45 and hams 20 were the main drivers of calculated cytotoxicity while hans 56 were the main drivers when phormidium was added when bromide and iodide were present calculated cytotoxicity of algae reacted in ultrapure water was 16x 13x 8x and 12x higher for dwr microseira lake marion microseira lake wateree microseira and lake wateree phormidium respectively compared to no halide addition similarly calculated genotoxicity was 2x higher in lake wateree source water when microseira was present and 3x higher for phormidium fig 6 table s8 in both cases calculated genotoxicity was driven by haas 24 and 47 and hnms 54 and 23 respectively when source waters no algae added were chlorinated when algae was added to these source waters haas 56 and 59 for microseira and phormidium respectively contributed most to the calculated genotoxicity calculated genotoxicity values followed the same trend as cytotoxicity when bromide and iodide were added to algae reactions in ultrapure water with 6 7x 37 4x 6 1x and 8 7x higher values for dwr microseira lake marion microseira lake wateree microseira and lake wateree phormidium respectively compared to no halide addition 4 conclusions and environmental implications this study reports the most comprehensive study of algal dbps to date with 66 dbps measured results show that microseira and phormidium can have a profound impact on dbps formed in chlorinated drinking water which is especially relevant for plants that use pre chlorination key take home messages from this study include total dbp and n dbp concentrations double when microseira and phormidium algae are present presence of bromide and iodide further increase the dbp levels and produce more toxic dbp species notably microseira and phormidium result in a 2 3 fold increase in calculated cytotoxicity and a 2 fold increase in calculated genotoxicity haloacetonitriles are a major driver of calculated cytotoxicity in algae impacted waters while haloacetic acids are major drivers of calculated genotoxicity in algae impacted waters most research on algae focuses on the algal toxins including microcystins saxitoxins and microseira wollei toxins which are very important but exposure to increased levels of dbps also pose a major human health risk that has not been fully investigated three of the 14 phormidium impacted samples exceed thm regulations 80 µg l and 7 exceed haa regulations 60 µg l in the u s for both phormidium and microseira impacted waters thus increasing presence of algae in source waters may necessitate changes in drinking water treatment including improved methods to remove algae and algal organic matter before disinfection in addition it will be important to investigate dbp formation from chloramination of algae impacted waters as chloramine has become a popular disinfectant in the u s and in many other countries and there is the possibility for increased toxic iodo dbp formation finally future studies should investigate the formation of high molecular weight dbps and highly polar dbps using liquid chromatography lc ms that

16106,huge synthetic chemicals and hydrocarbons have been released to inland waters and oceans composing anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon adoc they complement a large budget for co2 burial by inland and coastal marine sediments is crucial to reduce this budget how ecological regime shifts influence the burial ability of adoc by inland waters and coastal oceans and what are the differences between them remain largely unknown we collected sediment cores from an inland lake lake qianhu and the largest coastal lagoon lagoon pinqing in china and chose 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs to address these issues burial ability of pahs by sediments decreased by 55 1 98 5 in lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 and by 91 5 99 5 in lake qianhu in the period from 1970 to 2018 burial ability and its decrease rate for most pahs in lagoon pinqing were larger than those in lake qianhu in the same period pahs with higher hydrophobicity were more ready to be buried by both lake sediments and lagoon sediments burial ability of most pahs in lagoon pinqing was negative correlated with total phosphorus concentration in contrast burial ability of most pahs in lake qianhu was negative correlated with total nitrogen concentration regime shifted from phytoplankton to submerged macrophytes dominance in the year of 1976 and from submerged macrophytes to phytoplankton dominance in the year of 1999 in lagoon pinqing driven by nitrogen regime shifted from vascular plants to phytoplankton dominance in lake qianhu in the year of 1991 driven by phosphorus different aromaticity and sources of organic matter related to regime shifts were responsible for the discrepancy of burial ability for pahs by sediments of these two waters our study suggests that burial ability of adoc

vila costa et al 2020 the environmental concentrations of total semi volatile aromatic like compounds drive a large global deposition of carbon estimated at 400 tg c yr 1 around 15 of the oceanic co2 uptake le quéré et al 2015 although adoc complements a large budget for carbon dioxide previous studies on carbon burial mostly focused on natural organic carbon ignoring the burial of adoc sediments are the final reservoirs of adoc wang et al 2012 which can effectively reduce their budgets for carbon dioxide by burying them tao et al 2019 the ability of sediments to bury adoc will be altered if the climate tao et al 2019 and environment tao 2021 are changed ecological regime shifts have been found in many waters including inland waters scheffer and jeppesen 2007 tao 2021 and oceans deyoung et al 2008 which have largely altered the dynamics of primary productivity scheffer and carpenter 2003 and consequently carbon cycling alheit 2009 and carbon burial brothers et al 2013 however the effects of ecological regime shifts on the burial of adoc by sediments are largely unexplored eutrophication is a worldwide problem for inland waters and coastal oceans caused by nutrient enrichment especially nitrogen and phosphorus smith and schindler 2009 malone and newton 2020 it is an important driver for ecological regime shifts in inland waters and coastal oceans smith and schindler 2009 gebremariam et al 2021 the limiting nutrients for primary productivity in inland waters and coastal oceans are different conley et al 2009 the limiting nutrients can convert between nitrogen and phosphorus as well cai et al 2010 how ecological regime shifts driven by eutrophication influence the burial of adoc by sediments in inland waters and coastal oceans and what are the differences between them remain largely unknown lakes and coastal oceans play crucial roles in carbon burial mendonça et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 lakes have a disproportionate effect on the global carbon cycle relative to their area it is believed that the global lakes and reservoirs bury two times more organic carbon than oceans at the time scale of centuries to millennia mendonça et al 2017 coastal oceans host approximate 15 30 of oceanic primary production and approximate 80 of oceanic organic matter burial gattuso et al 1998 in contrast to natural carbon less attention has been paid on the burial of adoc by sediments of lakes and coastal oceans polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are important components of adoc mainly derived from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous materials shen et al 2013 we collected sediment cores from an inland lake and the largest coastal lagoon in china and chose 16 pahs to address the issues how ecological regime shifts influence the burial ability of adoc by inland waters and coastal oceans and what are the differences between them 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and analysis of sediment cores lagoon pinqing is the largest lagoon in china with a surface area of 23 2 km2 and a shoreline length of 39 6 km located in shanwei city guangdong province fig 1 sun et al 2010 meng et al 2012 it is embraced by low hills on its eastern southern and

sediment slices were obtained the sediment slices were frozen preserved and freeze dried before usage sediment cores were dated by 210pb and 137cs techniques at nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences with an eg g ortec gamma spectrometry according to our previous study yao et al 2013 the activity of 137cs was measured at 662 kev the activity of 210pb was determined via gamma emission at 46 5 kev and 226ra at 295 and 352 kev γ rays emitted by its daughter isotope 214pb the counting times of each sample ranged from 4 104 s to 9 104 s the counter error increased with decreased activity of 210pb for sediments with 210pb activity higher than 500 bq kg the counter error is below 5 137cs was used to identify the 1963 nuclear weapons peak which was then used as a part of constant rate of supply crs model to calculate the 210pb chronology for the core the crs model was chosen and expressed as 1 t x λ 1 l n a 0 a x where t is the age in years λ is the

activity with depth conformed to the exponential attenuation mode fig 2 suggesting that the sediment cores had not or rarely been disturbed by human activities the sedimentation rates of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu were 2 36 cm yr 1 and 0 58 cm yr 1 respectively the chronology of the collected sediment cores of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu ranged from 1963 to 2018 and from 1970 to 2018 respectively 3 2 emission density burial fluxes and burial ability of pahs the emission density of pahs in the catchments of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu increased gradually in the periods from 1963 to 2018 and from 1970 to 2018 figs s1a and b it was ascribed to the increasing energy consumption in shanwei city and nanjing city in recent decades the emission density of pah16 in the catchment of lagoon pinqing varied from 3 3 to 71 5 kg km 2 yr 1 in the period from 1963 to 2018 fig s1a it reached the peak value of 135 kg km 2 yr 1 in the year of 2017 fig s1a the emission density of pahs in the catchment of lake qianhu was higher than that of lagoon pinqing figs s1a and b varying from 2 8 to 85 5 kg km 2 yr 1 in the period from 1970 to 2018 fig s1b and reaching the peak value of 371 kg km 2 yr 1 in the year of 2013 fig s1b it may be ascribed to the higher consumption of coal crude oil and other resources in nanjing city than that in shanwei city the burial fluxes of pahs in lagoon pinqing were much lower than those in lake qianhu during the same period figs s2a and b the burial flux of pah16 in lagoon pinqing varied from 112 to 918 ng cm 2 yr 1 in the period from 1963 to 2018 fig s2a in contrast the burial flux of pah16 in lake qianhu varied from 162 to 2007 ng cm 2 yr 1 in the period from 1970 to 2018 fig s2a the burial fluxes of the pahs had significant decreasing trends in the period from 2010 to 2018 in lagoon pinqing fig s2a the average burial ability of the individual pahs by the sediments of lagoon pinqing varied from 1 0 1 2 to 32 8 23 1 n 55 in the period from 1963 to 2018 figs 3 and s3 although the burial fluxes of the pahs by the sediments of lake qianhu were higher figs s2a and b the average burial ability of most pahs by the sediments of lake qianhu was lower than that of lagoon pinqing figs s3 and s4 ranging from 0 1 0 3 to 6 1 6 3 n 29 in the period from 1970 to 2018 fig s4 the burial ability of the 16 pahs by sediments in lagoon pinqing decreased

1 0 0 1 and 19 7 3 2 mg g 1 respectively fig s5a the atomic ratio of corg n for lagoon pinqing varied from 4 2 to 11 2 with an average of 8 0 1 6 n 56 and showed a significant decreasing trend in the period from 1963 to 2018 r2 0 203 p 0 001 fig 4 the value of δ13corg in the sediments of lagoon pinqing showed an increasing trend in the period from 1976 to 1999 and reached a peak in 1999 and continued to decline in the period from 1999 to 2018 fig 5 a the value of δ15n in the sediments of lagoon pinqing varied from 6 0 to 7 5 in the period from 1963 to 2018 and showed an increasing trend from the year of 2000 with an average of 6 6 0 3 n 33 fig 5a the concentrations of tn tp and toc in the sediment core of lake qianhu increased significantly from 3 1 to 4 0 from 1 2 to 1 8 and from 42 7 to 83 6 mg g 1 in the period from 1970 to 2018 fig s5b with the averages of 3 6 0 5 1 4 0 2 and 66 9 8 6 mg g 1 n 29 fig s5b which were much higher than those of lagoon pinqing figs s5a and b significant correlations were found between toc and tn and tn and tp in the sediment core of lake qianhu table s7 meanwhile the atomic ratio of corg n of sediments in lake qianhu varied from 14 9 to 31 5 with an average of 21 8 3 5 n 29 fig 4 the value of δ15n of lake qianhu decreased gradually from 7 6 to 6 4 in the period from 1970 to 1991 fig 5b and then remained almost stable with an average of 6 9 0 3 n 11 after the year of 1991 fig 5b the results suggested that ecological regime shifts occurred in lake qianhu in the year of 1991 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of ecological regime shifts although the concentrations of tn and tp increased in the sediment core of lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 the concentration of toc in the sediment core decreased significantly during the same period fig s5a and table s6 this suggested that the sources of som in lagoon pinqing changed during this period atomic ratio of corg n is an indicator of different sources for organic matters in water if the atomic ratio of corg n is between 4 and 12 it indicates that som is mainly endogenic meybeck 1982 the atomic ratio of corg n fig 4 indicated that the som in lagoon pinqing was mainly endogenic previous studies have indicated that the atomic ratio of corg n for phytoplankton varies from 4 to 10 dou et al 2007 the atomic ratio of corg n fig 4 suggested that phytoplankton dominated in lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 the different trends of δ13corg value in sediments of lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 fig 5a implied that ecological regime shifts occurred during this period the δ13corg values of submerged macrophytes and freshwater phytoplankton were reported in the ranges of 5 8 to 18 1 and 25 0 to 33 0 cheung et al 2015 the decreasing value of δ13corg in the period from 1963 to 1976 fig 5a suggested that the proportion of phytoplankton to the total primary productivity increased gradually during this period in contrast the increasing value of δ13corg in the period from 1977 to 1999 suggested that the proportion of submerged macrophytes to the total primary productivity increased gradually during this period fig 5a the results suggested that ecological regime shifts occurred in lagoon pinqing in the year of 1976 the value of δ13corg in sediments of lagoon pinqing reached a peak in 1999 and continued to decline in the period from 2000 to 2018 fig 5a the value of δ15n in sediments of lagoon pinqing showed an increasing trend from the year of 2000 fig 5a these results suggested that ecological regime shifts occurred again in lagoon pinqing in the year of 2000 due to blooms of phytoplankton decomposition and denitrification of organic matter in sediments enhance the value of δ15n wu et al 2020 therefore the decreasing value of δ13corg and increasing value of δ15n in the period from 2000 to 2018 suggested that the proportion of phytoplankton to the total primary productivity increased gradually during this period in lagoon pinqing fig 5a previous studies have indicated that the atomic ratio of corg n for vascular plants can reach 20 and higher dou et al 2007 the decreasing values of corg n and δ15n in the period from 1970 to 1991 in lake qianhu figs 4 and 5b suggested that the proportion of vascular plants to the total primary productivity was decreasing rapidly during this period the value of δ15n in sediments of lake qianhu remained almost stable with an average of 6 9 0 3 n 11 after the year of 1991 fig 5b the almost stable atomic ratio of corg n and value of δ15n in the period from 1991 to 2018 figs 4 and 5b suggested that ecological regime was relatively stable in lake qianhu during this period these results suggested that ecological regime shifted from macrophyte to phytoplankton in lake qianhu in the year of 1991 in the period from 1991 to 2018 the value of δ13c fluctuated from 29 2 to 27 4 in lake qianhu fig 5b the concentration of tp and tn increased gradually in the same period in lake qianhu fig s5b previous study indicated that the δ13c signature varied not only among different phytoplankton classes but also between species belonging to the same class irrespective of growth phase brutemark et al 2009 the value of δ13c for diatom and cyanobacteria ranged from 30 6 to 26 6 and from 32 4 to 20 0 respectively vuorio et al 2006 the value of δ15n for diatom and chroococcalean cyanobacteria microcystis spp and w naegeliana ranged from 4 0 to 10 0 and from 4 0 to 8 0 respectively vuorio et al 2006 the values of δ13c and δ15n and the increasing concentrations of tn and tp in the period from 1991 to 2018 indicated that the dominant phytoplankton in lake qianhu might vary from diatom to cyanobacteria during this period 4 2 discrepancy of burial ability for pahs the different aromaticity and sources of som related to ecological regime shifts were responsible for the discrepancy of burial ability for pahs in these two waters figs 3 6 the e465 e665 ratio was used to describe the aromaticity of som the higher the ratio of e465 e665 the smaller the molecular aromatization and molecular weight tao 2021 the ratio of e465 e665 for som varied from 1 1 to 1 3 in lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 with an average of 1 2 0 1 n 66 fig 6 the ratio of e465 e665 for som varied from 1 2 to 1 5 in lake qianhu in the period from 1970 to 2018 with an average of 1 3 0 1 n 28 fig 6 the ratio of e465 e665 in lagoon pinqing was much lower than that in lake qianhu in the same period fig 6 this indicated that the polarity of som of lagoon pinqing was smaller than that of lake qianhu in the same period the adsorption ability of pahs by som of lagoon pinqing was thereby higher than that of lake qianhu in the same period therefore the burial ability of pahs in lagoon pinqing was higher than that in lake qianhu in the same period figs s3 and s4 the average burial ability of the individual pahs varied with their hydrophobicity expressed with log k ow values in both lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu fig 7 a and b the burial ability of nap and acy was lower in both lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu due to their lower log k ow values fig 7a in contrast the burial ability of bbf and bap was higher in lagoon pinqing owing to their higher log k ow values fig 7a daha had a higher log k ow value fig 7b the burial ability of it in lake qianhu was also higher figs 3 and s4 the results suggested that the pahs with higher log k ow values were more ready to be buried by both lake sediments and lagoon sediments than those with lower log k ow values the decrease rate of the burial ability of the pahs declined with the increase of log k ow of the pahs in both lake qianhu and lagoon pinqing fig 8 tables s4 and s5 suggesting that the pahs with lower log k ow values are quicker to be released to water or degraded and more ready to be the budget for carbon dioxide when ecological regime shifts occur 4 3 influences of ecological regime shifts on burial ability of pahs and the related limiting nutrients the values of tli tn and tli tp of the water column in lake qianhu were 75 5 and 60 4 in the year of 2020 suggesting that the trophic state of lake qianhu was eutrophic table s8 the e value of the water column in lagoon pinqing varied from 0 9 to 1 7 in the period from 2004 to 2008 feng et al 2011 suggesting that the trophic state of lagoon pinqing changed from eutrophia to eutrophication in this period table s9 tn and tp are the dominant limiting nutrients for primary productivity in waters abell et al 2010 if the atomic ratio of n p 16 tp is considered as the limiting factor long et al 2007 if the atomic ratio of tn tp 10 tn is usually considered as the limiting factor long et al 2007 the atomic ratios of tn tp in the water columns of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu were 9 3 and 61 8 respectively suggesting that n and p were the limiting nutrients for the primary productivity in lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu respectively the results are consistent with previous point of view that p is the limiting nutrient for primary productivity in inland waters while n is usually the limiting nutrient for primary productivity in coastal oceans smith et al 1999 smith and schindler 2009 the ecological regime shifts in lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu reduced the burial ability of pahs by sediments but were related to different limiting nutrients tables s10 and s11 stepwise linear regression analysis was used to calculate the relationships between the burial ability of pahs and tn tp corg n the content of clay and e465 e665 in these two waters tables s10 and s11 in contrast to the fact that tn was the limiting nutrient for primary productivity in lagoon pinqing tp was the dominant factor for the burial ability of most pahs in the sediments of lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 table s10 the burial ability of phe ant fla chr daha and bghip by sediments in lagoon pinqing was significantly negatively related to the concentration of tp in the sediments table s10 on the contrary tn was the dominant factor for the burial ability of the 16 pahs in lake qianhu in the period from 1970 to 2018 table s11 the burial ability of all the 16 pahs in lake qianhu showed negative correlations with the concentration of tn in sediments table s11 the results may be explained as the following with the increase of nutrient concentration the dominant species in waters change accordingly resulting in ecological regime shifts carpenter and brock 2006 tao 2021 the concentrations of nutrients affect the turbidity of waters resulting in aquatic macrophytes dominance shifting to algae dominance scheffer et al 1993 lagoon pinqing is undergoing the process of ecological transition from aquatic macrophytes to algae fig 5a the adsorption ability of aquatic macrophytes for adoc is stronger than that of algae roessink et al 2010 therefore the adsorption ability of pahs by som produced by total primary productivity decreased with the increase of nutrient concentration in lagoon pinqing burial ability of pahs by sediments thereby decreased with the increase of nutrient concentration in lagoon pinqing lake qianhu is undergoing the ecological transition among algae types fig 5b due to the porous structure of algal cell wall algae with larger specific surface area have stronger adsorption ability for adoc lu et al 2006 the shift of dominant species among different algae types in lake qianhu may be an important reason for the decrease of burial ability of pahs with the increase of nutrients 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that ecological regime shifts have greatly reduced the burial ability of 16 pahs by both lake sediments and coastal marine sediments but induced by different limiting nutrients burial ability and its decrease rate for most pahs in lagoon pinqing were larger than those in lake qianhu in the same period different aromaticity and sources of sediment organic matter related to ecological regime shifts were responsible for the discrepancy of burial ability for pahs the pahs with higher hydrophobicity were more ready to be buried by both lake sediments and coastal marine sediments our study suggests that the burial ability of adoc by inland and coastal marine sediments will be reduced and their budget for carbon dioxide may be higher especially for the adoc with less hydrophobicity if eutrophication results in ecological regime shifts which may undermine the efforts to mitigate global warming considering the fact that huge amount of synthetic chemicals and hydrocarbons are emitted to the environment and inland lakes and coastal oceans are crucial sinks for them eqs 1 8 credit authorship contribution statement ning yu data curation formal analysis

inland and coastal marine sediments is crucial to reduce this budget how ecological regime shifts influence the burial ability of adoc by inland waters and coastal oceans and what are the differences between them remain largely unknown we collected sediment cores from an inland lake lake qianhu and the largest coastal lagoon lagoon pinqing in china and chose 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs to address these issues burial ability of pahs by sediments decreased by 55 1 98 5 in lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 and by 91 5 99 5 in lake qianhu in the period from 1970 to 2018 burial ability and its decrease rate for most pahs in lagoon pinqing were larger than those in lake qianhu in the same period pahs with higher hydrophobicity were more ready to be buried by both lake sediments and lagoon sediments burial ability of most pahs in lagoon pinqing was negative correlated with total phosphorus concentration in contrast burial ability of most pahs in lake qianhu was negative correlated with total nitrogen concentration regime shifted from phytoplankton to submerged macrophytes dominance in the year of 1976 and from submerged macrophytes to phytoplankton dominance in the year of 1999 in lagoon pinqing driven by nitrogen regime shifted from vascular plants to phytoplankton dominance in lake qianhu in the year of 1991 driven by phosphorus different aromaticity and sources of organic matter related to regime shifts were responsible for the discrepancy of burial ability for pahs by sediments of these two waters our study suggests that burial ability of adoc

are the final reservoirs of adoc wang et al 2012 which can effectively reduce their budgets for carbon dioxide by burying them tao et al 2019 the ability of sediments to bury adoc will be altered if the climate tao et al 2019 and environment tao 2021 are changed ecological regime shifts have been found in many waters including inland waters scheffer and jeppesen 2007 tao 2021 and oceans deyoung et al 2008 which have largely altered the dynamics of primary productivity scheffer and carpenter 2003 and consequently carbon cycling alheit 2009 and carbon burial brothers et al 2013 however the effects of ecological regime shifts on the burial of adoc by sediments are largely unexplored eutrophication is a worldwide problem for inland waters and coastal oceans caused by nutrient enrichment especially nitrogen and phosphorus smith and schindler 2009 malone and newton 2020 it is an important driver for ecological regime shifts in inland waters and coastal oceans smith and schindler 2009 gebremariam et al 2021 the limiting nutrients for primary productivity in inland waters and coastal oceans are different conley et al 2009 the limiting nutrients can convert between nitrogen and phosphorus as well cai et al 2010 how ecological regime shifts driven by eutrophication influence the burial of adoc by sediments in inland waters and coastal oceans and what are the differences between them remain largely unknown lakes and coastal oceans play crucial roles in carbon burial mendonça et al 2017 zhao et al 2021 lakes have a disproportionate effect on the global carbon cycle relative to their area it is believed that the global lakes and reservoirs bury two times more organic carbon than oceans at the time scale of centuries to millennia mendonça et al 2017 coastal oceans host approximate 15 30 of oceanic primary production and approximate 80 of oceanic organic matter burial gattuso et al 1998 in contrast to natural carbon less attention has been paid on the burial of adoc by sediments of lakes and coastal oceans polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are important components of adoc mainly derived from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous materials shen et al 2013 we collected sediment cores from an inland lake and the largest coastal lagoon in china and chose 16 pahs to address the issues how ecological regime shifts influence the burial ability of adoc by inland waters and coastal oceans and what are the differences between them 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling and analysis of sediment cores lagoon pinqing is the largest lagoon in china with a surface area of 23 2 km2 and a shoreline length of 39 6 km located in shanwei city guangdong province fig 1 sun et al 2010 meng et al 2012 it is embraced by low hills on its eastern southern and

activity with depth conformed to the exponential attenuation mode fig 2 suggesting that the sediment cores had not or rarely been disturbed by human activities the sedimentation rates of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu were 2 36 cm yr 1 and 0 58 cm yr 1 respectively the chronology of the collected sediment cores of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu ranged from 1963 to 2018 and from 1970 to 2018 respectively 3 2 emission density burial fluxes and burial ability of pahs the emission density of pahs in the catchments of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu increased gradually in the periods from 1963 to 2018 and from 1970 to 2018 figs s1a and b it was ascribed to the increasing energy consumption in shanwei city and nanjing city in recent decades the emission density of pah16 in the catchment of lagoon pinqing varied from 3 3 to 71 5 kg km 2 yr 1 in the period from 1963 to 2018 fig s1a it reached the peak value of 135 kg km 2 yr 1 in the year of 2017 fig s1a the emission density of pahs in the catchment of lake qianhu was higher than that of lagoon pinqing figs s1a and b varying from 2 8 to 85 5 kg km 2 yr 1 in the period from 1970 to 2018 fig s1b and reaching the peak value of 371 kg km 2 yr 1 in the year of 2013 fig s1b it may be ascribed to the higher consumption of coal crude oil and other resources in nanjing city than that in shanwei city the burial fluxes of pahs in lagoon pinqing were much lower than those in lake qianhu during the same period figs s2a and b the burial flux of pah16 in lagoon pinqing varied from 112 to 918 ng cm 2 yr 1 in the period from 1963 to 2018

1 0 0 1 and 19 7 3 2 mg g 1 respectively fig s5a the atomic ratio of corg n for lagoon pinqing varied from 4 2 to 11 2 with an average of 8 0 1 6 n 56 and showed a significant decreasing trend in the period from 1963 to 2018 r2 0 203 p 0 001 fig 4 the value of δ13corg in the sediments of lagoon pinqing showed an increasing trend in the period from 1976 to 1999 and reached a peak in 1999 and continued to decline in the period from 1999 to 2018 fig 5 a the value of δ15n in the sediments of lagoon pinqing varied from 6 0 to 7 5 in the period from 1963 to 2018 and showed an increasing trend from the year of 2000 with an average of 6 6 0 3 n 33 fig 5a the concentrations of tn tp and toc in the sediment core of lake qianhu increased significantly from 3 1 to 4 0 from 1 2 to 1 8 and from 42 7 to 83 6 mg g 1 in the period from 1970 to 2018 fig s5b with the averages of 3 6 0 5 1 4 0 2 and 66 9 8 6 mg g 1 n 29 fig s5b which were much higher than those of lagoon pinqing figs s5a and b significant correlations were found between toc and tn and tn and tp in the sediment core of lake qianhu table s7 meanwhile the atomic ratio of corg n of sediments in lake qianhu varied from 14 9 to 31 5 with an average of 21 8 3 5 n 29 fig 4 the value of δ15n of lake qianhu decreased gradually from 7 6 to 6 4 in the period from 1970 to 1991 fig 5b and then remained almost stable with an average of 6 9 0 3 n 11 after the year of 1991 fig 5b the results suggested that ecological regime shifts occurred in lake qianhu in the year of 1991 4 discussion 4 1 evidence of ecological regime shifts although the concentrations of tn and tp increased in the sediment core of lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 the concentration of toc in the sediment core decreased significantly during the same period fig s5a and table s6 this suggested that the sources of som in lagoon pinqing changed during this period atomic ratio of corg n is an indicator of different sources for organic matters in water if the atomic ratio of corg n is between 4 and 12 it indicates that som is mainly endogenic meybeck 1982 the atomic ratio of corg n fig 4 indicated that the som in lagoon pinqing was mainly endogenic previous studies have indicated that the atomic ratio of corg n for phytoplankton varies from 4 to 10 dou et al 2007 the atomic ratio of corg n fig 4 suggested that phytoplankton dominated in lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 the different trends of δ13corg value in sediments of lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 fig 5a implied that ecological regime shifts occurred during this period the δ13corg values of submerged macrophytes and freshwater phytoplankton were reported in the ranges of 5 8 to 18 1 and 25 0 to 33 0 cheung et al 2015 the decreasing value of δ13corg in the period from 1963 to 1976 fig 5a suggested that the proportion of phytoplankton to the total primary productivity increased gradually during this period in contrast the increasing value of δ13corg in the period from 1977 to 1999 suggested that the proportion of submerged macrophytes to the total primary productivity increased gradually during this period fig 5a the results suggested that ecological regime shifts occurred in lagoon pinqing in the year of 1976 the value of δ13corg in sediments of lagoon pinqing reached a peak in 1999 and continued to decline in the period from 2000 to 2018 fig 5a the value of δ15n in sediments of lagoon pinqing showed an increasing trend from the year of 2000 fig 5a these results suggested that ecological regime shifts occurred again in lagoon pinqing in the year of 2000 due to blooms of phytoplankton decomposition and denitrification of organic matter in sediments enhance the value of δ15n wu et al 2020 therefore the decreasing value of δ13corg and increasing value of δ15n in the period from 2000 to 2018 suggested that the proportion of phytoplankton to the total primary productivity increased gradually during this period in lagoon pinqing fig 5a previous studies have indicated that the atomic ratio of corg n for vascular plants can reach 20 and higher dou et al 2007 the decreasing values of corg n and δ15n in the period from 1970 to 1991 in lake qianhu figs 4 and 5b suggested that the proportion of vascular plants to the total primary productivity was decreasing rapidly during this period the value of δ15n in sediments of lake qianhu remained almost stable with an average of 6 9 0 3 n 11 after the year of 1991 fig 5b the almost stable atomic ratio of corg n and value of δ15n in the period from 1991 to 2018 figs 4 and 5b suggested that ecological regime was relatively stable in lake qianhu during this period these results suggested that ecological regime shifted from macrophyte to phytoplankton in lake qianhu in the year of 1991 in the period from 1991 to 2018 the value of δ13c fluctuated from 29 2 to 27 4 in lake qianhu fig 5b the concentration of tp and tn increased gradually in the same period in lake qianhu fig s5b previous study indicated that the δ13c signature varied not only among different phytoplankton classes but also between species belonging to the same class irrespective of growth phase brutemark et al 2009 the value of δ13c for diatom and cyanobacteria ranged from 30 6 to 26 6 and from 32 4 to 20 0 respectively vuorio et al 2006 the value of δ15n for diatom and chroococcalean cyanobacteria microcystis spp and w naegeliana ranged from 4 0 to 10 0 and from 4 0 to 8 0 respectively vuorio et al 2006 the values of δ13c and δ15n and the increasing concentrations of tn and tp in the period from 1991 to 2018 indicated that the dominant phytoplankton in lake qianhu might vary from diatom to cyanobacteria during this period 4 2 discrepancy of burial ability for pahs the different aromaticity and sources of som related to ecological regime shifts were responsible for the discrepancy of burial ability for pahs in these two waters figs 3 6 the e465 e665 ratio was used to describe the aromaticity of som the higher the ratio of e465 e665 the smaller the molecular aromatization and molecular weight tao 2021 the ratio of e465 e665 for som varied from 1 1 to 1 3 in lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 with an average of 1 2 0 1 n 66 fig 6 the ratio of e465 e665 for som varied from 1 2 to 1 5 in lake qianhu in the period from 1970 to 2018 with an average of 1 3 0 1 n 28 fig 6 the ratio of e465 e665 in lagoon pinqing was much lower than that in lake qianhu in the same period fig 6 this indicated that the polarity of som of lagoon pinqing was smaller than that of lake qianhu in the same period the adsorption ability of pahs by som of lagoon pinqing was thereby higher than that of lake qianhu in the same period therefore the burial ability of pahs in lagoon pinqing was higher than that in lake qianhu in the same period figs s3 and s4 the average burial ability of the individual pahs varied with their hydrophobicity expressed with log k ow values in both lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu fig 7 a and b the burial ability of nap and acy was lower in both lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu due to their lower log k ow values fig 7a in contrast the burial ability of bbf and bap was higher in lagoon pinqing owing to their higher log k ow values fig 7a daha had a higher log k ow value fig 7b the burial ability of it in lake qianhu was also higher figs 3 and s4 the results suggested that the pahs with higher log k ow values were more ready to be buried by both lake sediments and lagoon sediments than those with lower log k ow values the decrease rate of the burial ability of the pahs declined with the increase of log k ow of the pahs in both lake qianhu and lagoon pinqing fig 8 tables s4 and s5 suggesting that the pahs with lower log k ow values are quicker to be released to water or degraded and more ready to be the budget for carbon dioxide when ecological regime shifts occur 4 3 influences of ecological regime shifts on burial ability of pahs and the related limiting nutrients the values of tli tn and tli tp of the water column in lake qianhu were 75 5 and 60 4 in the year of 2020 suggesting that the trophic state of lake qianhu was eutrophic table s8 the e value of the water column in lagoon pinqing varied from 0 9 to 1 7 in the period from 2004 to 2008 feng et al 2011 suggesting that the trophic state of lagoon pinqing changed from eutrophia to eutrophication in this period table s9 tn and tp are the dominant limiting nutrients for primary productivity in waters abell et al 2010 if the atomic ratio of n p 16 tp is considered as the limiting factor long et al 2007 if the atomic ratio of tn tp 10 tn is usually considered as the limiting factor long et al 2007 the atomic ratios of tn tp in the water columns of lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu were 9 3 and 61 8 respectively suggesting that n and p were the limiting nutrients for the primary productivity in lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu respectively the results are consistent with previous point of view that p is the limiting nutrient for primary productivity in inland waters while n is usually the limiting nutrient for primary productivity in coastal oceans smith et al 1999 smith and schindler 2009 the ecological regime shifts in lagoon pinqing and lake qianhu reduced the burial ability of pahs by sediments but were related to different limiting nutrients tables s10 and s11 stepwise linear regression analysis was used to calculate the relationships between the burial ability of pahs and tn tp corg n the content of clay and e465 e665 in these two waters tables s10 and s11 in contrast to the fact that tn was the limiting nutrient for primary productivity in lagoon pinqing tp was the dominant factor for the burial ability of most pahs in the sediments of lagoon pinqing in the period from 1963 to 2018 table s10 the burial ability of phe ant fla chr daha and bghip by sediments in lagoon pinqing was significantly negatively related to the concentration of tp in the sediments table s10 on the contrary tn was the dominant factor for the burial ability of the 16 pahs in lake qianhu in the period from 1970 to 2018 table s11 the burial ability of all the 16 pahs in lake qianhu showed negative correlations with the concentration of tn in sediments table s11 the results may be explained as the following with the increase of nutrient concentration the dominant species in waters change accordingly resulting in ecological regime shifts carpenter and brock 2006 tao 2021 the concentrations of nutrients affect the turbidity of waters resulting in aquatic macrophytes dominance shifting to algae dominance scheffer et al 1993 lagoon pinqing is undergoing the process of ecological transition from aquatic macrophytes to algae fig 5a the adsorption ability of aquatic macrophytes for adoc is stronger than that of algae roessink et al 2010 therefore the adsorption ability of pahs by som produced by total primary productivity decreased with the increase of nutrient concentration in lagoon pinqing burial ability of pahs by sediments thereby decreased with the increase of nutrient concentration in lagoon pinqing lake qianhu is undergoing the ecological transition among algae types fig 5b due to the porous structure of algal cell wall algae with larger specific surface area have stronger adsorption ability for adoc lu et al 2006 the shift of dominant species among different algae types in lake qianhu may be an important reason for the decrease of burial ability of pahs with the increase of nutrients 5 conclusions our results demonstrate that ecological regime shifts have greatly reduced the burial ability of 16 pahs by both lake sediments and coastal marine sediments but induced by different limiting nutrients burial ability and its decrease rate for most pahs in lagoon pinqing were larger than those in lake qianhu in the same period different aromaticity and sources of sediment organic matter related to ecological regime shifts were responsible for the discrepancy of burial ability for pahs the pahs with higher hydrophobicity were more ready to be buried by both lake sediments and coastal marine sediments our study suggests that the burial ability of adoc by inland and coastal marine sediments will be reduced and their budget for carbon dioxide may be higher especially for the adoc with less hydrophobicity if eutrophication results in ecological regime shifts which may undermine the efforts to mitigate global warming considering the fact that huge amount of synthetic chemicals and hydrocarbons are emitted to the environment and inland lakes and coastal oceans are crucial sinks for them eqs 1 8 credit authorship contribution statement ning yu data curation formal analysis

groundwater were low median 33 8 μg l dissolved cr mainly existed in the species of cr vi average 90 deep groundwater with higher cr vi concentrations generally had higher ph eh and do than shallow groundwater indicating that the high cr vi groundwater existed in relatively oxic environment cretaceous sandstones in deep aquifers had anomalously high contents of total cr average 115 mg kg where cr was mainly present in silicates bound form and secondly in strongly adsorbed form there were positive correlations between mn and cr in the unweathered silicate bound form and adsorbed form which were conducive to cr iii oxidation into cr vi in an alkaline oxic environment the different ionic ratios i e ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 also supported silicate weathering as the dominant rock water interactions in the deep groundwater which enhanced the release of the unweathered silicate bound cr relatively high ph and ionic strength mobilized the adsorbed cr vi into groundwater this investigation emphasizes the geological origin of high cr vi groundwater in deep sandstone aquifers containing mn oxides which deserves more concerns for the purpose of drinking water supply graphical

2020 cr iii is considered as a basic element in human nutrition while cr vi is regarded as a carcinogen and irritant which has mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on organisms ma et al 2021 unceta et al 2010 due to its strong solubility migration and toxicity cr vi is listed by epa as one of the 17 chemicals that pose a threat to human beings jobby et al 2018 and in the blacklist of pollutants with priority control by the ministry of ecological environment of china the who standard for total cr in drinking water is 50 μg l while the standard proposed by the chinese government is 50 μg l guo et al 2020 recent studies have shown that groundwater cr vi may be of geological origin in many parts of the world such as brazil bertolo et al 2011 china guo et al 2020 greece dermatas et al 2015 economou et al 2012 2017 kazakis et al 2015 tziritis et al 2012 italy apollaro et al 2011 lelli et at 2013 mexico armienta et al 1993 robles camacho and armienta 2000 and usa mills et al 2011 vengosh et al 2016 koilakos 2017 concluded that naturally high cr vi groundwater can occur in four geological environments arid alluvial basins evaporate basins chromite ore bodies and serpentinite ultramafic terrains hexavalent cr cr vi in natural groundwater mainly originated from cr iii oxidation lilli et al 2015 during which dissolved oxygen mn oxides and h2o2 can an intermediate phase associated with water formation under high h2 o2 conditions be oxidants namgung et al 2014 oze et al 2016 pan et al 2019 generally the dissolved oxygen in natural water is limited and its reaction kinetics for cr iii oxidation is very slow hausladen and fendorf 2017 at ph 9 cr iii oxidization by mn vi oxides is the only way to enrich cr vi in groundwater oze et al 2007 in addition serpentinization and h2o2 production can lead to oxidation of cr iii oze et al 2016 magnetite the product of serpentinization may help to catalyze the formation of h2o2 foustoukos et al 2011 which is a kinetically facile oxidant for chromite oxidation under alkaline conditions oze et al 2016 chromium in natural groundwater is usually closely related to cr bearing minerals in ultramafic and serpentine aquifers gonzalez et al 2005 the majority of cr iii containing minerals belongs to the cr spinel group fantoni et al 2002 morrison et al 2009 weathering and erosion of ultramafic rocks have also been identified as an important geochemical process of cr enrichment in shallow groundwater oze et al 2004 oze et al 2007 although high cr groundwater was mostly observed in shallow bedrock aquifers apollaro et al 2011 ball and izbicki 2004 stefánsson et al 2015 tiwari et al 2019 and shallow sedimentary aquifers chrysochoou et al 2016 dermatas et al 2015 mills et al 2011 morrison et al 2009 related to ultramafic and serpentine formations few were reported in deep aquifers gonzalez et al 2005 guo et al 2020 the genesis of high cr in deep groundwater from sandstone aquifers is poorly understood therefore more knowledge is required to proclaim the genesis distribution and source of dissolved cr and cr vi in deep aquifers especially sandstone aquifers the loess plateau lp in china is the most widely distributed and typical in the world which occupies 6 6 of the land area of p r china and supports 8 5 of the chinese population fu et al 2011 liang et al 2015 lv et al 2019 as a typical water limited area groundwater is an important water source for agricultural irrigation urbanization industrial production and ecological security and the only drinking water resource in lp li et al 2016 li and qian 2018 recently high cr groundwater was observed in deep sandstone aquifer of the lp area from northwestern shaanxi province in northwest china with cr concentrations up to 176 μg l he and wu 2018 wang et al 2021 however it is still unknown about the occurrence of cr vi and its mobilization mechanism in deep sandstone groundwater from the lp area therefore the main purposes of this investigation are to 1 decipher the spatial distribution characteristics of dissolved cr and cr vi in deep sandstone aquifers in the lp area 2 evaluate hydrogeochemical factors controlling cr vi concentrations in deep groundwater and 3 assess genesis mechanisms of high dissolved cr vi groundwater in deep sandstone aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in

the exposed strata in the study area primarily include the huanhe formation k1h and the luohe formation k1l of lower cretaceous the cenozoic neogene and the quaternary the aquifers in the area are composed of quaternary aquifer the huanhe formation k1h aquifer and the luohe formation k1l aquifer of lower cretaceous with the anding formation of jurassic j2a as the impermeable aquiclude underlying the cenozoic neogene between quaternary aquifer and the huanhe formation aquifer is mainly composed of clay layer which is considered as an upper aquiclude for the huanhe aquifer fig s1 the thickness of the quaternary ranges from 60 to160 m being mainly composed of clayey loess sandy silt and silty fine sand the huanhe formation is the prime aquifer in the study area with the thickness from 340 to 600 m being composed of fine sandstone siltstone and argillaceous siltstone the bedrock pores and fissures of the huanhe formation provide the major space for the occurrence of groundwater

supply layer in the study area han et al 2020 he and wu 2018 li et al 2004 li et al 2020 quaternary phreatic water is primarily recharged by atmospheric precipitation due to poor runoff conditions the groundwater flow direction is consistent with the slope direction of the terrain moving slowly from south to north in addition to the discharge to rivers and water catchment depressions shallow groundwater was mainly discharged by evaporation and artificial extraction for agricultural irrigation cretaceous confined groundwater underlying the cenozoic neogene as an upper aquiclude is hosted in fine sandstone aquifers which is recharged mainly by atmospheric precipitation in the areas with outcrops of bare bedrock and discharged by rivers and artificial extraction for agricultural irrigation cretaceous groundwater generally flows from south to north being consistent with the flow of quaternary phreatic water the groundwater systems were divided into shallow and deep groundwater according to regional geological and hydrogeological settings and field drilling logging data shallow groundwater mainly hosted in quaternary aquifer occurs at depths less than 100 m below land

drilling process continuous core sampling was performed and two hundred and sixty five sediment samples were collected the sediment samples of the lower cretaceous the cenozoic neogene and the quaternary were usually collected at intervals of 3 3 and 5 m respectively when lithological conditions changed additional samples of different lithological characteristics were collected after taken

however so4 2 was the most abundant major anion in deep groundwater 17 5 to 1280 mg l median 317 mg l followed by hco3 147 to 627 mg l with a median of 379 mg l cl 8 39 to 1320 mg l with a median of 164 mg l and no3 1 57 to 378 mg l with a median of 88 6 mg l shallow groundwater samples were predominantly of na hco3 and ca mg hco3 types whereas deep groundwater was predominantly of na mg hco3 so4 and na mg so4 cl types fig 3 so4 2 concentrations in the deep groundwater are proportional to the concentrations of cations fig 3 deep groundwater samples generally had mg2 so4 2 ratios around 1 fig s3a na so4 2 ratios greater than 2 fig s3b and cl so4 2 ratios around 1 fig s3c both shallow and deep groundwater had high no3 concentrations median 86 8 mg l and 88 6 mg l respectively among 55 deep groundwater samples 44 samples had no3 concentrations 50 mg l which is the acceptable limit set by the who wang et al 2021 nitrate concentrations in around 64 and 80 shallow and deep groundwater samples exceeded this acceptable limit 3 3 chromium in groundwater concentrations of total chromium cr t in groundwater were significantly higher than those in surface water p 0 01 cr t concentrations of shallow and deep groundwater samples ranged from 2 14 to 85 1 μg l median 18 3 μg l and from 2 34 to 387 μg l median 143 μg l respectively of eleven shallow groundwater samples four samples had cr t concentrations higher than who drinking water guideline standard 50 μg l wang et al 2021 the deep groundwater samples with cr t concentrations 50 μg l accounted for 87 3 generally the cr t concentrations of deep groundwater samples were higher than those of shallow groundwater samples fig 4 high cr t groundwaters were mainly distributed in the river valleys between the mountains with relatively low altitudes fig s4 groundwater cr mostly existed in the species of dissolved cr vi although both shallow groundwater and deep one had high cr vi concentrations 50 μg l relatively lower cr vi concentrations were observed in shallow groundwater from 0 05 to 76 9 μg l median 14 9 μg l than those in deep groundwater from 0 05 to 365 μg l median 135 μg l fig s5 in shallow and deep groundwater the proportion of cr vi to total cr was from 50 4 to 95 6 and from 72 4 to 99 9 respectively which is consistent with the results of the thiva basin in greece panagiotakis et al 2015 the spatial distributions of groundwater cr vi were basically consistent with those of cr t figs s4 s6 the high cr vi concentrations were primarily distributed in groundwater from intermountain valleys among the studied groundwater there were 87 3 and 18 2 of deep and shallow groundwater samples with cr vi concentrations greater than the chinese drinking water guideline 50 μg l ministry of health of pr china 2006 98 2 and 81 8 of deep and shallow groundwater samples exceeding the italian drinking water guideline for cr vi 5 μg l chrysochoou et al 2016 respectively according to the drinking water guideline for cr vi in california 10 μg l kaprara et al 2015 there were 98 2 and 63 6 of deep and shallow groundwater exceeding the guideline respectively concentrations of cr t and cr vi in surface water samples were much lower in relative to groundwater samples fig 4 no obvious source of cr pollution was observed in the study area li et al 2004 dissolved fe and mn concentrations in groundwater were low ranging from 0 1 to 110 μg l median 13 4 μg l and from 0 23 to 147 μg l median 1 6 μg l respectively fig 4 the dissolved fe and mn concentrations were not statistically different between shallow and deep groundwater p 0 25 and p 0 72 respectively 3 4 oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope groundwater had δ18o range between 13 3 and 4 81 and δd between 97 3 and 47 4 the δ18o and δd were located near the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 5 33 δ18o 11 74 he et al 2018 and global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 fig 5 showing that precipitation was the main source of groundwater recharge in the area δ18o and δd in shallow groundwater δ18o from 11 2 to 7 39 median 9 52 δd from 85 6 to 47 4 median 73 7 were higher than those in deep groundwater δ18o from 13 3 to 4 81 median 10 2 δd between 97 3 and 53 2 median 79 the results show that the evaporation intensity of shallow groundwater was greater than that of deep groundwater the points of intersection between regression line of shallow groundwater δ18o and δd and the lmwl and between regression line of deep groundwater δ18o and δd and the lmwl were at δ18o 6 01 and δd 43 8 and δ18o 30 4 and δd 174 respectively showing that deep groundwater was replenished from higher altitude and or higher latitude compared to shallow groundwater guo et al 2014 wang et al 2018 3 5 sediment geochemistry the borehole dbzk exposed geological strata of cretaceous k neogene n and quaternary q cretaceous strata include huanhe formation k1h and luohe formation k1l the luohe formation k1l is present at depths below 592 m bls with the lithology of brick red loose medium fine sandstone the huanhe formation k1h occurs at depths from 155 to 592 m bls with the lithology of brown red gray sandstone with mudstone argillaceous siltstone and argillaceous sandstone neogene strata as an aquiclude are located at depths from 95 to 155 m bls with the lithology of red brown mudstone the quaternary overlies on neogene strata with the lithology of brown yellow gray yellow loess and at the depth above 95 m bls the xrf results show that the sediments of dbzk had total cr contents from 17 to 325 mg kg average 115 mg kg the sandstone had the highest cr content 325 mg kg at the depth of 217 5 m bls a slight decreasing trend was observed in cr content along the depth and cr contents of the sediment samples were mostly above the global sandstone average 35 mg kg kazakis et al 2015 fig s7 total fe and mn contents in sediments ranged from 0 83 to 7 62 mean 3 29 and from 168 to 1340 mg kg mean 515 mg kg respectively chromium was expected to mainly occur as unweathered silicate bound cr form vi and strongly adsorbed cr form ii sequential extraction results showed that the contents of cr in form vi ranged between 17 2 and 65 8 mg kg with the highest at a depth of 341 m bls chromium in form ii ranged from 17 6 to 172 mg kg with the highest at a depth of 314 m bls the contents of cr in form i 0 44 to 3 95 mg kg form iii 3 56 to 86 2 mg kg form iv 1 22 to 19 1 mg kg form v 2 11 to 18 7 mg kg and form vii 10 2 to 16 6 mg kg were much lower than those in forms vi and ii fig 6 in terms of mn the strongly adsorbed form form ii had the highest proportion between 11 2 and 59 4 median 32 9 followed by forms iii and vi fig s8 the unweathered silicate bound fe form vi was the major fe form in sediments with the relative contents between 18 3 and 72 6 median 51 5 fig s9 there were positive correlations between cr and mn r 0 873 p 0 05 and between cr and fe r 0 877 p 0 05 in form vi manganese oxide extraction results showed that the mn contents in the form of mn oxides mn mno2 ranged from 45 6 to 1060 mg kg median 216 mg kg there were relatively higher contents of mn oxides in the lower cretaceous sandstone than shallow loess and clay above 150 m bls which however fluctuated greatly fig s10a total cr vi contents in sediments ranged from 463 to 5100 μg kg median 860 μg kg contents of soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi were only detected in a few sediments from deep aquifer which ranged between 0 1 and 24 3 μg kg and 0 24 to 3 15 μg kg respectively fig s10b c 4 discussion 4 1 sources of groundwater cr dissolved cr in studied groundwater would be sourced from aquifer solids high cr groundwater was generally hosted in deep aquifers with high total cr contents total cr contents in deep cretaceous aquifer sandstones were significantly higher median 108 mg kg than the global average of sandstone 35 mg kg and were commonly below those in aquifers from anthemountas river basin in greece 115 959 mg kg kazakis et al 2015 from sacramento valley california in usa 140 2220 mg kg mills et al 2011 and from cecina coastal area italy 1435 2700 mg kg lelli et al 2013 but similar to those from aromas red sands aquifer california of usa 37 130 mg kg gonzalez et al 2005 and from bauru basin brazil 129 336 mg kg bertolo et al 2011 hosting high cr groundwater it is possible that the source of dissolved cr in groundwater in the study area came from cretaceous sandstones sequential extraction results showed that the major cr forms in deep aquifer sediments were unweathered silicate bound form and strongly adsorbed form accounting for 9 44 to 52 2 median 30 8 and 13 1 to 74 9 median 27 8 of total cr content respectively in addition total cr vi in deep aquifer solids ranged from 463 to 5100 μg kg median 848 μg kg although soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi were mostly below the detection limits in shallow aquifer solids 0 1 μg kg a few deep aquifer solids had contents of soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi from 0 1 to 24 3 μg kg and 0 24 to 3 15 μg kg respectively therefore soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi would be the direct source of groundwater cr vi in the studied area high cr concentrations were mainly observed in deep groundwater but concentrations of cr in surface water were very low median 2 41 μg l also indicating that the deep groundwater was unlikely to be polluted by anthropogenic input from surface water cr recent studies have shown that the direct recharge rates in the lp was around tens of millimeters per year currell et al 2012 and the deep groundwater was tens of thousands of years old neighboring the study area ling et al 2021 also supporting the conclusion that the cr in deep groundwater was from natural sources in the aquifers chromium sourced from aquifer solids was accumulated in deep groundwater during a long period of water rock interaction high cr vi concentration 50 μg l groundwater had low δ18o and δd and cr vi concentration in groundwater was negatively correlated with δ18o and δd fig 7 a b it indicates that high cr groundwater in deep aquifers may be supplied from higher altitude areas which experienced a long term of water rock interaction the enhanced water rock interactions increased the naturally high concentrations of potentially toxic elements in groundwater sacchi et al 2021 recent studies have shown that water rock interaction caused mobilization of cr in the ultramafic rock related aquifers apollaarp et al 2011 pyrgaki et al 2021 sequential extraction analyses showed that contents of loosely adsorbed cr were averagely 1 25 mg kg fig 6 which would be released into groundwater during the long term water rock interaction considering the average density 2 6 g cm3 and porosity 28 of the aquifer sandstones the theoretical cr concentrations in deep groundwater would reach 11 0 mg l in case that the loosely adsorbed cr were completely released into groundwater which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the observed results 4 2 genesis of cr vi groundwater cr vi would be of geogenic origin in the study area as shown above averagely more than 90 of cr were present as cr vi in groundwater the significant correlation between cr and cr vi r 0 997 p 0 01 suggested that the source of groundwater cr vi should be the same as groundwater cr which were most likely geogenic this is in line with others observed in california in usa morrison et al 2015 thiva basin in greece tziritis et al 2012 sali river basin in argentina nicolli et al 2012 and baiyangdian in china guo et al 2020 where cr vi concentrations were up to 172 μg l 220 μg l 250 μg l and 86 μg l respectively groundwater cr vi in aquifers mainly originated from the oxidation of cr iii in solids cr vi was positively correlated with do r 0 547 p 0 01 and eh r 0 284 p 0 05 fig 7c d they indicate that high do and eh promoted the oxidation of cr iii zhang and lin 2020 zhao et al 2020 although the do in natural groundwater is limited and reaction kinetics of cr iii oxidation by do is very low in some special environments i e high ph and aerobic groundwater with a long residence time cr vi mainly resulted from the oxidation of cr iii by do manning et al 2015 manganese oxides were the main oxidant for cr iii oxidation in the aquifers the mn oxide contents in aquifer sediments ranged from 45 6 to 1060 mg kg median 207 mg kg manganese oxide contents in deep aquifer sediments were generally higher than those in shallow sediments fig s10a which would play an essential role in formation of groundwater cr vi becquer et al 2003 coyte et al 2020 guo et al 2020 panagiotakis et al 2015 high contents of cr and mn in the strongly adsorbed form and unweathered silicate bound form especially in deep cretaceous sandstone fig 6 and fig s8 also support this observation mn oxides would closely contact with cr iii due to weathering of silicates and cr iii adsorption this proximity is favorable for cr iii oxidation into cr vi with mn oxides as the oxidant hausladen and fendorf 2017 garnier et al 2013 guo et al 2020 pan et al 2019 moreover mn ii formed during cr iii oxidation can be quickly converted into mno2 in the presence of dissolved oxygen murray and tebo 2007 this may explain the low concentrations of dissolved mn observed in the high cr groundwater average 9 17 μg l other studies also showed that under natural conditions mn oxides would rapidly and readily oxidize cr iii to cr vi oze et al 2007 namgung et al 2014 the hypothesis that silicate weathering played a key role in genesis of high cr vi groundwater was also supported by the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 fig 8 a in this plot all samples were located below the 1 1 line showing that weathering of silicates was the dominant process including sodium silicate asbestos quartz and feldspar sunkari et al 2021 in the scatter plot of na k and cl fig 8b samples mostly fell above the 1 1 line indicating that na and k may come from silicate weathering wang et al 2021 4 3 factors influencing cr vi concentrations in groundwater after oxidation of cr iii into cr vi cr vi would be mobilized into groundwater under preferable environmental conditions high ph was conducive to cr vi desorption from aquifer solids into groundwater fig 9 a shows that the groundwater occurred under weakly alkaline environments and higher cr vi groundwater generally had higher ph values median 7 8 the high ph environment reduces the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto aquifer minerals enhances the mobility of cr vi and promotes the release of cr vi from the solids into groundwater dias ferreira et al 2015 dong et al 2009 in addition the increase of ph is beneficial for the transformation of cr iii to cr vi panagiotakis et al 2015 which is more mobile than cr iii roestorff and chirwa 2019 therefore high ph was the primary factor contributing to the enrichment of cr vi in deep groundwater the high ionic strength is promoted mobility of cr vi in the deep aquifers in the study area groundwater is between 7 0 and 98 2 mmol l was positively correlated with cr vi r 0 301 p 0 05 fig 9b it indicates that the increase in groundwater is may increase desorption of cr vi this is in line with observation by bertolo et al 2011 showing that desorption of cr occurred under the conditions with high is among the main anions so4 2 were positively correlated with cr vi r 0 409 p 0 01 fig 9c cr vi mainly exists in the form of oxyanion cro4 2 under neutral weakly alkaline conditions which has similar chemical structures and dissociation constant with so4 2 punia et al 2021 therefore so4 2 would compete with cr vi for the adsorption sites on solid surfaces and promote desorption of cr vi into groundwater izbicki et al 2015 therefore so4 2 would be the main anion that caused desorption of cr vi in studied deep aquifer 5 conclusion the studied groundwater was neutral to weakly alkaline under oxic conditions in comparison with shallow groundwater deep groundwater had higher ph eh and do values shallow groundwater samples were predominantly of na hco3 and ca mg hco3 types whereas deep ones were mainly of na hco3 and na so4 types groundwater cr occurred predominantly as cr vi averagely 90 with concentrations up to 365 μg l the concentrations of both total cr and cr vi in deep groundwater were higher than those in shallow groundwater the higher cr concentrations were associated with higher ph do eh ionic strength and higher concentration of so4 2 groundwater cr was originated from aquifer sediments abnormal high contents of total cr in deep aquifer sandstones with an average of 115 mg kg which were mostly above the global sandstone average manganese oxides were the main oxidant for cr iii oxidation into cr vi in the aquifers the predominant cr form in deep aquifer sediments was unweathered silicate bound cr accounting for 9 44 to 52 2 median 30 6 of total cr contents followed by strongly adsorbed form accounting for 13 1 to 74 9 contents of mn in the unweathered silicate bound form and strongly adsorbed form were also high in deep aquifer solids which were positively correlated with cr contents in the related forms once silicates in sandstones with the high contents of cr and mn in unweathered silicate bound form are weathered the close contact between cr iii and mn oxides would be conducive to the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi the higher ph and ionic strength in deep groundwater would cause the desorption of cr vi from adsorbed forms and lead to enrichment of cr vi in groundwater if all adsorbed cr form is mobilized via desorption cr concentrations in groundwater would be increased by one order of magnitude declaration of

16107,hexavalent chromium cr vi groundwater usually exists in shallow aquifers related to ultramafic and serpentine formations but knowledge of the genesis of dissolved cr vi in deep sandstone aquifers is limited both groundwater and aquifer sediments were taken from the jingbian county in the loess plateau of northwestern shaanxi to investigate distribution and genesis mechanism of high cr vi groundwater in deep sandstone aquifers results showed that the cr concentrations median 142 μg l in groundwater from deep aquifers 100 m were relatively high while the cr concentrations in shallow groundwater were low median 33 8 μg l dissolved cr mainly existed in the species of cr vi average 90 deep groundwater with higher cr vi concentrations generally had higher ph eh and do than shallow groundwater indicating that the high cr vi groundwater existed in relatively oxic environment cretaceous sandstones in deep aquifers had anomalously high contents of total cr average 115 mg kg where cr was mainly present in silicates bound form and secondly in strongly adsorbed form there were positive correlations between mn and cr in the unweathered silicate bound form and adsorbed form which were conducive to cr iii oxidation into cr vi in an alkaline oxic environment the different ionic ratios i e ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 also supported silicate weathering as the dominant rock water interactions in the deep groundwater which enhanced the release of the unweathered silicate bound cr relatively high ph and ionic strength mobilized the adsorbed cr vi into groundwater this investigation emphasizes the geological origin of high cr vi groundwater in deep sandstone aquifers containing mn oxides which deserves more concerns for the purpose of drinking water supply graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chromium groundwater enrichment geogenic hydrogeochemistry 1 introduction chromium cr being widely distributed in the earth crust is one of the most abundant heavy metals with content of about 100 mg kg kazakis et al 2018 the cr content of solids varies greatly with type and properties of rocks or sediments low contents of cr usually occur in limestone average 11 mg kg granites average 22 mg kg and sandstones average 35 mg kg fantoni et al 2002 kazakis et al 2015 but high contents of cr generally exist in ultramafic rocks average 2400 mg kg particularly in serpentinites of ophiolitic complexes oze et al 2004 chromium occurs in two oxidation states in natural waters trivalent cr cr iii and hexavalent cr cr vi coyte et al 2020 he et al 2020 cr iii is considered as a basic element in human nutrition while cr vi is regarded as a carcinogen and irritant which has mutagenic and carcinogenic effects on organisms ma et al 2021 unceta et al 2010 due to its strong solubility migration and toxicity cr vi is listed by epa as one of the 17 chemicals that pose a threat to human beings jobby et al 2018 and in the blacklist of pollutants with priority control by the ministry of ecological environment of china the who standard for total cr in drinking water is 50 μg l while the standard proposed by the chinese government is 50 μg l guo et al 2020 recent studies have shown that groundwater cr vi may be of geological origin in many parts of the world such as brazil bertolo et al 2011 china guo et al 2020 greece dermatas et al 2015 economou et al 2012 2017 kazakis et al 2015 tziritis et al 2012 italy apollaro et al 2011 lelli et at 2013 mexico armienta et al 1993 robles camacho and armienta 2000 and usa mills et al 2011 vengosh et al 2016 koilakos 2017 concluded that naturally high cr vi groundwater can occur in four geological environments arid alluvial basins evaporate basins chromite ore bodies and serpentinite ultramafic terrains hexavalent cr cr vi in natural groundwater mainly originated from cr iii oxidation lilli et al 2015 during which dissolved oxygen mn oxides and h2o2 can an intermediate phase associated with water formation under high h2 o2 conditions be oxidants namgung et al 2014 oze et al 2016 pan et al 2019 generally the dissolved oxygen in natural water is limited and its reaction kinetics for cr iii oxidation is very slow hausladen and fendorf 2017 at ph 9 cr iii oxidization by mn vi oxides is the only way to enrich cr vi in groundwater oze et al 2007 in addition serpentinization and h2o2 production can lead to oxidation of cr iii oze et al 2016 magnetite the product of serpentinization may help to catalyze the formation of h2o2 foustoukos et al 2011 which is a kinetically facile oxidant for chromite oxidation under alkaline conditions oze et al 2016 chromium in natural groundwater is usually closely related to cr bearing minerals in ultramafic and serpentine aquifers gonzalez et al 2005 the majority of cr iii containing minerals belongs to the cr spinel group fantoni et al 2002 morrison et al 2009 weathering and erosion of ultramafic rocks have also been identified as an important geochemical process of cr enrichment in shallow groundwater oze et al 2004 oze et al 2007 although high cr groundwater was mostly observed in shallow bedrock aquifers apollaro et al 2011 ball and izbicki 2004 stefánsson et al 2015 tiwari et al 2019 and shallow sedimentary aquifers chrysochoou et al 2016 dermatas et al 2015 mills et al 2011 morrison et al 2009 related to ultramafic and serpentine formations few were reported in deep aquifers gonzalez et al 2005 guo et al 2020 the genesis of high cr in deep groundwater from sandstone aquifers is poorly understood therefore more knowledge is required to proclaim the genesis distribution and source of dissolved cr and cr vi in deep aquifers especially sandstone aquifers the loess plateau lp in china is the most widely distributed and typical in the world which occupies 6 6 of the land area of p r china and supports 8 5 of the chinese population fu et al 2011 liang et al 2015 lv et al 2019 as a typical water limited area groundwater is an important water source for agricultural irrigation urbanization industrial production and ecological security and the only drinking water resource in lp li et al 2016 li and qian 2018 recently high cr groundwater was observed in deep sandstone aquifer of the lp area from northwestern shaanxi province in northwest china with cr concentrations up to 176 μg l he and wu 2018 wang et al 2021 however it is still unknown about the occurrence of cr vi and its mobilization mechanism in deep sandstone groundwater from the lp area therefore the main purposes of this investigation are to 1 decipher the spatial distribution characteristics of dissolved cr and cr vi in deep sandstone aquifers in the lp area 2 evaluate hydrogeochemical factors controlling cr vi concentrations in deep groundwater and 3 assess genesis mechanisms of high dissolved cr vi groundwater in deep sandstone aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in

supply layer in the study area han et al 2020 he and wu 2018 li et al 2004 li et al 2020 quaternary phreatic water is primarily recharged by atmospheric precipitation due to poor runoff conditions the groundwater flow direction is consistent with the slope direction of the terrain moving slowly from south to north in addition to the discharge to rivers and water catchment depressions shallow groundwater was mainly discharged by evaporation and artificial extraction for agricultural irrigation cretaceous confined groundwater underlying the cenozoic neogene as an upper aquiclude is hosted in fine sandstone aquifers which is recharged mainly by atmospheric precipitation in the areas with outcrops of bare bedrock and discharged by rivers and artificial extraction for agricultural irrigation cretaceous groundwater generally flows from south to north being consistent with the flow of quaternary phreatic water the groundwater systems were divided into shallow and deep groundwater

between 234 to 368 mv median 344 mv respectively eh and do of deep groundwater were slightly higher than those of shallow groundwater fig s2 showing that deep groundwater occurred in more oxic conditions than shallow groundwater 3 2 major ions in groundwater sodium was the most abundant major cation the na concentrations of shallow and deep groundwater samples ranged between 22 2 and 253 mg

however so4 2 was the most abundant major anion in deep groundwater 17 5 to 1280 mg l median 317 mg l followed by hco3 147 to 627 mg l with a median of 379 mg l cl 8 39 to 1320 mg l with a median of 164 mg l and no3 1 57 to 378 mg l with a median of 88 6 mg l shallow groundwater samples were predominantly of na hco3 and ca mg hco3 types whereas deep groundwater was predominantly of na mg hco3 so4 and na mg so4 cl types fig 3 so4 2 concentrations in the deep groundwater are proportional to the concentrations of cations fig 3 deep groundwater samples generally had mg2 so4 2 ratios around 1 fig s3a na so4 2 ratios greater than 2 fig s3b and cl so4 2 ratios around 1 fig s3c both shallow and deep groundwater had high no3 concentrations median 86 8 mg l and 88 6 mg l respectively among 55 deep groundwater samples 44 samples had no3 concentrations 50 mg l which is the acceptable limit set by the who wang et al 2021 nitrate concentrations in around 64 and 80 shallow and deep groundwater samples exceeded this acceptable limit 3 3 chromium in groundwater concentrations of total chromium cr t in groundwater were significantly higher than those in surface water p 0 01 cr t concentrations of shallow and deep groundwater samples ranged from 2 14 to 85 1 μg l median 18 3 μg l and from 2 34 to 387 μg l median 143 μg l respectively of eleven shallow groundwater samples four samples had cr t concentrations higher than who drinking water guideline standard 50 μg l wang et al 2021 the deep groundwater samples with cr t concentrations 50 μg l accounted for 87 3 generally the cr t concentrations of deep groundwater samples were higher than those of shallow groundwater samples fig 4 high cr t groundwaters were mainly distributed in the river valleys between the mountains with relatively low altitudes fig s4 groundwater cr mostly existed in the species of dissolved cr vi although both shallow groundwater and deep one had high cr vi concentrations 50 μg l relatively lower cr vi concentrations were observed in shallow groundwater from 0 05 to 76 9 μg l median 14 9 μg l than those in deep groundwater from 0 05 to 365 μg l median 135 μg l fig s5 in shallow and deep groundwater the proportion of cr vi to total cr was from 50 4 to 95 6 and from 72 4 to 99 9 respectively which is consistent with the results of the thiva basin in greece panagiotakis et al 2015 the spatial distributions of groundwater cr vi were basically consistent with those of cr t figs s4 s6 the high cr vi concentrations were primarily distributed in groundwater from intermountain valleys among the studied groundwater there were 87 3 and 18 2 of deep and shallow groundwater samples with cr vi concentrations greater than the chinese drinking water guideline 50 μg l ministry of health of pr china 2006 98 2 and 81 8 of deep and shallow groundwater samples exceeding the italian drinking water guideline for cr vi 5 μg l chrysochoou et al 2016 respectively according to the drinking water guideline for cr vi in california 10 μg l kaprara et al 2015 there were 98 2 and 63 6 of deep and shallow groundwater exceeding the guideline respectively concentrations of cr t and cr vi in surface water samples were much lower in relative to groundwater samples fig 4 no obvious source of cr pollution was observed in the study area li et al 2004 dissolved fe and mn concentrations in groundwater were low ranging from 0 1 to 110 μg l median 13 4 μg l and from 0 23 to 147 μg l median 1 6 μg l respectively fig 4 the dissolved fe and mn concentrations were not statistically different between shallow and deep groundwater p 0 25 and p 0 72 respectively 3 4 oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope groundwater had δ18o range between 13 3 and 4 81 and δd between 97 3 and 47 4 the δ18o and δd were located near the local meteoric water line lmwl δd 5 33 δ18o 11 74 he et al 2018 and global meteoric water line gmwl δd 8 δ18o 10 fig 5 showing that precipitation was the main source of groundwater recharge in the area δ18o and δd in shallow groundwater δ18o from 11 2 to 7 39 median 9 52 δd from 85 6 to 47 4 median 73 7 were higher than those in deep groundwater δ18o from 13 3 to 4 81 median 10 2 δd between 97 3 and 53 2 median 79 the results show that the evaporation intensity of shallow groundwater was greater than that of deep groundwater the points of intersection between regression line of shallow groundwater δ18o and δd and the lmwl and between regression line of deep groundwater δ18o and δd and the lmwl were at δ18o 6 01 and δd 43 8 and δ18o 30 4 and δd 174 respectively showing that deep groundwater was replenished from higher altitude and or higher latitude compared to shallow groundwater guo et al 2014 wang et al 2018 3 5 sediment geochemistry the borehole dbzk exposed geological strata of cretaceous k neogene n and quaternary q cretaceous strata include huanhe formation k1h and luohe formation k1l the luohe formation k1l is present at depths below 592 m bls with the lithology of brick red loose medium fine sandstone the huanhe formation k1h occurs at depths from 155 to 592 m bls with the lithology of brown red gray sandstone with mudstone argillaceous siltstone and argillaceous sandstone neogene strata as an aquiclude are located at depths from 95 to 155 m bls with the lithology of red brown mudstone the quaternary overlies on neogene strata with the lithology of brown yellow gray yellow loess and at the depth above 95 m bls the xrf results show that the sediments of dbzk had total cr contents from 17 to 325 mg kg average 115 mg kg the sandstone had the highest cr content 325 mg kg at the depth of 217 5 m bls a slight decreasing trend was observed in cr content along the depth and cr contents of the sediment samples were mostly above the global sandstone average 35 mg kg kazakis et al 2015 fig s7 total fe and mn contents in sediments ranged from 0 83 to 7 62 mean 3 29 and from 168 to 1340 mg kg mean 515 mg kg respectively chromium was expected to mainly occur as unweathered silicate bound cr form vi and strongly adsorbed cr form ii sequential extraction results showed that the contents of cr in form vi ranged between 17 2 and 65 8 mg kg with the highest at a depth of 341 m bls chromium in form ii ranged from 17 6 to 172 mg kg with the highest at a depth of 314 m bls the contents of cr in form i 0 44 to 3 95 mg kg form iii 3 56 to 86 2 mg kg form iv 1 22 to 19 1 mg kg form v 2 11 to 18 7 mg kg and form vii 10 2 to 16 6 mg kg were much lower than those in forms vi and ii fig 6 in terms of mn the strongly adsorbed form form ii had the highest proportion between 11 2 and 59 4 median 32 9 followed by forms iii and vi fig s8 the unweathered silicate bound fe form vi was the major fe form in sediments with the relative contents between 18 3 and 72 6 median 51 5 fig s9 there were positive correlations between cr and mn r 0 873 p 0 05 and between cr and fe r 0 877 p 0 05 in form vi manganese oxide extraction results showed that the mn contents in the form of mn oxides mn mno2 ranged from 45 6 to 1060 mg kg median 216 mg kg there were relatively higher contents of mn oxides in the lower cretaceous sandstone than shallow loess and clay above 150 m bls which however fluctuated greatly fig s10a total cr vi contents in sediments ranged from 463 to 5100 μg kg median 860 μg kg contents of soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi were only detected in a few sediments from deep aquifer which ranged between 0 1 and 24 3 μg kg and 0 24 to 3 15 μg kg respectively fig s10b c 4 discussion 4 1 sources of groundwater cr dissolved cr in studied groundwater would be sourced from aquifer solids high cr groundwater was generally hosted in deep aquifers with high total cr contents total cr contents in deep cretaceous aquifer sandstones were significantly higher median 108 mg kg than the global average of sandstone 35 mg kg and were commonly below those in aquifers from anthemountas river basin in greece 115 959 mg kg kazakis et al 2015 from sacramento valley california in usa 140 2220 mg kg mills et al 2011 and from cecina coastal area italy 1435 2700 mg kg lelli et al 2013 but similar to those from aromas red sands aquifer california of usa 37 130 mg kg gonzalez et al 2005 and from bauru basin brazil 129 336 mg kg bertolo et al 2011 hosting high cr groundwater it is possible that the source of dissolved cr in groundwater in the study area came from cretaceous sandstones sequential extraction results showed that the major cr forms in deep aquifer sediments were unweathered silicate bound form and strongly adsorbed form accounting for 9 44 to 52 2 median 30 8 and 13 1 to 74 9 median 27 8 of total cr content respectively in addition total cr vi in deep aquifer solids ranged from 463 to 5100 μg kg median 848 μg kg although soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi were mostly below the detection limits in shallow aquifer solids 0 1 μg kg a few deep aquifer solids had contents of soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi from 0 1 to 24 3 μg kg and 0 24 to 3 15 μg kg respectively therefore soluble cr vi and exchangeable cr vi would be the direct source of groundwater cr vi in the studied area high cr concentrations were mainly observed in deep groundwater but concentrations of cr in surface water were very low median 2 41 μg l also indicating that the deep groundwater was unlikely to be polluted by anthropogenic input from surface water cr recent studies have shown that the direct recharge rates in the lp was around tens of millimeters per year currell et al 2012 and the deep groundwater was tens of thousands of years old neighboring the study area ling et al 2021 also supporting the conclusion that the cr in deep groundwater was from natural sources in the aquifers chromium sourced from aquifer solids was accumulated in deep groundwater during a long period of water rock interaction high cr vi concentration 50 μg l groundwater had low δ18o and δd and cr vi concentration in groundwater was negatively correlated with δ18o and δd fig 7 a b it indicates that high cr groundwater in deep aquifers may be supplied from higher altitude areas which experienced a long term of water rock interaction the enhanced water rock interactions increased the naturally high concentrations of potentially toxic elements in groundwater sacchi et al 2021 recent studies have shown that water rock interaction caused mobilization of cr in the ultramafic rock related aquifers apollaarp et al 2011 pyrgaki et al 2021 sequential extraction analyses showed that contents of loosely adsorbed cr were averagely 1 25 mg kg fig 6 which would be released into groundwater during the long term water rock interaction considering the average density 2 6 g cm3 and porosity 28 of the aquifer sandstones the theoretical cr concentrations in deep groundwater would reach 11 0 mg l in case that the loosely adsorbed cr were completely released into groundwater which is one to two orders of magnitude higher than the observed results 4 2 genesis of cr vi groundwater cr vi would be of geogenic origin in the study area as shown above averagely more than 90 of cr were present as cr vi in groundwater the significant correlation between cr and cr vi r 0 997 p 0 01 suggested that the source of groundwater cr vi should be the same as groundwater cr which were most likely geogenic this is in line with others observed in california in usa morrison et al 2015 thiva basin in greece tziritis et al 2012 sali river basin in argentina nicolli et al 2012 and baiyangdian in china guo et al 2020 where cr vi concentrations were up to 172 μg l 220 μg l 250 μg l and 86 μg l respectively groundwater cr vi in aquifers mainly originated from the oxidation of cr iii in solids cr vi was positively correlated with do r 0 547 p 0 01 and eh r 0 284 p 0 05 fig 7c d they indicate that high do and eh promoted the oxidation of cr iii zhang and lin 2020 zhao et al 2020 although the do in natural groundwater is limited and reaction kinetics of cr iii oxidation by do is very low in some special environments i e high ph and aerobic groundwater with a long residence time cr vi mainly resulted from the oxidation of cr iii by do manning et al 2015 manganese oxides were the main oxidant for cr iii oxidation in the aquifers the mn oxide contents in aquifer sediments ranged from 45 6 to 1060 mg kg median 207 mg kg manganese oxide contents in deep aquifer sediments were generally higher than those in shallow sediments fig s10a which would play an essential role in formation of groundwater cr vi becquer et al 2003 coyte et al 2020 guo et al 2020 panagiotakis et al 2015 high contents of cr and mn in the strongly adsorbed form and unweathered silicate bound form especially in deep cretaceous sandstone fig 6 and fig s8 also support this observation mn oxides would closely contact with cr iii due to weathering of silicates and cr iii adsorption this proximity is favorable for cr iii oxidation into cr vi with mn oxides as the oxidant hausladen and fendorf 2017 garnier et al 2013 guo et al 2020 pan et al 2019 moreover mn ii formed during cr iii oxidation can be quickly converted into mno2 in the presence of dissolved oxygen murray and tebo 2007 this may explain the low concentrations of dissolved mn observed in the high cr groundwater average 9 17 μg l other studies also showed that under natural conditions mn oxides would rapidly and readily oxidize cr iii to cr vi oze et al 2007 namgung et al 2014 the hypothesis that silicate weathering played a key role in genesis of high cr vi groundwater was also supported by the scatter plot of ca2 mg2 and hco3 so4 2 fig 8 a in this plot all samples were located below the 1 1 line showing that weathering of silicates was the dominant process including sodium silicate asbestos quartz and feldspar sunkari et al 2021 in the scatter plot of na k and cl fig 8b samples mostly fell above the 1 1 line indicating that na and k may come from silicate weathering wang et al 2021 4 3 factors influencing cr vi concentrations in groundwater after oxidation of cr iii into cr vi cr vi would be mobilized into groundwater under preferable environmental conditions high ph was conducive to cr vi desorption from aquifer solids into groundwater fig 9 a shows that the groundwater occurred under weakly alkaline environments and higher cr vi groundwater generally had higher ph values median 7 8 the high ph environment reduces the adsorption capacity of cr vi onto aquifer minerals enhances the mobility of cr vi and promotes the release of cr vi from the solids into groundwater dias ferreira et al 2015 dong et al 2009 in addition the increase of ph is beneficial for the transformation of cr iii to cr vi panagiotakis et al 2015 which is more mobile than cr iii roestorff and chirwa 2019 therefore high ph was the primary factor contributing to the enrichment of cr vi in deep groundwater the high ionic strength is promoted mobility of cr vi in the deep aquifers in the study area groundwater is between 7 0 and 98 2 mmol l was positively correlated with cr vi r 0 301 p 0 05 fig 9b it indicates that the increase in groundwater is may increase desorption of cr vi this is in line with observation by bertolo et al 2011 showing that desorption of cr occurred under the conditions with high is among the main anions so4 2 were positively correlated with cr vi r 0 409 p 0 01 fig 9c cr vi mainly exists in the form of oxyanion cro4 2 under neutral weakly alkaline conditions which has similar chemical structures and dissociation constant with so4 2 punia et al 2021 therefore so4 2 would compete with cr vi for the adsorption sites on solid surfaces and promote desorption of cr vi into groundwater izbicki et al 2015 therefore so4 2 would be the main anion that caused desorption of cr vi in studied deep aquifer 5 conclusion the studied groundwater was neutral to weakly alkaline under oxic conditions in comparison with shallow groundwater deep groundwater had higher ph eh and do values shallow groundwater samples were predominantly of na hco3 and ca mg hco3 types whereas deep ones were mainly of na hco3 and na so4 types groundwater cr occurred predominantly as cr vi averagely 90 with concentrations up to 365 μg l the concentrations of both total cr and cr vi in deep groundwater were higher than those in shallow groundwater the higher cr concentrations were associated with higher ph do eh ionic strength and higher concentration of so4 2 groundwater cr was originated from aquifer sediments abnormal high contents of total cr in deep aquifer sandstones with an average of 115 mg kg which were mostly above the global sandstone average manganese oxides were the main oxidant for cr iii oxidation into cr vi in the aquifers the predominant cr form in deep aquifer sediments was unweathered silicate bound cr accounting for 9 44 to 52 2 median 30 6 of total cr contents followed by strongly adsorbed form accounting for 13 1 to 74 9 contents of mn in the unweathered silicate bound form and strongly adsorbed form were also high in deep aquifer solids which were positively correlated with cr contents in the related forms once silicates in sandstones with the high contents of cr and mn in unweathered silicate bound form are weathered the close contact between cr iii and mn oxides would be conducive to the oxidation of cr iii to cr vi the higher ph and ionic strength in deep groundwater would cause the desorption of cr vi from adsorbed forms and lead to enrichment of cr vi in groundwater if all adsorbed cr form is mobilized via desorption cr concentrations in groundwater would be increased by one order of magnitude declaration of

16108,shallow lakes provide essential ecological and environmental services but are exposed to multiple stressors including agricultural runoff aro and climate warming which may act on different target receptors disrupting their normal functioning we performed a microcosm experiment to determine the individual and combined effects of three stressors pesticides nitrate and climate warming on two trophic levels representative of communities found in shallow lakes we used three submerged macrophyte species myriophyllum spicatum potamogeton perfoliatus elodea nuttallii eight benthic or pelagic microalgal species and three primary consumer species daphnia magna lymnaea stagnalis dreissena polymorpha with different feeding preferences for benthic and pelagic primary producers eight different treatments consisted of a control only nitrate a pesticide cocktail and a combination of nitrate and pesticides representing aro each replicated at ambient temperature and 3 5 c mimicking climate warming pesticides negatively affected all functional groups except phytoplankton which increased warming and nitrate modified these effects strong but opposite pesticide and warming effects on myriophyllum drove the response of the total macrophyte biomass nitrate significantly suppressed myriophyllum final biomass but not overall macrophyte and microalgal biomass nitrate and pesticides in combination caused a macrophyte decline and the system tipped towards phytoplankton dominance strong synergistic or even reversed stressor interaction effects were observed for macrophytes or periphyton we emphasize the need for more complex community and ecosystem level studies incorporating multiple stressor scenarios to define safe operating spaces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agricultural runoff benthic pelagic coupling microcosm multiple stressors regime shifts stressor interactions 1 introduction multiple stressors affecting aquatic systems do not spare shallow lakes the most abundant type of freshwater systems worldwide meerhoff and jeppesen 2009 these lakes including fishless water bodies such as kettle holes and peatland ditches are common in agricultural landscapes and are hubs of biodiversity pätzig et al 2012 peeters 2005 whatley et al 2014 typical lakes may exhibit either the more desirable clear water macrophyte dominated state providing a variety of ecosystem services or the degraded turbid phytoplankton dominated state janssen et al 2021 in addition periphyton shading on macrophytes can play an important role in the transition from the clear water to the turbid state phillips et al 1978 these state shifts have been largely ascribed to nutrient loading to aquatic systems which has significantly increased since the agricultural revolution moss et al 2013 yet the role of nitrogen in regime shifts has received less attention than phosphorus particularly due to the presence of nitrogen fixation as a compensation mechanism for nitrogen shortage moss et al 2013 schindler et al 2008 increasing nitrogen concentrations may lead to reduced macrophyte abundance and diversity due to phytoplankton shading moss 1976 phillips et al 2016 higher nitrogen concentrations are consistently measured close to agricultural sites 1 5 to 1 8 mg l 1 compared with non agricultural watersheds 1 0 mg l 1 xu et al 2014 actual nitrogen input concentrations may be masked by quick assimilation by phytoplankton or periphyton reduced macrophyte biomass and species richness as well as increased phytoplankton and chlorophyll a concentrations have been observed at nitrogen concentrations between 2 and 10 mg l 1 barker et al 2008 sagrario et al 2005 these shifts occurred irrespective of total phosphorus concentrations ranging between 0 03 and 1 2 mg l 1 sagrario et al 2005 high nitrogen loading can therefore increase phytoplankton and periphyton biomass in nitrogen limited or co limited lakes smith and lee 2006 zhang and mei 2013 nitrates are easily leached into groundwater or carried away in agricultural runoff aro in the following concentrations in shallow lakes may thus rise proportionally with increasing fertilizer applications underlining the need for nitrogen control around shallow lakes while alternative states are less common in smaller lakes such as ditches and kettle holes where macrophytes and periphyton are more abundant kazanjian et al 2018 they are still possible under high eutrophication whatley et al 2014 the primary source of nitrogen in these lakes is aro rücker et al 2019 which may also contain organic and inorganic pesticides global production and use of pesticides has risen significantly after the 1950s schäfer et al 2011 sharma et al 2019 pesticides varying in concentrations in aquatic systems based on rain events and surface or subsurface runoff graymore et al 2001 can directly affect all types of aquatic primary producers through e g inhibition of photosynthesis carotenoid biosynthesis or growth regulation mohaupt et al 2020 vonk and kraak 2020 they may also indirectly alter their development by affecting top down control cuenca cambronero et al 2018 macrophytes are affected directly by phytoplankton and periphyton shading and indirectly through top down control of microalgae by invertebrate grazers phillips et al 2016 zooplankton efficiently controls phytoplankton leading to high transparency in lakes lampert et al 1986 and invertebrate grazing on periphyton may alleviate shading on macrophytes jones et al 2003 pesticides may affect not only these primary consumers allen et al 2021 hanazato 2001 but also predators such as fish ali et al 2020 or other higher trophic levels if present depending on their modes of action pesticides may therefore alter macrophyte abundance directly or indirectly through trophic interactions yamamuro et al 2019 reducing the resilience of the system scheffer et al 1993 in addition to local chemical stressors shallow lakes are increasingly subjected to climate warming the international panel on climate change ipcc has projected a 4 c increase in global temperatures in its rcp 8 5 scenario ipcc 2014 such an increase may have negative effects for shallow lakes particularly in combination with chemical pollution entering these systems modelling studies propose that rising temperatures will cause an increase in phytoplankton biomass trolle et al 2014 yet warming may also reduce phytoplankton biomass due to enhanced grazing in fishless lakes hansson et al 2012 further filtering rates of daphnia key grazers in fishless ditches may be reduced at higher temperatures müller et al 2018 climate warming leading to increased nutrient release from sediments jeppesen et al 2009 or increased herbivory on macrophytes zhang et al 2019 may contribute to phytoplankton dominance and ultimately cause regime shifts in shallow eutrophic lakes scheffer 2001 these multiple stressors may affect shallow aquatic lakes in several ways nitrate or other nutrients could act antagonistic to pesticide effects e g dampening negative effects of herbicides on primary producers halstead et al 2014 dalton et al 2015 high nutrient availability for microalgae provide a better food quality for grazers guo et al 2016 but might interact with grazer sensitivity towards pesticides climate warming may further complicate the prediction of combined nitrate and pesticide effects the resilience of the clear water macrophyte dominated state may be reduced and tipping points for state shifts more easily reached scheffer et al 1993 as a result of the combined effects of multiple stressors nitrate pesticides and warming on community and ecosystem processes in shallow lakes or fishless ditches or kettle holes we combined this complex scenario in our microcosms to test the interactive effects of nitrate pesticides and warming on a benthic pelagic system whose respective response to the stressors can induce state shifts of the system to the best of our knowledge this type of complex integrative study including a top down consumer control of both phytoplankton and periphyton has not been performed before the objective of our study is to determine the individual and combined effects of nitrate pesticides and climate warming in microcosms using key functional groups representative of the first two trophic levels in shallow aquatic ecosystems the organisms we chose are used in normalized ecotoxicity assays oecd 2011 2012 2014 2016 to disentangle the nitrate pesticide and warming effects we exposed our microcosms to these stressors individually and in combination we hypothesized that 1 pesticides will affect the primary producers through effects on trophic interactions and 2 nitrate and warming will interact synergistically with pesticides to weaken macrophyte dominance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design to determine the individual and combined effects of nitrate

avoid size changes haney and hall 1973 and their length measured using a digital microscope vhx 6000 keyence bois colombes france length measures were converted into dry weight using the formula b 0

macrophytes were sampled cleaned and separated by species into aboveground and belowground parts the carbon content based on dry mass was measured in apical 10 cm shoot sections total carbon content of each species per microcosm was calculated from their respective aboveground biomass total macrophyte dry mass and carbon content reflect the sums for all three macrophyte species per microcosm 2 3

variance anova was applied using r r core team 2018 to test pest nitr tmp fixed factors and their interaction effects on all response factors a kruskal wallis test by ranks was performed for non parametric data the hedges g effect sizes and 90 confidence intervals ci were calculated based on hedges and olkin 1985 when the effect sizes were large 0 8 cohen 2013 and their cis did not touch the

considered to be additive synergistic antagonistic or reversed if they were similar to higher than lower than or opposite in direction to the calculated additions respectively respecting ci margins to analyse shifts in the relative dominance among the three macrophyte species and among the three primary producer groups a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed using the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 to visualize significant patterns in the variability of the final sampling data and to reduce the confounding influence of multiple highly correlated variables principal components analyses pca were performed using the vegan oksanen et al 2020 and factoextra packages kassambara and mundt 2020 to decipher direct and indirect stressor effects on the organisms as well as species interactions a path analysis subjected to structural equation modelling sem was created package sem fox et al 2021 using several hypothetical pathways similar to allen et al 2021 table s2 further details of statistical approaches are presented in the supplemental material 3 results the factorial design of our experiment allowed us to identify individual and combined effects of pesticides nitrate and warming in the different treatments con no3 pst aro on the development of the different functional groups and on water chemistry table s3 shows the statistical outputs of either three way anova kruskal wallis test by ranks and permanova supporting the following results 3 1 water analyses the average temperatures remained consistent throughout the experiment and measured 24 6

presented in the supplemental material high nitrate additions to the no3 and aro treatments were no longer measurable at the end of the experiment continuous fertilisation by nitrate and phosphate at a 16 1 µm ratio did not result in an accumulation of dissolved nutrients compared to initial values of the volvic water 1 71 mg l 1 n no3 0 176 mg l 1 p po4 remaining orthophosphate was lower in ambient treatments 58 36 µg l 1 compared with warm 119 97 µg l 1 and variable in the con and no3 treatments we observed strong tmp x pest interactions for p po4 and the np molar ratio fig s2b particulate phosphorus was low at the end of the experiment range 5 6 31 5 µg l 1 with significantly higher levels in the pst and aro treatments fig s2e pesticides were still present at the end of the experiment 30 78 see supplementary s3 1 except for terbuthylazine which was not found in any of the samples 3 2 response of primary producers macrophyte biomass was lower in the pst and aro treatments with a concomitant increase in phytoplankton fig 1 table s3 total macrophyte aboveground biomass reduced by 55 in the ambient aro 0 09 0 05 g compared with ambient con 0 2 0 04 g all three stressors influenced the relative abundance of macrophyte species table s3 fig 2 a myriophyllum dominated and showed the strongest response to all stressors aboveground biomass significantly decreased with pesticides and nitrate and increased with warming pesticides or nitrate did not affect the other species warming significantly reduced potamogeton aboveground biomass due to the opposite temperature response of myriophyllum and potamogeton warming only marginally positively influenced total macrophyte aboveground biomass p 0 06 final periphyton biomass was significantly lower in pst and aro treatments but only in the ambient temperature treatments significant pest and tmp x pest effect fig 1 distinct temporal dynamics were observed between weeks 1 and 3 fig 3 with initial positive nitr and negative tmp effects followed by positive pest effects table s3 by the end of the experiment the phytoplankton comprised predominantly green algae their biomass in the ambient aro treatment was high at the end of the experiment fig 3 reflected in both the chlorophyll a chl a and water od measurements phytoplankton measured as water od first responded positively to temperature week 1 and then to pesticides weeks 2 3 and 4 nitrate strongly affected water od at the time of sampling but did not affect phytoplankton chl a and was possibly driven by an underestimation of water od in the ambient pst spectrophotometric methods are in general less specific reporting 1 4 times lower chl a compared with the hplc method ward et al 1994 final biomass chl a responded strongly to pesticides and showed a tmp x pest interaction table s3 fig 1 the highest and lowest mean chl a concentrations were present in the ambient microcosms for the aro 231 9 277 µg l 1 and no3 9 6 14 6 µg l 1 treatments respectively opposite of what was observed for periphyton the number of bacterial cells measured in the water and the biofilm significantly increased in the warm treatments compared with the ambient fig s3 this reduction of total macrophyte biomass in the aro treatments resulted in significant changes in the relative abundance of primary producers fig 2b whereas the controls were dominated by macrophytes the aro treatments were dominated by phytoplankton pesticides caused declining shares of macrophytes and increasing dominance of phytoplankton table s3 permanova when pesticides and nitrate were present together aro effects were amplified fig 2b warming had a positive influence on macrophyte dominance 3 3 response of primary consumers three of the 40 initial lymnaea individuals did not survive all dead snails belonged to treatments containing pesticides growth rate was significantly reduced with pesticides but increased under warming fig 1 nitrate significantly increased snail growth only at a higher temperature only five snails had produced clutches two from ambient con one each from ambient and warm no3 and one from warm aro the no3 treatments had the highest number of eggs per clutch 144 23 while the aro had the least 9 mussels exhibited high mortality irrespective of treatment type and have not been included further in the analyses a strong negative effect of pesticides on daphnia abundance was found in the first two weeks and a positive effect of temperature in the first week table s3 fig 3 in the second week the percentage decrease in daphnia numbers in the ambient and warm aro treatments was 95 88 196 individuals l 1 and 55 620 673 individuals l 1 compared with the ambient and warm con 1636 1197 and 1152 554 individuals l 1 respectively final biomass of daphnia did not reflect any response to the stressors compared with the ambient con 3 4 integrative assessment of stressor effects and interactions effect sizes allowed us to compare the observed and predicted effects of individual and combined stressors effect sizes for individual stressors were calculated based on pairwise comparisons between each experimental condition and the control n 5 therefore some effects observed in the three way anova based on the data of the forty microcosms were not observed with this analysis mostly the observed and predicted effect sizes were similar showing that stressor effects were additive three exceptions exist fig 4 the observed combined effect of pesticides and nitrate on total macrophyte biomass and periphyton biomass was negative while the predicted effect was neutral this indicates a synergistic interaction of both stressors when increased temperature was applied with this stressor combination a reversed effect was observed for total macrophyte biomass pcas provided a global view of the strongest patterns in the data distinct pest and tmp effects were visible along axis 1 of the pca fig s4a c axes 1 and 2 contributed to 33 9 and 17 8 of the variation in the data respectively although the combined contribution of these two principal components to explain the variability of our observations is admittedly low 51 7 the contribution of pc1 is clear it separated total macrophyte biomass and myriophyllum biomass on the right from phytoplankton on the left and is explained by temperature and pesticides the effect of nitrate is weak the warm microcosms without pesticides explained the high total macrophyte and myriophyllum biomass along axis 2 periphyton and lymnaea are placed on opposite sides suggesting a top down control sems constructed based on hypothesized interactions between stressors and functional groups allowed us to trace food web effects using final sampling data the three stressors affected long lived organisms such as the dominant macrophyte myriophyllum or lymnaea but not or only marginally organisms with shorter generation times like phytoplankton daphnia and periphyton fig 5 myriophyllum hindered phytoplankton development possibly also through allelopathy hilt and gross 2008 and lymnaea controlled periphyton temporal dynamics likely influenced this outcome fig s5 strong direct positive nitrate effects were observed on periphyton during the first week of exposure fig s5a phytoplankton on the other hand was directly or indirectly affected by nitrate depending on the exposure phase pesticides directly affected the number of daphnia in the first two weeks fig s5b during the intermediate exposure phytoplankton was indirectly affected by pesticides through daphnia grazing warming had a direct positive influence on daphnia but only in the first week the preliminary sems using all expected pathways are presented in fig s6 and s7 the models created with potamogeton and elodea are not included as no significant stressor or biotic interactions were observed all sems with the final sampling data figs 5 s6 s7 fit the quality indicators the sems with the temporal data fig s5 however did not fit these quality indicators and should therefore be interpreted as a hypothesis for further experimental research 4 discussion our results confirm the first hypothesis the aquatic primary producers were affected through negative pesticide effects on the primary consumers which promoted phytoplankton development the second hypothesis is also confirmed nitrate and pesticides interacted synergistically to reduce macrophyte dominance warming together with pesticides and nitrates even reverted the expected outcome on macrophytes based on individual stressor effects shown by a significant negative effect of the combined stressors on total macrophyte abundance this means that a typical agricultural runoff aro containing a mixture of pesticides and nitrate can be more detrimental to macrophyte dominated fishless water bodies than the individual stressors alone and climate warming might even enhance these effects 4 1 effect of pesticides the different primary producer groups and the species in each group compete for light and nutrients stressor effects on one group or species may thus affect other primary producers the dominance of myriophyllum among the tested macrophyte species is not surprising as it is fast growing and able to successfully outcompete other species especially under eutrophic conditions grace and wetzel 1978 while it remains unclear whether terbuthylazine was present in the samples the other pesticides including copper might have affected the growth of macrophytes yet neither terbuthylazine nor copper showed effects on macrophytes in comparable studies and in the same range of concentrations bhp submitted vv unpublished data in different genotypes of myriophyllum ec50s ranging from 42 296 μg l 1 copper have been identified roubeau dumont et al 2019 the presumed negative effect of pesticides as seen in the sem might therefore be primarily indirect resulting from shading by phytoplankton or periphyton at the early or intermediate exposure period the lack of strong direct or indirect stressor effects on potamogeton or elodea might be related to the dominance of myriophyllum the sensitivity of phytoplankton to pesticides may be species dependent some species were inhibited already at 1 µg l 1 and others not even at 25 µg l 1 fiori et al 2013 green algae exhibited ec50s for copper between 30 µg l 1 de schamphelaere et al 2005 and 9200 µg l 1 gatidou and thomaidis 2007 less sensitive species therefore probably developed fast in the pst or aro treatments the positive indirect effect of pesticides on phytoplankton as suggested by the sem is likely related to the temporal effects of daphnia feeding on it in fact daphnia numbers showed a similar dynamic to phytoplankton with a lag of one week and a strong peak in week 2 in the con and no3 treatments the direct negative effect of pesticides on daphnia abundances observed during the first two weeks may be due to pirimicarb exhibiting ec50 values for d magna of 16 24 µg l 1 kusk 1996 modelling studies show that copper concentrations comparable to those applied in our experiment 42 µg l 1 affected top down control of daphnia on green algae prosnier et al 2015 and should thus have been sufficient to cause a significant decrease in phytoplankton filtration by daphnia one potential reason for the decline in daphnia numbers at the end of the experiment could be food shortage as no further phytoplankton peak emerged in con and no3 although other reasons such as fungal infections cannot be excluded the decline in lymnaea growth when exposed to pesticides is in line with allen et al 2021 and may be related to copper brix et al 2011 or pirimicarb tufi et al 2015 4 2 modulation of pesticide effects by nitrate remarkably nitrate or pesticides alone did not affect the proportion of the different functional groups of primary producers in pesticide free treatments nitrate effects on periphyton and phytoplankton biomass were compensated by snail and zooplankton grazing pressure and thus did not affect the total macrophyte biomass pesticides alone hampered daphnia and thus promoted phytoplankton but the relative proportion of phytoplankton or macrophytes did not change significantly compared to con or no3 treatments synergistic stressor interactions observed for the combination of pesticides and nitrate on total macrophyte biomass and periphyton and for the combination of all three stressors on total macrophyte biomass highlight the importance of better understanding multiple stressor effects further only the combination of pesticides and nitrate affected the overall proportion of primary producers this is likely due to a facilitation of periphyton growth by nitrate in the early phase of exposure and negative effects of pesticides on daphnia promoting phytoplankton these findings may have direct relevance for small fishless lakes with high levels of resource abundance where daphnia are dominant filter feeders romanovsky and feniova 1985 the fact that the system moves towards a much lower resilience is indicated by both the general increase and the wide variability in the phytoplankton biomass in the combined treatments although permanova indicated no significant interactions between pesticides and nitrate in fact such an increase in variability can also be used as an indicator that a system is shifting from one stable state to the other scheffer et al 2015 although we saw strong direct negative nitrate effects on myriophyllum controlled laboratory studies showed that myriophyllum could tolerate nitrogen levels up to 14 mg l 1 palove balang et al 2016 field studies on the other hand show that myriophyllum growth is reduced after a week if concentrations exceed 0 5 mg l 1 palove balang et al 2016 suggesting that macrophytes are affected by other nitrate related factors for example through competition with phytoplankton or periphyton in our study periphyton growth in the nitrate treatments significantly increased in the first week causing shading of macrophytes this highlights the relevance of including epiphytes in studies concerning regime shifts between primary producers phillips et al 2016 4 3 warming and its modification of pesticide effects global warming is generally expected to stimulate macrophyte growth in temperate zhang et al 2019 and arctic lauridsen et al 2020 lakes unless critical thresholds in nutrient loading that result in phytoplankton dominance have been crossed mooij et al 2008 one explanation for the increased biomass of myriophyllum in our warm treatments is its higher optimum temperature range of up to 35 c grace and wetzel 1978 however indirect effects for example on snail activity by increased grazing on periphyton or by accelerated plant growth as a compensatory mechanism to leaf loss by grazing are likely allen et al 2021 whose microcosms did not have a top down control on phytoplankton showed no effects of warming on myriophyllum or the other two macrophyte species in our experiment two non exclusive explanations are possible for the modulation of pesticide effects by warming the first is that top down control of microalgae was higher in the warm aro treatments reflected by increased snail growth rate and an increase in daphnia numbers in the early phase of the experiment increasing light and nutrient availability to macrophytes herbivore plant interactions can in fact be strengthened by warming zhang et al 2019 the second explanation is that the warm treatments promoted the development of bacteria which may also have been influenced by a higher nutrient cycling by consumers thereby increasing competition for resources with phytoplankton joint et al 2002 the effect of warming on phytoplankton and periphyton which we expected to be positive mahdy et al 2015 rasconi et al 2015 remained context specific and was likely quickly counterbalanced by grazing effects of daphnia and lymnaea similar to previous findings kazanjian et al 2018 velthuis et al 2017 the increased phytoplankton and decreased periphyton in the pesticide treatments were significant only in the ambient treatments and may be linked to the lower consumer activity in these treatments warming was therefore mitigating pesticide toxicity elevated temperature in the form of heatwaves applied with pesticides have shown antagonistic or synergistic effects depending on the type of pesticide used polazzo et al 2021 the type of pesticides present and the community composition including number of trophic levels and their feeding behaviours will all determine how warming affects such shallow lake ecosystems several studies have included warming as a stressor along with nitrate bouraï et al 2020 mckee et al 2002 or pesticides wijewardene et al 2021 knillmann et al 2013 often using simplified food webs or communities yet the literature is lacking on experiments combining all three stressors which is a more realistic scenario and incorporating more complex food web structures to disentangle direct and indirect effects such a mechanistic understanding is of paramount importance if safe operating spaces are to be defined in the context of rising global temperatures 5 conclusion our findings have implications for decision making on alleviating stressor effects not only in shallow lakes but also in fishless ditches and kettle holes in our study the applied agricultural run off aro strongly reduced phytoplankton and periphyton control by primary consumers daphnia lymnaea alone pesticides and nitrate caused low or no effects at the individual or community level but when present in combination the macrophyte dominated state was threatened especially at ambient temperature as highlighted by the synergistic stressor interaction effects on macrophytes and periphyton we highlight the importance of reducing both nitrate and pesticide use in agriculture to positively influence the water quality of adjacent aquatic ecosystems by enhancing potential for macrophyte dominance reducing just one of these chemical stressor types may be insufficient the situation even gets more complex when adding warming to these stressors despite the apparent buffering effect of temperature on nitrate and pesticide effects for phytoplankton and daphnia total macrophyte biomass was significantly reduced the significant reversed stressor interaction found for nitrate pesticides and warming on submerged macrophytes highlights the risk in predicting multiple stressor effects from individual stressor effects a better understanding of systems comprising complex benthic pelagic interactions as outlined in our study is necessary for policymakers to develop strategies that enable the achievement of the good ecological status of shallow lakes as defined by the water framework directive future studies can build on our study by considering e g larger scales and a longer duration of the experiment or the implementation of more complex food webs including higher trophic levels author contributions the concept of the climshift

16108,shallow lakes provide essential ecological and environmental services but are exposed to multiple stressors including agricultural runoff aro and climate warming which may act on different target receptors disrupting their normal functioning we performed a microcosm experiment to determine the individual and combined effects of three stressors pesticides nitrate and climate warming on two trophic levels representative of communities found in shallow lakes we used three submerged macrophyte species myriophyllum spicatum potamogeton perfoliatus elodea nuttallii eight benthic or pelagic microalgal species and three primary consumer species daphnia magna lymnaea stagnalis dreissena polymorpha with different feeding preferences for benthic and pelagic primary producers eight different treatments consisted of a control only nitrate a pesticide cocktail and a combination of nitrate and pesticides representing aro each replicated at ambient temperature and 3 5 c mimicking climate warming pesticides negatively affected all functional groups except phytoplankton which increased warming and nitrate modified these effects strong but opposite pesticide and warming effects on myriophyllum drove the response of the total macrophyte biomass nitrate significantly suppressed myriophyllum final biomass but not overall macrophyte and microalgal biomass nitrate and pesticides in combination caused a macrophyte decline and the system tipped towards phytoplankton dominance strong synergistic or even reversed stressor interaction effects were observed for macrophytes or periphyton we emphasize the need for more complex community and ecosystem level studies incorporating multiple stressor scenarios to define safe operating spaces graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords agricultural runoff benthic pelagic coupling microcosm multiple stressors regime shifts stressor interactions 1 introduction multiple stressors affecting aquatic systems do not spare shallow lakes the most abundant type of freshwater systems worldwide meerhoff and jeppesen 2009 these lakes including fishless water bodies such as kettle holes and peatland ditches are common in agricultural landscapes and are hubs of biodiversity pätzig et al 2012 peeters 2005 whatley et al 2014 typical lakes may exhibit either the more desirable clear water macrophyte dominated state providing a variety of ecosystem services or the degraded turbid phytoplankton dominated state janssen et al 2021 in addition periphyton shading on macrophytes can play an important role in the transition from the clear water to the turbid state phillips et al 1978 these state shifts have been largely ascribed to nutrient loading to aquatic systems which has significantly increased since the agricultural revolution moss et al 2013 yet the role of nitrogen in regime shifts has received less attention than phosphorus particularly due to the presence of nitrogen fixation as a compensation mechanism for nitrogen shortage moss et al 2013 schindler et al 2008 increasing nitrogen concentrations may lead to reduced macrophyte abundance and diversity due to phytoplankton shading moss 1976 phillips et al 2016 higher nitrogen concentrations are consistently measured close to agricultural sites 1 5 to 1 8 mg l 1 compared with non agricultural watersheds 1 0 mg l 1 xu et al 2014 actual nitrogen input concentrations may be masked by quick assimilation by phytoplankton or periphyton reduced macrophyte biomass and species richness as well as increased phytoplankton and chlorophyll a concentrations have been observed at nitrogen concentrations between 2 and 10 mg l 1 barker et al 2008 sagrario et al 2005 these shifts occurred irrespective of total phosphorus concentrations ranging between 0 03 and 1 2 mg l 1 sagrario et al 2005 high nitrogen loading can therefore increase phytoplankton and periphyton biomass in nitrogen limited or co limited lakes smith and lee 2006 zhang and mei 2013 nitrates are easily leached into groundwater or carried away in agricultural runoff aro in the following concentrations in shallow lakes may thus rise proportionally with increasing fertilizer applications underlining the need for nitrogen control around shallow lakes while alternative states are less common in smaller lakes such as ditches and kettle holes where macrophytes and periphyton are more abundant kazanjian et al 2018 they are still possible under high eutrophication whatley et al 2014 the primary source of nitrogen in these lakes is aro rücker et al 2019 which may also contain organic and inorganic pesticides global production and use of pesticides has risen significantly after the 1950s schäfer et al 2011 sharma et al 2019 pesticides varying in concentrations in aquatic systems based on rain events and surface or subsurface runoff graymore et al 2001 can directly affect all types of aquatic primary producers through e g inhibition of photosynthesis carotenoid biosynthesis or growth regulation mohaupt et al 2020 vonk and kraak 2020 they may also indirectly alter their development by affecting top down control cuenca cambronero et al 2018 macrophytes are affected directly by phytoplankton and periphyton shading and indirectly through top down control of microalgae by invertebrate grazers phillips et al 2016 zooplankton efficiently controls phytoplankton leading to high transparency in lakes lampert et al 1986 and invertebrate grazing on periphyton may alleviate shading on macrophytes jones et al 2003 pesticides may affect not only these primary consumers allen et al 2021 hanazato 2001 but also predators such as fish ali et al 2020 or other higher trophic levels if present depending on their modes of action pesticides may therefore alter macrophyte abundance directly or indirectly through trophic interactions yamamuro et al 2019 reducing the resilience of the system scheffer et al 1993 in addition to local chemical stressors shallow lakes are increasingly subjected to climate warming the international panel on climate change ipcc has projected a 4 c increase in global temperatures in its rcp 8 5 scenario ipcc 2014 such an increase may have negative effects for shallow lakes particularly in combination with chemical pollution entering these systems modelling studies propose that rising temperatures will cause an increase in phytoplankton biomass trolle et al 2014 yet warming may also reduce phytoplankton biomass due to enhanced grazing in fishless lakes hansson et al 2012 further filtering rates of daphnia key grazers in fishless ditches may be reduced at higher temperatures müller et al 2018 climate warming leading to increased nutrient release from sediments jeppesen et al 2009 or increased herbivory on macrophytes zhang et al 2019 may contribute to phytoplankton dominance and ultimately cause regime shifts in shallow eutrophic lakes scheffer 2001 these multiple stressors may affect shallow aquatic lakes in several ways nitrate or other nutrients could act antagonistic to pesticide effects e g dampening negative effects of herbicides on primary producers halstead et al 2014 dalton et al 2015 high nutrient availability for microalgae provide a better food quality for grazers guo et al 2016 but might interact with grazer sensitivity towards pesticides climate warming may further complicate the prediction of combined nitrate and pesticide effects the resilience of the clear water macrophyte dominated state may be reduced and tipping points for state shifts more easily reached scheffer et al 1993 as a result of the combined effects of multiple stressors nitrate pesticides and warming on community and ecosystem processes in shallow lakes or fishless ditches or kettle holes we combined this complex scenario in our microcosms to test the interactive effects of nitrate pesticides and warming on a benthic pelagic system whose respective response to the stressors can induce state shifts of the system to the best of our knowledge this type of complex integrative study including a top down consumer control of both phytoplankton and periphyton has not been performed before the objective of our study is to determine the individual and combined effects of nitrate pesticides and climate warming in microcosms using key functional groups representative of the first two trophic levels in shallow aquatic ecosystems the organisms we chose are used in normalized ecotoxicity assays oecd 2011 2012 2014 2016 to disentangle the nitrate pesticide and warming effects we exposed our microcosms to these stressors individually and in combination we hypothesized that 1 pesticides will affect the primary producers through effects on trophic interactions and 2 nitrate and warming will interact synergistically with pesticides to weaken macrophyte dominance 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design to determine the individual and combined effects of nitrate

avoid size changes haney and hall 1973 and their length measured using a digital microscope vhx 6000 keyence bois colombes france length measures were converted into dry weight using the formula b 0

measure the minimum fluorescence f0 by pulse amplitude modulation pam the strip was immediately placed back in the cylinder at the end of the experiment periphyton from all four strips 400 cm2 per microcosm was brushed off into 20 ml volvic water using a soft toothbrush following homogenization and centrifugation pellets were stored at 80 c then lyophilised for the analysis of organic carbon

macrophytes were sampled cleaned and separated by species into aboveground and belowground parts the carbon content based on dry mass was measured in apical 10 cm shoot sections total carbon content of each species per microcosm was calculated from their respective aboveground biomass total macrophyte dry mass and carbon content reflect the sums for all three macrophyte species per microcosm 2 3

considered to be additive synergistic antagonistic or reversed if they were similar to higher than lower than or opposite in direction to the calculated additions respectively respecting ci margins to analyse shifts in the relative dominance among the three macrophyte species and among the three primary producer groups a permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was performed using the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 to visualize significant patterns in the variability of the final sampling data and to reduce the confounding influence of multiple highly correlated variables principal components analyses pca were performed using the vegan oksanen et al 2020 and factoextra packages kassambara and mundt 2020 to decipher direct and indirect stressor effects on the organisms as well as species interactions a path analysis subjected to structural equation modelling sem was created package sem fox et al 2021 using several hypothetical pathways similar to allen et al 2021 table s2 further details of statistical approaches are presented in the supplemental material 3 results the factorial design of our experiment allowed us to identify individual and combined effects of pesticides nitrate and warming in the different treatments con no3 pst aro on the development of the different functional groups and on water chemistry table s3 shows the statistical outputs of either three way anova kruskal wallis test by ranks and permanova supporting the following results 3 1 water analyses the average temperatures remained consistent throughout the experiment and measured 24 6

presented in the supplemental material high nitrate additions to the no3 and aro treatments were no longer measurable at the end of the experiment continuous fertilisation by nitrate and phosphate at a 16 1 µm ratio did not result in an accumulation of dissolved nutrients compared to initial values of the volvic water 1 71 mg l 1 n no3 0 176 mg l 1 p po4 remaining orthophosphate was lower in ambient treatments 58 36 µg l 1 compared with warm 119 97 µg l 1 and variable in the con and no3 treatments we observed strong tmp x pest interactions for p po4 and the np molar ratio fig s2b particulate phosphorus was low at the end of the experiment range 5 6 31 5 µg l 1 with significantly higher levels in the pst and aro treatments fig s2e pesticides were still present at the end of the experiment 30 78 see supplementary s3 1 except for terbuthylazine which was not found in any of the samples 3 2 response of primary producers macrophyte biomass was lower in the pst and aro treatments with a concomitant increase in phytoplankton fig 1 table s3 total macrophyte aboveground biomass reduced by 55 in the ambient aro 0 09 0 05 g compared with ambient con 0 2 0 04 g all three stressors influenced the relative abundance of macrophyte species table s3 fig 2 a myriophyllum dominated and showed the strongest response to all stressors aboveground biomass significantly decreased with pesticides and nitrate and increased with warming pesticides or nitrate did not affect the other species warming significantly reduced potamogeton aboveground biomass due to the opposite temperature response of myriophyllum and potamogeton warming only marginally positively influenced total macrophyte aboveground biomass p 0 06 final periphyton biomass was significantly lower in pst and aro treatments but only in the ambient temperature treatments significant pest and tmp x pest effect fig 1 distinct temporal dynamics were observed between weeks 1 and 3 fig 3 with initial positive nitr and negative tmp effects followed by positive pest effects table s3 by the end of the experiment the phytoplankton comprised predominantly green algae their biomass in the ambient aro treatment was high at the end of the experiment fig 3 reflected in both the chlorophyll a chl a and water od measurements phytoplankton measured as water od first responded positively to temperature week 1 and then to pesticides weeks 2 3 and 4 nitrate strongly affected water od at the time of sampling but did not affect phytoplankton chl a and was possibly driven by an underestimation of water od in the ambient pst spectrophotometric methods are in general less specific reporting 1 4 times lower chl a compared with the hplc method ward et al 1994 final biomass chl a responded strongly to pesticides and showed a tmp x pest interaction table s3 fig 1 the highest and lowest mean chl a concentrations were present in the ambient microcosms for the aro 231 9 277 µg l 1 and no3 9 6 14 6 µg l 1 treatments respectively opposite of what was observed for periphyton the number of bacterial cells measured in the water and the biofilm significantly increased in the warm treatments compared with the ambient fig s3 this reduction of total macrophyte biomass in the aro treatments resulted in significant changes in the relative abundance of primary producers fig 2b whereas the controls were dominated by macrophytes the aro treatments were dominated by phytoplankton pesticides caused declining shares of macrophytes and increasing dominance of phytoplankton table s3 permanova when pesticides and nitrate were present together aro effects were amplified fig 2b warming had a positive influence on macrophyte dominance 3 3 response of primary consumers three of the 40 initial lymnaea individuals did not survive all dead snails belonged to treatments containing pesticides growth rate was significantly reduced with pesticides but increased under warming fig 1 nitrate significantly increased snail growth only at a higher temperature only five snails had produced clutches two from ambient con one each from ambient and warm no3 and one from warm aro the no3 treatments had the highest number of eggs per clutch 144 23 while the aro had the least 9 mussels exhibited high mortality irrespective of treatment type and have not been included further in the analyses a strong negative effect of pesticides on daphnia abundance was found in the first two weeks and a positive effect of temperature in the first week table s3 fig 3 in the second week the percentage decrease in daphnia numbers in the ambient and warm aro treatments was 95 88 196 individuals l 1 and 55 620 673 individuals l 1 compared with the ambient and warm con 1636 1197 and 1152 554 individuals l 1 respectively final biomass of daphnia did not reflect any response to the stressors compared with the ambient con 3 4 integrative assessment of stressor effects and interactions effect sizes allowed us to compare the observed and predicted effects of individual and combined stressors effect sizes for individual stressors were calculated based on pairwise comparisons between each experimental condition and the control n 5 therefore some effects observed in the three way anova based on the data of the forty microcosms were not observed with this analysis mostly the observed and predicted effect sizes were similar showing that stressor effects were additive three exceptions exist fig 4 the observed combined effect of pesticides and nitrate on total macrophyte biomass and periphyton biomass was negative while the predicted effect was neutral this indicates a synergistic interaction of both stressors when increased temperature was applied with this stressor combination a reversed effect was observed for total macrophyte biomass pcas provided a global view of the strongest patterns in the data distinct pest and tmp effects were visible along axis 1 of the pca fig s4a c axes 1 and 2 contributed to 33 9 and 17 8 of the variation in the data respectively although the combined contribution of these two principal components to explain the variability of our observations is admittedly low 51 7 the contribution of pc1 is clear it separated total macrophyte biomass and myriophyllum biomass on the right from phytoplankton on the left and is explained by temperature and pesticides the effect of nitrate is weak the warm microcosms without pesticides explained the high total macrophyte and myriophyllum biomass along axis 2 periphyton and lymnaea are placed on opposite sides suggesting a top down control sems constructed based on hypothesized interactions between stressors and functional groups allowed us to trace food web effects using final sampling data the three stressors affected long lived organisms such as the dominant macrophyte myriophyllum or lymnaea but not or only marginally organisms with shorter generation times like phytoplankton daphnia and periphyton fig 5 myriophyllum hindered phytoplankton development possibly also through allelopathy hilt and gross 2008 and lymnaea controlled periphyton temporal dynamics likely influenced this outcome fig s5 strong direct positive nitrate effects were observed on periphyton during the first week of exposure fig s5a phytoplankton on the other hand was directly or indirectly affected by nitrate depending on the exposure phase pesticides directly affected the number of daphnia in the first two weeks fig s5b during the intermediate exposure phytoplankton was indirectly affected by pesticides through daphnia grazing warming had a direct positive influence on daphnia but only in the first week the preliminary sems using all expected pathways are presented in fig s6 and s7 the models created with potamogeton and elodea are not included as no significant stressor or biotic interactions were observed all sems with the final sampling data figs 5 s6 s7 fit the quality indicators the sems with the temporal data fig s5 however did not fit these quality indicators and should therefore be interpreted as a hypothesis for further experimental research 4 discussion our results confirm the first hypothesis the aquatic primary producers were affected through negative pesticide effects on the primary consumers which promoted phytoplankton development the second hypothesis is also confirmed nitrate and pesticides interacted synergistically to reduce macrophyte dominance warming together with pesticides and nitrates even reverted the expected outcome on macrophytes based on individual stressor effects shown by a significant negative effect of the combined stressors on total macrophyte abundance this means that a typical agricultural runoff aro containing a mixture of pesticides and nitrate can be more detrimental to macrophyte dominated fishless water bodies than the individual stressors alone and climate warming might even enhance these effects 4 1 effect of pesticides the different primary producer groups and the species in each group compete for light and nutrients stressor effects on one group or species may thus affect other primary producers the dominance of myriophyllum among the tested macrophyte species is not surprising as it is fast growing and able to successfully outcompete other species especially under eutrophic conditions grace and wetzel 1978 while it remains unclear whether terbuthylazine was present in the samples the other pesticides including copper might have affected the growth of macrophytes yet neither terbuthylazine nor copper showed effects on macrophytes in comparable studies and in the same range of concentrations bhp submitted vv unpublished data in different genotypes of myriophyllum ec50s ranging from 42 296 μg l 1 copper have been identified roubeau dumont et al 2019 the presumed negative effect of pesticides as seen in the sem might therefore be primarily indirect resulting from shading by phytoplankton or periphyton at the early or intermediate exposure period the lack of strong direct or indirect stressor effects on potamogeton or elodea might be related to the dominance of myriophyllum the sensitivity of phytoplankton to pesticides may be species dependent some species were inhibited already at 1 µg l 1 and others not even at 25 µg l 1 fiori et al 2013 green algae exhibited ec50s for copper between 30 µg l 1 de schamphelaere et al 2005 and 9200 µg l 1 gatidou and thomaidis 2007 less sensitive species therefore probably developed fast in the pst or aro treatments the positive indirect effect of pesticides on phytoplankton as suggested by the sem is likely related to the temporal effects of daphnia feeding on it in fact daphnia numbers showed a similar dynamic to phytoplankton with a lag of one week and a strong peak in week 2 in the con and no3 treatments the direct negative effect of pesticides on daphnia abundances observed during the first two weeks may be due to pirimicarb exhibiting ec50 values for d magna of 16 24 µg l 1 kusk 1996 modelling studies show that copper concentrations comparable to those applied in our experiment 42 µg l 1 affected top down control of daphnia on green algae prosnier et al 2015 and should thus have been sufficient to cause a significant decrease in phytoplankton filtration by daphnia one potential reason for the decline in daphnia numbers at the end of the experiment could be food shortage as no further phytoplankton peak emerged in con and no3 although other reasons such as fungal infections cannot be excluded the decline in lymnaea growth when exposed to pesticides is in line with allen et al 2021 and may be related to copper brix et al 2011 or pirimicarb tufi et al 2015 4 2 modulation of pesticide effects by nitrate remarkably nitrate or pesticides alone did not affect the proportion of the different functional groups of primary producers in pesticide free treatments nitrate effects on periphyton and phytoplankton biomass were compensated by snail and zooplankton grazing pressure and thus did not affect the total macrophyte biomass pesticides alone hampered daphnia and thus promoted phytoplankton but the relative proportion of phytoplankton or macrophytes did not change significantly compared to con or no3 treatments synergistic stressor interactions observed for the combination of pesticides and nitrate on total macrophyte biomass and periphyton and for the combination of all three stressors on total macrophyte biomass highlight the importance of better understanding multiple stressor effects further only the combination of pesticides and nitrate affected the overall proportion of primary producers this is likely due to a facilitation of periphyton growth by nitrate in the early phase of exposure and negative effects of pesticides on daphnia promoting phytoplankton these findings may have direct relevance for small fishless lakes with high levels of resource abundance where daphnia are dominant filter feeders romanovsky and feniova 1985 the fact that the system moves towards a much lower resilience is indicated by both the general increase and the wide variability in the phytoplankton biomass in the combined treatments although permanova indicated no significant interactions between pesticides and nitrate in fact such an increase in variability can also be used as an indicator that a system is shifting from one stable state to the other scheffer et al 2015 although we saw strong direct negative nitrate effects on myriophyllum controlled laboratory studies showed that myriophyllum could tolerate nitrogen levels up to 14 mg l 1 palove balang et al 2016 field studies on the other hand show that myriophyllum growth is reduced after a week if concentrations exceed 0 5 mg l 1 palove balang et al 2016 suggesting that macrophytes are affected by other nitrate related factors for example through competition with phytoplankton or periphyton in our study periphyton growth in the nitrate treatments significantly increased in the first week causing shading of macrophytes this highlights the relevance of including epiphytes in studies concerning regime shifts between primary producers phillips et al 2016 4 3 warming and its modification of pesticide effects global warming is generally expected to stimulate macrophyte growth in temperate zhang et al 2019 and arctic lauridsen et al 2020 lakes unless critical thresholds in nutrient loading that result in phytoplankton dominance have been crossed mooij et al 2008 one explanation for the increased biomass of myriophyllum in our warm treatments is its higher optimum temperature range of up to 35 c grace and wetzel 1978 however indirect effects for example on snail activity by increased grazing on periphyton or by accelerated plant growth as a compensatory mechanism to leaf loss by grazing are likely allen et al 2021 whose microcosms did not have a top down control on phytoplankton showed no effects of warming on myriophyllum or the other two macrophyte species in our experiment two non exclusive explanations are possible for the modulation of pesticide effects by warming the first is that top down control of microalgae was higher in the warm aro treatments reflected by increased snail growth rate and an increase in daphnia numbers in the early phase of the experiment increasing light and nutrient availability to macrophytes herbivore plant interactions can in fact be strengthened by warming zhang et al 2019 the second explanation is that the warm treatments promoted the development of bacteria which may also have been influenced by a higher nutrient cycling by consumers thereby increasing competition for resources with phytoplankton joint et al 2002 the effect of warming on phytoplankton and periphyton which we expected to be positive mahdy et al 2015 rasconi et al 2015 remained context specific and was likely quickly counterbalanced by grazing effects of daphnia and lymnaea similar to previous findings kazanjian et al 2018 velthuis et al 2017 the increased phytoplankton and decreased periphyton in the pesticide treatments were significant only in the ambient treatments and may be linked to the lower consumer activity in these treatments warming was therefore mitigating pesticide toxicity elevated temperature in the form of heatwaves applied with pesticides have shown antagonistic or synergistic effects depending on the type of pesticide used polazzo et al 2021 the type of pesticides present and the community composition including number of trophic levels and their feeding behaviours will all determine how warming affects such shallow lake ecosystems several studies have included warming as a stressor along with nitrate bouraï et al 2020 mckee et al 2002 or pesticides wijewardene et al 2021 knillmann et al 2013 often using simplified food webs or communities yet the literature is lacking on experiments combining all three stressors which is a more realistic scenario and incorporating more complex food web structures to disentangle direct and indirect effects such a mechanistic understanding is of paramount importance if safe operating spaces are to be defined in the context of rising global temperatures 5 conclusion our findings have implications for decision making on alleviating stressor effects not only in shallow lakes but also in fishless ditches and kettle holes in our study the applied agricultural run off aro strongly reduced phytoplankton and periphyton control by primary consumers daphnia lymnaea alone pesticides and nitrate caused low or no effects at the individual or community level but when present in combination the macrophyte dominated state was threatened especially at ambient temperature as highlighted by the synergistic stressor interaction effects on macrophytes and periphyton we highlight the importance of reducing both nitrate and pesticide use in agriculture to positively influence the water quality of adjacent aquatic ecosystems by enhancing potential for macrophyte dominance reducing just one of these chemical stressor types may be insufficient the situation even gets more complex when adding warming to these stressors despite the apparent buffering effect of temperature on nitrate and pesticide effects for phytoplankton and daphnia total macrophyte biomass was significantly reduced the significant reversed stressor interaction found for nitrate pesticides and warming on submerged macrophytes highlights the risk in predicting multiple stressor effects from individual stressor effects a better understanding of systems comprising complex benthic pelagic interactions as outlined in our study is necessary for policymakers to develop strategies that enable the achievement of the good ecological status of shallow lakes as defined by the water framework directive future studies can build on our study by considering e g larger scales and a longer duration of the experiment or the implementation of more complex food webs including higher trophic levels author contributions the concept of the climshift

16109,seawater desalination is regarded as a possible way to overcome current shortages of fresh water and membrane based air humidification dehumidification desalination mhdd represents a promising technique owing to its high quality freshwater and cost effectiveness however its development is restricted by membrane fouling while a superhydrophobic membrane provides resistance to hydrophilic fouling it remains susceptible to hydrophobic fouling here a polyvinylidene fluoride zno mxene pvdf zm membrane with a reversible conversion between superhydrophobicity and hydrophilicity was fabricated to achieve universal fouling resistance it earned a competitive permeate flux 3 93 kg m 2 h 1 and an excellent salt rejection 99 5 the membrane exhibited a strong anti hydrophilic fouling ability benefiting from its superhydrophobicity and rough surface the adsorbed hydrophobic contaminants could desorb from the membrane surface under uv irradiation when transforming the surface wettability into hydrophilicity exhibiting an anti hydrophobic fouling ability subsequently the membrane surface returned to the hydrophobic state under dark conditions the membrane recovered 90 of the original permeation flux while maintaining a salt rejection of 99 5 thus realizing membrane self healing the pvdf zm membrane holds promise for sustainable desalination applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desalination anti fouling self healing superhydrophobicity reversible conversion of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity 1 introduction fresh water is an essential component for much life on the planet and its importance is self evident however pre existing shortages of fresh water resources are being further aggravated by the economic development of water resources and pollution as reduction in expenditure alone cannot meet the current global demand additional resources must be sought after and desalination of marine water represents one potential approach to address this issue ding et al 2020a pistocchi et al 2020 in particular membrane distillation md has become a rapidly growing area of research and development due to its tolerance to high salinity levels excellent salt rejection and low operational pressure ma et al 2021 murugesan et al 2020 membrane based air humidification dehumidification desalination mhdd combined with solar geothermal or waste heat sources offers a cost effective thermally driven desalination technology zhang and zhang 2022 however scaling and fouling contamination of membranes remain a major obstacle to their industrial application kim et al 2020 warsinger et al 2015 many scaling mitigation technologies have been analyzed including micro nano filtration pre treatment alklaibi and lior 2006 thermal water softening gryta 2010 use of antiscalants gryta 2012 magnetic water treatment gryta 2011 etc goh et al 2018 although operating and investment capital costs remained largely neglected the most efficient strategy for improving antifouling performance is to tailor the membrane properties to specific needs rana et al modified pvdf membrane by in situ phase inversion process to promote the industrial application of membrane distillation in seawater desalination li et al 2019 yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 furthermore the superhydrophobic modification on the membrane surface has a significant effect on reducing the formation of scale since the hydrophobic layer acts as a buffer layer of scale inhibition by reducing nucleation and particle adhesion on the surface su et al 2020 presently superhydrophobic modification is mainly achieved by increasing surface roughness while decreasing the surface energy deka et al 2019 accordingly fluorinated chemicals are the most commonly used hydrophobic modifiers for their low surface energy however their derived superhydrophobic surfaces can readily adsorb natural organic matter e g humid acid ha and proteins meng et al 2018 2014 therefore membrane cleaning is an essential component to increasing stable operation time treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or acids is considered effective at restoring membrane permeability although it may destroy the membrane structure or further degrade the water quality thereby increasing treatment costs physical treatment can avoid these problems ye et al 2019 but its effectiveness is reduced and requires greater levels of energy consumption abdel karim et al 2021 thus it remains urgent to find an effective and economically viable method of membrane cleaning in general superhydrophobic surfaces are resistant to hydrophilic contaminants whereas hydrophilic surfaces are less susceptible to hydrophobic contaminants from this perspective the ideal membrane should be both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic because when the membrane is superhydrophobic it is a hydrophilic pollutant obstacle and when it is switched to superhydrophilic the hydrophobic substances can be easily cleaned although creating such a membrane represents a notably difficult task one with reversible hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity transition may help achieve this goal jucker and clark 1994 feng et al 2004 realized a reversible superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity transition of aligned zno nanorod films by alternating between states of uv illumination and dark storage the holes generated by zno excited by uv light could react with water molecules to form oh groups and adsorb onto the surface of the film transforming into hydrophilic states after dark storage the unstable hydroxyl adsorption was gradually replaced by more stable and stronger oxygen adsorption restoring membrane performance to hydrophobic state however in real fabrication unreacted zn oh 2 is always left on zno surfaces making zno crystals hydrophilic therefore a direct use of zno to realize hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible conversion is difficult to achieve in practical circumstances pan et al 2019 the hydrophobic modification of zno is required first before its hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible properties can be used a relatively young family of 2d materials known as mxenes are obtained by etching the a layer from m n 1 ax n where m refers to a transition metal a represents a main group element mostly iii a or iv a and x is c and or n ding et al 2018 ghidiu et al 2014 sang et al 2016 mxenes represent by the formula m n 1 x n t x where t x is o oh and f possess outstanding antibacterial properties as well as excellent mechanical stability antifouling activity and adjustable surface chemistry making it a strong candidate for application in water treatment indeed previous studies have indicated that mxene based membranes exhibit high flux and excellent durability for water desalination wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 in addition mxene is prone to hydrophobic modification owing to its surface functional groups chen et al 2020 and perhaps most importantly the f and oh terminated mxene are semiconductors with small band gaps tang and zhou 2013 a combination of mxene and zno is expected to achieve superhydrophobicity and has no hindrance to hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible conversion to the best of our knowledge the work here represents the first application of reversible conversion between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity in the field of membrane distillation for antifouling in this study a fibrous root like superhydrophobic membrane with reversible conversion between hydrophilicity was fabricated and applied to seawater desalination for anti fouling fig 1 zno nanorods were first grown on a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane pvdf zno surface via electrostatic interactions using a simple hydrothermal synthesis method then mxene sheets were deposited on the zno surface and superhydrophobic modification was realized by a dehydration reaction deriving pvdf zm uv irradiation and dark storage were used as the switching methods for hydrophilic hydrophobic reversible conversion compared with an untreated pvdf membrane the permeation flux of the modified membrane remained stable within 120 h thereby showing excellent anti scale ability furthermore additional hydrophobic contaminants were applied to the membrane surface to assess its self healing ability the hydrophobic scale attached to the surface was easily desorbed owing to changes in surface hydrophilicity subsequently the membrane was then placed in the dark to recover hydrophobicity the permeate flux of the healed membrane reached 90 of the initial flux 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 0 45 μm pore size membranes were purchased from millipore massachusetts usa to serve as the substrate layer max ti3alc2

to previous work ding et al 2018 zhang and zhang 2022 lif 2 g was dissolved in 40 ml of 6 mol l 1 6 m hcl and mixed thoroughly for 5 min then 1 g of ti3alc2 was slowly added to the mixture over 24 h at 35 c while stirring the resulting product was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and washed several times with dw until supernatant ph 6 the precipitate was then dispersed in 100 ml of dw under ultrasonication for 30 min to delaminate the mxene flakes the solution was again centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min and this process was repeated several times until no precipitate was visible at the bottom of the tube a light green supernatant the colloidal solution of mxene was obtained 2 2 2 fabrication of the pvdf zno membrane zno arrays were grown via a hydrothermal method yeom et al 2017 zno nanoparticles were first dissolved in dw 25 wt to form the seed solution then 1 μl of the seed solution was dispersed in 100 ml dw under sonication for 10 min and the solution was vacuum filtered onto the pvdf membrane to assist with the uniform growth of zno nanoarrays next the membrane was suspended in 1 wt zno nanoparticle solution with magnetic stirring for 30 min followed by washing with dw and drying at room temperature for 24 h after uniformly coating the zno seeds on the pvdf substrate pyrotechnic flower like zno arrays were grown by floating the substrate in an aqueous solution of zn no3 2 6h2o 50 mm and hmta 50 mm at 90 c for 4 h the pvdf zno membrane was obtained after rinsing with dw and drying at room temperature 2 2 3 fabrication of pvdf zm membrane the pvdf zno membrane was floated in mxene solution at 5 c for 12 h and then rinsed with dw the membrane was dehydrated at 90 c for 2 h and 120 c for 2 h before obtaining the pvdf zm membrane 2 2 4 preparation of contaminated membrane next 0 1 g bsa and 0 1 g ha were dispersed in 100 ml of dw each the pvdf zm membrane was suspended in the bsa and ha aqueous solutions for 3 h while stirring afterwards the bsa contaminated membrane was dried at 80 c for 6 h whereas 1 wt cacl2 solution was dripped onto the ha contaminated membrane surface prior to drying at 80 c for 6 h subsequently the membrane was immersed in deionized water to remove excess cacl2 and then redried for further use 2 3 characterization of materials and membranes high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jeol jem 2011f japan with an acceleration voltage of 200 kv was used to observe the zno nanorods and lattice parameters the crystal structures were obtained by x ray diffraction xrd x pert3 powder panalytical the netherlands with

the conductivity of seawater and production of fresh water a high speed camera pco dimax hd germany was used to assess the process of a droplet bouncing off membrane 3d surface roughness was measured using a 3d optical profilometer rtec up dual model usa 2 4 seawater desalination performance of pvdf and pvdf zm membranes here membrane based air humidification dehumidification desalination mhdd was used to measure seawater permeate flux and salt rejection conventionally high salt rejection and low grade thermal utilization are advantageous su et al 2019 the real seawater was obtained from the yantian coast shenzhen a coastal city in southern china and its composition is shown in table s1 the test device for mhdd experimentation is shown in fig s1 the entire system is comprised of humidification and dehumidification seawater was heated to 60 c and then passed through the membrane at a rate of 200 ml min 1 liquid water could not enter the membrane pores due to the membrane s beneficial surface superhydrophobicity in addition to the high surface tension of water however water vapor was able under a humidity difference the vapor passing through the membrane then humidified the air on the membrane permeate side i e the humidification process simultaneously room temperature air was blown on the permeate side of the membrane at a flow rate of 0 5 m3 h 1 to enter the chiller for dehumidification fresh water was collected to monitor the conductivity and weight in real time the flow mode of the fluid on both sides of the membrane was a cross flow heat loss was minimized by wrapping all pipes with thermal insulation foam the effective membrane area was 7 065 cm2 and the relative humidity of the inlet was 50 the permeate flux j kg m 2 h 1 was calculated according to eq 1 ding et al 2020b 1 j δ m a δ t where a is the membrane area m2 δ t is the interval time h and δ m is the change in mass within the interval time the precent salt rejection r was calculated via eq 2 2 r c f c p c f where c is the percent salt concentration proportional to the conductivity whereas f and p represent the feed and permeate sides respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of the pvdf zm membrane the crystalline structures of the zno nanorods are shown in fig s2 zno with its single crystal structure was employed here for its highly ordered lattice structure readily observed in high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem no structural defects were observed including dislocations or stack errors fig s2a b the spacing between adjacent lattice faces stacked perpendicularly to the growth direction was 0 283 nm fig s2b inset which is consistent with the spacing of the zno 100 planes combined with the selective regional electron diffraction saed diagram fig s2a inset it was confirmed that the zno nanotubes grew along the direction of the 100 plane feng et al 2004 furthermore the x ray diffraction xrd peaks of the as prepared zno at 2θ equaled 31 7 34 3 36 1 47 4 56 5 62 7 and 67 8 corresponding to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 and 112 planes respectively and exhibited a hexagonal wurtzite zno structure wang et al 2020 pdf 36 1451 fig s2c the mxene sheets were prepared by etching the al layer of the max ti3alc2 phase fig s3 the tyndall scattering effect was observed in the mxene colloidal solution and the detected thickness of the porous mxene nanosheet was 1 5 nm corresponding to a single layer zhang and zhang 2022 the peaks of ti3alc2 followed its standard patterning pdf 52 0875 fig s3c ultimately it was determined that the max phase was successfully converted into mxene nanosheets with a d spacing of 1 4 nm owing to the disappearance of the 104 peak and left shift of the 002 peak in agreement with a previous report ghidiu et al 2014 the surface morphology is displayed in fig 2 a c a single highly porous pvdf membrane containing c and f elements and with a contact angle of 118 was selected as the substrate figs 2a and s5a pyrotechnic flower like zno nanoarrays with a rod diameter of 200 260 nm and length of 2 5 3 3 μm were grown on the substrate figs 2b s4a b and the hexagonal structure was consistent with xrd results extraneous zn and o elements were observed on the pvdf zno membrane surface fig s5b indicative of the successful growth of zno nanorods on the pvdf substrate the contact angle of the pvdf zno membrane was 64 4 making it likely that the sides of the nanorods were the main cause of hydrophilicity to improve membrane hydrophobicity sheet like mxene was grafted onto zno by reaction with hydrophilic groups on the side surface hydrophobicity was increased resulting from the dehydration reaction of the hydroxyl groups in zno and mxene in the form of zn o c a fibrous root like pvdf zm membrane with a contact angle of 158 5 was obtained fig 2c the appearance of elemental ti from the x ray energy dispersive spectrometry eds analysis indicated that mxene was covered on the surface fig s5c the zeta potential of the membrane surface was measured to assess the modification process fig s6 and revealed that the potential increased when zno grew on the pvdf membrane signifying that the zno seeds first attached on membrane via charge attraction however the addition of mxene reduced the zeta potential which may be explained by the electronegative charge of mxene chen et al 2020 this also served as additional evidence of the successful loading of mxene the detailed modification process was deduced from the xps results new peaks of zn and o binding energies zn 3d 9 7 zn 3p 88 3 zn 3s 139 5 zn 2p3 2 1017 zn 2p1 2 1040 and o 1s 531 8 ev in pvdf zno and ti ti 2p 456 0 ti 3p 32 4 ev in pvdf zm further demonstrated the growth of zno as well as the addition of mxene sheets the zn and ti content was 39 02 wt in pvdf zno and 0 33 wt in pvdf zm membranes respectively table s2 interestingly zno was first adsorbed near the c f group of pvdf as evidenced by the significant reduction in intensity of the cf2 peak in the c1s spectrum of pvdf zno fig s7a the binding energy of c f shifted to a higher energy after the growth of zno fig 2e possibly attributable to the shift of electrons in f towards zn thus increasing the binding energy furthermore the ch2 binding energy increased when zno was grown on the pvdf membrane fig s7a perhaps due to hydrogen bonding between the o in zno and the h in ch2 of the pvdf thereby causing electrons to deviate from the c atom similarly compared with pvdf zno the binding energies of zn 2p and o 1s in pvdf zm were both higher possibly resulting from the dehydration reaction of the hydroxyl groups in zno and mxene figs 2f and s7b in addition to the contact angle ca the process of a water droplet bouncing off the membrane was also observed using a high speed camera to study the superhydrophobicity fig 3 a the droplet 0 5 ml fully rebounded after falling onto the pvdf zm membrane surface from a position demonstrating the low adhesion forces between the water droplet and membrane surface potentially deriving from the higher surface roughness the surface root mean square roughness sq of the pvdf zm membrane was 1 955 μm 48 higher than that of the pure pvdf membrane 1 32 μm fig s8 based on the wettability of zno nanorods via reversible switching between uv irradiation and dark air storage feng et al 2004 a similar behavior of pvdf zm films was assumed and the reversible wetting of the pvdf zm membrane was studied after 30 min of uv irradiation obtained from a 300 w xenon lamp with a filter centered at 365 10 nm the ca of the newly fabricated membrane changed from 158 5 to 34 indicative of the hydrophobic membrane transferring to hydrophilic fig 3b after 3 days of dark air storage at 60 c the membrane returned to its hydrophobic static state ca 152 2 thus the controllable wettability of the membrane was an essential characteristic this process was repeated over five times fig 3d notably the uv irradiation time required for the pvdf zm membrane to convert to hydrophilic 0 5 h was significantly lower than that of the zno film previously reported 2 h as the addition of mxene enhanced uv light absorption by zno thereby making it easier to convert to a hydrophilic static state this process was supported by the derived uv vis absorption spectra in which the absorbance of pvdf zm was higher than that of the pvdf zno membrane fig s9 to detect the pvdf zm membrane self repair rate from hydrophilic to hydrophobic the relationship between surface ca and dark storage time was studied fig 3c the ca of the uv irradiated membrane quickly recovered to 89 of the final value after 12 h of dark storage gradually increasing to 152 2 within 3 days 3 2 seawater desalination performance next the permeate flux and salt rejection for real seawater of the pure pvdf and pvdf zm membranes were tested using a homemade test device fig s1 for the untreated pvdf membrane the initial permeate flux and salt rejection were 4 1 kg m2 h 1 and 99 96 respectively fig 4 a the permeability began to decrease after 26 h of seawater treatment falling to 66 of the initial flux after 44 h conversely the flux of the pvdf zm membrane fluctuated slightly without an obvious decrease across 120 h of operations due to the superhydrophobicity and increased membrane surface roughness which creates air gaps between the membrane and water thus preventing direct contact with the pollutants in the water and resulting in a greater anti fouling ability zhang et al 2022 the original flux of the pvdf zm membrane was slightly lower than that of the pristine pvdf membrane 90 2 of the pvdf flux this slightly decreased flux indicated that the addition of zm increased the mass transfer resistance of the membrane the salt rejection of both membranes was 99 95 indicating they remained relatively undamaged throughout operation the surface scanning electron microscope sem images of the post test membranes were assessed to characterize contamination whereas large salt crystals and limescales were observed on the pvdf membrane surface fig s10a little fouling was seen on the pvdf zm membrane surface fig s10b further corroborated by the eds results fig s11 the overall structural changes of the post analysis membranes are shown in fig s12 compared to the pre test analyses of the pvdf and pvdf zm membranes additional weak peaks at 1645 and 1644 cm 1 ascribed to c o were observed after testing from the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum fig s12a indicating minor organic contamination occurred on the membrane surface in contrast the xrd results showed that a peak of limescale caso4 appeared on the post test pvdf membrane while no such apparent change in the peak was observed for the pvdf zm membrane pre or post test fig s12b this supports the strong anti scaling ability of the pvdf zm membrane 3 3 membrane self recovery ability via hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible switching although superhydrophobic membranes have shown excellent pollution resistance in seawater desalination the hydrophobic pollutants present such as proteins and humic substances are more likely to adsorb the surfaces compared to hydrophilic surfaces warsinger et al 2015 however previous analysis did not examine such effects because of the relatively low proportion of hydrophobic matter in seawater and short experimental running time table s1 accordingly 1 g l 1 of bovine serum albumin bsa and 1g l 1 humic acid ha were used in the present research to simulate heavy membrane contamination by hydrophobic organic compounds subsequently the desorption of these pollutants from the membrane was evaluated by switching the surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic under uv irradiation elemental analyses of the membrane before and after uv irradiation are shown in fig 5 the content of n in bsa contaminated pvdf zm membrane was 0 75 wt whereas that in the uv treated pvdf zm membrane was 0 21 wt representing a decrease of 72 similarly after humic acid contamination ca levels were reduced by 80 post uv exposure additionally the permeate flux following pollution and uv irradiation was normalized based on the initial pvdf zm membrane fig 4b the flux decreased to 69 3 of the original membrane after bsa contamination and subsequently recovered to 93 4 following uv light application permeability dropped to 83 6 of the initial value after ha pollution and recovered to 97 9 following uv irradiation notably the salt rejection of all membranes was 99 9 indicating the unwetting property of the membranes it can thus be concluded that the reversible transformation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic pvdf zm membrane surfaces could effectively reduce pollution and realize membrane self repair compared with previously reported cleaning methods such as acid or alkaline cleaning the method proposed here is milder and easier to implement to further explore the self cleaning mechanisms the contaminated membrane was added to a sealed glass bottle of deionized water and uv light was applied the desorbed substances were collected by freeze drying the aqueous solution for both the bsa and ha contaminated membranes the ftir spectra of the desorbed substances were largely consistent with the original pollutants save for a new peak at 1385 cm 1 assigned to co 3 2 fig s13 in addition to desorption the partial decomposition of the pollutants may further explain this observation the ph and conductivity of the solution pre and post uv irradiation are shown in table s3 displaying the reduced ph and increased electrical conductivity further supported the existence of co 3 2 3 4 antifouling mechanism by hydrophilic hydrophobic reversible conversion both organic and inorganic pollutants in seawater can affect membrane stability during long term desalination operations hydrophilic pollutants have been shown to be reduced by hydrophobic membranes in previous work su et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 here a similar conclusion was also observed on one hand liquid seawater cannot directly contact the pvdf zm membrane surface owing to its superhydrophobicity and roughness figs 3 and s8 in addition to the formation of an air gap between the membrane surface and seawater acting as a barrier and preventing water soluble pollutants according to the cassie state cassie and baxter 1944 alternatively surface electronegativity gave an electrostatic repulsion to the anion fig s6 resulting in decreased adsorption of contamination thus improving the membrane anti fouling ability however hydrophobic contaminations such as protein and humid acid were readily adsorbed on the hydrophobic membrane surface degrading membrane performance as hydrophilic membrane surfaces are reported to be less susceptible to hydrophobic substance pollution kou et al 2003 the pvdf zm membrane here was fabricated with a hydrophilic hydrophobic reversible switching property to achieve self recovery fig 6 presents a conceptual diagram membrane surface properties changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic following uv irradiation for 30 min due to the excited electron transitions of zno creating electron hole pairs al mayyahi and deng 2018 these holes can react with water molecules on the membrane surface to form oxygen or oh groups these two molecules o and oh compete to adsorb onto the membrane surface however compared with oxygen adsorption the defect site is more conducive to hydroxyl adsorption feng et al 2004 accordingly the hydrophilicity is improved the rough surface structure further assists with filling the membrane grooves with water the photo generated electrons could react with oxygen molecules o2 to produce superoxide radical o 2 additionally mxene enhances the absorption of uv light fig s9 resulting in a shorter irradiation time hydrophobic contaminants adsorb to hydrophobic surfaces via van der waals and electrostatic interactions in addition to hydrophobic effects i e the favorable interaction between the nonpolar hydrophobic regions of the contaminants and the membrane surface for hydrophilic surfaces lower hydrophobic fouling was observed owing to these polar interactions becoming unfavorable one previous report showed that the adhesion of bsa to the surface of a superhydrophilic membrane was lower than that on the surface of a non superhydrophilic membrane supporting that the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface determines its interaction with hydrophobic pollutants tiraferri et al 2012 the conversion of the hydrophobic surface to hydrophilic thus reduced the adsorption force between hydrophobic pollutants prompting pollutant desorption alternatively the o 2 and holes can split pollutants into h2o and co2 owing to their strong oxidation ability thus removing contamination next the uv irradiated membrane surface wettability was reconverted from hydrophilic to hydrophobic via an extended treatment in dark conditions where the unstable hydroxyl adsorption was gradually replaced by more stable and stronger oxygen adsorption feng et al 2004 thus improving the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface and restoring membrane performance to its original state fig 4b the processes of hydrophobic pollution hydrophilic cleaning were operated and pvdf zm membrane self recovery was achieved via this reversible hydrophilic hydrophobic conversion 4 conclusions in summary a self healing pvdf zm membrane was fabricated to realize the intelligent alternation of uv illumination and dark storage for seawater desalination the fibrous root like zno mxene zm grew on the pvdf membrane surface to achieve surface superhydrophobicity via increased roughness acting as a barrier preventing membrane wetting in seawater the pvdf zm membrane exhibited outstanding salt rejection 99 5 with a comparable permeate flux 3 93 kg m 2 h 1 owing to its superhydrophobicity and large roughness the modified membrane maintained excellent stability for 120 h in addition to strong anti fouling ability as the superhydrophobic membranes suffered from hydrophobic substance pollution high concentrations of bsa and ha 1 g l 1 were used to assess its self recovery ability of the created pvdf zm membrane membrane permeate flux recovered to 93 4 and 97 9 of the initial flux after remediation from the bsa and ha contaminated membranes respectively as a result of the reversible conversion between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces when the membrane surface property was transferred from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity via uv irradiation the adsorption forces between the membrane surface and hydrophobic contamination was weakened and the contamination were readily desorbed from the membrane surface the surface then reformed back to its original state superhydrophobicity after dark storage thus achieving membrane self healing the pvdf zm membrane created here

16109,seawater desalination is regarded as a possible way to overcome current shortages of fresh water and membrane based air humidification dehumidification desalination mhdd represents a promising technique owing to its high quality freshwater and cost effectiveness however its development is restricted by membrane fouling while a superhydrophobic membrane provides resistance to hydrophilic fouling it remains susceptible to hydrophobic fouling here a polyvinylidene fluoride zno mxene pvdf zm membrane with a reversible conversion between superhydrophobicity and hydrophilicity was fabricated to achieve universal fouling resistance it earned a competitive permeate flux 3 93 kg m 2 h 1 and an excellent salt rejection 99 5 the membrane exhibited a strong anti hydrophilic fouling ability benefiting from its superhydrophobicity and rough surface the adsorbed hydrophobic contaminants could desorb from the membrane surface under uv irradiation when transforming the surface wettability into hydrophilicity exhibiting an anti hydrophobic fouling ability subsequently the membrane surface returned to the hydrophobic state under dark conditions the membrane recovered 90 of the original permeation flux while maintaining a salt rejection of 99 5 thus realizing membrane self healing the pvdf zm membrane holds promise for sustainable desalination applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords desalination anti fouling self healing superhydrophobicity reversible conversion of hydrophobicity hydrophilicity 1 introduction fresh water is an essential component for much life on the planet and its importance is self evident however pre existing shortages of fresh water resources are being further aggravated by the economic development of water resources and pollution as reduction in expenditure alone cannot meet the current global demand additional resources must be sought after and desalination of marine water represents one potential approach to address this issue ding et al 2020a pistocchi et al 2020 in particular membrane distillation md has become a rapidly growing area of research and development due to its tolerance to high salinity levels excellent salt rejection and low operational pressure ma et al 2021 murugesan et al 2020 membrane based air humidification dehumidification desalination mhdd combined with solar geothermal or waste heat sources offers a cost effective thermally driven desalination technology zhang and zhang 2022 however scaling and fouling contamination of membranes remain a major obstacle to their industrial application kim et al 2020 warsinger et al 2015 many scaling mitigation technologies have been analyzed including micro nano filtration pre treatment alklaibi and lior 2006 thermal water softening gryta 2010 use of antiscalants gryta 2012 magnetic water treatment gryta 2011 etc goh et al 2018 although operating and investment capital costs remained largely neglected the most efficient strategy for improving antifouling performance is to tailor the membrane properties to specific needs rana et al modified pvdf membrane by in situ phase inversion process to promote the industrial application of membrane distillation in seawater desalination li et al 2019 yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2019 furthermore the superhydrophobic modification on the membrane surface has a significant effect on reducing the formation of scale since the hydrophobic layer acts as a buffer layer of scale inhibition by reducing nucleation and particle adhesion on the surface su et al 2020 presently superhydrophobic modification is mainly achieved by increasing surface roughness while decreasing the surface energy deka et al 2019 accordingly fluorinated chemicals are the most commonly used hydrophobic modifiers for their low surface energy however their derived superhydrophobic surfaces can readily adsorb natural organic matter e g humid acid ha and proteins meng et al 2018 2014 therefore membrane cleaning is an essential component to increasing stable operation time treatment with chemicals such as chlorine or acids is considered effective at restoring membrane permeability although it may destroy the membrane structure or further degrade the water quality thereby increasing treatment costs physical treatment can avoid these problems ye et al 2019 but its effectiveness is reduced and requires greater levels of energy consumption abdel karim et al 2021 thus it remains urgent to find an effective and economically viable method of membrane cleaning in general superhydrophobic surfaces are resistant to hydrophilic contaminants whereas hydrophilic surfaces are less susceptible to hydrophobic contaminants from this perspective the ideal membrane should be both superhydrophobic and superhydrophilic because when the membrane is superhydrophobic it is a hydrophilic pollutant obstacle and when it is switched to superhydrophilic the hydrophobic substances can be easily cleaned although creating such a membrane represents a notably difficult task one with reversible hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity transition may help achieve this goal jucker and clark 1994 feng et al 2004 realized a reversible superhydrophobicity to superhydrophilicity transition of aligned zno nanorod films by alternating between states of uv illumination and dark storage the holes generated by zno excited by uv light could react with water molecules to form oh groups and adsorb onto the surface of the film transforming into hydrophilic states after dark storage the unstable hydroxyl adsorption was gradually replaced by more stable and stronger oxygen adsorption restoring membrane performance to hydrophobic state however in real fabrication unreacted zn oh 2 is always left on zno surfaces making zno crystals hydrophilic therefore a direct use of zno to realize hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible conversion is difficult to achieve in practical circumstances pan et al 2019 the hydrophobic modification of zno is required first before its hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible properties can be used a relatively young family of 2d materials known as mxenes are obtained by etching the a layer from m n 1 ax n where m refers to a transition metal a represents a main group element mostly iii a or iv a and x is c and or n ding et al 2018 ghidiu et al 2014 sang et al 2016 mxenes represent by the formula m n 1 x n t x where t x is o oh and f possess outstanding antibacterial properties as well as excellent mechanical stability antifouling activity and adjustable surface chemistry making it a strong candidate for application in water treatment indeed previous studies have indicated that mxene based membranes exhibit high flux and excellent durability for water desalination wang et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 in addition mxene is prone to hydrophobic modification owing to its surface functional groups chen et al 2020 and perhaps most importantly the f and oh terminated mxene are semiconductors with small band gaps tang and zhou 2013 a combination of mxene and zno is expected to achieve superhydrophobicity and has no hindrance to hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible conversion to the best of our knowledge the work here represents the first application of reversible conversion between hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity in the field of membrane distillation for antifouling in this study a fibrous root like superhydrophobic membrane with reversible conversion between hydrophilicity was fabricated and applied to seawater desalination for anti fouling fig 1 zno nanorods were first grown on a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membrane pvdf zno surface via electrostatic interactions using a simple hydrothermal synthesis method then mxene sheets were deposited on the zno surface and superhydrophobic modification was realized by a dehydration reaction deriving pvdf zm uv irradiation and dark storage were used as the switching methods for hydrophilic hydrophobic reversible conversion compared with an untreated pvdf membrane the permeation flux of the modified membrane remained stable within 120 h thereby showing excellent anti scale ability furthermore additional hydrophobic contaminants were applied to the membrane surface to assess its self healing ability the hydrophobic scale attached to the surface was easily desorbed owing to changes in surface hydrophilicity subsequently the membrane was then placed in the dark to recover hydrophobicity the permeate flux of the healed membrane reached 90 of the initial flux 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf 0 45 μm pore size membranes were purchased from millipore massachusetts usa to serve as the substrate layer max ti3alc2

to previous work ding et al 2018 zhang and zhang 2022 lif 2 g was dissolved in 40 ml of 6 mol l 1 6 m hcl and mixed thoroughly for 5 min then 1 g of ti3alc2 was slowly added to the mixture over 24 h at 35 c while stirring the resulting product was centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min and washed several times with dw until supernatant ph 6 the precipitate was then dispersed in 100 ml of dw under ultrasonication for 30 min to delaminate the mxene flakes the solution was again centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min and this process was repeated several times until no precipitate was visible at the bottom of the tube a light green supernatant the colloidal solution of mxene was obtained 2 2 2 fabrication of the pvdf zno membrane zno arrays were grown via a hydrothermal method yeom et al 2017 zno nanoparticles were first dissolved in dw 25 wt to form the seed solution then 1 μl of the seed solution was dispersed in 100 ml dw under sonication for 10 min and the solution was vacuum filtered onto the pvdf membrane to assist with the uniform growth of zno nanoarrays next the membrane was suspended in 1 wt zno nanoparticle solution with magnetic stirring for 30 min followed by washing with dw and drying at room temperature for 24 h after uniformly coating the zno seeds on the pvdf substrate pyrotechnic flower like zno arrays were grown by floating the substrate in an aqueous solution of zn no3 2 6h2o 50 mm and hmta 50 mm at 90 c for 4 h the pvdf zno membrane was obtained after rinsing with dw and drying at room temperature 2 2 3 fabrication of pvdf zm membrane the pvdf zno membrane was floated in mxene solution at 5 c for 12 h and then rinsed with dw the membrane was dehydrated at 90 c for 2 h and 120 c for 2 h before obtaining the pvdf zm membrane 2 2 4 preparation of contaminated membrane next 0 1 g bsa and 0 1 g ha were dispersed in 100 ml of dw each the pvdf zm membrane was suspended in the bsa and ha aqueous solutions for 3 h while stirring afterwards the bsa contaminated membrane was dried at 80 c for 6 h whereas 1 wt cacl2 solution was dripped onto the ha contaminated membrane surface prior to drying at 80 c for 6 h subsequently the membrane was immersed in deionized water to remove excess cacl2 and then redried for further use 2 3 characterization of materials and membranes high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem jeol jem 2011f japan with an acceleration voltage of 200 kv was used to observe the zno nanorods and lattice parameters the crystal structures were obtained by x ray diffraction xrd x pert3 powder panalytical the netherlands with

scientific usa was carried out across the range of 650 4000 cm 1 the elemental valence state on the surface of the membrane was determined using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps axis ultra dld uk the membrane surface wettability was acquired using an oca40 micro contact angle system dataphysics germany with a 3 μl water droplet the average contact angle was measured at five different positions for each sample a solid surface zeta potential analyzer surpass anton paar austria was used to test the membrane surface zeta potential under different ph conditions a solid ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer u 3010 hitachi japan was employed to evaluate uv absorbance in the range of 350 800 nm at a speed of 300 nm min 1 an electrical conductivity meter dds 307a china was used to monitor the conductivity of seawater and production of fresh water a high speed camera pco dimax hd germany was used to assess the process of a droplet bouncing off membrane 3d surface roughness was measured using a 3d optical profilometer rtec up dual model usa 2 4 seawater desalination performance of pvdf and pvdf zm membranes here membrane based air humidification dehumidification desalination mhdd was used to measure seawater permeate flux and salt rejection conventionally high salt rejection and low grade thermal utilization are advantageous su et al 2019 the real seawater was obtained from the yantian coast shenzhen a coastal city in southern china and its composition is shown in table s1 the test device for mhdd experimentation is shown in fig s1 the entire system is comprised of humidification and dehumidification seawater was heated to 60 c and then passed through the membrane at a rate of 200 ml min 1 liquid water could not enter the membrane pores due to the membrane s beneficial surface superhydrophobicity in addition to the high surface tension of water however water vapor was able under a humidity difference the vapor passing through the membrane then humidified the air on the membrane permeate side i e the humidification process simultaneously room temperature air was blown on the permeate side of the membrane at a flow rate of 0 5 m3 h 1 to enter the chiller for dehumidification fresh water was collected to monitor the conductivity and weight in real time the flow mode of the fluid on both sides of the membrane was a cross flow heat loss was minimized by wrapping all pipes with thermal insulation foam the effective membrane area was 7 065 cm2 and the relative humidity of the inlet was 50 the permeate flux j kg m 2 h 1 was calculated according to eq 1 ding et al 2020b 1 j δ m a δ t where a is the membrane area m2 δ t is the interval time h and δ m is the change in mass within the interval time the precent salt rejection r was calculated via eq 2 2 r c f c p c f where c is the percent salt concentration proportional to the conductivity whereas f and p represent the feed and permeate sides respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of the pvdf zm membrane the crystalline structures of the zno nanorods are shown in fig s2 zno with its single crystal structure was employed here for its highly ordered lattice structure readily observed in high resolution transmission electron microscopy hrtem no structural defects were observed including dislocations or stack errors fig s2a b the spacing between adjacent lattice faces stacked perpendicularly to the growth direction was 0 283 nm fig s2b inset which is consistent with the spacing of the zno 100 planes combined with the selective regional electron diffraction saed diagram fig s2a inset it was confirmed that the zno nanotubes grew along the direction of the 100 plane feng et al 2004 furthermore the x ray diffraction xrd peaks of the as prepared zno at 2θ equaled 31 7 34 3 36 1 47 4 56 5 62 7 and 67 8 corresponding to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 and 112 planes respectively and exhibited a hexagonal wurtzite zno structure wang et al 2020 pdf 36 1451 fig s2c the mxene sheets were prepared by etching the al layer of the max ti3alc2 phase fig s3 the tyndall scattering effect was observed in the mxene colloidal solution and the detected thickness of the porous mxene nanosheet was 1 5 nm corresponding to a single layer zhang and zhang 2022 the peaks of ti3alc2 followed its standard patterning pdf 52 0875 fig s3c ultimately it was determined that the max phase was successfully converted into mxene nanosheets with a d spacing of 1 4 nm owing to the disappearance of the 104 peak and left shift of the 002 peak in agreement with a previous report ghidiu et al 2014 the surface morphology is displayed in fig 2 a c a single highly porous pvdf membrane containing c and f elements and with a contact angle of 118 was selected as the substrate figs 2a and s5a pyrotechnic flower like zno nanoarrays with a rod diameter of 200 260 nm and length of 2 5 3 3 μm were grown on the substrate figs 2b s4a b and the hexagonal structure was consistent with xrd results extraneous zn and o elements were observed on the pvdf zno membrane surface fig s5b indicative of the successful growth of zno nanorods on the pvdf substrate the contact angle of the pvdf zno membrane was 64 4 making it likely that the sides of the nanorods were the main cause of hydrophilicity to improve membrane hydrophobicity sheet like mxene was grafted onto zno by reaction with hydrophilic groups on the side surface hydrophobicity was increased resulting from the dehydration reaction of the hydroxyl groups in zno and mxene in the form of zn o c a fibrous root like pvdf zm membrane with a contact angle of 158 5 was obtained fig 2c the appearance of elemental ti from the x ray energy dispersive spectrometry eds analysis indicated that mxene was covered on the surface fig s5c the zeta potential of the membrane surface was measured to assess the modification process fig s6 and revealed that the potential increased when zno grew on the pvdf membrane signifying that the zno seeds first attached on membrane via charge attraction however the addition of mxene reduced the zeta potential which may be explained by the electronegative charge of mxene chen et al 2020 this also served as additional evidence of the successful loading of mxene the detailed modification process was deduced from the xps results new peaks of zn and o binding energies zn 3d 9 7 zn 3p 88 3 zn 3s 139 5 zn 2p3 2 1017 zn 2p1 2 1040 and o 1s 531 8 ev in pvdf zno and ti ti 2p 456 0 ti 3p 32 4 ev in pvdf zm further demonstrated the growth of zno as well as the addition of mxene sheets the zn and ti content was 39 02 wt in pvdf zno and 0 33 wt in pvdf zm membranes respectively table s2 interestingly zno was first adsorbed near the c f group of pvdf as evidenced by the significant reduction in intensity of the cf2 peak in the c1s spectrum of pvdf zno fig s7a the binding energy of c f shifted to a higher energy after the growth of zno fig 2e possibly attributable to the shift of electrons in f towards zn thus increasing the binding energy furthermore the ch2 binding energy increased when zno was grown on the pvdf membrane fig s7a perhaps due to hydrogen bonding between the o in zno and the h in ch2 of the pvdf thereby causing electrons to deviate from the c atom similarly compared with pvdf zno the binding energies of zn 2p and o 1s in pvdf zm were both higher possibly resulting from the dehydration reaction of the hydroxyl groups in zno and mxene figs 2f and s7b in addition to the contact angle ca the process of a water droplet bouncing off the membrane was also observed using a high speed camera to study the superhydrophobicity fig 3 a the droplet 0 5 ml fully rebounded after falling onto the pvdf zm membrane surface from a position demonstrating the low adhesion forces between the water droplet and membrane surface potentially deriving from the higher surface roughness the surface root mean square roughness sq of the pvdf zm membrane was 1 955 μm 48 higher than that of the pure pvdf membrane 1 32 μm fig s8 based on the wettability of zno nanorods via reversible switching between uv irradiation and dark air storage feng et al 2004 a similar behavior of pvdf zm films was assumed and the reversible wetting of the pvdf zm membrane was studied after 30 min of uv irradiation obtained from a 300 w xenon lamp with a filter centered at 365 10 nm the ca of the newly fabricated membrane changed from 158 5 to 34 indicative of the hydrophobic membrane transferring to hydrophilic fig 3b after 3 days of dark air storage at 60 c the membrane returned to its hydrophobic static state ca 152 2 thus the controllable wettability of the membrane was an essential characteristic this process was repeated over five times fig 3d notably the uv irradiation time required for the pvdf zm membrane to convert to hydrophilic 0 5 h was significantly lower than that of the zno film previously reported 2 h as the addition of mxene enhanced uv light absorption by zno thereby making it easier to convert to a hydrophilic static state this process was supported by the derived uv vis absorption spectra in which the absorbance of pvdf zm was higher than that of the pvdf zno membrane fig s9 to detect the pvdf zm membrane self repair rate from hydrophilic to hydrophobic the relationship between surface ca and dark storage time was studied fig 3c the ca of the uv irradiated membrane quickly recovered to 89 of the final value after 12 h of dark storage gradually increasing to 152 2 within 3 days 3 2 seawater desalination performance next the permeate flux and salt rejection for real seawater of the pure pvdf and pvdf zm membranes were tested using a homemade test device fig s1 for the untreated pvdf membrane the initial permeate flux and salt rejection were 4 1 kg m2 h 1 and 99 96 respectively fig 4 a the permeability began to decrease after 26 h of seawater treatment falling to 66 of the initial flux after 44 h conversely the flux of the pvdf zm membrane fluctuated slightly without an obvious decrease across 120 h of operations due to the superhydrophobicity and increased membrane surface roughness which creates air gaps between the membrane and water thus preventing direct contact with the pollutants in the water and resulting in a greater anti fouling ability zhang et al 2022 the original flux of the pvdf zm membrane was slightly lower than that of the pristine pvdf membrane 90 2 of the pvdf flux this slightly decreased flux indicated that the addition of zm increased the mass transfer resistance of the membrane the salt rejection of both membranes was 99 95 indicating they remained relatively undamaged throughout operation the surface scanning electron microscope sem images of the post test membranes were assessed to characterize contamination whereas large salt crystals and limescales were observed on the pvdf membrane surface fig s10a little fouling was seen on the pvdf zm membrane surface fig s10b further corroborated by the eds results fig s11 the overall structural changes of the post analysis membranes are shown in fig s12 compared to the pre test analyses of the pvdf and pvdf zm membranes additional weak peaks at 1645 and 1644 cm 1 ascribed to c o were observed after testing from the fourier transform infrared ftir spectrum fig s12a indicating minor organic contamination occurred on the membrane surface in contrast the xrd results showed that a peak of limescale caso4 appeared on the post test pvdf membrane while no such apparent change in the peak was observed for the pvdf zm membrane pre or post test fig s12b this supports the strong anti scaling ability of the pvdf zm membrane 3 3 membrane self recovery ability via hydrophobic hydrophilic reversible switching although superhydrophobic membranes have shown excellent pollution resistance in seawater desalination the hydrophobic pollutants present such as proteins and humic substances are more likely to adsorb the surfaces compared to hydrophilic surfaces warsinger et al 2015 however previous analysis did not examine such effects because of the relatively low proportion of hydrophobic matter in seawater and short experimental running time table s1 accordingly 1 g l 1 of bovine serum albumin bsa and 1g l 1 humic acid ha were used in the present research to simulate heavy membrane contamination by hydrophobic organic compounds subsequently the desorption of these pollutants from the membrane was evaluated by switching the surface properties from hydrophobic to hydrophilic under uv irradiation elemental analyses of the membrane before and after uv irradiation are shown in fig 5 the content of n in bsa contaminated pvdf zm membrane was 0 75 wt whereas that in the uv treated pvdf zm membrane was 0 21 wt representing a decrease of 72 similarly after humic acid contamination ca levels were reduced by 80 post uv exposure additionally the permeate flux following pollution and uv irradiation was normalized based on the initial pvdf zm membrane fig 4b the flux decreased to 69 3 of the original membrane after bsa contamination and subsequently recovered to 93 4 following uv light application permeability dropped to 83 6 of the initial value after ha pollution and recovered to 97 9 following uv irradiation notably the salt rejection of all membranes was 99 9 indicating the unwetting property of the membranes it can thus be concluded that the reversible transformation between hydrophilic and hydrophobic pvdf zm membrane surfaces could effectively reduce pollution and realize membrane self repair compared with previously reported cleaning methods such as acid or alkaline cleaning the method proposed here is milder and easier to implement to further explore the self cleaning mechanisms the contaminated membrane was added to a sealed glass bottle of deionized water and uv light was applied the desorbed substances were collected by freeze drying the aqueous solution for both the bsa and ha contaminated membranes the ftir spectra of the desorbed substances were largely consistent with the original pollutants save for a new peak at 1385 cm 1 assigned to co 3 2 fig s13 in addition to desorption the partial decomposition of the pollutants may further explain this observation the ph and conductivity of the solution pre and post uv irradiation are shown in table s3 displaying the reduced ph and increased electrical conductivity further supported the existence of co 3 2 3 4 antifouling mechanism by hydrophilic hydrophobic reversible conversion both organic and inorganic pollutants in seawater can affect membrane stability during long term desalination operations hydrophilic pollutants have been shown to be reduced by hydrophobic membranes in previous work su et al 2020 zhang et al 2022 here a similar conclusion was also observed on one hand liquid seawater cannot directly contact the pvdf zm membrane surface owing to its superhydrophobicity and roughness figs 3 and s8 in addition to the formation of an air gap between the membrane surface and seawater acting as a barrier and preventing water soluble pollutants according to the cassie state cassie and baxter 1944 alternatively surface electronegativity gave an electrostatic repulsion to the anion fig s6 resulting in decreased adsorption of contamination thus improving the membrane anti fouling ability however hydrophobic contaminations such as protein and humid acid were readily adsorbed on the hydrophobic membrane surface degrading membrane performance as hydrophilic membrane surfaces are reported to be less susceptible to hydrophobic substance pollution kou et al 2003 the pvdf zm membrane here was fabricated with a hydrophilic hydrophobic reversible switching property to achieve self recovery fig 6 presents a conceptual diagram membrane surface properties changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic following uv irradiation for 30 min due to the excited electron transitions of zno creating electron hole pairs al mayyahi and deng 2018 these holes can react with water molecules on the membrane surface to form oxygen or oh groups these two molecules o and oh compete to adsorb onto the membrane surface however compared with oxygen adsorption the defect site is more conducive to hydroxyl adsorption feng et al 2004 accordingly the hydrophilicity is improved the rough surface structure further assists with filling the membrane grooves with water the photo generated electrons could react with oxygen molecules o2 to produce superoxide radical o 2 additionally mxene enhances the absorption of uv light fig s9 resulting in a shorter irradiation time hydrophobic contaminants adsorb to hydrophobic surfaces via van der waals and electrostatic interactions in addition to hydrophobic effects i e the favorable interaction between the nonpolar hydrophobic regions of the contaminants and the membrane surface for hydrophilic surfaces lower hydrophobic fouling was observed owing to these polar interactions becoming unfavorable one previous report showed that the adhesion of bsa to the surface of a superhydrophilic membrane was lower than that on the surface of a non superhydrophilic membrane supporting that the hydrophilicity of the membrane surface determines its interaction with hydrophobic pollutants tiraferri et al 2012 the conversion of the hydrophobic surface to hydrophilic thus reduced the adsorption force between hydrophobic pollutants prompting pollutant desorption alternatively the o 2 and holes can split pollutants into h2o and co2 owing to their strong oxidation ability thus removing contamination next the uv irradiated membrane surface wettability was reconverted from hydrophilic to hydrophobic via an extended treatment in dark conditions where the unstable hydroxyl adsorption was gradually replaced by more stable and stronger oxygen adsorption feng et al 2004 thus improving the hydrophobicity of the membrane surface and restoring membrane performance to its original state fig 4b the processes of hydrophobic pollution hydrophilic cleaning were operated and pvdf zm membrane self recovery was achieved via this reversible hydrophilic hydrophobic conversion 4 conclusions in summary a self healing pvdf zm membrane was fabricated to realize the intelligent alternation of uv illumination and dark storage for seawater desalination the fibrous root like zno mxene zm grew on the pvdf membrane surface to achieve surface superhydrophobicity via increased roughness acting as a barrier preventing membrane wetting in seawater the pvdf zm membrane exhibited outstanding salt rejection 99 5 with a comparable permeate flux 3 93 kg m 2 h 1 owing to its superhydrophobicity and large roughness the modified membrane maintained excellent stability for 120 h in addition to strong anti fouling ability as the superhydrophobic membranes suffered from hydrophobic substance pollution high concentrations of bsa and ha 1 g l 1 were used to assess its self recovery ability of the created pvdf zm membrane membrane permeate flux recovered to 93 4 and 97 9 of the initial flux after remediation from the bsa and ha contaminated membranes respectively as a result of the reversible conversion between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces when the membrane surface property was transferred from hydrophobicity to hydrophilicity via uv irradiation the adsorption forces between the membrane surface and hydrophobic contamination was weakened and the contamination were readily desorbed from the membrane surface the surface then reformed back to its original state superhydrophobicity after dark storage thus achieving membrane self healing the pvdf zm membrane created here not only resisted hydrophilic fouling but repaired hydrophobic contaminations without extra reagents thus pvdf zm membranes represent a strong candidate for sustainably reducing the operating costs of seawater desalination processes and the designed membrane with universal pollution resistance here is expected to achieve a breakthrough in sustainable seawater desalination appendix a supplementary
