ecology relationships were modelled that tested different invertebrate community responses taxonomic functional flow response guilds individual taxa most flow alteration ecology relationships were not statistically significant highlighting the absence of consistent detectable ecological responses to long term water management operations a small number of significant statistical models provided insights into how flow alterations transformed specific ecological assets including ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa which are rheophilic in nature being positively associated with groundwater abstraction effects reducing river discharges by 0 15 this represents a key finding from a water resource management operation perspective given that such flow alteration conditions were observed on average in over two thirds of the study sites examined in a small number of instances specific invertebrate responses displayed relative declines associated with the most severe groundwater abstraction effects and artificial hydrological inputs predominantly effluent water returns the strongest flow ecology relationships were recorded during spring months when invertebrate communities were most responsive to antecedent minimum and maximum discharges and average flow conditions in the preceding summer months results from this study provide new evidence indicating how groundwater and surface water resources can be managed to conserve riverine ecological assets moreover the ensemble of flow alteration and flow ecology relationships established in this study could be

is a key challenge of the 21st century naiman and dudgeon 2011 arthington et al 2018 biota inhabiting riverine environments have developed a suite of morphological behavioural and life history strategies over evolutionary timescales which allow them to inhabit rivers conveying naturally varying flow regimes lytle and poff 2004 the transformation of river flow regimes threatens biota devoid of the necessary traits required to adapt to anthropogenic flow alterations ruhi et al 2018 as such there have been numerous attempts to rehabilitate altered flow regimes and mitigate aquatic

2017 studies quantifying ecological responses to anthropogenic flow alterations i e flow alteration ecology relationships are more limited globally compared to those establishing flow ecology relationships bradley et al 2017 which hinders our scientific understanding of how existing water resource management operations have influenced riverine ecosystems moreover studies developing flow alteration ecology relationships based on groundwater abstraction effects have been notoriously understudied poff and zimmerman 2010 instead riverine ecological responses to groundwater abstraction are often inferred based on experimental designs manipulating water volumes associated with hypothetical low flow abstraction scenarios dewson et al 2007 aspin et al 2019 as a result there remains a paucity of evidence quantifying ecosystem responses to empirically derived groundwater abstraction pressures gleeson and richter 2018 such ecological evidence and appraisals are urgently required given the pervasive effects of groundwater abstraction on riverine ecosystems which have reduced river discharges by an average of 10 worldwide de graaf et al 2014 and greater societal water demands are projected to increase groundwater abstraction pressures in the future van loon et al 2016 to our knowledge this study provides the first evidence of long term 1995 2016 ecological responses to anthropogenic flow alterations driven by both groundwater and surface water management operations as well as historic hydrological discharge variations to achieve this freshwater invertebrate biomonitoring data was combined with regional groundwater model outputs to construct an ensemble of flow alteration and flow ecology relationships 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study region the study region is situated in the south west of the united kingdom uk fig 1 within the operational boundaries of the water company wessex water plc ww who manage water resources for 2 8 million inhabitants the focus of this study was centred on groundwater dominated river systems predominantly underlain by cretaceous chalk a white fine grained limestone calcium carbonate the underlying aquifer supports more groundwater abstraction than any other aquifer in the uk and accounts for 60 of the groundwater used across england and wales macdonald and allen 2011 in the ww region 75 of water abstracted by is derived from groundwater sources across the study region from 72 public water sources wessex water 2014 however outflows from 97 effluent water returns results in some river reaches conveying greater flows than would occur naturally in addition the study region contains 6 low flow alleviation schemes where groundwater is augmented into select rivers which fall below a designated discharge the study region is dominated by arable agriculture and grassland national river flow 2020 and the rivers are typically characterized by high dissolved oxygen levels alkalinity and nutrient levels white et al 2018 2 2 wessex basin groundwater model the wessex basin groundwater model see soley et al 2012 was used to characterize anthropogenic flow alterations and hydrological variations at each study site the wessex basin model divides the ww region underlain by cretaceous chalk and upper greensand into 250 250m grid cells the wessex basin model has been adapted from the finite difference modflow model see mcdonald and harraugh 1988 and estimates the interaction between stream cells and groundwater levels at circa c 10 day intervals 3 modelled outputs per month these modflow principles were then combined with daily outputs from a 4r rainfall recharge and runoff routing hydrological model to estimate the total daily discharge historic discharges herein at each stream cell see heathcote et al 2004 historic discharge estimates incorporate groundwater abstraction influences from ww and other small abstractors and artificial hydrological inputs principally effluent water returns but also some low flow alleviation strategies the wessex basin model also models daily naturalised discharges those not subjected to any form of hydrological alteration anthropogenic flow alterations were derived from the percentage difference between the naturalised and historic discharge time series anthropogenic flow alteration and historic discharge time series were obtained from 01 01 1994 to 31 12 2016 for each stream cell representing sampling sites thus incorporating flow data from the 12 month period preceding all invertebrate samples see below some short term drying events identified at 9 study sites were incorrectly modelled according to measurements from nearby flow gauges but zero flow days totalled 6 of the total hydrological time series at any given site and were subsequently replaced by interpolated values derived from the na approx function in the zoo package zeileis 2020 this was performed within r studio r development core team 2014 along with all subsequent statistical analyses 2 3 invertebrate dataset data on instream invertebrate communities was obtained from the biosys database collated by the environment agency ea the environment regulator for england invertebrate samples collected during ww s routine biomonitoring were also used in the analysis surveyors from both organizations adopted a standardized kick sampling procedure with all habitats within a river reach being proportionally sampled over a 3 minute period supplemented with an additional 1 minute hand search iso 2012 both ea and ww invertebrate samples were subjected to industrial standard quality control assurances samples collected between 1995 2016 were utilized in the study only study sites exhibiting a groundwater dominated hydrology perennial flows guided by the groundwater model and gauged flows and accurate groundwater model outputs guided by validation exercises of the groundwater model entec 2015 were retained in total 1693 invertebrate samples collected during spring march may and autumn september november from 89 study sites containing at least 5 years of invertebrate data were initially selected and region wide hydrological information from these were analysed throughout however for ecological analyses due to subsequent data refinement removal of samples containing outliers see section 3 2 1405 invertebrate samples 705 in spring and 700 in autumn from 87 study sites were analysed with a mean average of 19 2 samples and 10 1 years of data per study site abundances of all invertebrate taxa were aggregated into logarithmic groups which were subsequently recorded on an ordinal scale so that 1 1 9 individuals 2 10 99 3 100 999 4 1000 9999 5 10000 sensu durance and ormerod 2009 invertebrates were predominantly identified to family level in accordance with the taxonomic resolution routinely utilized by the ea iso 2012 due to variations in how taxa were resolved over time the following community data harmonization protocols were implemented cragoncytidae was combined with gammaridae limonidae pedicidae and scertidae were grouped under tipulidae lumbricilidae naididae tubifidae haplotaxidae lumbricidae nematoda and nematomorpha were pooled with oligochaetes dugesidae were included in planaridae and bithynidae were incorporated with hydrobiidae while coarser taxonomic resolutions may lead to weakened hydrological signatures on invertebrate communities monk et al 2012 durance and ormerod 2009 highlighted that invertebrate data resolved to the same taxonomic resolution yielded highly significant responses to antecedent discharges variations in the same region finally bibionidae collembola hebridae oribatei staphylinidae succineidae zonitidae were excluded from the analysis as they are typically indicative of terrestrial riparian habitats following harmonization 102 taxa were used in the analyses 2 4 invertebrate community responses in total 19 ecological response metrics were examined that characterized various community responses characterizing taxonomic functional and flow response guild properties and individual taxa abundances see table 1 the functional diversity of invertebrate communities was derived from the european database compiled by tachet et al 2010 which adopts a fuzzy coding procedure within this faunal affinities to individual traits range from zero to three or five indicating no to high affinity the upper limit depending on existing scientific certainty in total 11 grouping features i e a functional trait category e g maximum body size comprising 63 traits i e modalities residing within grouping features e g 0 25cm 8cm were examined that characterize the biological properties of invertebrate taxa see supplementary material appendix a taxa that did not occur within the uk guided by davies and edwards 2011 were removed from the database along with chironomidae and all taxa resolved beyond family level trait values were then standardized for all samples so that each grouping feature summed to 1 to ensure trait affinities had equal weighting between taxa family averaged trait values were then calculated and standardized as above to account for taxa expressing no affinity for all traits within a specific grouping feature these standardized values were used to derive all functional metrics except for functional trait diversity see table 1 which was calculated from a trait abundance array for this standardized family averaged trait values were multiplied by community abundances averaged across all sampled taxa and standardized once more across all grouping features the individual taxa examined comprise uk species representatives expressing the same ecological guilds defined by their preferences towards flow velocities sensu extence et al 1999 and occurred widely throughout the invertebrate dataset 68 79 of samples in summary 19 ecological responses were tested 11 community response metrics and 8 individual taxa table 1 3 statistical analyses 3 1 hydrological and anthropogenic flow alteration temporal variations temporal variations in anthropogenic flow alterations and historic discharges were explored using values averaged on a monthly basis across all 89 groundwater stream cells corresponding to invertebrate sampling locations for anthropogenic flow alteration time series a generalized additive model was constructed using the sample date as a smoothing term so the degree of smoothness equalled 0 3 times the number of years using the gam function in the mgcv package wood 2018 and all residual plots were inspected to ensure the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were satisfied for historic discharges a flow regime magnitude rm classification procedure was undertaken to characterize periods of above and below average discharge conditions daily historic discharge values from each stream cell were transformed to z scores for the rm classification historic discharge time series were divided into hydrological years commencing in august and terminating in july to help ensure that the rising limb annual peak and flow recession were typically incorporated across a 12 month period sensu monk et al 2006 subsequently monthly summaries of historic discharges mean standard deviation minimum and maximum values were obtained for each hydrological year these 4 statistical summaries underwent unit based standardization x x xmin xmax xmin 1 to ensure equal weighting and were inputted into a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis ward s method see monk et al 2006 subsequently hydrological years were grouped into 4 flow magnitude classes guided by silhouette analysis implemented via the fviz silhouette function in the factoextra package kassambra and mundt 2017 spanning from low rm1 moderate rm2 and rm3 and high flow conditions rm4 finally to test the association between groundwater and surface water management operations and river flow regimes anthropogenic flow alteration and historic discharge z score values were averaged on a monthly basis and across all 89 stream cells which were subsequently used as dependent and independent variables respectively in a linear regression using a logarithmic function for this residual diagnostics were inspected to ensure the data was normally distributed and homoscedasticity existed 3 2 invertebrate responses to hydrological and flow alteration indices a suite of hydrological indices characterizing different river flow regime components were calculated including 33 hydrological indices outlined in the indicators of hydrological alteration methodology sensu richter et al 1996 and additional ecologically important indices identified in previous research in the uk worrall et al 2014 white et al 2019b these indices were calculated for both anthropogenic flow alteration af n 43 only af indices characterizing flow magnitude alterations were processed and historic discharge q n 47 time series see supplementary material appendix b hydrological indices with skewed distributions or a lack of unique values 100 were excluded from the analyses n 12 subsequently all hydrological indices underwent a unit based standardization x x xmin xmax xmin 1 and extreme outliers were identified from interquartile range iqr values values that fall below q1 3 iqr or above q3 3 iqr subsequently 10 indices were removed that contained 50 outliers from the analysis see supplementary material appendix b and any sample containing an outlier within the remaining af and q indices were not analysed which resulted in 1405 samples and 87 sites with 5 years of data being analysed in total four statistical model groups were constructed that explored the separate influence of af i e flow alteration ecology relationships and q i e flow ecology relationships indices on invertebrate community responses derived from spring and autumn samples af spring af autumn q spring and q autumn see fig 2 each of these model groups contained a series of quantile regressions qrs and quantile mixed effect regressions qmrs which were performed across various quantiles from 0 05 to 0 95 in 0 05 increments to test community responses across a range of data values including central tendencies and upper or lower limits qmrs incorporated river identity as a random effect to account for potential spatial autocorrelation and that samples from the same watercourse likely being correlated over time mathers et al 2020 qrs and qrms were implemented using the lqm and lqmm functions respectively within the lqmm package geraci 2020 for each community response metric a set of qrs and qrms were initially performed for each individual hydrological index independent variable see fig 2 each of these sets comprised the same 6 null models qrs and qrms that tested a constant response spatial and or temporal effects i e no hydrological index alongside 26 single hydrological models shms that modelled the influence of a single hydrological index via 4 statistical functions linear exponential logarithmic and quadratic sensu fornaroli et al 2019 together with different spatial and temporal effects all formulae underpinning qrs and qrms performed for each set are displayed in supplementary material appendix c akaike weights w i derived from corrected akaike information criteria values were calculated and averaged across all quantiles for all qrs and qrms allen and vaughn 2010 a hydrological index would be excluded from subsequent analyses if its optimal i e highest average w i shm exhibited an average w i 2 times the average w i of the optimal null model the construction of shms allowed ecologically important hydrological indices in the form of their most powerful statistical function to be identified prior to multiple regression analyses see below qualifying hydrological indices for each community response metric were then checked for collinearity by iteratively removing hydrological indices containing the highest variance inflation factor values until all were below 3 various full multiple hydrological models mhms were created for each community response metric that modelled the additive effects of qualifying hydrological indices modelled via their optimal statistical function identified in shms alongside different combinations of spatial and temporal effects the same as inputted into shms see fig 2 of these the full mhm yielding the best variance structure i e the model containing the spatial and temporal effects exhibiting the highest average w i was identified which was subsequently compared against restricted models generated by removing af or q indices in a backward stepwise procedure this process was repeated iteratively until the optimal mhm exhibiting the highest average w i was identified finally the optimal mhm obtained for each community response metric was compared against a null model exhibiting the same spatial and temporal effects but devoid of any q or af indices in order to test its overall significance a method analogous to a likelihood ratio test for this significant optimal mhms somhms were identified as those yielding a relative average w i 0 75 sensu fornaroli et al 2019 for counts of individual taxa the statistical formulae and procedures utilised in the qr and qrm approach described above were replicated using quantile count models which were developed in accordance with cade and dong 2008 the counts of invertebrate taxa were transformed by adding a random uniform number in the interval 0 1 y y u 0 1 each qr and qrm was modelled across 100 different datasets comprising randomly added numbers with the estimated coefficients being averaged to remove the source of additional variation introduced by adding random u 0 1 numbers to y 4 results 4 1 long term hydrological variability and extreme flow conditions rivers in the study region displayed consistent intra annual changes in hydrological variability i e historic discharges from the groundwater model with peak flows occurring during late winter to early spring before declining across the summer and autumn months fig 3 a distinct periods of low 1996 1997 2004 2006 2010 2012 and high 2001 2001 2012 2014 discharges were observed across the study region which corresponded with the lowest rm1 and highest rm4 flow regime magnitude classes figs 3a and 3b when anthropogenic flow alterations were averaged across all 89 study sites on a monthly basis values ranged between 15 0 fig 3a and 67 of the study sites averaged flow alterations within this range across the entire study period anthropogenic flow alterations displayed the most extreme negative values at the beginning of the study period but from 1997 onwards displayed inter annual variations congruent with historic discharges with the greatest reductions in discharge occurring during periods of low flow and vice versa fig 3a a highly significant logarithmic relationship was observed between the percentage of flow altered versus historic discharges linear regression r2 0 59 f 395 p 0 001 see fig 3c 4 2 1 flow alteration and flow ecology results structure the remaining results highlight flow alteration and flow ecology relationships derived from the four statistical model groups containing data from different seasons spring and autumn and hydrological index types i e anthropogenic flow alteration af and discharge variability q each of these groups tested the effects of hydrological indices on each individual ecological response metric therefore each group potentially contained up to 19 significant optimal multiple hydrological models somhms the final step in the analytical framework adopted in this study see fig 2 4 2 2 flow alteration ecology relationships of the four model groups tested af spring and af autumn i e the two groups comprising flow alteration ecology relationships yielded the greatest number of non significant models each with 15 out of a possible 19 table 2 ecological response metrics yielding non significant associations varied slightly between seasons although the taxonomic diversity slower flow taxa richness the richness of taxa preferring slow flow conditions functional richness and functional evenness see table 1 for ecological response metric descriptions and all individual taxa modelled except for ephemerellidae during autumn were not significantly affected by af indices table 2 the 4 significant optimal multiple hydrological models somhms in both the af spring and af autumn model groups comprised 8 and 9 af indices respectively of these 10 af indices characterized the discharge percentage altered during specific months 7 of which yielded quadratic responses in total 5 of these modelled rheophilic taxa richness the richness of rheophilic taxa and ept the percentage of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa which peaked at c 15 0 flow alterations that characterise negligible moderate abstraction intensities figs 4 a d 58 to 87 of data values comprising these somhms lay between 15 0 af values see supplementary material appendix d for figures displaying all associations comprising somhms not presented in the main text however it should be noted that the functional diversity and rao quadratic entropy values displayed the opposite trends in response to september flow alterations based on invertebrate samples collected during spring and autumn respectively see appendix d figures d1b and d2c in total 6 af indices comprising somhms characterised the magnitude and duration of specific flow alterations all of which yielded a logarithmic relationship a key example of such a trend was family life the family level lotic invertebrate index for flow evaluation scores which decreased most dramatically when the minimum flow alteration i e most severe groundwater abstraction effect in the 180 days prior to sampling spring samples fig 4e and 30 day average minimum flow alteration values autumn samples fig 4f dropped below c 60 and 50 respectively which occurred in 1 of data values in both models 4 2 3 flow ecology relationships the q spring model group yielded the highest number of somhms n 11 with the 9 non significant models primarily comprising taxonomic responses and individual taxa table 3 these somhms consisted of 32 q indices 14 of which characterised the duration of certain flow magnitudes notably antecedent minimum and maximum discharges table 3 one key somhm association was functional evennessresponding unimodally to the maximum 7 day averaged discharge q7max fig 5a some individual taxa responses also displayed important trends such as ephemerellidae abundances displaying a negative linear trend with the maximum discharge in the 7 days prior to sampling qmax7 fig 5b and rhyacophilidae abundances increasing at faster rates with rising maximum 90 day average discharges q90max fig 5c in the q spring group 13 indices comprising somhms characterized the average discharges during specific months of these 6 reflected summer flow conditions table 3 and were influential on flow response guilds with family life responding in a positive linear fashion to the average discharge in july qjul fig 5d rheophilic taxa richness yielded a positive logarithmic response to qjul fig 5e while slower flow taxa richness displayed a quadratic response and notably declined across intermediate to high qjul values fig 5f the q autumn group yielded 6 somhms that comprised 13 q indices which are summarised in supplementary material appendix d 5 discussion 5 1 invertebrate responses to groundwater and surface water management operations this study utilized a novel combination of long term groundwater model outputs and a suite of invertebrate responses derived from regional biomonitoring programmes while a limited number of studies have combined riverine ecological data with hydrological models characterizing groundwater abstraction effects across seasonal kennen et al 2014 white et al 2019b to inter annual periods bradley et al 2017 white et al 2018 liu et al 2020 to our knowledge the present study represents the first example to combine such sources of information over a multi decadal temporal scale moreover the groundwater model used accounted for different forms of water management operations principally groundwater abstraction and effluent water returns as well as a small number of low flow alleviation strategies which have seldom been explored simultaneously the present study highlighted that many flow alteration ecology models were not statistically significant including different taxonomic and functional community measures as well as most individual taxa such findings highlight the absence of consistent detectable ecological effects of long term water management operations over a 20 year period this suggests that ecological responses to flow alterations were either highly variable and therefore statistically undetectable or exerted a weak influence on instream communities on a national scale mims and olden 2013 attributed weak statistical associations between dam induced flow alterations and fish communities to nuanced ecological responses that varied between different dam operations and flow regimes however the present study examined river systems at the regional scale which yield comparable groundwater dominated flow regimes and were mostly subjected to low moderate groundwater abstraction intensities approximately two thirds of study site averages and altered flow index values lay between 15 0 as such it is more likely that non significant flow alteration ecology relationships in the present study were an artefact of water resource management operations largely exerting weak and not variable ecological effects despite this a small number of significant flow alteration ecology relationships 8 in total 4 out of 19 in each season provided some insight into how long term groundwater and surface water management operations have modified certain ecological properties for instance the number of rheophilic taxa sampled during spring peaked when the preceding summer and winter discharges had been artificially reduced by c 0 15 this could be explained by groundwater abstraction practices in the winter immediately preceding the sampling period mitigating the effects of extreme high flow events on riverine biota even rheophilic taxa miller et al 2007 and those in the previous summer potentially concentrating flows and creating localized pockets of enhanced flow velocities white et al 2019a 2019b in addition the percentage of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept taxa sampled in autumn also peaked when groundwater abstraction effects reduced antecedent summer and winter discharges by c 0 15 potential ecological mechanisms driving this may mirror those described for rheophilic taxa as many representatives belong to ept orders in addition to low moderate groundwater abstraction influences during the summer immediately preceding autumn samples potentially prompting earlier emergence and adult oviposition patterns thus allowing new larval cohorts to develop in the autumn brown et al 2012 equally for both rheophilic and ept taxa affiliations with low to moderate groundwater abstraction effects could be attributed to greater invertebrate densities through organisms being concentrated into a reduced wetted perimeter dewson et al 2007 or channel contraction enhancing the sampling detection of a greater number of taxa whichever the underlying ecological mechanism s are these unimodal flow alteration ecology relationships provide vital empirical evidence highlighting that over a 20 year time period regional groundwater and surface water management operations broadly have not limited important riverine ecosystem components however some functional diversity measures displayed the opposite unimodal trend in relation to flow alterations during september with relative declines in values at c 0 15 groundwater abstraction effects potentially being due to greater dominance of ept communities which at the community level yield more comparable functional niches usseglio polatera et al 2000 such findings have important implications globally where there remains a paucity of information quantifying ecological responses to groundwater abstraction for this reason gleeson and richter 2018 proposed a global presumptive standard on how groundwater resources should be managed to conserve surface water ecosystems and highlighted that baseflows the portion of flow derived from groundwater or other delayed hydrological sources should be reduced by no more than 10 while groundwater and surface water management operations in most instances reduced river discharges by c 0 15 some exceptions to this did occur and prompted distinct ecological responses for instance artificial hydrological inputs the majority of which stemmed from effluent water returns surprisingly led to relative declines in the number of rheophilic and ept taxa sampled in spring and autumn respectively although the latter was less sensitive to flow inputs during winter it is possible that alternative stressors associated with such water releases e g modified water physio chemical characteristics were not suitable for sensitive biota although it should be noted that major effluent water returns have been subjected to phosphorous stripping across the study region mainstone et al 2005 in addition some ecological response metrics most notably ept taxa sampled during autumn and family life displayed relative declines when groundwater abstraction effects resulted in more severe negative flow alterations while the occurrence of such extreme groundwater abstraction effects were rare c 1 in the family life models hydrological analyses in this study indicated that groundwater abstraction practices had a stronger relative effect on low flow conditions which occurs due to groundwater abstraction having a greater proportional influence on lower water levels that coincides with peaks in societal water demands given that combined increases in global temperatures and societal water demands are likely to exacerbate future low flow conditions worldwide van loon et al 2016 further research is required to elucidate the direct effects of groundwater abstraction effects on riverine ecosystems 5 2 long term structural and functional invertebrate responses to hydrological variations the suite of flow ecology relationships derived from such a dense network of ecohydrological information in this study has important implications for guiding water resource management operations and developing environmental flow strategies davies et al 2014 this study highlighted the importance of antecedent flow discharge variability for invertebrate communities sampled during the spring months while previous studies within the uk have highlighted stronger flow ecology relationships when examining invertebrate communities sampled during autumn e g monk et al 2006 worrall et al 2014 durance and ormerod 2009 reported that antecedent river discharges yielded a greater influence on spring invertebrate communities in the same region as the present study such findings may reflect spring being a critical time period for the life cycle of many invertebrates that are closely linked with antecedent flow conditions including the maturation of insect larvae nymphs prior to late spring and early summer emergence e g ephemera danica everall et al 2015 and periods of reproduction for others ancylus fluviatilis pfenninger et al 2003 for invertebrate communities sampled during spring the duration of certain flow magnitudes notably minimum and maximum discharges were of critical importance this includes functional evenness responding unimodally to the maximum 7 day averaged discharges which potentially reflects competitively superior taxa dominating when antecedent high flow conditions are less severe while only highly tolerant taxa persisting when the maximum 7 day averaged discharge is at its greatest see townsend et al 1997 this has important implications for wider ecosystem functioning villeger et al 2008 and could inform environmental flow strategies that may target intermediate flow magnitudes to promote greater functional evenness of biotic communities the abundance of ephemerellidae during spring months declining with the maximum discharge in the 7 days prior to sampling could be due to their affiliation with fine leaved macrophyte habitats which become dominated by select taxa when hydraulic pressures intensify between plant strands see white et al 2019b this has important management implications given the socioeconomic importance of this mayfly for commercial and angling activities everall et al 2018 conversely the trichopteran rhyacophilidae was positively associated with the maximum 90 day averaged discharges emphasising the torrenticole nature of this key predator which benefits of long periods of sustained higher discharges extence et al 1999 this study highlighted the sensitivity of specific invertebrate community flow response guilds to antecedent flow conditions which supports the findings of chen and olden 2018 who highlighted the effectiveness of such responses in facilitating spatially transferrable flow ecology relationships from a national perspective the sensitivity of family life during spring months represents an important finding as this biomonitoring index is used to guide water resource management operations and set abstraction licenses klaar et al 2014 importantly summer discharges had a strong effect on flow response guild values of spring invertebrate communities in the following year and highlights the long lasting ecological effects of low flow conditions extence et al 1999 6 conclusions this study provides a novel perspective on the ecological effects of water resource management operations by combining biomonitoring datasets with groundwater model outputs over a multi decadal timeframe our findings provide empirical evidence regarding how regional water resource management operations largely resulted in statistically non significant effects on benthic invertebrate communities however a small number of statistical models recorded invertebrate communities being sensitive to more extreme groundwater abstraction intensities and artificial hydrological inputs although such flow alterations were less common over the study period given a global paucity of evidence highlighting the long term implications of groundwater abstraction effects on riverine ecosystems studies like this are urgently required to inform the management of groundwater and surface water resource operations such research will become increasingly important in the face of increasing hydrological

is a key challenge of the 21st century naiman and dudgeon 2011 arthington et al 2018 biota inhabiting riverine environments have developed a suite of morphological behavioural and life history

alteration ecology relationships based on groundwater abstraction effects have been notoriously understudied poff and zimmerman 2010 instead riverine ecological responses to groundwater abstraction are often inferred based on experimental designs manipulating water volumes associated with hypothetical low flow abstraction scenarios dewson et al 2007 aspin et al 2019 as a result there remains a paucity of evidence quantifying ecosystem responses to empirically derived groundwater abstraction pressures gleeson and richter 2018 such ecological evidence and appraisals are urgently required given the pervasive effects of groundwater abstraction on riverine ecosystems which have reduced river discharges by an average of 10 worldwide de graaf et al 2014 and greater societal water demands are projected to increase groundwater abstraction pressures in the future van loon et al 2016 to our knowledge this study provides the first evidence of long term 1995 2016 ecological responses to anthropogenic flow alterations driven by both groundwater and surface water management operations as well as historic hydrological discharge variations to achieve this freshwater invertebrate biomonitoring data was combined with regional groundwater model outputs to construct an ensemble of flow alteration and flow ecology relationships 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study region the study region is situated in the south west of the united kingdom uk fig 1 within the operational boundaries of the water company wessex water plc ww who manage water resources for 2 8 million inhabitants the focus of this study was centred on groundwater dominated river systems predominantly underlain by cretaceous chalk a white fine grained limestone calcium carbonate the underlying aquifer supports more groundwater abstraction than any other aquifer in the uk and accounts for 60 of the groundwater used across england and wales macdonald and allen 2011 in the ww region 75 of water abstracted by is derived from groundwater sources across the study region from 72 public water sources wessex water 2014 however outflows from 97 effluent water returns results in some river reaches conveying greater flows than would occur naturally in addition the study region contains 6 low flow alleviation schemes where groundwater is augmented into select rivers which fall below a designated discharge the study region is dominated by arable agriculture and grassland national river flow 2020 and the rivers are typically characterized by high dissolved oxygen levels alkalinity and nutrient levels white et al 2018 2 2 wessex basin groundwater model the wessex basin groundwater model see soley et al 2012 was used to characterize anthropogenic flow alterations and hydrological variations at each study site the wessex basin model divides the ww region underlain by cretaceous chalk and upper greensand into 250 250m grid cells the wessex basin model has been adapted from the finite difference modflow model see mcdonald and harraugh 1988 and estimates the interaction between stream cells and groundwater levels at circa c 10 day intervals 3 modelled outputs per month these modflow principles were then combined with daily outputs from a 4r rainfall recharge and runoff routing hydrological model to estimate the total daily discharge historic discharges herein at each stream cell see heathcote et al 2004 historic discharge estimates incorporate groundwater abstraction influences from ww and other small abstractors and artificial hydrological inputs principally effluent water returns but also some low flow alleviation strategies the wessex basin model also models daily naturalised discharges those not subjected to any form of hydrological alteration anthropogenic flow alterations were derived from the percentage difference between the naturalised and historic discharge time series anthropogenic flow alteration and historic discharge time series were obtained from 01 01 1994 to 31 12 2016 for each stream cell representing sampling sites thus incorporating flow data from the 12 month period preceding all invertebrate samples see below some short term drying events identified at 9 study sites were incorrectly modelled according to measurements from nearby flow gauges but zero flow days totalled 6 of the total hydrological time series at any given site and were subsequently replaced by interpolated values derived from the na approx function in the zoo package zeileis 2020 this was performed within r studio r development core team 2014 along with all subsequent statistical analyses 2 3 invertebrate dataset data on instream invertebrate communities was obtained from the biosys database collated by the environment agency ea the environment regulator for england invertebrate samples collected during ww s routine biomonitoring were also used in the analysis surveyors from both organizations adopted a standardized kick sampling procedure with all habitats within a river reach being proportionally sampled over a 3 minute period supplemented with an additional 1 minute hand search iso 2012 both ea and ww invertebrate samples were subjected to industrial standard quality control assurances samples collected between 1995 2016 were utilized in the study only study sites exhibiting a groundwater dominated hydrology perennial flows guided by the groundwater model and gauged flows and accurate groundwater model outputs guided by validation exercises of the groundwater model entec 2015 were retained in total 1693 invertebrate samples collected during spring march may and autumn september november from 89 study sites containing at least 5 years of invertebrate data were initially selected and region wide hydrological information from these were analysed throughout however for ecological analyses due to subsequent data refinement removal of samples containing outliers see section 3 2 1405 invertebrate samples 705 in spring and 700 in autumn from 87 study sites were analysed with a mean average of 19 2 samples and 10 1 years of data per study site abundances of all invertebrate taxa were aggregated into logarithmic groups which were subsequently recorded on an ordinal scale so that 1 1 9 individuals 2 10 99 3 100 999 4 1000 9999 5 10000 sensu durance and ormerod 2009 invertebrates were predominantly identified to family level in accordance with the taxonomic resolution routinely utilized by the ea iso 2012 due to variations in how taxa were resolved over time the following community data harmonization protocols were implemented cragoncytidae was combined with gammaridae limonidae pedicidae and scertidae were grouped under tipulidae lumbricilidae naididae tubifidae haplotaxidae lumbricidae nematoda and nematomorpha were pooled with oligochaetes dugesidae were included in planaridae and bithynidae were incorporated with hydrobiidae while coarser taxonomic resolutions may lead to weakened hydrological signatures on invertebrate communities monk et al 2012 durance and ormerod 2009 highlighted that invertebrate data resolved to the same taxonomic resolution yielded highly significant responses to antecedent discharges variations in the same region finally bibionidae collembola hebridae oribatei staphylinidae succineidae zonitidae were excluded from the analysis as they are typically indicative of terrestrial riparian habitats following harmonization 102 taxa were used in the analyses 2 4 invertebrate community responses in total 19 ecological response metrics were examined that characterized various community responses characterizing taxonomic functional and flow response guild properties and individual taxa abundances see table 1 the functional diversity of invertebrate communities was derived from the european database compiled by tachet et al 2010 which adopts a fuzzy coding procedure within this faunal affinities to individual traits range from zero to three or five indicating no to high affinity the upper limit depending on existing scientific certainty in total 11 grouping features i e a functional trait category e g maximum body size comprising 63 traits i e modalities residing within grouping features e g 0 25cm 8cm were examined that characterize the biological properties of invertebrate taxa see supplementary material appendix a taxa that did not occur within the uk guided by davies and edwards 2011 were removed from the database along with chironomidae and all taxa resolved beyond family level trait values were then standardized for all samples so that each grouping feature summed to 1 to ensure trait affinities had equal weighting between taxa family averaged trait values were then calculated and standardized as above to account for taxa expressing no affinity for all traits within a specific grouping feature these standardized values were used to derive all functional metrics except for functional trait diversity see table 1 which was calculated from a trait abundance array for this standardized family averaged trait values were multiplied by community abundances averaged across all sampled taxa and standardized once more across all grouping features the individual taxa examined comprise uk species representatives expressing the same ecological guilds defined by their preferences towards flow velocities sensu extence et al 1999 and occurred widely throughout the invertebrate dataset 68 79 of samples in summary 19 ecological responses were tested 11 community response metrics and 8 individual taxa table 1 3 statistical analyses 3 1 hydrological and anthropogenic flow alteration temporal variations temporal variations in anthropogenic flow alterations and historic discharges were explored using values averaged on a monthly basis across all 89 groundwater stream cells corresponding to invertebrate sampling locations for anthropogenic flow alteration time series a generalized additive model was constructed using the sample date as a smoothing term so the degree of smoothness equalled 0 3 times the number of years using the gam function in the mgcv package wood 2018 and all residual plots were inspected to ensure the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity were satisfied for historic discharges a flow regime magnitude rm classification procedure was undertaken to characterize periods of above and below average discharge conditions daily historic discharge values from each stream cell were transformed to z scores for the rm classification historic discharge time series were divided into hydrological years commencing in august and terminating in july to help ensure that the rising limb annual peak and flow recession were typically incorporated across a 12 month period sensu monk et al 2006 subsequently monthly summaries of historic discharges mean standard deviation minimum and maximum values were obtained for each hydrological year these 4 statistical summaries underwent unit based standardization x x xmin xmax xmin 1 to ensure equal weighting and were inputted into a hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis ward s method see monk et al 2006 subsequently hydrological years were grouped into 4 flow magnitude classes guided by silhouette analysis implemented via the fviz silhouette function in the factoextra package kassambra and mundt 2017 spanning from low rm1 moderate rm2 and rm3 and high flow conditions rm4 finally to test the association between groundwater and surface water management operations and river flow regimes anthropogenic flow alteration and historic discharge z score values were averaged on a monthly basis and across all 89 stream cells which were subsequently used as dependent and independent variables respectively in a linear regression using a logarithmic function for this residual diagnostics were inspected to ensure the data was normally distributed and homoscedasticity existed 3 2 invertebrate responses to hydrological and flow alteration indices a suite of hydrological indices characterizing different river flow regime components were calculated including 33 hydrological indices outlined in the indicators of hydrological alteration methodology sensu richter et al 1996 and additional ecologically important indices identified in previous research in the uk worrall et al 2014 white et al 2019b these indices were calculated for both anthropogenic flow alteration af n 43 only af indices characterizing flow magnitude alterations were processed and historic discharge q n 47 time series see supplementary material appendix b hydrological indices with skewed distributions or a lack of unique values 100 were excluded from the analyses n 12 subsequently all hydrological indices underwent a unit based standardization x x xmin xmax xmin 1 and extreme outliers were identified from interquartile range iqr values values that fall below q1 3 iqr or above q3 3 iqr subsequently 10 indices were removed that contained 50 outliers from the analysis see supplementary material appendix b and any sample containing an outlier within the remaining af and q indices were not analysed which resulted in 1405 samples and 87 sites with 5 years of data being analysed in total four statistical model groups were constructed that explored the separate influence of af i e flow alteration ecology relationships and q i e flow ecology relationships indices on invertebrate community responses derived from spring and autumn samples af spring af autumn q spring and q autumn see fig 2 each of these model groups contained a series of quantile regressions qrs and quantile mixed effect regressions qmrs which were performed across various quantiles from 0 05 to 0 95 in 0 05 increments to test community responses across a range of data values including central tendencies and upper or lower limits qmrs incorporated river identity as a random effect to account for potential spatial autocorrelation and that samples from the same watercourse likely being correlated over time mathers et al 2020 qrs and qrms were implemented using the lqm and lqmm functions respectively within the lqmm package geraci 2020 for each community response metric a set of qrs and qrms were initially performed for each individual hydrological index independent variable see fig 2 each of these sets comprised the same 6 null models qrs and qrms that tested a constant response spatial and or temporal effects i e no hydrological index alongside 26 single hydrological models shms that modelled the influence of a single hydrological index via 4 statistical functions linear exponential logarithmic and quadratic sensu fornaroli et al 2019 together with different spatial and temporal effects all formulae underpinning qrs and qrms performed for each set are displayed in supplementary material appendix c akaike weights w i derived from corrected akaike information criteria values were calculated and averaged across all quantiles for all qrs and qrms allen and vaughn 2010 a hydrological index would be excluded from subsequent analyses if its optimal i e highest average w i shm exhibited an average w i 2 times the average w i of the optimal null model the construction of shms allowed ecologically important hydrological indices in the form of their most powerful statistical function to be identified prior to multiple regression analyses see below qualifying hydrological indices for each community response metric were then checked for collinearity by iteratively removing hydrological indices containing the highest variance inflation factor values until all were below 3 various full multiple hydrological models mhms were created for each community response metric that modelled the additive effects of qualifying hydrological indices modelled via their optimal statistical function identified in shms alongside different combinations of spatial and temporal effects the same as inputted into shms see fig 2 of these the full mhm yielding the best variance structure i e the model containing the spatial and temporal effects exhibiting the highest average w i was identified which was subsequently compared against restricted models generated by removing af or q indices in a backward stepwise procedure this process was repeated iteratively until the optimal mhm exhibiting the highest average w i was identified finally the optimal mhm obtained for each community response metric was compared against a null model exhibiting the same spatial and temporal effects but devoid of any q or af indices in order to test its overall significance a method analogous to a likelihood ratio test for this significant optimal mhms somhms were identified as those yielding a relative average w i 0 75 sensu fornaroli et al 2019 for counts of individual taxa the statistical formulae and procedures utilised in the qr and qrm approach described above were replicated using quantile count models which were developed in accordance with cade and dong 2008 the counts of invertebrate taxa were transformed by adding a random uniform number in the interval 0 1 y y u 0 1 each qr and qrm was modelled across 100 different datasets comprising randomly added numbers with the estimated coefficients being averaged to remove the source of additional variation introduced by adding random u 0 1 numbers to y 4 results 4 1 long term hydrological variability and extreme flow conditions rivers in the study region displayed consistent intra annual changes in hydrological variability i e historic discharges from the groundwater model with peak flows occurring during late winter to early spring before declining across the summer and autumn months fig 3 a distinct periods of low 1996 1997 2004 2006 2010 2012 and high 2001 2001 2012 2014 discharges were observed across the study region which corresponded with the lowest rm1 and highest rm4 flow regime magnitude classes figs 3a and 3b when anthropogenic flow alterations were averaged across all 89 study sites on a monthly basis values ranged between 15 0 fig 3a and 67 of the study sites averaged flow alterations within this range across the entire study period anthropogenic flow alterations displayed the most extreme negative values at the beginning of the study period but from 1997 onwards displayed inter annual variations congruent with historic discharges with the greatest reductions in discharge occurring during periods of low flow and vice versa fig 3a a highly significant logarithmic relationship was observed between the percentage of flow altered versus historic discharges linear regression r2 0 59 f 395 p 0 001 see fig 3c 4 2 1 flow alteration and flow ecology results structure the remaining results highlight flow alteration and flow ecology relationships derived from the four statistical model groups containing data from different seasons spring and autumn and hydrological index types i e anthropogenic flow alteration af and discharge variability q each of these groups tested the effects of hydrological indices on each individual ecological response metric therefore each group potentially contained up to 19 significant optimal multiple hydrological models somhms the final step in the analytical framework adopted in this study see fig 2 4 2 2 flow alteration ecology relationships of the four model groups tested af spring and af autumn i e the two groups comprising flow alteration ecology relationships yielded the greatest number of non significant models each with 15 out of a possible 19 table 2 ecological response metrics yielding non significant associations varied slightly between seasons although the taxonomic diversity slower flow taxa richness the richness of taxa preferring slow flow conditions functional richness and functional evenness see table 1 for ecological response metric descriptions and all individual taxa modelled except for ephemerellidae during autumn were not significantly affected by af indices table 2 the 4 significant optimal multiple hydrological models somhms in both the af spring and af autumn model groups comprised 8 and 9 af indices respectively of these 10 af indices characterized the discharge percentage altered during specific months 7 of which yielded quadratic responses in total 5 of these modelled rheophilic taxa richness the richness of rheophilic taxa and ept the percentage of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera taxa which peaked at c 15 0 flow alterations that characterise negligible moderate abstraction intensities figs 4 a d 58 to 87 of data values comprising these somhms lay between 15 0 af values see supplementary material appendix d for figures displaying all associations comprising somhms not presented in the main text however it should be noted that the functional diversity and rao quadratic entropy values displayed the opposite trends in response to september flow alterations based on invertebrate samples collected during spring and autumn respectively see appendix d figures d1b and d2c in total 6 af indices comprising somhms characterised the magnitude and duration of specific flow alterations all of which yielded a logarithmic relationship a key example of such a trend was family life the family level lotic invertebrate index for flow evaluation scores which decreased most dramatically when the minimum flow alteration i e most severe groundwater abstraction effect in the 180 days prior to sampling spring samples fig 4e and 30 day average minimum flow alteration values autumn samples fig 4f dropped below c 60 and 50 respectively which occurred in 1 of data values in both models 4 2 3 flow ecology relationships the q spring model group yielded the highest number of somhms n 11 with the 9 non significant models primarily comprising taxonomic responses and individual taxa table 3 these somhms consisted of 32 q indices 14 of which characterised the duration of certain flow magnitudes notably antecedent minimum and maximum discharges table 3 one key somhm association was functional evennessresponding unimodally to the maximum 7 day averaged discharge q7max fig 5a some individual taxa responses also displayed important trends such as ephemerellidae abundances displaying a negative linear trend with the maximum discharge in the 7 days prior to sampling qmax7 fig 5b and rhyacophilidae abundances increasing at faster rates with rising maximum 90 day average discharges q90max fig 5c in the q spring group 13 indices comprising somhms characterized the average discharges during specific months of these 6 reflected summer flow conditions table 3 and were influential on flow response guilds with family life responding in a positive linear fashion to the average discharge in july qjul fig 5d rheophilic taxa richness yielded a positive logarithmic response to qjul fig 5e while slower flow taxa richness displayed a quadratic response and notably declined across intermediate to high qjul values fig 5f the q autumn group yielded 6 somhms that comprised 13 q indices which are summarised in supplementary material appendix d 5 discussion 5 1 invertebrate responses to groundwater and surface water management operations this study utilized a novel combination of long term groundwater model outputs and a suite of invertebrate responses derived from regional biomonitoring programmes while a limited number of studies have combined riverine ecological data with hydrological models characterizing groundwater abstraction effects across seasonal kennen et al 2014 white et al 2019b to inter annual periods bradley et al 2017 white et al 2018 liu et al 2020 to our knowledge the present study represents the first example to combine such sources of information over a multi decadal temporal scale moreover the groundwater model used accounted for different forms of water management operations principally groundwater abstraction and effluent water returns as well as a small number of low flow alleviation strategies which have seldom been explored simultaneously the present study highlighted that many flow alteration ecology models were not statistically significant including different taxonomic and functional community measures as well as most individual taxa such findings highlight the absence of consistent detectable ecological effects of long term water management operations over a 20 year period this suggests that ecological responses to flow alterations were either highly variable and therefore statistically undetectable or exerted a weak influence on instream communities on a national scale mims and olden 2013 attributed weak statistical associations between dam induced flow alterations and fish communities to nuanced ecological responses that varied between different dam operations and flow regimes however the present study examined river systems at the regional scale which yield comparable groundwater dominated flow regimes and were mostly subjected to low moderate groundwater abstraction intensities approximately two thirds of study site averages and altered flow index values lay between 15 0 as such it is more likely that non significant flow alteration ecology relationships in the present study were an artefact of water resource management operations largely exerting weak and not variable ecological effects despite this a small number of significant flow alteration ecology relationships 8 in total 4 out of 19 in each season provided some insight into how long term groundwater and surface water management operations have modified certain ecological properties for instance the number of rheophilic taxa sampled during spring peaked when the preceding summer and winter discharges had been artificially reduced by c 0 15 this could be explained by groundwater abstraction practices in the winter immediately preceding the sampling period mitigating the effects of extreme high flow events on riverine biota even rheophilic taxa miller et al 2007 and those in the previous summer potentially concentrating flows and creating localized pockets of enhanced flow velocities white et al 2019a 2019b in addition the percentage of ephemeroptera plecoptera and trichoptera ept taxa sampled in autumn also peaked when groundwater abstraction effects reduced antecedent summer and winter discharges by c 0 15 potential ecological mechanisms driving this may mirror those described for rheophilic taxa as many representatives belong to ept orders in addition to low moderate groundwater abstraction influences during the summer immediately preceding autumn samples potentially prompting earlier emergence and adult oviposition patterns thus allowing new larval cohorts to develop in the autumn brown et al 2012 equally for both rheophilic and ept taxa affiliations with low to moderate groundwater abstraction effects could be attributed to greater invertebrate densities through organisms being concentrated into a reduced wetted perimeter dewson et al 2007 or channel contraction enhancing the sampling detection of a greater number of taxa whichever the underlying ecological mechanism s are these unimodal flow alteration ecology relationships provide vital empirical evidence highlighting that over a 20 year time period regional groundwater and surface water management operations broadly have not limited important riverine ecosystem components however some functional diversity measures displayed the opposite unimodal trend in relation to flow alterations during september with relative declines in values at c 0 15 groundwater abstraction effects potentially being due to greater dominance of ept communities which at the community level yield more comparable functional niches usseglio polatera et al 2000 such findings have important implications globally where there remains a paucity of information quantifying ecological responses to groundwater abstraction for this reason gleeson and richter 2018 proposed a global presumptive standard on how groundwater resources should be managed to conserve surface water ecosystems and highlighted that baseflows the portion of flow derived from groundwater or other delayed hydrological sources should be reduced by no more than 10 while groundwater and surface water management operations in most instances reduced river discharges by c 0 15 some exceptions to this did occur and prompted distinct ecological responses for instance artificial hydrological inputs the majority of which stemmed from effluent water returns surprisingly led to relative declines in the number of rheophilic and ept taxa sampled in spring and autumn respectively although the latter was less sensitive to flow inputs during winter it is possible that alternative stressors associated with such water releases e g modified water physio chemical characteristics were not suitable for sensitive biota although it should be noted that major effluent water returns have been subjected to phosphorous stripping across the study region mainstone et al 2005 in addition some ecological response metrics most notably ept taxa sampled during autumn and family life displayed relative declines when groundwater abstraction effects resulted in more severe negative flow alterations while the occurrence of such extreme groundwater abstraction effects were rare c 1 in the family life models hydrological analyses in this study indicated that groundwater abstraction practices had a stronger relative effect on low flow conditions which occurs due to groundwater abstraction having a greater proportional influence on lower water levels that coincides with peaks in societal water demands given that combined increases in global temperatures and societal water demands are likely to exacerbate future low flow conditions worldwide van loon et al 2016 further research is required to elucidate the direct effects of groundwater abstraction effects on riverine ecosystems 5 2 long term structural and functional invertebrate responses to hydrological variations the suite of flow ecology relationships derived from such a dense network of ecohydrological information in this study has important implications for guiding water resource management operations and developing environmental flow strategies davies et al 2014 this study highlighted the importance of antecedent flow discharge variability for invertebrate communities sampled during the spring months while previous studies within the uk have highlighted stronger flow ecology relationships when examining invertebrate communities sampled during autumn e g monk et al 2006 worrall et al 2014 durance and ormerod 2009 reported that antecedent river discharges yielded a greater influence on spring invertebrate communities in the same region as the present study such findings may reflect spring being a critical time period for the life cycle of many invertebrates that are closely linked with antecedent flow conditions including the maturation of insect larvae nymphs prior to late spring and early summer emergence e g ephemera danica everall et al 2015 and periods of reproduction for others ancylus fluviatilis pfenninger et al 2003 for invertebrate communities sampled during spring the duration of certain flow magnitudes notably minimum and maximum discharges were of critical importance this includes functional evenness responding unimodally to the maximum 7 day averaged discharges which potentially reflects competitively superior taxa dominating when antecedent high flow conditions are less severe while only highly tolerant taxa persisting when the maximum 7 day averaged discharge is at its greatest see townsend et al 1997 this has important implications for wider ecosystem functioning villeger et al 2008 and could inform environmental flow strategies that may target intermediate flow magnitudes to promote greater functional evenness of biotic communities the abundance of ephemerellidae during spring months declining with the maximum discharge in the 7 days prior to sampling could be due to their affiliation with fine leaved macrophyte habitats which become dominated by select taxa when hydraulic pressures intensify between plant strands see white et al 2019b this has important management implications given the socioeconomic importance of this mayfly for commercial and angling activities everall et al 2018 conversely the trichopteran rhyacophilidae was positively associated with the maximum 90 day averaged discharges emphasising the torrenticole nature of this key predator which benefits of long periods of sustained higher discharges extence et al 1999 this study highlighted the sensitivity of specific invertebrate community flow response guilds to antecedent flow conditions which supports the findings of chen and olden 2018 who highlighted the effectiveness of such responses in facilitating spatially transferrable flow ecology relationships from a national perspective the sensitivity of family life during spring months represents an important finding as this biomonitoring index is used to guide water resource management operations and set abstraction licenses klaar et al 2014 importantly summer discharges had a strong effect on flow response guild values of spring invertebrate communities in the following year and highlights the long lasting ecological effects of low flow conditions extence et al 1999 6 conclusions this study provides a novel perspective on the ecological effects of water resource management operations by combining biomonitoring datasets with groundwater model outputs over a multi decadal timeframe our findings provide empirical evidence regarding how regional water resource management operations largely resulted in statistically non significant effects on benthic invertebrate communities however a small number of statistical models recorded invertebrate communities being sensitive to more extreme groundwater abstraction intensities and artificial hydrological inputs although such flow alterations were less common over the study period given a global paucity of evidence highlighting the long term implications of groundwater abstraction effects on riverine ecosystems studies like this are urgently required to inform the management of groundwater and surface water resource operations such research will become increasingly important in the face of increasing hydrological

17371,machine learning models provide an adaptive tool to predict the performance of treatment reactors under varying operational and influent conditions aerobic granular sludge ags is still an emerging technology and does not have a long history of full scale application there is therefore a scarcity of long term data in this field which impacted the development of data driven models in this study a machine learning model was developed for simulating the ags process using 475 days of data collected from three lab based reactors inputs were selected based on rrelieff ranking after multicollinearity reduction a five stage model structure was adopted in which each parameter was predicted using separate models for the preceding parameters as inputs an ensemble of artificial neural networks support vector regression and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems was used to improve the models performance the developed model was able to predict the mlss mlvss svi5 svi30 granule size

adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems support vector regression aerobic granular sludge sequencing batch reactors 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge ags is a promising biological wastewater treatment technology that has shown excellent performance in laboratories for the treatment of domestic and high strength wastewater and is starting to be applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps pronk et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 ags has certain advantages over conventional activated sludge cas in terms of lower reactor footprint higher capacity for organic loading and simultaneous removal of nutrients and organics he et al 2020 the compact structure of the biomass granules gives the reactor higher resilience against shock loads and toxic wastewater and provides better biomass retention due to the enhanced settling properties franca et al 2018 nancharaiah reddy 2018 although ags has consistently shown promise in terms of performance the operation of ags bioreactors is challenging due to the large number of factors affecting the process wilén et al 2018 the characteristics of the influent wastewater biomass properties within the reactor and operational conditions all play a significant role in the removal efficiency of the reactor additionally these factors are interconnected and have complex nonlinear relationships khan et al 2013 influent characteristics and the mode of operation of the sequencing batch reactor sbr play a significant role in the biomass microbial culture which in turn affects the integrity of the granule structure and settling ability the settling ability of biomass is also affected by the settling time volumetric exchange ratio and discharge time at the end of the settling time slow settling biomass that does not settle below the effluent port gets washed out of the reactor during the decant phase leaving the faster settling granules inside the reactor qin et al 2004 wang et al 2004 this also affects the concentration of biomass left inside the reactor after every cycle of operation which provides seed for new granule formation and therefore directly affects the level of organics and nutrients removal a certain aeration time is necessary for aerobic degradation of organics nitrification and for providing the required shear force that triggers the granulation process in the biomass flocs the latter being the governing factor hamza et al 2018 other factors that affect the ags process include the influent ph volumetric exchange ratio hydraulic retention time hrt and temperature khan et al 2013 sudden changes to these factors can lead to the failure of the structural integrity of the granules and the washout of the biomass out of the reactor resulting in the reactor failing to meet the required effluent quality since these factors do continue to change the operation of an ags system is challenging and requires careful monitoring a tool that can simulate ags reactors considering all previously mentioned factors would help alleviate some of this challenge such a tool can provide operators with the ability to predict the reactor performance and adapt as the quality of influent wastewater changes there are several studies in the literature that present physical models for ags reactors baeten et al 2019 ni yu 2010 physical ags models utilize the biofilm model to simulate the diffusion of the substrate into the granules and activated sludge models asm based equations to simulate the kinetics of the biological process cui et al 2020 many restrictions and assumptions have to be made to be able to develop physical models without being overly complicated ni yu 2010 the calibrated kinetic and stoichiometric parameters will change with any change in operation or influent wastewater making it challenging to use physical models for process control baeten et al 2018 physical models however are excellent for understanding the biological processes conversion rates and for studying the factors affecting the process performance machine learning provides an excellent alternative to physical models for predicting reactor performance and process control data driven models can overcome the need for continuous re calibration of physical models they are more adaptive and can learn from new data that is collected as the process continues to run el din et al 2004 the use of machine learning for ags modelling is still not as studied as physical models baeten et al 2019 artificial neural networks ann were used to simulate the ags process in a simple model structure where only chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn removals were predicted with an r2 of 0 9 and 0 81 gong et al 2018 single hidden layer anns were used to predict the effluent cod using six inputs resulting in an r2 of 0 91 mahmod wahab 2017 another ags model was developed using single hidden layer feed forward anns using eight inputs to predict the effluent cod nh4 n and tn with an r2 of 0 9988 0 9997 and 0 9991 respectively liang et al 2020 a more comprehensive model structure was developed using feed forward multi layer anns to simulate the full ags process including the prediction of biomass characteristics and the removal rates of cod ammonia and phosphates with a minimum prediction r2 of 99 zaghloul et al 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis and support vector regression svr were investigated as alternative algorithms to ann concluding that svr provided comparable results to ann with a minimum r2 of 0 997 while anfis provided lower prediction accuracy than ann and svr with a minimum r2 of 0 815 when simulating ags reactors zaghloul et al 2020 aside from modelling ags machine learning has shown excellent performance in simulating other wastewater treatment processes such as cas showing the potential application of machine learning in forecasting and process control corominas et al 2018 an ann model was successfully used for modelling the bod and tss removal in a full scale cas process using single input single output models with an r2 of 0 665 and 0 542 respectively hamed et al 2004 ann was also used for the development of software sensors that predict the effluent tn tp and cod for a real time remote monitoring system in another full scale cas treatment plant with an r2 of 0 952 0 934 and 0 921 respectively lee et al 2008 svr was used to predict the removal of cod ammonia and nitrates in a cas process using microbial community data with an r2 of 0 9501 0 7936 and 0 8916 respectively seshan et al 2014 ann and svr were compared for the prediction of effluent tn in a cas process treating food waste leachate showing that both algorithms performed similarly where the r2 was 0 47 and 0 46 respectively however the svr suffered from overfitting where the training r2 was 1 00 guo et al 2015 anfis was compared to svr for predicting the removal of tkn in a full scale bnr plant where svr provided better performance than anfis with r2 values of 0 85 and 0 91 respectively manu thalla 2017 the studies above concluded that ann svr and anfis are capable of simulating various biological treatment processes in wwtps it was also observed that while ann provided reliable results it required the largest training datasets to provide good quality modelling svr was reported to provide unique solutions to regression problems and not as likely to get trapped in local error minima during error optimization as ann but it is hard to interpret the final model formulation and the computational requirements increase with larger datasets karamizadeh et al 2014 september anfis models can be relatively easier to interpret than ann and svr but the number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially with the number of input variables and input membership functions stathakis et al 2006 ye et al 2020 detailed the characteristics advantages and limitations of several algorithms including the ones used in this study ye et al 2020 they showed that 1 anns are accurate but have the risk of overfitting and harder to find the best architecture 2 svr works well with noisy data and does not require as much training data but needs higher computation power that other algorithms 3 anfis can optimally solve nonlinear problems but it is difficult to find the best model structure machine learning ideally requires large datasets for training the algorithms liu et al 2017 databases from ags wwtps are still not large enough for conventional machine learning simulations small datasets are challenging when used for training machine learning models i e the training process becomes highly affected by data quality issues dimensionality and multicollinearity shaikhina khovanova 2017 additionally small datasets with high dimensionality increase the required level of model complexity to achieve reasonable prediction accuracies wójcik kurdziel 2019 data pre processing and feature selection play an important role in handling outliers and gaps normalizing features and reducing dimensionality and multicollinearity in the dataset which improves the model training and final performance this work presents a modelling approach for ags reactors when only small datasets are available data were pre processed and cleaned then feature selection was performed using the variance inflation factor vif for reducing multicollinearity and the rrelieff algorithm for ranking inputs a combination of ann svr and anfis algorithms was used via different ensemble techniques and the best performing technique was used for the final model a multi stage model structure was developed to provide stepwise predictions where outputs of each stage get added to the potential pool of inputs for the following stage the purpose of this model is to provide a tool that can predict the biomass characteristics inside ags reactors effluent characteristics concentrations of cod nh4 n and po4 3 and potential failure to meet user defined treatment requirements 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup three sbrs were set up and operated to collect the required data for this study reactor r1 had a diameter of 89 mm and a working volume of 4 5 l reactors r2 and r3 had a diameter of 150 mm and a working volume of 19 l fig 1 shows the general setup of the reactors the sbr operation was automated with scheduled times for fill idle aeration reaction settling and draw decant table 1 shows the cycle times and superficial air velocity used for the duration of the data collection period aeration was provided using air compressors and controlled using cole parmer airflow meters and regulators air was diffused into the reactor using paintair fine bubble ceramic diffusers as4 masterflex peristaltic pumps were used for feeding the reactors the reactors were operated using synthetic wastewater prepared as detailed in tay et al 2002 the main carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources were sodium acetate ammonium chloride monopotassium and dipotassium phosphate respectively return activated sludge ras was procured from the pine creek wastewater treatment plant for seeding the granulation process the reactors were run at a stable temperature of 18 2 c influent effluent and biomass samples were collected daily mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss 5 minute sludge volumetric index svi5 and 30 minute svi svi30 were measured according to standard methods rice et al 2017 the united states environmental protection agency usepa reactor digestion method was adopted for the measurement of cod using a hach dr 2400 spectrophotometer the salicylate method was used to measure ammonia with tnt 830 831 832 and 833 kits ion chromatography was used to measure reactive phosphate using a metrohm compact ic flex based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater rice et al 2017 laser particle size analysis was used to measure the granule size malvern mastersizer series 2000 2 2 model structure this study adopted a 5 stage model structure where each of the stages 2 to 5 is predicted using the preceding stages as potential inputs as shown in fig 2 the multi stage model structure is designed to simulate the cause effect process in ags reactors where the influent characteristics and operational parameters affect the biomass concentration due to growth and decay of the microbial community the biomass concentration and the sbr operation directly affect the biomass settling properties which in turn affects the granule growth all the previous parameters and interactions affect the removal efficiency and the effluent wastewater quality each of the parameters in stages 2 5 were predicted using a separate model except for the f m ratio that was calculated using the influent organics and biomass concentrations then added as input for stages 4 and 5 the multi stage structure also adds versatility during model development as it allows using different inputs for each output in this study three algorithm alternatives were individually used for simulating the ags process ann svr and anfis the outputs of individual models were combined as inputs to ensemble algorithms using five different alternative methods ann svr anfis arithmetic mean e avg and weighted average e wavg in total each output was predicted eight times using the individual and ensemble alternatives the best performing algorithm out of the eight alternatives was chosen for the final model the ensemble algorithms were denoted with the prefix e fig 3 shows the algorithm choice approach the dataset of 475 days was divided into 404 days for developing the models and 71 days for evaluation the evaluation dataset was completely isolated and was only used after the models were trained and chosen fig 4 shows the data divisions for the algorithms used in this study the model development data 404 days was divided according to the requirements of the algorithm being trained the ann and e ann models had a data division scheme of 70 for training 15 for test and 15 for validation which corresponded to 284 60 and 60 days respectively the svr and e svr models utilized the full 404 days for training the anfis and e anfis models used 85 of the data for training and 15 for validation which corresponded to 344 and 60 days respectively the e avg and e wavg ensembles are not machine learning algorithms thus they did not require training and validation 2 3 data pre processing the dataset collected for this study consisted of 475 days datasets used for training machine learning algorithms need to undergo a cleaning process that mainly removes outliers fills missing points randomizes the dataset and normalizes all the data features to the same scale in this study outliers were removed during data collection and missing data points were filled using linear regression imputation lakshminarayan et al 1999 randomization is done to remove the effect of phased operation and the use of multiple reactors when the dataset is split into training and evaluation datasets the statistical properties of the training and evaluation datasets must be as close as possible to ensure proper evaluation of the models table 2 shows the maximum minimum mean and coefficient of variation for the training and evaluation datasets following randomization each feature in the training dataset is normalized to the scale of 0 1 by dividing the feature by its maximum value the evaluation dataset was normalized using the training maximum to keep the evaluation dataset unseen during the model development therefore the normalized values might slightly exceed one if the maximum of the evaluation dataset was higher than that of the training dataset 2 4 feature selection the choice of model inputs has a significant effect on model performance the dataset collected contained input parameters that are correlated at varying degrees and contributed differently to each of the outputs each output had a pool of parameters to choose its inputs from using feature selection methods such as multicollinearity reduction and rreleiff algorithms linearly correlated input parameters reduce the orthogonality of the model which is also known as multicollinearity alin 2010 multicollinearity is a source of overfitting during training and results in models with low reliability read belsley 1994 the level of multicollinearity in a set of parameters can be measured using the variance inflation factor vif as shown in eq 1 it is generally accepted that vif values of 5 and below are accepted for regression problems if the vif is larger than 5 the parameter with the highest vif is removed and the test is repeated till the maximum vif is 5 or less 1 v i f 1 1 r i 2 after multicollinearity is reduced and redundant parameters are removed the remaining parameters were sorted according to a weight calculated for each parameter using the rrelieff algorithm the rrelieff algorithm is one of the filter methods for feature selection that assigns weights to input parameters based on their effect on the output using the k nearest neighbours approach for input output instances where higher weights correspond to more important inputs urbanowicz et al 2018 weights are calculated based on three probabilities at the nearest instances a different input value at nearest outputs a different output value at nearest inputs and a different output value when there is a difference in the input value detailed mathematical formulation and the algorithm structure can be found in robnik šikonja kononenko 1997 inputs that are more consistent with the nearest neighbours in explaining the variation in outputs receive higher weights the rrelieff algorithm being one of the filter methods carries the advantage that it is not affected by the induction algorithms applied to the raw data data pre processing urbanowicz et al 2018 this allows the chosen inputs to be used with different machine learning algorithms with confidence the number of nearest neighbours k used in this study was determined by calculating the input weights as k is increased from 1 to 500 weights were used at k 200 where the results have stabilized as shown in fig 5 2 5 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks mimic the way neurons work in the human brain to perform complex operations the anns type used in this study feed forward neural networks utilize an error minimization algorithm to tune the network weights fernando shamseldin 2009 sammut webb 2016 well designed and trained neural networks can achieve outstanding prediction accuracies however this comes at the expense of long training time as the error minimization functions are generally slow to converge additionally large training datasets are needed to reach high prediction accuracies without overfitting neural networks can also overfit if the inputs are not well selected or the layers architecture is not well designed lawrence giles 2000 ye et al 2020 in this study bayesian regularization was used as the objective function for error minimization using a linear formulation of squared errors and network weights foresee hagan 1997 the network architectures were selected by training all ann combinations of 1 3 hidden layers and 1 10 hidden nodes in each layer this approach resulted in the training of 8880 neural networks for the 8 outputs the best performing network selected for each of the outputs was the one with the most accurate prediction lowest error and with similar training and test performance these conditions ensured that the chosen networks did not overfit or underfit 2 6 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis is used to simulate complex processes with measurement uncertainty it is a universal approximator that utilizes logical rules to reach an output through human like reasoning jang 1993 in anfis membership functions are used to map numerical inputs to fuzzy sets a learning algorithm similar to the back propagation algorithm is used to minimize the errors by optimizing the anfis parameters each of the outputs in this study was predicted using a separate anfis model the clustering method used was grid partitioning as it allows for choosing the desired membership functions grid partitioning however assigns a fuzzy rule for each input membership function combination which exponentially increases the number of rules and the computational requirement for training the models 2 7 support vector regression support vector regression svr is an algorithm based on the statistical learning theory that uses the structural risk minimization srm method to minimize the modelling error and maintain low model complexity smola schölkopf 2004 vapnik 2000 the nonlinear svr model formula is shown in eq 2 for an input vector x output vector y and n number of samples 2 y i 1 n w i φ i x b where w i is a weight vector b is bias φ i is a nonlinear kernel function that maps the training data to a higher dimensional feature space making it possible to linearize the model smola schölkopf 2004 a gaussian kernel was used as it is easier to tune than other functions and it can also handle complex error boundaries goyal ojha 2011 three hyperparameters need tuning in svr the kernel scale γ box constraint c and the error band ε the kernel scale γ determines how much the kernel function will detect variation in the input vectors it is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the kernel function to input variation the svr model can underfit if the kernel function is not sensitive enough to detect changes in inputs and can overfit if the kernel function was too sensitive to detect the smallest variation in inputs the box constraint c is a regularization factor needed by the srm to control the penalty on large prediction residual errors it represents the trade off between the training error and model complexity where small c values will result in poor predictions and large values will cause overfitting finally the error band represents the space where the predictions can be made around the actual measured values tighter error bands will result in more accurate predictions at the expense of the model complexity more details on the mathematical formulation of svr can be found in awad khanna 2015 cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 smola schölkopf 2004 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerobic granular sludge performance the reactors simulated in this study were operated for data collection for a collective of 475 days periods of stable operation have been observed along with some disruptions due to biomass washout the average standard deviation influent cod nh4 n and po4 3 concentrations in the reactors are 3309 1838 130 41 and 48 18 mg l respectively the systems exhibited stable organics and nutrients removal throughout the duration of the experiment with an average cod nh4 n and po4 3 removal efficiencies of 96 8 81 18 and 84 18 respectively aerobic granular sludge has been proven to have consistent good removal of organics and nutrients de kreuk et al 2005 iorhemen et al 2020 nancharaiah reddy 2018 the stratification of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic microbial communities has also been observed resulting in better nitrogen and phosphorus removal wang et al 2008 yilmaz et al 2008 the average mlss and mlvss concentrations were 7888 5158 and 6284 3810mg l respectively the average mlss mlvss ratio was 80 which is a typical value in aerobic treatment reactors the average svi5 and svi30 were 114 63 and 73 34 ml g respectively demonstrating the fast settling of the granules granules are considered to have good settling properties when svi30 is below 100 ml mg hamza et al 2018 liu et al 2007 the average ratio of granulation in ags reactors calculated by the svi30 svi5 hamza et al 2018 was 64 and the average granule diameter was 445 206 µm which showed that the biomass was mostly granular the presence of some floccular biomass and fluctuation in settling properties were expected due to the variation in f m ratio 2 1 hamza et al 2018 3 2 feature selection the ann svr and anfis models that were used to predict outputs 1 2 and 3 fig 3 were developed using the operation and performance dataset which was collected from the laboratory table 2 feature selection was necessary to overcome the multicollinearity between different parameters and remove the inputs that adversely affect the model performance the feature selection methods used in this study were able to reduce the level of multicollinearity and identify the most effective parameters for each output which resulted in the elimination of some parameters calculating the vif for the inputs of each stage resulted in the reduction of inputs by 4 5 8 and 7 for stages 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the results of the multicollinearity reduction are shown in table 3 the level of multicollinearity is accepted once the maximum vif is below 5 the data collection plan was quite thorough in the selection of parameters to measure this resulted in a high level of multicollinearity in the initial dataset due to the close relationships between parameters such as the olr cod or the flowrate reactor volume hrt price 1998 further dimensionality reduction was applied using the rrelieff algorithm to rank the inputs for each output unlike the vif test that was input dependent the rrelieff weights depended on the relationship between the inputs and outputs which resulted in different input weights for each of the outputs even within the same stage table 4 shows the final inputs used for the ann svr and anfis models in table 4 the ann was denoted by n svr was denoted by s and anfis was denoted by a table 4 shows for each output the models in which each of the predictors was used for example the influent nh4 n influent po4 3 olr and hrt were used as inputs for the mlvss anfis model the ranking done using the rrelieff algorithm was used for the three modelling algorithms selected inputs were chosen from the ranked list and noting the model performance until the model stopped improving or was unable to complete the training due to computational limitation in anfis models the anfis model was restricted by the number of inputs to be used as is was found that adding more inputs would significantly increase the required training time and cpu usage anfis was limited to a maximum of six inputs selected according to the rrelieff ranking except for the mlvss where the best performance was achieved with four inputs and the effluent ammonia where seven inputs had to be used to achieve acceptable performance feature selection was found to be the most important step in the development as it has improved the performance of the ann svr and anfis models by raising the overall evaluation average r2 from 93 85 and 83 to 94 2 92 4 and 85 6 respectively using the same data and model structure 3 3 model development the ann model was trained using the selected inputs in table 4 the network architectures for each ann model are shown in table 5 all ann models had three hidden layers with different combinations of hidden nodes table 5 also shows the tuned svr hyperparameters there is a large variation in the values of c γ and ε between the models the available literature explains the individual effect of each of the hyperparameters on the performance of the trained svr models and the risk of overfitting however the hyperparameters have a combined effect on the performance the values of c γ and ε were optimized within the svr training process using bayesian optimization to minimize 5 fold cross validation error the optimization of the hyperparameters results in the best possible prediction accuracy without significant overfitting finally the anfis models were all assigned two input membership functions it was difficult to increase the number of membership functions due to computational limitations that resulted in failing to train the models different membership functions were tested and the best performing ones were chosen for the final model triangular type membership functions were used for the mlss mlvss svi30 and effluent nh4 n eq 3 3 y 0 x a x a b a a x b c x c b b x c 0 x c where a b and c are constants determined through the anfis training the rest of the anfis models used gaussian combination membership functions eq 4 4 y e x μ 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation and µ is the mean of the training data the average training performance of the ann model for all outputs was 96 0 03 and 3 3 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the average training performance of the svr model for all outputs was 95 8 0 026 and 1 9 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the average training performance of the anfis model for all outputs was 92 5 0 047 and 4 6 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the overall performance of svr was better than ann in terms of nrmse and smape the anfis model was considerably less accurate than the ann and svr which can be attributed to the computational limitation on the number of inputs and membership functions that were used the outputs of the ann svr and anfis models were used as inputs to five ensemble alternatives e ann e svr e anfis e avg and e wavg the e avg was the arithmetic mean of the three inputs which resulted in an overall average training performance of 97 3 0 027 and 2 8 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively e wavg was a weighted average of the three inputs using the training r2 of the ann svr and anfis for each output as relative weights this approach had the advantage of favouring the more accurate inputs which provided an improvement over e avg when there was a large difference in accuracy between the ann svr and anfis the overall average performance of the e wavg was 97 8 0 024 and 2 4 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the e ann e svr and e anfis are machine learning based ensembles where the ann svr and anfis outputs were used as inputs table 6 shows the architecture hyperparameters and membership functions of the e ann e svr and e anfis respectively these algorithms were much simpler in their development as they were intended to use three versions of the true output to make the predictions also the number of inputs was much less than the original three models maintaining a simple model was essential to ensure that overfitting was minimal considering the small number of inputs three and that the inputs are variants of the same parameters that are already close to the desired solution all neural networks had one hidden layer with a single neuron providing a training performance of 98 7 0 016 and 1 8 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the e svr hyperparameters provide insight into the performance of the algorithm where large c values indicate larger penalties on errors in all outputs however the γ values were also much higher than the svr model indicating that the kernel function is not as sensitive to the variation in the inputs the overall average training performance of the e svr was 98 7 0 016 and 1 6 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the e anfis models had 2 gaussian combination membership functions with an overall training performance of 94 3 0 031 and 1 9 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively 3 4 model performance the developed algorithms in this study ann svr anfis e ann e svr e anfis e avg e wavg were all validated using the evaluation dataset that was isolated before developing the models table 7 shows the overall evaluation performance averaged for all outputs for each algorithm it was found that the e ann provided the best performance in terms of r2 nrmse and smape the e svr and e wavg provided a close performance to the e ann but the e anfis was not able to reach the same level of performance although e ann outperformed the other ensemble algorithm in the overall performance the e wavg was able to provide a somewhat better prediction accuracy for the granule size with an r2 of 89 as opposed to the e ann with an r2 of 85 the ensemble models did not provide an improvement over the ann for the prediction of the effluent cod where the ann provided an r2 of 99 65 as opposed to the 99 3 r2 of the e ann the best performing models for each of the outputs were selected for the final model as shown in table 8 fig 6 shows the diagonal plots of the final selected models after using the best performing ensemble algorithms the final model improved the overall prediction accuracy over the ann model the best performing single algorithm by raising the overall average r2 from 94 2 to 95 2 and reducing the overall average nrmse from 0 037 to 0 032 and the overall average smape from 4 2 to 3 7 the most significant improvement was observed in the granule size where the r2 was increased from 81 to 88 2 it was found that even though the e svr was close to the e ann in terms of prediction accuracy of the evaluation data it suffered from a slightly higher level of overfitting in some of the outputs where the difference between the training and evaluation predictions was larger than that of e ann the e anfis did not provide predictions as accurately as the other ensembles as there was not enough distinction in the input parameters for the anfis to be able to develop a reliable rule base table 9 compares the model developed in this study to other machine learning models in the literature using the prediction r2 of the validation datasets as a performance indicator the comparison shows that this study can achieve prediction accuracies that are similar to those made by ags machine learning models with much larger datasets zaghloul et al 2020 it can also be observed that the performance of the model developed in this study achieves prediction accuracies that are higher than ags models that were developed with small datasets gong et al 2018 mahmod wahab 2017 other cas models with small datasets resulted in predictions that are consistent with ags models el din et al 2004 manu thalla 2017 the small size of test datasets can result in less reliable models that do not provide consistent results which is demonstrated in the results of mahmod and wahab 2017 where the training and testing r2 were 78 and 91 17 respectively mahmod wahab 2017 svr and anns were found to perform at the same level of accuracy in other cas and ags models which is consistent with the models developed in this study gong et al 2018 guo et al 2015 mahmod wahab 2017 seshan et al 2014 4 multi stage model structure ags machine learning models in the literature are all single stage models where a group of inputs is used to predict the final effluent quality parameters without considering the process sequence gong et al 2018 mahmod wahab 2017 two stage models were designed to improve the model structure with success zaghloul et al 2020 the multi stage model structure makes the model developed in this study more versatile than other machine learning models as it considers the effect of influent characteristics on the biomass properties and the consequent effect on the effluent quality the multi stage model structure also provides the ability to identify the source of predicted effluent quality issues where the different biomass properties that were predicted at the same instance can be analyzed this mitigates the disadvantage of the application of black box models that can be difficult to use for process interpretation newhart et al 2019 5 failure prediction the model developed in this study can accurately predict the performance of ags reactors under varying operational and influent conditions the model provides a tool that can be used to forecast the reactor behaviour during operation which will guide the operators on experimental design fig 7 shows the predictions made for a portion of the evaluation dataset chronologically ordered and obtained from the same reactor plotted with failure thresholds operators can utilize such figures to identify sources of process failures and potential causes the local treated effluent standards were set as thresholds for this study maximum effluent cod nh4 n and po4 3 were set to 20 mg l 10 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively the threshold for the granule size was set to 200 µm below which the biomass would be considered floccular liu et al 2010 which indicates either structural integrity failure of the granule or failure to achieve a state of granulation the mlss threshold was chosen for this study to be 4000 mg l the mlss dropping below the threshold would indicate a washout of the biomass due to poor settling the settling properties can also be predicted by the svi values additionally the svi30 svi5 indicates the percentage or granulation inside the reactor as defined by kocaturk and erguder 2016 the threshold for the svi30 svi5 was set to 50 for this study it can be observed that a failure to remove nh4 n has occurred between samples 218 and 232 where the effluent concentration reached 28 mg l the mlss plot shows a rapid decline in the mlss concentration which entailed a loss of the slow growing nitrifying bacteria thus the delayed effect of poor nh4 n removal while the biomass recovered further analysis of the results shows that there was a drop in the granule size and the granulation ratio inside the reactor indicating that a partial washout has occurred followed by a rapid growth of heterotrophic biomass in floccular form due to the abundance of organics f m ratio was disturbed due to the loss of biomass the influent cod was reduced from around 7000 mg l to 4500 mg l after the biomass washout instance this improved the observed cod removal efficiency as the new heterotrophic growth was able to handle the influent organics the effluent cod concentration was above the allowed threshold as the reactor was being operated to treat high organic content wastewater where the effluent wastewater was to be polished before disposal the aerobic biological process although successful in removing most of the organic load was unable to bring the cod concentrations below the required limits hamza et al 2018 6 conclusion a machine learning model was developed for ags reactors using a combination of neural networks support vector regression and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems feature selection methods were applied and a five stage model structure was adopted this study shows that proper feature selection and combining multiple machine learning algorithms in an ensemble can improve the performance of data driven models when the available dataset is small the two feature selection methods were applied to reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem and reduce the multicollinearity of the input data combining multiple algorithms using simple neural networks or weighted average ensembles reduced the levels of over and under fitting of the individual algorithms the modular nature of the model structure allowed the use of best performing models out of the eight alternatives for each output the model developed in this study was able to predict the behaviour of ags reactors and provide insight into the process by explaining the causes of predicted failures declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors would like to acknowledge the national science and engineering research council of canada for

17371,machine learning models provide an adaptive tool to predict the performance of treatment reactors under varying operational and influent conditions aerobic granular sludge ags is still an emerging technology and does not have a long history of full scale application there is therefore a scarcity of long term data in this field which impacted the development of data driven models in this study a machine learning model was developed for simulating the ags process using 475 days of data collected from three lab based reactors inputs were selected based on rrelieff ranking after multicollinearity reduction a five stage model structure was adopted in which each parameter was predicted using separate models for the preceding parameters as inputs an ensemble of artificial neural

treatment technology that has shown excellent performance in laboratories for the treatment of domestic and high strength wastewater and is starting to be applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants wwtps pronk et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 ags has certain advantages over conventional activated sludge cas in terms of lower reactor footprint higher capacity for organic loading and simultaneous removal of nutrients and organics he et al 2020 the compact structure of the biomass granules gives the reactor higher resilience against shock loads and toxic wastewater and provides better biomass retention due to the enhanced settling properties franca et al 2018 nancharaiah reddy 2018 although ags has consistently shown promise in terms of performance the operation of ags bioreactors is challenging due to the large number of factors affecting the process wilén et al 2018 the characteristics of the influent wastewater biomass properties within the reactor and operational conditions all play a significant role in the removal efficiency of the reactor additionally these factors are interconnected and have complex nonlinear relationships khan et al 2013 influent characteristics and the mode of operation of the sequencing batch reactor sbr play a significant role in the biomass microbial culture which in turn affects the integrity of the granule structure and settling ability the settling ability of biomass is also affected by the settling time volumetric exchange ratio and discharge time at the end of the settling time slow settling biomass that does not settle below the effluent port gets washed out of the reactor during the decant phase leaving the faster settling granules inside the reactor qin et al 2004 wang et al 2004 this also affects the concentration of biomass left inside the reactor after every cycle of operation which provides seed for new granule formation and therefore directly affects the level of organics and nutrients removal a certain aeration time is necessary for aerobic degradation of organics nitrification and for providing the required shear force that triggers the granulation process in the biomass flocs the latter being the governing factor hamza et al 2018 other factors that affect the ags process include the influent ph volumetric exchange ratio hydraulic retention time hrt and temperature khan et al 2013 sudden changes to these factors can lead to the failure of the structural integrity of the granules and the washout of the biomass out of the reactor resulting in the reactor failing to meet the required effluent quality since these factors do continue to change the operation of an ags system is challenging and requires careful monitoring a tool that can simulate ags reactors considering all previously mentioned factors would help alleviate some of this challenge such a tool can provide operators with the ability to predict the reactor performance and adapt as the quality of influent wastewater changes there are several studies in the literature that present physical models for ags reactors baeten et al 2019 ni yu 2010 physical ags models utilize the biofilm model to simulate the diffusion of the substrate into the granules and activated sludge models asm based equations to simulate the kinetics of the biological process cui et al 2020 many restrictions and assumptions have to be made to be able to develop physical models without being overly complicated ni yu 2010 the calibrated kinetic and stoichiometric parameters will change with any change in operation or influent wastewater making it challenging to use physical models for process control baeten et al 2018 physical models however are excellent for understanding the biological processes conversion rates and for studying the factors affecting the process performance machine learning provides an excellent alternative to physical models for predicting reactor performance and process control data driven models can overcome the need for continuous re calibration of physical models they are more adaptive and can learn from new data that is collected as the process continues to run el din et al 2004 the use of machine learning for ags modelling is still not as studied as physical models baeten et al 2019 artificial neural networks ann were used to simulate the ags process in a simple model structure where only chemical oxygen demand cod and total nitrogen tn removals were predicted with an r2 of 0 9 and 0 81 gong et al 2018 single hidden layer anns were used to predict the effluent cod using six inputs resulting in an r2 of 0 91 mahmod wahab 2017 another ags model was developed using single hidden layer feed forward anns using eight inputs to predict the effluent cod nh4 n and tn with an r2 of 0 9988 0 9997 and 0 9991 respectively liang et al 2020 a more comprehensive model structure was developed using feed forward multi layer anns to simulate the full ags process including the prediction of biomass characteristics and the removal rates of cod ammonia and phosphates with a minimum prediction r2 of 99 zaghloul et al 2018 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis and support vector regression svr were investigated as alternative algorithms to ann concluding that svr provided comparable results to ann with a minimum r2 of 0 997 while anfis provided lower prediction accuracy than ann and svr with a minimum r2 of 0 815 when simulating ags reactors zaghloul et al 2020 aside from modelling ags machine learning has shown excellent performance in simulating other wastewater treatment processes such as cas showing the potential application of machine learning in forecasting and process control corominas et al 2018 an ann model was successfully used for modelling the bod and tss removal in a full scale cas process using single input single output models with an r2 of 0 665 and 0 542 respectively hamed et al 2004 ann was also used for the development of software sensors that predict the effluent tn tp and cod for a real time remote monitoring system in another full scale cas treatment plant with an r2 of 0 952 0 934 and 0 921 respectively lee et al 2008 svr was used to predict the removal of cod ammonia and nitrates in a cas process using microbial community data with an r2 of 0 9501 0 7936 and 0 8916 respectively seshan et al 2014 ann and svr were compared for the prediction of effluent tn in a cas process treating food waste leachate showing that both algorithms performed similarly where the r2 was 0 47 and 0 46 respectively however the svr suffered from overfitting where the training r2 was 1 00 guo et al 2015 anfis was compared to svr for predicting the removal of tkn in a full scale bnr plant where svr provided better performance than anfis with r2 values of 0 85 and 0 91 respectively manu thalla 2017 the studies above concluded that ann svr and anfis are capable of simulating various biological treatment processes in wwtps it was also observed that while ann provided reliable results it required the largest training datasets to provide good quality modelling svr was reported to provide unique solutions to regression problems and not as likely to get trapped in local error minima during error optimization as ann but it is hard to interpret the final model formulation and the computational requirements increase with larger datasets karamizadeh et al 2014 september anfis models can be relatively easier to interpret than ann and svr but the number of fuzzy rules increases exponentially with the number of input variables and input membership functions stathakis et al 2006 ye et al 2020 detailed the characteristics advantages and limitations of several algorithms including the ones used in this study ye et al 2020 they showed that 1 anns are accurate but have the risk of overfitting and harder to find the best architecture 2 svr works well with noisy data and does not require as much training data but needs higher computation power that other algorithms 3 anfis can optimally solve nonlinear problems but it is difficult to find the best model structure machine learning ideally requires large datasets for training the algorithms liu et al 2017 databases from ags wwtps are still not large enough for conventional machine learning simulations small datasets are challenging when used for training machine learning models i e the training process becomes highly affected by data quality issues dimensionality and multicollinearity shaikhina khovanova 2017 additionally small datasets with high dimensionality increase the required level of model complexity to achieve reasonable prediction accuracies wójcik kurdziel 2019 data pre processing and feature selection play an important role in handling outliers and gaps normalizing features and reducing dimensionality and multicollinearity in the dataset which improves the model training and final performance this work presents a modelling approach for ags reactors when only small datasets are available data were pre processed and cleaned then feature selection was performed using the variance inflation factor vif for reducing multicollinearity and the rrelieff algorithm for ranking inputs a combination of ann svr and anfis algorithms was used via different ensemble techniques and the best performing technique was used for the final model a multi stage model structure was developed to provide stepwise predictions where outputs of each stage get added to the potential pool of inputs for the following stage the purpose of this model is to provide a tool that can predict the biomass characteristics inside ags reactors effluent characteristics concentrations of cod nh4 n and po4 3 and potential failure to meet user defined treatment requirements 2 methods 2 1 experimental setup three sbrs were set up and operated to collect the required data for this study reactor r1 had a diameter of 89 mm and a working volume of 4 5 l reactors r2 and r3 had a diameter of 150 mm and a working volume of 19 l fig 1 shows the general setup of the reactors the sbr operation was automated with scheduled times for fill idle aeration reaction settling and draw decant table 1 shows the cycle times and superficial air velocity used for the duration of the data collection period aeration was provided using air compressors and controlled using cole parmer airflow meters and regulators air was diffused into the reactor using paintair fine bubble ceramic diffusers as4 masterflex peristaltic pumps were used for feeding the reactors the reactors were operated using synthetic wastewater prepared as detailed in tay et al 2002 the main carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources were sodium acetate ammonium chloride monopotassium and dipotassium phosphate respectively return activated sludge ras was procured from the pine creek wastewater treatment plant for seeding the granulation process the reactors were run at a stable temperature of 18 2 c influent effluent and biomass samples were collected daily mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss 5 minute sludge volumetric index svi5 and 30 minute svi svi30 were measured according to standard methods rice et al 2017 the united states environmental protection agency usepa reactor digestion method was adopted for the measurement of cod using a hach dr 2400 spectrophotometer the salicylate method was used to measure ammonia with tnt 830 831 832 and 833 kits ion chromatography was used to measure reactive phosphate using a metrohm compact ic flex based on the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater rice et al 2017 laser particle size analysis was used to measure the granule size malvern mastersizer series 2000 2 2 model structure this study adopted a 5 stage model structure where each of the stages 2 to 5 is predicted using the preceding stages as potential inputs as shown in fig 2 the multi stage model structure is designed to simulate the cause effect process in ags reactors where the influent characteristics and operational parameters affect the biomass concentration due to growth and decay of the microbial community the biomass concentration and the sbr operation directly affect the biomass settling properties which in turn affects the granule growth all the previous parameters and interactions affect the removal efficiency and the effluent wastewater quality each of the parameters in stages 2 5 were predicted using a separate model except for the f m ratio that was calculated using the influent organics and biomass concentrations then added as input for stages 4 and 5 the multi stage structure also adds versatility during model development as it allows using different inputs for each output in this study three algorithm alternatives were individually used for simulating the ags process ann svr and anfis the outputs of individual models were combined as inputs to ensemble algorithms using five different alternative methods ann svr anfis arithmetic mean e avg and weighted average e wavg in total each output was predicted eight times using the individual and ensemble alternatives the best performing algorithm out of the eight alternatives was chosen for the final model the ensemble algorithms were denoted with the prefix e fig 3 shows the algorithm choice approach the dataset of 475 days was divided into 404 days for developing the models and 71 days for evaluation the evaluation dataset was completely isolated and was only used after the models were trained and chosen fig 4 shows the data divisions for the algorithms used in this study the model development data 404 days was divided according to the requirements of the algorithm being trained the ann and e ann models had a data division scheme of 70 for training 15 for test and 15 for validation which corresponded to 284 60 and 60 days respectively the svr and e svr models utilized the full 404 days for training the anfis and e anfis models used 85 of the data for training and 15 for validation which corresponded to 344 and 60 days respectively the e avg and e wavg ensembles are not machine learning algorithms thus they did not require training and validation 2 3 data pre processing the dataset collected for this study consisted of 475 days datasets used for training machine learning algorithms need to undergo a cleaning process that mainly removes outliers fills missing points randomizes the dataset and normalizes all the data features to the same scale in this study outliers were removed during data collection and missing data points were filled using linear regression imputation lakshminarayan et al 1999 randomization is done to remove the effect of phased operation and the use of multiple reactors when the dataset is split into training and evaluation datasets the statistical properties of the training and evaluation datasets must be as close as possible to ensure proper evaluation of the models table 2 shows the maximum minimum mean and coefficient of variation for the training and evaluation datasets following randomization each feature in the training dataset is normalized to the scale of 0 1 by dividing the feature by its maximum value the evaluation dataset was normalized using the training maximum to keep the evaluation dataset unseen during the model development therefore the normalized values might slightly exceed one if the maximum of the evaluation dataset was higher than that of the training dataset 2 4 feature selection the choice of model inputs has a significant effect on model performance the dataset collected contained input parameters that are correlated at varying degrees and contributed differently to each of the outputs each output had a pool of parameters to choose its inputs from using feature selection methods such as multicollinearity reduction and rreleiff algorithms linearly correlated input parameters reduce the orthogonality of the model which is also known as multicollinearity alin 2010 multicollinearity is a source of overfitting during training and results in models with low reliability read belsley 1994 the level of multicollinearity in a set of parameters can be measured using the variance inflation factor vif as shown in eq 1 it is generally accepted that vif values of 5 and below are accepted for regression problems if the vif is larger than 5 the parameter with the highest vif is removed and the test is repeated till the maximum vif is 5 or less 1 v i f 1 1 r i 2 after multicollinearity is reduced and redundant parameters are removed the remaining parameters were sorted according to a weight calculated for each parameter using the rrelieff algorithm the rrelieff algorithm is one of the filter methods for feature selection that assigns weights to input parameters based on their effect on the output using the k nearest neighbours approach for input output instances where higher weights correspond to more important inputs urbanowicz et al 2018 weights are calculated based on three probabilities at the nearest instances a different input value at nearest outputs a different output value at nearest inputs and a different output value when there is a difference in the input value detailed mathematical formulation and the algorithm structure can be found in robnik šikonja kononenko 1997 inputs that are more consistent with the nearest neighbours in explaining the variation in outputs receive higher weights the rrelieff algorithm being one of the filter methods carries the advantage that it is not affected by the induction algorithms applied to the raw data data pre processing urbanowicz et al 2018 this allows the chosen inputs to be used with different machine learning algorithms with confidence the number of nearest neighbours k used in this study was determined by calculating the input weights as k is increased from 1 to 500 weights were used at k 200 where the results have stabilized as shown in fig 5 2 5 artificial neural networks artificial neural networks mimic the way neurons work in the human brain to perform complex operations the anns type used in this study feed forward neural networks utilize an error minimization algorithm to tune the network weights fernando shamseldin 2009 sammut webb 2016 well designed and trained neural networks can achieve outstanding prediction accuracies however this comes at the expense of long training time as the error minimization functions are generally slow to converge additionally large training datasets are needed to reach high prediction accuracies without overfitting neural networks can also overfit if the inputs are not well selected or the layers architecture is not well designed lawrence giles 2000 ye et al 2020 in this study bayesian regularization was used as the objective function for error minimization using a linear formulation of squared errors and network weights foresee hagan 1997 the network architectures were selected by training all ann combinations of 1 3 hidden layers and 1 10 hidden nodes in each layer this approach resulted in the training of 8880 neural networks for the 8 outputs the best performing network selected for each of the outputs was the one with the most accurate prediction lowest error and with similar training and test performance these conditions ensured that the chosen networks did not overfit or underfit 2 6 adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems anfis is used to simulate complex processes with measurement uncertainty it is a universal approximator that utilizes logical rules to reach an output through human like reasoning jang 1993 in anfis membership functions are used to map numerical inputs to fuzzy sets a learning algorithm similar to the back propagation algorithm is used to minimize the errors by optimizing the anfis parameters each of the outputs in this study was predicted using a separate anfis model the clustering method used was grid partitioning as it allows for choosing the desired membership functions grid partitioning however assigns a fuzzy rule for each input membership function combination which exponentially increases the number of rules and the computational requirement for training the models 2 7 support vector regression support vector regression svr is an algorithm based on the statistical learning theory that uses the structural risk minimization srm method to minimize the modelling error and maintain low model complexity smola schölkopf 2004 vapnik 2000 the nonlinear svr model formula is shown in eq 2 for an input vector x output vector y and n number of samples 2 y i 1 n w i φ i x b where w i is a weight vector b is bias φ i is a nonlinear kernel function that maps the training data to a higher dimensional feature space making it possible to linearize the model smola schölkopf 2004 a gaussian kernel was used as it is easier to tune than other functions and it can also handle complex error boundaries goyal ojha 2011 three hyperparameters need tuning in svr the kernel scale γ box constraint c and the error band ε the kernel scale γ determines how much the kernel function will detect variation in the input vectors it is inversely proportional to the sensitivity of the kernel function to input variation the svr model can underfit if the kernel function is not sensitive enough to detect changes in inputs and can overfit if the kernel function was too sensitive to detect the smallest variation in inputs the box constraint c is a regularization factor needed by the srm to control the penalty on large prediction residual errors it represents the trade off between the training error and model complexity where small c values will result in poor predictions and large values will cause overfitting finally the error band represents the space where the predictions can be made around the actual measured values tighter error bands will result in more accurate predictions at the expense of the model complexity more details on the mathematical formulation of svr can be found in awad khanna 2015 cristianini and shawe taylor 2000 smola schölkopf 2004 3 results and discussion 3 1 aerobic granular sludge performance the reactors simulated in this study were operated for data collection for a collective of 475 days periods of stable operation have been observed along with some disruptions due to biomass washout the average standard deviation influent cod nh4 n and po4 3 concentrations in the reactors are 3309 1838 130 41 and 48 18 mg l respectively the systems exhibited stable organics and nutrients removal throughout the duration of the experiment with an average cod nh4 n and po4 3 removal efficiencies of 96 8 81 18 and 84 18 respectively aerobic granular sludge has been proven to have consistent good removal of organics and nutrients de kreuk et al 2005 iorhemen et al 2020 nancharaiah reddy 2018 the stratification of aerobic anoxic and anaerobic microbial communities has also been observed resulting in better nitrogen and phosphorus removal wang et al 2008 yilmaz et al 2008 the average mlss and mlvss concentrations were 7888 5158 and 6284 3810mg l respectively the average mlss mlvss ratio was 80 which is a typical value in aerobic treatment reactors the average svi5 and svi30 were 114 63 and 73 34 ml g respectively demonstrating the fast settling of the granules granules are considered to have good settling properties when svi30 is below 100 ml mg hamza et al 2018 liu et al 2007 the average ratio of granulation in ags reactors calculated by the svi30 svi5 hamza et al 2018 was 64 and the average granule diameter was 445 206 µm which showed that the biomass was mostly granular the presence of some floccular biomass and fluctuation in settling properties were expected due to the variation in f m ratio 2 1 hamza et al 2018 3 2 feature selection the ann svr and anfis models that were used to predict outputs 1 2 and 3 fig 3 were developed using the operation and performance dataset which was collected from the laboratory table 2 feature selection was necessary to overcome the multicollinearity between different parameters and remove the inputs that adversely affect the model performance the feature selection methods used in this study were able to reduce the level of multicollinearity and identify the most effective parameters for each output which resulted in the elimination of some parameters calculating the vif for the inputs of each stage resulted in the reduction of inputs by 4 5 8 and 7 for stages 2 3 4 and 5 respectively the results of the multicollinearity reduction are shown in table 3 the level of multicollinearity is accepted once the maximum vif is below 5 the data collection plan was quite thorough in the selection of parameters to measure this resulted in a high level of multicollinearity in the initial dataset due to the close relationships between parameters such as the olr cod or the flowrate reactor volume hrt price 1998 further dimensionality reduction was applied using the rrelieff algorithm to rank the inputs for each output unlike the vif test that was input dependent the rrelieff weights depended on the relationship between the inputs and outputs which resulted in different input weights for each of the outputs even within the same stage table 4 shows the final inputs used for the ann svr and anfis models in table 4 the ann was denoted by n svr was denoted by s and anfis was denoted by a table 4 shows for each output the models in which each of the predictors was used for example the influent nh4 n influent po4 3 olr and hrt were used as inputs for the mlvss anfis model the ranking done using the rrelieff algorithm was used for the three modelling algorithms selected inputs were chosen from the ranked list and noting the model performance until the model stopped improving or was unable to complete the training due to computational limitation in anfis models the anfis model was restricted by the number of inputs to be used as is was found that adding more inputs would significantly increase the required training time and cpu usage anfis was limited to a maximum of six inputs selected according to the rrelieff ranking except for the mlvss where the best performance was achieved with four inputs and the effluent ammonia where seven inputs had to be used to achieve acceptable performance feature selection was found to be the most important step in the development as it has improved the performance of the ann svr and anfis models by raising the overall evaluation average r2 from 93 85 and 83 to 94 2 92 4 and 85 6 respectively using the same data and model structure 3 3 model development the ann model was trained using the selected inputs in table 4 the network architectures for each ann model are shown in table 5 all ann models had three hidden layers with different combinations of hidden nodes table 5 also shows the tuned svr hyperparameters there is a large variation in the values of c γ and ε between the models the available literature explains the individual effect of each of the hyperparameters on the performance of the trained svr models and the risk of overfitting however the hyperparameters have a combined effect on the performance the values of c γ and ε were optimized within the svr training process using bayesian optimization to minimize 5 fold cross validation error the optimization of the hyperparameters results in the best possible prediction accuracy without significant overfitting finally the anfis models were all assigned two input membership functions it was difficult to increase the number of membership functions due to computational limitations that resulted in failing to train the models different membership functions were tested and the best performing ones were chosen for the final model triangular type membership functions were used for the mlss mlvss svi30 and effluent nh4 n eq 3 3 y 0 x a x a b a a x b c x c b b x c 0 x c where a b and c are constants determined through the anfis training the rest of the anfis models used gaussian combination membership functions eq 4 4 y e x μ 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the standard deviation and µ is the mean of the training data the average training performance of the ann model for all outputs was 96 0 03 and 3 3 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the average training performance of the svr model for all outputs was 95 8 0 026 and 1 9 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the average training performance of the anfis model for all outputs was 92 5 0 047 and 4 6 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the overall performance of svr was better than ann in terms of nrmse and smape the anfis model was considerably less accurate than the ann and svr which can be attributed to the computational limitation on the number of inputs and membership functions that were used the outputs of the ann svr and anfis models were used as inputs to five ensemble alternatives e ann e svr e anfis e avg and e wavg the e avg was the arithmetic mean of the three inputs which resulted in an overall average training performance of 97 3 0 027 and 2 8 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively e wavg was a weighted average of the three inputs using the training r2 of the ann svr and anfis for each output as relative weights this approach had the advantage of favouring the more accurate inputs which provided an improvement over e avg when there was a large difference in accuracy between the ann svr and anfis the overall average performance of the e wavg was 97 8 0 024 and 2 4 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the e ann e svr and e anfis are machine learning based ensembles where the ann svr and anfis outputs were used as inputs table 6 shows the architecture hyperparameters and membership functions of the e ann e svr and e anfis respectively these algorithms were much simpler in their development as they were intended to use three versions of the true output to make the predictions also the number of inputs was much less than the original three models maintaining a simple model was essential to ensure that overfitting was minimal considering the small number of inputs three and that the inputs are variants of the same parameters that are already close to the desired solution all neural networks had one hidden layer with a single neuron providing a training performance of 98 7 0 016 and 1 8 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the e svr hyperparameters provide insight into the performance of the algorithm where large c values indicate larger penalties on errors in all outputs however the γ values were also much higher than the svr model indicating that the kernel function is not as sensitive to the variation in the inputs the overall average training performance of the e svr was 98 7 0 016 and 1 6 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively the e anfis models had 2 gaussian combination membership functions with an overall training performance of 94 3 0 031 and 1 9 for r2 nrmse and smape respectively 3 4 model performance the developed algorithms in this study ann svr anfis e ann e svr e anfis e avg e wavg were all validated using the evaluation dataset that was isolated before developing the models table 7 shows the overall evaluation performance averaged for all outputs for each algorithm it was found that the e ann provided the best performance in terms of r2 nrmse and smape the e svr and e wavg provided a close performance to the e ann but the e anfis was not able to reach the same level of performance although e ann outperformed the other ensemble algorithm in the overall performance the e wavg was able to provide a somewhat better prediction accuracy for the granule size with an r2 of 89 as opposed to the e ann with an r2 of 85 the ensemble models did not provide an improvement over the ann for the prediction of the effluent cod where the ann provided an r2 of 99 65 as opposed to the 99 3 r2 of the e ann the best performing models for each of the outputs were selected for the final model as shown in table 8 fig 6 shows the diagonal plots of the final selected models after using the best performing ensemble algorithms the final model improved the overall prediction accuracy over the ann model the best performing single algorithm by raising the overall average r2 from 94 2 to 95 2 and reducing the overall average nrmse from 0 037 to 0 032 and the overall average smape from 4 2 to 3 7 the most significant improvement was observed in the granule size where the r2 was increased from 81 to 88 2 it was found that even though the e svr was close to the e ann in terms of prediction accuracy of the evaluation data it suffered from a slightly higher level of overfitting in some of the outputs where the difference between the training and evaluation predictions was larger than that of e ann the e anfis did not provide predictions as accurately as the other ensembles as there was not enough distinction in the input parameters for the anfis to be able to develop a reliable rule base table 9 compares the model developed in this study to other machine learning models in the literature using the prediction r2 of the validation datasets as a performance indicator the comparison shows that this study can achieve prediction accuracies that are similar to those made by ags machine learning models with much larger datasets zaghloul et al 2020 it can also be observed that the performance of the model developed in this study achieves prediction accuracies that are higher than ags models that were developed with small datasets gong et al 2018 mahmod wahab 2017 other cas models with small datasets resulted in predictions that are consistent with ags models el din et al 2004 manu thalla 2017 the small size of test datasets can result in less reliable models that do not provide consistent results which is demonstrated in the results of mahmod and wahab 2017 where the training and testing r2 were 78 and 91 17 respectively mahmod wahab 2017 svr and anns were found to perform at the same level of accuracy in other cas and ags models which is consistent with the models developed in this study gong et al 2018 guo et al 2015 mahmod wahab 2017 seshan et al 2014 4 multi stage model structure ags machine learning models in the literature are all single stage models where a group of inputs is used to predict the final effluent quality parameters without considering the process sequence gong et al 2018 mahmod wahab 2017 two stage models were designed to improve the model structure with success zaghloul et al 2020 the multi stage model structure makes the model developed in this study more versatile than other machine learning models as it considers the effect of influent characteristics on the biomass properties and the consequent effect on the effluent quality the multi stage model structure also provides the ability to identify the source of predicted effluent quality issues where the different biomass properties that were predicted at the same instance can be analyzed this mitigates the disadvantage of the application of black box models that can be difficult to use for process interpretation newhart et al 2019 5 failure prediction the model developed in this study can accurately predict the performance of ags reactors under varying operational and influent conditions the model provides a tool that can be used to forecast the reactor behaviour during operation which will guide the operators on experimental design fig 7 shows the predictions made for a portion of the evaluation dataset chronologically ordered and obtained from the same reactor plotted with failure thresholds operators can utilize such figures to identify sources of process failures and potential causes the local treated effluent standards were set as thresholds for this study maximum effluent cod nh4 n and po4 3 were set to 20 mg l 10 mg l and 0 5 mg l respectively the threshold for the granule size was set to 200 µm below which the biomass would be considered floccular liu et al 2010 which indicates either structural integrity failure of the granule or failure to achieve a state of granulation the mlss threshold was chosen for this study to be 4000 mg l the mlss dropping below the threshold would indicate a washout of the biomass due to poor settling the settling properties can also be predicted by the svi values additionally the svi30 svi5 indicates the percentage or granulation inside the reactor as defined by kocaturk and erguder 2016 the threshold for the svi30 svi5 was set to 50 for this study it can be observed that a failure to remove nh4 n has occurred between samples 218 and 232 where the effluent concentration reached 28 mg l the mlss plot shows a rapid decline in the mlss concentration which entailed a loss of the slow growing nitrifying bacteria thus the delayed effect of poor nh4 n removal while the biomass recovered further analysis of the results shows that there was a drop in the granule size and the granulation ratio inside the reactor indicating that a partial washout has occurred followed by a rapid growth of heterotrophic biomass in floccular form due to the abundance of organics f m ratio was disturbed due to the loss of biomass the influent cod was reduced from around 7000 mg l to 4500 mg l after the biomass washout instance this improved the observed cod removal efficiency as the new heterotrophic growth was able to handle the influent organics the effluent cod concentration was above the allowed threshold as the reactor was being operated to treat high organic content wastewater where the effluent wastewater was to be polished before disposal the aerobic biological process although successful in removing most of the organic load was unable to bring the cod concentrations below the required limits hamza et al 2018 6 conclusion a machine learning model was developed for ags reactors using a combination of neural networks support vector regression and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems feature selection methods were applied and a five stage model structure was adopted this study shows that proper feature selection and combining multiple machine learning algorithms in an ensemble can improve the performance of data driven models when the available dataset is

17372,a novel anammox in the absence of anammox bacteria was confirmed to occur in an anaerobic sludge slurry system in which fe ii fe iii cycle driven by no2 induced fe ii oxidation and subsequent nh4 induced fe iii reduction feammox pushed the nitrogen removal results showed that fe ii contents significantly p 0 05 decreased and fe iii accordingly increased with no2 addition indicating that fe ii was anaerobically oxidized to fe iii with depletion of no2 the fe ii content began to increase which was a result of feammox consequently 96 0 nh4 n of the no2 added reactor was removed during 18 days operation while nh4 n content remained essentially unchanged in the control in which no2 was not added x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis indicated that feooh was produced from chemical fe ii oxidation with no2 during the treatment anammox bacteria was not detected but the relative abundance of geobacter of the no2 added group increased by 13 folds isotope experiment in 15nh4 containing reactors found that much more 30n2 and 29n2 in the 14no2 added group were produced than those in the control without 14no2 confirming that 14no2 induced fe ii oxidation to participate in feammox for 15nh4 removal also no2 could be produced from partial denitrification of no3 meaning that no3 as a more common species might substitute no2 to trigger this new anammox process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feammox iron cycle nitrogen removal 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a biological process confirmed in 1990s to oxidize nh4 with no2 as terminal electron acceptor nh4 no2 n2 2h2o has been applied in the full scale ammonium wastewater treatment lackner et al 2014 strous et al 2006 autotrophic anammox bacteria is indispensable in this process which however is a type of slow growing microorganism with a doubling time of 11 days and is sensitive to environmental conditions such as ph salinity and organic carbon miao et al 2018 the characteristics of anammox bacteria have restrained the process in more application iron fe minerals play an important role in the attenuation of contaminants in natural environments mejia et al 2016 fe occurs in two main redox states in the environment oxidized ferric fe fe iii which is poorly soluble at circumneutral ph and reduced ferrous fe fe ii which is easily soluble and therefore more bioavailable fe speciation and bioavailability are dynamically controlled by the prevalent changing redox conditions bird et al 2011 the cycle of fe is always intertwined with the cycle of many elements microbially and abiotically including c n o and s in nature feammox i e nh4 induced fe iii reduction or fe iii reduction coupled to anaerobic ammonium oxidation eqs 1 3 yang et al 2012 yang et al 2018a has been found to occur and cause ammonium removal in anaerobic systems such as riparian zone ding et al 2017 marine rios del toro et al 2018 wetland clement et al 2005 li et al 2015 tropical forest huang et al 2016 and paddy soil zhou et al 2016 according to eqs 1 3 feammox could be promoted under weak acid conditions zhou et al 2016 iron reducing bacteria irb that is a typical group of dissimilatory fe iii reduction microorganisms capable of utilizing various electron donors to extracellularly reduce fe iii hydr oxides was found to be indispensable in feammox bao and li 2017 nevin and lovley 2000 yang et al 2012 it was recently reported that adding fe iii oxides in anaerobic digester could cause significant nh4 loss due to feammox yang et al 2018a yang et al 2018b however from economic and environmental considerations it is impractical to add large amount of fe iii into anaerobic systems for nh4 removal no2 has reported to be capable of inducing fe ii oxidization anaerobically and abiotically termed as chemodenitrification eq 4 which plays an important role in the generation of fe iii and mixed valence minerals in subsurface environments particularly in systems low in other oxidants such as manganese jamieson et al 2018 melton et al 2014 however as far as we know chemodenitrification has not been investigated to combine feammox for nh4 removal we assume that if fe iii regenerated from chemodenitrification could participate in next round of feammox it is expected to achieve successive nh4 removal in anaerobic systems also this nh4 loss pathway chemodenitrification followed by feammox is just equivalent to a novel anammox like process with condition of fe ii fe iii cycle but with no need of anammox bacteria instead irb might be a key microbial player to affect the nh4 removal of this process compared with anammox microorganisms irb has the stronger survival ability and it widely exists in the natural environment mejia et al 2016 no2 production from partial nitrification nh4 no2 seems to be fragile due to the lack of efficient strategy to suppress the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and maintain stable partial nitrification while partial denitrification no3 no2 i e denitratation has been considered as an effective pathway for generating no2 ma et al 2017 however no3 could also oxidize fe ii to fe iii directly namely no3 dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo eq 5 jamieson et al 2018 li et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 this means that two fe ii oxidation pathways i e chemodenitrification and ndfo coexist theoretically in the no3 added system containing organic matter and fe ii the purpose of the study in the fe ii fe iii cycle system was to investigate 1 the effects of no2 on nh4 removal and to explore the mechanism 2 which pathway ndfo or chemodenitrification contributed the dominating fe ii oxidation after no3 addition in iron rich sludge slurry 3 changes of the nitrogen species after nox addition and microorganisms involved in these processes besides the properties of different fe iii vary greatly in the degradation and preservation of c n and the fate of many nutrients and contaminants bird et al 2011 thus it was important to investigate which fe iii was produced after nox addition 1 3 f e o h 3 5 h n h 4 3 f e 2 9 h 2 o 0 5 n 2 2 6 f e o h 3 10 h n h 4 6 f e 2 16 h 2 o

materials sludge slurry collected from the effluent of an anaerobic digester sludge retention time of 20 days dalian china was used as inoculant sludge in this study energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis of the original slurry demonstrated the existence of iron in this sludge sample fig s1 the iron was mainly from sludge dewatering process using iron salts as coagulants prior to the experiments the inoculant sludge was diluted with a medium v v 1 3 containing mgcl2 6h2o 0 4 g l cacl2 h2o 0 1 g l nh4cl 0 027 g l kh2po4 0 6 g l 1 ml l of a vitamin solution 1 ml l of a trace element solution and 30 mm bicarbonate buffer mejia et al 2016 fe ii and fe iii content were 608 2 23 5 mg l and 69 2 9 8 mg l in the mixture respectively 2 2 experimental setup to investigate nitrogen removal after no2 and no3 addition three batch experiments were conducted in 250 ml serum bottles containing 200 ml diluted sludge slurry including no2 added group no3 added group and a control group without adding nox specifically 0 5 ml nano3 0 8 m and nano2 stock solution 1 3 m were added on day 1 7 and 14 i e the final no3 and no2 concentration of each addition were 2 mm and 3 3 mm respectively theoretically they could oxidize the same amounts of reductive substances such as fe ii eqs 4 and 5 as comparison a control experiment without nox was carried out with adding same volume of above mentioned medium in parallel before the experiment the oxygen of the headspace and sludge in the bottles was removed via aerating using n2 for 30 min to further distinguish ndfo and chemodenitrification two another batch experiments were operated in 100 ml serum bottles containing 100 ml diluted sludge slurry one group was autoclaved at 120 c for 20 min labeled as the autoclaved group and the another group was not autoclaved named by the microbial group in each batch experiment three parallel groups including the control no3 added group no2 added group were set in which 0 1 ml mentioned medium 0 1 ml nano3 0 8 m and 0 1 ml nano2 1 3 m stock solution were added initially respectively the all bottles were placed in a shaker 120 rpm in the dark at 30 c all experiments were repeated in triplicate and were operated in an anaerobic glove box besides to investigate fe iii species produced after no3 and no2 addition feso4 solution was mixed with nano3 and nano2 solution respectively in anaerobic gloves and the ph was adjusted to about 6 after the mixture was fully mixed it stood still for one day and the precipitation was washed by anaerobic pure water for three times after the precipitation was freeze dried its composition was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 3 analysis methods no2 n no3 n nh4 n total nitrogen fe ii fe iii xrd and xps were analyzed according to previous reports ding et al 2014 yang et al 2018a yang et al 2019 yang et al 2018b liquid samples were taken in the anoxic glovebox and filtered through 0 22 μm filters microbial analysis after experiment was conducted via high throughput 16s rdna pyrosequencing according to our previous report yang et al 2018a and rna based real time quantitative pcr analysis qpcr was further applied to test for the presence of active anammox bacteria huang et al 2018 huang and jaffé 2015 total bacteria were represented via quantification of the 16s rrna genes using primer set 1055f 1392r anammox bacteria were detected using primer set amx368f amx820r huang et al 2018 specific primer information is shown in table s1 2 4 statistical analyses the one way analysis of variance anova was performed for statistical analyses using origin 9 0 statistical significance was denoted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 fe ii oxidation and nh4 removal with adding no2 to investigate the effects of intermittent no2 addition on the changes of fe ii and nh4 0 5 ml nano2 solution 1 3 m was added on day 1 7 and 14 i e the final cumulative no2 concentration of each addition was 3 3 mm from fig 1 a fe ii content of the control without no2 addition remained unchanged generally during operation slightly ranging in 603 0 10 9 mg l comparatively the no2 addition caused fe ii content to significantly p 0 05 decrease in the no2 added group for example after 1 day of adding no2 fe ii dropped from 608 2 mg l initially to 17 6 mg l accompanied with the decrease of fe ii fe iii of the no2 added group increased from 69 2 mg l to 668 8 mg l fig s2 with the decrease of fe ii no2 was consumed fig 1b e g 46 7 mg l no2 n 3 3 mm added on day 1 decreased to 10 5 mg l on day 2 the results indicated that no2 induced fe ii oxidization to produce fe iii with the depletion of no2 of each addition the generated fe iii began to decrease and the fe ii content accordingly increased for example when no2 n lowered to 0 8 mg l on day 10 the fe ii content rose and reached to 346 6 mg l and fe iii decreased to 330 8 mg l figs 1a and s2 the increase of fe ii and decease of fe iii was due to dissimilatory fe iii reduction coupled with anaerobically oxidizing ammonium feammox which resulted in nh4 removal fig 1c the fluctuation of fe ii fe iii with each addition of no2 due to the fe ii oxidation and feammox forwarded consecutive removal of nh4 consequently nh4 n content decreased from about 32 2 mg l initially to 1 3 mg l on day 18 in the no2 added group namely 96 0 of nh4 was removed comparatively nh4 n content remained essentially unchanged in the control without no2 fe ii oxidation was critical for the consecutive oxidation of nh4 via feammox with fe iii as electron acceptor to clarify the roles of chemodenitrification and biodenitrification in denitrification through fe ii reduction two batch experiments including autoclaved group and microbial group were performed after adding 0 1 ml nano2 4 3 m solution the fe ii content accordingly decreased in the microbial group fig 2 a for example fe ii content decreased from 729 8 mg l initially to 481 mg l after 1 5 h of no2 addition in the autoclaved group the fe ii oxidation still occurred after adding no2 fig 2b e g fe ii decreased from 615 8 mg l to 382 mg l after 1 5 h of no2 addition interestingly fe ii oxidation rates during the initial 1 5 h of no2 addition were similar in the microbial group and autoclaved group 165 9 mg l h vs 155 9 mg l h this indicated that chemodenitrification was the main reason for fe ii oxidation with no2 noteworthily fe ii content in the autoclaved group did not increase after 24 h fig 2b unlike the microbial group fig 2a since inactivation of dissimilatory fe iii reduction caused the standstill of feammox it was previously reported that the feammox efficiency was significantly correlated with the bacterial abundances of irb li et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 it implies that irb is likely to be directly involved in ammonium oxidation i e irb accepts electrons from ammonium and then transfers the electrons to fe iii as shown in fig 3 geobacter a typical irb was enriched in the no2 added group the relative abundance of geobacter was 0 7 in the no2 added group which was about 13 folds higher than that in the control 0 05 anammox was a possible way to remove nh4 with no2 under anaerobic systems but anammox bacteria including six genera candidatus scalindua ca brocadia ca anammoximicrobium ca jettenia ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobus huang et al 2016 kartal et al 2012 oshiki et al 2013 were not detected in control and no2 added group through high throughput 16s rdna pyrosequencing the qpcr in control and no2 added group also demonstrated that the copies of anammox bacteria on day 18 were absent further indicating that anammox could be ruled out in this study therefore the nh4 removal fig 1c was the result of feammox due to fe iii generation after adding no2 noteworthily it was obvious that the abundances of pseudomonas and macellibacteroides were increased significantly after 18 days of incubation in no2 added reactors compared with the control specifically the abundances of pseudomonas and macellibacteroides were 0 2 and 7 0 and they rose to 26 5 and 11 2 respectively fig 3 roosa et al 2014 found that the level of pseudomonas was positively and significantly correlated with the concentration of bioavailable metals and the continuous fluctuation of fe ii and fe iii i e fe ii fe iii cycle could increase the actual amount of bioavailable fe resulting in promoting the growth of pseudomonas pseudomonas bacteria are ubiquitous and known to harbor metal resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps and intracellular redox enzymes roosa et al 2014 however it s unknown whether pseudomonas could be involved in the fe conversions macellibacteroides was reported to be responsible for organic matter biodegradation pang et al 2020 the sludge slurry used in this study was the digestate after anaerobic digestion of municipal residual sludge for 20 days and most of the easily degradable organic matters e g volatile fatty acids vfas have been consumed and the residual organic matters were difficult to be utilized kroiss et al 2006 top et al 2019 nox with high redox potential could accelerate the decomposition of complex organic matter through denitrification and produce vfas for the growth of macellibacteroides wang et al 2016 3 2 characterization of feooh generation to investigate the fe ii oxidation and the subsequent fe iii reduction xrd analysis of the sludge samples taken from serum bottles at different times was conducted fig 4 from xrd patterns of the no2 added group fig 4 bottom some new characteristic peaks at 27 32 were observed after one day of no2 addition compared with the initial sludge and then the characteristic peaks were no longer obvious after 5 days while the xrd patterns of the sludge in the control in different periods basically remained the same fig 4 top very likely the newly generated characteristic peaks at 27 8 and 30 4 with the no2 addition were ascribed to the 301 and 220 planes corresponding to the standard card of iron oxide hydroxide feooh jcpds card no 22 0353 the changes of xrd patterns indicated the formation and consumption of feooh with no2 and nh4 removal respectively fig 1 the generation of feooh was in agreement with previous reports that feooh was the product of chemodenitrification 4fe ii 2no2 5h2o 4feooh n2o 6h jamieson et al 2018 thus the generated feo oh might participate in feammox 6feooh nh4 10h 6fe2 no2 10h2o for nh4 removal fig 1c melton et al 2014 a chemical reaction between feso4 and nano2 also confirmed the generation of feooh under anaerobic condition through xps analysis see fig s3 3 3 isotope experiment to further verify the ammonium removal with adding no2 in iron rich system 0 2 ml 14no2 1 3 mm was added every week into 250 ml serum bottle containing 200 ml sludge slurry ss 9 5 0 6 g l vss 5 3 0 2 g l fe ii 124 4 5 6 mg l with 300 mg l 15nh4 n the experimental conditions of the control group were the same as above except for the substitution of water for no2 the sludge used here was taken from a reactor that supplementing no2 for three months during 14 days the 30n2 production rate in the 14no2 added group was 1 3 10 2 ml g sludge d which was about 12 folds higher than that in the control without 14no2 1 1 10 3 ml g sludge d fig 5 a the 30n2 could be directly produced from feammox 15nh4 15nh4 and indirectly from feammox generated 15no2 15no3 followed by anammox feammox generated 15no2 added 15nh4 and denitrification feammox generated 15nox feammox generated 15nox table 1 ding et al 2014 yang et al 2012 among which feammox was indispensable therefore the detected 30n2 indicated the occurrence of feammox the higher 30n2 production with 14no2 addition demonstrated that removal of 15nh4 n was enhanced during feammox in the presence of 14no2 it was because the 14no2 oxidized fe ii produced from feammox to fe iii that participated in the next round feammox for 15nh4 removal the results further confirmed that fe ii oxidation with no2 drove feammox to successively occur for nh4 removal comparatively 29n2 production was significantly higher fig 5b the 29n2 production rate in the no2 added group was 1 7 ml g sludge d which was about 106 folds higher than that in the control without 14no2 theoretically 29n2 could be directly produced from feammox indigenous 14nh4 added 15nh4 and indirectly from feammox generated 15no2 15no3 followed by anammox feammox generated 15no2 indigenous 14nh4 and denitrification feammox generated 15nox added 14no2 table 1 besides 29n2 could be also produced from anammox reaction between added 15nh4 and added 14no2 table 1 however qpcr analysis in the presence and absence of 14no2 showed no anammox bacteria therefore the 29n2 generation demonstrated the occurrence of feammox and the higher 29n2 production with 14no2 also indicated that 14no2 addition increased fe iii production to participate in feammox 3 4 distinguish fe ii oxidation with no2 and no3 no3 is a more common species than no2 in natural and artificial water systems perakis and hedin 2002 partial denitrification of no3 no3 no2 is likely an effective way to generate no2 ma et al 2017 moreover no3 was reportedly capable of directly oxidizing fe ii to fe iii through ndfo this means that two fe ii oxidation pathways i e chemodenitrification and ndfo likely co exist in the no3 added system actually compared with the rapid generation of feooh via chemodenitrification of no2 no3 was difficult to directly oxidize fe ii see figs s4 and s5 jamieson et al 2018 melton et al 2014 it was due to the weaker oxidability of no3 at low concentrations since low concentration no3 was entirely ionized to have a spatially symmetric disposition of no bond while no2 might be ionized to hono that was a dissymmetric structure to present stronger oxidability nevertheless no3 was easily reduced to no2 by nitrate reducing bacteria using organic matter as electron donor ma et al 2017 and then the generated no2 oxidized fe ii to fe iii through chemodenitrification according to the mentioned above results jamieson et al 2018 to prove this conjecture the experiments above were repeated with no3 0 8 m to replace no2 1 3 m noteworthily the stoichiometric amount of fe ii oxidation by 1 3 m of no2 and 0 8 m of no3 was the same after no3 addition fe ii content significantly p 0 05 decreased fig 6 a along with significant decrease of no3 fig 6b for example fe ii decreased from 608 2 mg l initially to 491 5 mg l on day 2 in the no3 added group indicating the occurrence of fe ii oxidation noteworthily no2 was detected with decrease of no3 in the no3 added group fig 6c e g no2 n increased from 0 to 13 2 mg l after one day of no3 addition from day 7 to 8 the generated no2 abiotically oxidized fe ii via chemodenitrification eq 5 to produce fe iii that was then involved in feammox which resulted in the increase of fe ii fig 6a and nh4 n removal in the no3 added group fig 6d for example nh4 n content decreased from 32 2 mg l initially to 15 8 mg l on day 18 in the no3 added reactor although the extents of fe ii oxidation and nh4 removal with addition of no2 and no3 should be the same theoretically eqs 4 and 5 the fe ii oxidation and nh4 removal of no2 added group were much higher than those of no3 added group fig 1 vs fig 6 it was because that the added no3 must be converted into no2 firstly via nitrate reduction then the produced no2 began to oxidize fe ii while added no2 would react with both organic matters denitrification and fe ii simultaneously therefore when the same electron equivalent of no3 and no2 were added to the sludge system the amount of fe ii oxidized by the former would be less than that by the latter furthermore the results also showed that the rapid fe ii oxidation with no3 was related to the no2 produced since direct fe ii oxidation with no3 was unobvious figs s4 and s5 while fe ii oxidation with no2 i e chemodenitrification was fast figs 2 and s3 microbial analysis showed that the abundance of geobacter of no3 added groups was 7 folds 0 4 higher than that of control groups with no no3 addition 0 05 and no anammox species were detected fig s6 so far only three species of no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer at genus level have been found including acidovorax thermomonas and aquabacterium bao and li 2017 straub et al 2004 and they were undetected in both groups meaning that fe ii oxidization in this study was contributed by no2 in the no3 added group also just like xrd patterns of the no2 added group fig 4 feooh was also generated in the no3 added groups fig s7 remarkably it has been reported that fe oh 3 and feooh were the products of biotic ndfo and abiotic chemodenitrification respectively 10fe ii 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h 4fe ii 2no2 5h2o 4feooh n2o 6h jamieson et al 2018 melton et al 2014 it is reasonably concluded that in the no3 added group fe ii oxidation was performed by no2 produced from the reduction of no3 which caused fe iii generation to participate in next round feammox for nh4 removal 3 5 implication in this study no2 was added to trigger fe ii oxidation then the produced fe iii participated in feammox in this fe driven anammox process fe ii fe iii cycle was completed via combination of feammox and chemodenitrification to achieve nh4 oxidation and no2 reduction some or all iron reducing bacteria e g geobacter as the functional microbial in this process ubiquitously exists in natural and artificial anaerobic anoxic systems mejia et al 2016 it implied that this fe driven anammox process has played and is playing an important role in nitrogen loss of these systems which however is long ignored taking anammox as an example fe ii is regarded as an essential element for the growth of anammox bacteria and a certain amount fe ii e g 0 02 0 08 mm was reported to improve the performance of anammox while the activity of anammox bacteria could be suppressed under higher fe ii concentrations 0 08 mm bi et al 2014 liu and ni 2015 qiao et al 2013 according to this study no2 induced fe ii oxidation and generated fe iii could participate in feammox to cause nitrogen removal in agreement it has been reported that the fe ii fe iii cycle also occurred in iron containing anammox system adding no2 in which the fe ii fe iii cycle likely caused nh4 removal shu et al 2016 in this study no2 could be produced through partial denitrification of no3 which provided continuous electron acceptor for fe ii oxidation certainly the nitrogen removal efficiency of this study was not high fig 1c which was related to the low efficiency of autotrophic feammox ding et al 2017 li et al 2015 feammox induced by iron reducing bacteria depended upon extracellular electron transfer it has been reported that the feammox efficiency can be improved by supplementing electron shutters e g aqds zhou et al 2016 which will be investigated in our next work 4 conclusions in this study the fluctuation of fe ii fe iii with intermittent no2 addition due to the fe ii oxidation and feammox was discovered for the first time in consecutive removal of nh4 consequently nh4 n content decreased from about 32 2 mg l initially to 1 3 mg l on day 18 in the no2 added reactor although the nh4 removal rate was not high a novel nh4 oxidation process with no2 as terminal electron acceptor but with fe ii fe iii cycle as propellant was totally different with common anammox process that depended on anammox bacteria through xrd and xps analysis figs 4 and s3 feooh was produced after no2 addition the qpcr result showed that anammox bacteria was undetected meaning nitrogen removal from anammox could be excluded in this study actually the added no2 served as the terminal electron acceptor to oxidize ammonium with fe ii fe iii as the electron shuttle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of

17372,a novel anammox in the absence of anammox bacteria was confirmed to occur in an anaerobic sludge slurry system in which fe ii fe iii cycle driven by no2 induced fe ii oxidation and subsequent nh4 induced fe iii reduction feammox pushed the nitrogen removal results showed that fe ii contents significantly p 0 05 decreased and fe iii accordingly increased with no2 addition indicating that fe ii was anaerobically oxidized to fe iii with depletion of no2 the fe ii content began to increase which was a result of feammox consequently 96 0 nh4 n of the no2 added reactor was removed during 18 days operation while nh4 n content remained essentially unchanged in the control in which no2 was not added x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis indicated that feooh was produced from chemical fe ii oxidation with no2 during the treatment anammox bacteria was not detected but the relative abundance of geobacter of the no2 added group increased by 13 folds isotope experiment in 15nh4 containing reactors found that much more 30n2 and 29n2 in the 14no2 added group were produced than those in the control without 14no2 confirming that 14no2 induced fe ii oxidation to participate in feammox for 15nh4 removal also no2 could be produced from partial denitrification of no3 meaning that no3 as a more common species might substitute no2 to trigger this new anammox process graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords feammox iron cycle nitrogen removal 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox a biological process confirmed in 1990s to oxidize

yang et al 2012 yang et al 2018a has been found to occur and cause ammonium removal in anaerobic systems such as riparian zone ding et al 2017 marine rios del toro et al 2018 wetland clement et al

that is a typical group of dissimilatory fe iii reduction microorganisms capable of utilizing various electron donors to extracellularly reduce fe iii hydr oxides was found to be indispensable in feammox bao and li 2017 nevin and lovley 2000 yang et al 2012 it was recently reported that adding fe iii oxides in anaerobic digester could cause significant nh4 loss due to feammox yang et al 2018a yang et al 2018b however from economic and environmental considerations it is impractical to add large amount of fe iii into anaerobic systems for nh4 removal no2 has reported to be capable of inducing fe ii oxidization anaerobically and abiotically termed as chemodenitrification eq 4 which plays an important role in the generation of fe iii and mixed valence minerals in subsurface environments particularly in systems low in other oxidants such as manganese jamieson et al 2018 melton et al 2014 however as far as we know chemodenitrification has not been investigated to combine feammox for nh4 removal we assume that if fe iii regenerated from chemodenitrification could participate in next round of feammox it is expected to achieve successive nh4 removal in anaerobic systems also this nh4 loss pathway chemodenitrification followed by feammox is just equivalent to a novel anammox like process with condition of fe ii fe iii cycle but with no need of anammox bacteria instead irb might be a key microbial player to affect the nh4 removal of this process compared with anammox microorganisms irb has the stronger survival ability and it widely exists in the natural environment mejia et al 2016 no2 production from partial nitrification nh4 no2 seems to be fragile due to the lack of efficient strategy to suppress the growth of nitrite oxidizing bacteria and maintain stable partial nitrification while partial denitrification no3 no2 i e denitratation has been considered as an effective pathway for generating no2 ma et al 2017 however no3 could also oxidize fe ii to fe iii directly namely no3 dependent fe ii oxidation ndfo eq 5 jamieson et al 2018 li et al 2016 zhao et al 2013 this means that two fe ii oxidation pathways i e chemodenitrification and ndfo coexist theoretically in the no3 added system containing organic matter and fe ii the purpose of the study in the fe ii fe iii cycle system was to investigate 1 the effects of no2 on nh4 removal and to explore the mechanism 2 which pathway ndfo or chemodenitrification contributed the dominating fe ii oxidation after no3 addition in iron rich sludge slurry 3 changes of the nitrogen species after nox addition and microorganisms involved in these processes besides the properties of different fe iii vary greatly in the degradation and preservation of c n and the fate of many nutrients and contaminants bird et al 2011 thus it was important to investigate which fe iii was produced after nox addition 1 3 f e o h 3 5 h n h 4 3 f e 2 9 h 2 o 0 5 n 2 2 6 f e o h 3 10 h n h 4 6 f e 2 16 h 2 o

materials sludge slurry collected from the effluent of an anaerobic digester sludge retention time of 20 days dalian china was used as inoculant sludge in this study energy dispersive spectrometer eds analysis of the original slurry demonstrated the existence of iron in this sludge sample fig s1 the iron was mainly from sludge dewatering process using iron salts as coagulants prior to the experiments the inoculant sludge was diluted with a medium v v 1 3 containing mgcl2 6h2o 0 4 g l cacl2 h2o 0 1 g l nh4cl 0 027 g l kh2po4 0 6 g l 1 ml l of a vitamin solution 1 ml l of a trace element solution and 30 mm bicarbonate buffer mejia et al 2016 fe ii and fe iii content were 608 2 23 5 mg l and 69 2 9 8 mg l in the mixture respectively 2 2 experimental setup to investigate nitrogen removal after no2 and no3 addition three batch experiments were conducted in 250 ml serum bottles containing 200 ml diluted sludge slurry including no2 added group no3 added group and a control group without adding nox specifically 0 5 ml nano3 0 8 m and nano2 stock solution 1 3 m were added on day 1 7 and 14 i e the final no3 and no2 concentration of each addition were 2 mm and 3 3 mm respectively theoretically they could oxidize the same amounts of reductive substances such as fe ii eqs 4 and 5 as comparison a control experiment without nox was carried out with adding same volume of above mentioned medium in parallel before the experiment the oxygen of the headspace and sludge in the bottles was removed via aerating using n2 for 30 min to further distinguish ndfo and chemodenitrification two another batch experiments were operated in 100 ml serum bottles containing 100 ml diluted sludge slurry one group was autoclaved at 120 c for 20 min labeled as the autoclaved group and the another group was not autoclaved named by the microbial group in each batch experiment three parallel groups including the control no3 added group no2 added group were set in which 0 1 ml mentioned medium 0 1 ml nano3 0 8 m and 0 1 ml nano2 1 3 m stock solution were added initially respectively the all bottles were placed in a shaker 120 rpm in the dark at 30 c all experiments were repeated in triplicate and were operated in an anaerobic glove box besides to investigate fe iii species produced after no3 and no2 addition feso4 solution was mixed with nano3 and nano2 solution respectively in anaerobic gloves and the ph was adjusted to about 6 after the mixture was fully mixed it stood still for one day and the precipitation was washed by anaerobic pure water for three times after the precipitation was freeze dried its composition was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps 2 3 analysis methods no2 n no3 n nh4 n total nitrogen fe ii fe iii xrd and xps were analyzed according to previous reports ding et al 2014 yang et al 2018a yang et al 2019 yang et al 2018b liquid samples were taken in the anoxic glovebox and filtered through 0 22 μm filters microbial analysis after experiment was conducted via high throughput 16s rdna pyrosequencing according to our previous report yang et al 2018a and rna based real time quantitative pcr analysis qpcr was further applied to test for the presence of active anammox bacteria huang et al 2018 huang and jaffé 2015 total bacteria were represented via quantification of the 16s rrna genes using primer set 1055f 1392r anammox bacteria were detected using primer set amx368f amx820r huang et al 2018 specific primer information is shown in table s1 2 4 statistical analyses the one way analysis of variance anova was performed for statistical analyses using origin 9 0 statistical significance was denoted at p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 fe ii oxidation and nh4 removal with adding no2 to investigate the effects of intermittent no2 addition on the changes of fe ii and nh4 0 5 ml nano2 solution 1 3 m was added on day 1 7 and 14 i e the final cumulative no2 concentration of each addition was 3 3 mm from fig 1 a fe ii content of the control without no2 addition remained unchanged generally during operation slightly ranging in 603 0 10 9 mg l comparatively the no2 addition caused fe ii content to significantly p 0 05 decrease in the no2 added group for example after 1 day of adding no2 fe ii dropped from 608 2 mg l initially to 17 6 mg l accompanied with the decrease of fe ii fe iii of the no2 added group increased from 69 2 mg l to 668 8 mg l fig s2 with the decrease of fe ii no2 was consumed fig 1b e g 46 7 mg l no2 n 3 3 mm added on day 1 decreased to 10 5 mg l on day 2 the results indicated that no2 induced fe ii oxidization to produce fe iii with the depletion of no2 of each addition the generated fe iii began to decrease and the fe ii content accordingly increased for example when no2 n lowered to 0 8 mg l on day 10 the fe ii content rose and reached to 346 6 mg l and fe iii decreased to 330 8 mg l figs 1a and s2 the increase of fe ii and decease of fe iii was due to dissimilatory fe iii reduction coupled with anaerobically oxidizing ammonium feammox which resulted in nh4 removal fig 1c the fluctuation of fe ii fe iii with each addition of no2 due to the fe ii oxidation and feammox forwarded consecutive removal of nh4 consequently nh4 n content decreased from about 32 2 mg l initially to 1 3 mg l on day 18 in the no2 added group namely 96 0 of nh4 was removed comparatively nh4 n content remained essentially unchanged in the control without no2 fe ii oxidation was critical for the consecutive oxidation of nh4 via feammox with fe iii as electron acceptor to clarify the roles of chemodenitrification and biodenitrification in denitrification through fe ii reduction two batch experiments including autoclaved group and microbial group were performed after adding 0 1 ml nano2 4 3 m solution the fe ii content accordingly decreased in the microbial group fig 2 a for example fe ii content decreased from 729 8 mg l initially to 481 mg l after 1 5 h of no2 addition in the autoclaved group the fe ii oxidation still occurred after adding no2 fig 2b e g fe ii decreased from 615 8 mg l to 382 mg l after 1 5 h of no2 addition interestingly fe ii oxidation rates during the initial 1 5 h of no2 addition were similar in the microbial group and autoclaved group 165 9 mg l h vs 155 9 mg l h this indicated that chemodenitrification was the main reason for fe ii oxidation with no2 noteworthily fe ii content in the autoclaved group did not increase after 24 h fig 2b unlike the microbial group fig 2a since inactivation of dissimilatory fe iii reduction caused the standstill of feammox it was previously reported that the feammox efficiency was significantly correlated with the bacterial abundances of irb li et al 2015 zhou et al 2016 it implies that irb is likely to be directly involved in ammonium oxidation i e irb accepts electrons from ammonium and then transfers the electrons to fe iii as shown in fig 3 geobacter a typical irb was enriched in the no2 added group the relative abundance of geobacter was 0 7 in the no2 added group which was about 13 folds higher than that in the control 0 05 anammox was a possible way to remove nh4 with no2 under anaerobic systems but anammox bacteria including six genera candidatus scalindua ca brocadia ca anammoximicrobium ca jettenia ca kuenenia and ca anammoxoglobus huang et al 2016 kartal et al 2012 oshiki et al 2013 were not detected in control and no2 added group through high throughput 16s rdna pyrosequencing the qpcr in control and no2 added group also demonstrated that the copies of anammox bacteria on day 18 were absent further indicating that anammox could be ruled out in this study therefore the nh4 removal fig 1c was the result of feammox due to fe iii generation after adding no2 noteworthily it was obvious that the abundances of pseudomonas and macellibacteroides were increased significantly after 18 days of incubation in no2 added reactors compared with the control specifically the abundances of pseudomonas and macellibacteroides were 0 2 and 7 0 and they rose to 26 5 and 11 2 respectively fig 3 roosa et al 2014 found that the level of pseudomonas was positively and significantly correlated with the concentration of bioavailable metals and the continuous fluctuation of fe ii and fe iii i e fe ii fe iii cycle could increase the actual amount of bioavailable fe resulting in promoting the growth of pseudomonas pseudomonas bacteria are ubiquitous and known to harbor metal resistance mechanisms such as efflux pumps and intracellular redox enzymes roosa et al 2014 however it s unknown whether pseudomonas could be involved in the fe conversions macellibacteroides was reported to be responsible for organic matter biodegradation pang et al 2020 the sludge slurry used in this study was the digestate after anaerobic digestion of municipal residual sludge for 20 days and most of the easily degradable organic matters e g volatile fatty acids vfas have been consumed and the residual organic matters were difficult to be utilized kroiss et al 2006 top et al 2019 nox with high redox potential could accelerate the decomposition of complex organic matter through denitrification and produce vfas for the growth of macellibacteroides wang et al 2016 3 2 characterization of feooh generation to investigate the fe ii oxidation and the subsequent fe iii reduction xrd analysis of the sludge samples taken from serum bottles at different times was conducted fig 4 from xrd patterns of the no2 added group fig 4 bottom some new characteristic peaks at 27 32 were observed after one day of no2 addition compared with the initial sludge and then the characteristic peaks were no longer obvious after 5 days while the xrd patterns of the sludge in the control in different periods basically remained the same fig 4 top very likely the newly generated characteristic peaks at 27 8 and 30 4 with the no2 addition were ascribed to the 301 and 220 planes corresponding to the standard card of iron oxide hydroxide feooh jcpds card no 22 0353 the changes of xrd patterns indicated the formation and consumption of feooh with no2 and nh4 removal respectively fig 1 the generation of feooh was in agreement with previous reports that feooh was the product of chemodenitrification 4fe ii 2no2 5h2o 4feooh n2o 6h jamieson et al 2018 thus the generated feo oh might participate in feammox 6feooh nh4 10h 6fe2 no2 10h2o for nh4 removal fig 1c melton et al 2014 a chemical reaction between feso4 and nano2 also confirmed the generation of feooh under anaerobic condition through xps analysis see fig s3 3 3 isotope experiment to further verify the ammonium removal with adding no2 in iron rich system 0 2 ml 14no2 1 3 mm was added every week into 250 ml serum bottle containing 200 ml sludge slurry ss 9 5 0 6 g l vss 5 3 0 2 g l fe ii 124 4 5 6 mg l with 300 mg l 15nh4 n the experimental conditions of the control group were the same as above except for the substitution of water for no2 the sludge used here was taken from a reactor that supplementing no2 for three months during 14 days the 30n2 production rate in the 14no2 added group was 1 3 10 2 ml g sludge d which was about 12 folds higher than that in the control without 14no2 1 1 10 3 ml g sludge d fig 5 a the 30n2 could be directly produced from feammox 15nh4 15nh4 and indirectly from feammox generated 15no2 15no3 followed by anammox feammox generated 15no2 added 15nh4 and denitrification feammox generated 15nox feammox generated 15nox table 1 ding et al 2014 yang et al 2012 among which feammox was indispensable therefore the detected 30n2 indicated the occurrence of feammox the higher 30n2 production with 14no2 addition demonstrated that removal of 15nh4 n was enhanced during feammox in the presence of 14no2 it was because the 14no2 oxidized fe ii produced from feammox to fe iii that participated in the next round feammox for 15nh4 removal the results further confirmed that fe ii oxidation with no2 drove feammox to successively occur for nh4 removal comparatively 29n2 production was significantly higher fig 5b the 29n2 production rate in the no2 added group was 1 7 ml g sludge d which was about 106 folds higher than that in the control without 14no2 theoretically 29n2 could be directly produced from feammox indigenous 14nh4 added 15nh4 and indirectly from feammox generated 15no2 15no3 followed by anammox feammox generated 15no2 indigenous 14nh4 and denitrification feammox generated 15nox added 14no2 table 1 besides 29n2 could be also produced from anammox reaction between added 15nh4 and added 14no2 table 1 however qpcr analysis in the presence and absence of 14no2 showed no anammox bacteria therefore the 29n2 generation demonstrated the occurrence of feammox and the higher 29n2 production with 14no2 also indicated that 14no2 addition increased fe iii production to participate in feammox 3 4 distinguish fe ii oxidation with no2 and no3 no3 is a more common species than no2 in natural and artificial water systems perakis and hedin 2002 partial denitrification of no3 no3 no2 is likely an effective way to generate no2 ma et al 2017 moreover no3 was reportedly capable of directly oxidizing fe ii to fe iii through ndfo this means that two fe ii oxidation pathways i e chemodenitrification and ndfo likely co exist in the no3 added system actually compared with the rapid generation of feooh via chemodenitrification of no2 no3 was difficult to directly oxidize fe ii see figs s4 and s5 jamieson et al 2018 melton et al 2014 it was due to the weaker oxidability of no3 at low concentrations since low concentration no3 was entirely ionized to have a spatially symmetric disposition of no bond while no2 might be ionized to hono that was a dissymmetric structure to present stronger oxidability nevertheless no3 was easily reduced to no2 by nitrate reducing bacteria using organic matter as electron donor ma et al 2017 and then the generated no2 oxidized fe ii to fe iii through chemodenitrification according to the mentioned above results jamieson et al 2018 to prove this conjecture the experiments above were repeated with no3 0 8 m to replace no2 1 3 m noteworthily the stoichiometric amount of fe ii oxidation by 1 3 m of no2 and 0 8 m of no3 was the same after no3 addition fe ii content significantly p 0 05 decreased fig 6 a along with significant decrease of no3 fig 6b for example fe ii decreased from 608 2 mg l initially to 491 5 mg l on day 2 in the no3 added group indicating the occurrence of fe ii oxidation noteworthily no2 was detected with decrease of no3 in the no3 added group fig 6c e g no2 n increased from 0 to 13 2 mg l after one day of no3 addition from day 7 to 8 the generated no2 abiotically oxidized fe ii via chemodenitrification eq 5 to produce fe iii that was then involved in feammox which resulted in the increase of fe ii fig 6a and nh4 n removal in the no3 added group fig 6d for example nh4 n content decreased from 32 2 mg l initially to 15 8 mg l on day 18 in the no3 added reactor although the extents of fe ii oxidation and nh4 removal with addition of no2 and no3 should be the same theoretically eqs 4 and 5 the fe ii oxidation and nh4 removal of no2 added group were much higher than those of no3 added group fig 1 vs fig 6 it was because that the added no3 must be converted into no2 firstly via nitrate reduction then the produced no2 began to oxidize fe ii while added no2 would react with both organic matters denitrification and fe ii simultaneously therefore when the same electron equivalent of no3 and no2 were added to the sludge system the amount of fe ii oxidized by the former would be less than that by the latter furthermore the results also showed that the rapid fe ii oxidation with no3 was related to the no2 produced since direct fe ii oxidation with no3 was unobvious figs s4 and s5 while fe ii oxidation with no2 i e chemodenitrification was fast figs 2 and s3 microbial analysis showed that the abundance of geobacter of no3 added groups was 7 folds 0 4 higher than that of control groups with no no3 addition 0 05 and no anammox species were detected fig s6 so far only three species of no3 reducing fe ii oxidizer at genus level have been found including acidovorax thermomonas and aquabacterium bao and li 2017 straub et al 2004 and they were undetected in both groups meaning that fe ii oxidization in this study was contributed by no2 in the no3 added group also just like xrd patterns of the no2 added group fig 4 feooh was also generated in the no3 added groups fig s7 remarkably it has been reported that fe oh 3 and feooh were the products of biotic ndfo and abiotic chemodenitrification respectively 10fe ii 2no3 24h2o 10fe oh 3 n2 18h 4fe ii 2no2 5h2o 4feooh n2o 6h jamieson et al 2018 melton et al 2014 it is reasonably concluded that in the no3 added group fe ii oxidation was performed by no2 produced from the reduction of no3 which caused fe iii generation to participate in next round feammox for nh4 removal 3 5 implication in this study no2 was added to trigger fe ii oxidation then the produced fe iii participated in feammox in this fe driven anammox process fe ii fe iii cycle was completed via combination of feammox and chemodenitrification to achieve nh4 oxidation and no2 reduction some or all iron reducing bacteria e g geobacter as the functional microbial in this process ubiquitously exists in natural and artificial anaerobic anoxic systems mejia et al 2016 it implied that this fe driven anammox process has played and is playing an important role in nitrogen loss of these systems which however is long ignored taking anammox as an example fe ii is regarded as an essential element for the growth of anammox bacteria and a certain amount fe ii e g 0 02 0 08 mm was reported to improve the performance of anammox while the activity of anammox bacteria could be suppressed under higher fe ii concentrations 0 08 mm bi et al 2014 liu and ni 2015 qiao et al 2013 according to this study no2 induced fe ii oxidation and generated fe iii could participate in feammox to cause nitrogen removal in agreement it has been reported that the fe ii fe iii cycle also occurred in iron containing anammox system adding no2 in which the fe ii fe iii cycle likely caused nh4 removal shu et al 2016 in this study no2 could be produced through partial denitrification of no3 which provided continuous electron acceptor for fe ii oxidation certainly the nitrogen removal efficiency of this study was not high fig 1c which was related to the low efficiency of autotrophic feammox ding et al 2017 li et al 2015 feammox induced by iron reducing bacteria depended upon extracellular electron transfer it has been reported that the feammox efficiency can be improved by supplementing electron shutters e g aqds zhou et al 2016 which will be investigated in our next work 4 conclusions in this study the fluctuation of fe ii fe iii with intermittent no2 addition due to the fe ii oxidation and feammox was discovered for the first time in consecutive removal of nh4 consequently nh4 n content decreased from about 32 2 mg l initially to 1 3 mg l on day 18 in the no2 added reactor although the nh4 removal rate was not high a novel nh4 oxidation process with no2 as terminal electron acceptor but with fe ii fe iii cycle as propellant was totally different with common anammox process that depended on anammox bacteria through xrd and xps analysis figs 4 and s3 feooh was produced after no2 addition the qpcr result showed that anammox bacteria was undetected meaning nitrogen removal from anammox could be excluded in this study actually the added no2 served as the terminal electron acceptor to oxidize ammonium with fe ii fe iii as the electron shuttle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of

17373,free nitrous acid fna based applications have been broadly adopted in the development of novel wastewater management technologies but a basic understanding of the effect of the chemical properties of fna on the elimination of micropollutants is still lacking this study aims to comprehensively evaluate fna based elimination of sulfamethoxazole smx which is a typical species of sulphonamide antibiotics batch experiments were conducted under different influencing factors to investigate the antibiotics elimination processes we found that fna showed specific efficacy on sulphonamides characterized by sulfonamide and aniline functional groups such as smx smx degradation was affected by the initial smx concentration fna concentration and solution ph and described by d s m x dt 0 29 e 1 69 p h s m x 0 945 f n a 1 35 the cationic forms of smx were more reactive towards fna based active components sulfonamide bond s n or c s bonds cleavage nitrosubstitution deamination and radical oxidation were proposed to be the relevant transformation pathways the fna based technique was not effective for diminishing toxicity but this process could strongly control antibacterial activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords free nitrous acid sulfamethoxazole transformation pathways toxicity antibacterial activity 1 introduction antibiotics are effective agents for killing or inhibiting microbes and therefore large quantities of antibiotics have been produced and consumed to control infections in humans and animals since the discovery of penicillin in 1929 fleming 1929 global antibiotics usage has been estimated to be 300 000 tons per year with approximately 1 3 of this total used to treat humans wise 2002 the average metabolic rate of all antibiotics used for humans is approximately 30 kümmerer and henninger 2003 so a large amount of residual antibiotics have been excreted and have entered the sewage system in either parent or metabolic forms it is estimated that more than 8000 t of 36 commonly used antibiotics are excreted annually in china zhang et al 2015 although the removal efficiency for most antibiotics in wastewater treatment facilities is higher than 80 their concentrations in effluent still range from ng l 1 to μg l 1 wu et al 2016 ben et al 2018 the toxic byproducts of antibiotics may lead to changes of aquatic microbes yu et al 2014 and nonbiodegradable antibiotics also increase the selective pressure for the transfer and mutations of antibiotics resistance genes in the whole water cycle zhao et al 2019 weakening the antibacterial action of antibiotics and threatening ecological safety hao et al 2015 thus in addition to advanced techniques coupled to conventional treatment processes moreira et al 2016 li et al 2014 novel methods should be developed to promote antibiotics degradation in wastewater treatment plants wwtps researchers found free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite jiang et al 2011 can react with pollutants such as sulfide jiang et al 2013a catechols khalafi et al 2010 and phenols ridd et al 1991 via direct hydroxylation deamination and nitrosubstitution sun et al 2019 in recent years the fna based technologies have been broadly developed in wastewater management to obtain effects such as controlling corrosion and odor in sewers achieving carbon and energy efficient nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment and improving waste activated sludge reduction and energy recovery duan et al 2020 sun et al found that fna interfered with sulfamethoxazole degradation in the nitrification process but did not fully evaluate the chemical efficacy of fna for antibiotics because the low fna concentration 0 04 mg n l presented a limited sulfamethoxazole removal of 6 16 sun et al 2019 in fact a large amount of fna can be accumulated during the nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor source separated urine and landfill leachate zheng et al 2017 law et al 2015 however the chemical efficacy and the underlying mechanism of the effect of high fna concentrations on antibiotics are still unclear thus it is essential to investigate the optimal reaction conditions develop a kinetics model analyze the reaction pathway and evaluate the toxicity of byproducts to obtain a deeper understanding of fna based elimination on antibiotics generally aromatic amines readily react with nitric oxide no to form diazonium cations brückner 2004 and the unstable diazonium cations undergo consecutive reactions to form aromatic nitro no2 species in the presence of excess nitrite nödler et al 2012 itoh et al 1996 in addition it is reported that the derivatives of fna i e no n2o3 no2 and n2o4 and the reactive nitrogen intermediates i e no and no2 are hypothesized to intervene with pollutants transformation jiang and yuan 2013b park and lee 1988 the chemical degradation pathway of antibiotics exposed to fna is not determined thus the potential pathways should be inferred according to detectable abundant products currently toxicological evaluation of degradation products is recommended if the transformation products become more or less biologically active than the original chemicals a previous study showed that the transformation products obtained via uv pds oxidation treatment were more toxic than the parent forms zhang et al 2016 whereas the toxicity of the products obtained by fna chemical treatment is unknown in addition since the antibacterial activity of sulfonamides originates from the sulfanilamide toxicophore structure of the sulfonamide group bound to aniline in the para position majewsky et al 2014 the changes of antibacterial activity upon the change of partial functional moieties are unknown thus it is essential to evaluate the biological toxicity and antibacterial properties of the antibiotics byproducts in this work sulfamethoxazole smx is selected as the target micropollutant due to its heavy consumption frequent detection and widespread distribution in natural waters a comprehensive evaluation of fna based elimination of smx is conducted including specific elimination identification kinetics construction transformation pathways inference and toxicity and antibacterial property evaluation the present study is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of fna based technology for antibiotics control 2 materials and methods 2 1 specific elimination of antibiotics by fna all of the antibiotics 98 purity were purchased from either solarbio beijing china or j k scientific beijing china and their standards 99 purity were purchased from tmrm standard materials center beijing china or were provided by dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany stock solutions of representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp roxithromycin rox enrofloxacin enr and chloramphenicol cp were prepared by dissolving each compound in methanol to a concentration of 100 mg l the stock solutions were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator the major physicochemical properties of these antibiotics are listed in table s1 we obtained different fna concentrations according to the following equation park and bae 2009 1 fna n o 2 e 2300 273 t 10 p h where t is the temperature c and fna and n o 2 are calculated in the units of mg n l to examine the elimination of different antibiotics by fna experiments were conducted under the condition of 3 mg n l fna 145 3 mgn l nano2 27 5 c and 100 mm phosphate buffered solution pb ph 5 0 which was prepared by mixing 100 mm nah2po4 and 100 mm na2hpo4 a mixture of antibiotics was diluted in the buffer solution to obtain a concentration of 0 4 μm for each antibiotic samples were withdrawn at regular intervals filtered and then stored for analysis 2 2 effect of influencing factors on smx elimination 2 2 1 effect of the initial smx concentration as table 1 showed different amounts of smx were added to aqueous solutions 100 ml containing 242 1 mg n l nano2 all of the reactions were conducted in a 100 mm pb solution ph 5 0 to obtain the same fna concentration of 5 0 mg n l 27 5 c magnetic stirring was conducted during the reactions all of the reactions were carried out several times during the experiment aliquots of solutions 1 ml were withdrawn at regular intervals and filtered through 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filters pvdf millipore massachusetts usa into centrifuge tubes to prevent further reactions occurring in the ph 5 0 solution a naoh 10 m solution 11 5 μl was added to adjust the sample ph to 8 0 the prepared samples were stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 2 2 effect of fna to investigate the effect of fna on the elimination of antibiotics batch experiments were performed with different amounts of nano2 at the same ph ph 5 0 and room temperature 27 5 c in amber bottles according to the actual fna concentrations adopted for nitritation control with side stream activated sludge treatment duan et al 2020 the initial fna concentration was considered from 1 0 to 5 0 mg n l in batch tests in each test shown in table 2 an aqueous solution 100 ml containing 0 4 μm smx and different concentrations of nano2 was prepared in a 100 mm pb solution ph 5 0 for comparison tests were conducted by adding different amounts of nano2 to 100 mm phosphate buffered solution ph 8 0 because under these conditions the minor fna amounts had a negligible effect on smx the sampling was the same as mentioned above 2 2 3 effect of ph to investigate the effect of ph on smx elimination we set the fixed initial fna concentration by changing the added nano2 concentration according to eq 1 the experimental procedures were as the same as mentioned above buffer solutions at ph 5 0 and 6 0 were prepared by mixing 100 mm nah2po4 and a 100 mm na2hpo4 solution at different ratios and ph 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 solutions were prepared by adding an 85 h3po4 solution dropwise to the 100 mm nah2po4 solution without the addition of nano2 buffer solutions at different ph values only containing smx were prepared for comparison detailed information about these experiments is provided in table 3 the subsequent sampling was the same as mentioned above 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 antibiotics concentration analysis the antibiotics concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry agilent 1290 6460 lc ms ms a sample 10 μl was injected onto a waters xbridge c18 chromatographic separation column 3 150 mm 3 5 μm waters corp milford ma usa run at 30 c with a flow rate of 0 4 ml min the mobile phase eluent consisted of solution a 0 01 ammonia water for cp and 0 1 formic acid for the other antibiotics in milliq water and solution b 0 01 ammonia water for cp and 0 1 formic acid for the other antibiotics in 1 1 methanol acetonitrile with the exception of cp the antibiotics were eluted from the column as follows 0 1 0 min 80 a 1 0 3 0 min 80 a 70 a 3 0 6 0 min 70 a 6 0 7 0 min 70 a 30 a 7 0

details are provided in tables s2 s3 2 3 2 ms dd ms2 analysis to identify the transformation byproducts the initial antibiotic concentration was set to 1 mg l and the effluent was enriched by solid phase extraction to ensure that the products could be detected by ultra performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry using an ultimate 3000 rs autosampler dionex usa and q exactive plus thermo scientific usa instrument the samples were analyzed in both the electrospray ionization positive esi and electrospray ionization negative esi ion modes data were collected between m z 100 and1500 with a resolution of 70000 for full ms and a resolution of 17500 for dd ms2 the operational conditions are listed in text s1 2 4 model simulation aquasim 2 1 software was implemented to identify and simulate the degradation kinetics reichert 1998 the parameter degradation rate constant k reaction order constant a and b estimation was carried out through minimizing the sum of squares of deviations between the model predictions and the experimentally measured antibiotics concentrations in batch tests with different nitrite concentration antibiotics concentration and ph profiles the 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters zheng et al 2018 the significance of modeling results was evaluated by variance analysis in which p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant and p 0 05 showed statistical insignificance 2 5 toxicity analysis the antimicrobial properties of smx and its transformation byproducts were tested using escherichia coli atcc 25922 the stored strain in 30 v v glycerol was activated and cultured using mueller hinton mh broth based on the bacterial growth curve we obtained the relation between od600 optical density at 600 nm absorbance wavelength and cell density the antibacterial tests were performed in a 96 well sterile microtiter plate by dosing the samples 100 μl withdrawn at different time intervals to each well and inoculating with mh broth 100 μl with a cell density of 1 106 cfu ml a microplate reader synergy h1 usa was used to continuously monitor the growth kinetics of the e coli strain at 37 c for 12 hours the measured od600 was then converted to growth inhibition as follows 2 i n h i b i t i o n 1 o d 600 s a m p l e o d 600 c o n t r o l 100 where od600 sample is the absorbance at 600 nm of the sample aliquot taken at each selected time interval or the background samples only containing nano2 and od600 control is the absorbance of the ultra pure water replacing the samples in the final calculation growth inhibition caused by nano2 was subtracted from the sample inhibition in addition an acute toxicity assessment was conducted against the common vibrio fischeri luminescent bacterium because of the disruption of normal metabolism bioluminescence decreases when the bacteria come in contact with toxic compounds the same samples as above were sent to beijing bixiao bio technologies co ltd for the toxicity tests the nano2 background samples had a negligible impact on the luminescence 3 results and discussion 3 1 specific elimination effect of fna on antibiotics the effect of fna on different antibiotics was investigated as shown in fig 1 in contrast to smx the concentrations of rox tmp enr and cp did not show significant changes during the reaction indicating that fna exerted a specific action on these antibiotics the main structure of smx consists of a sulfonamide moiety an aniline and an isoxazole ring whereas the chemical structures of rox tmp enr and cp table s1 do not contain these characteristic groups this result implied that fna can act on sulfonamides that contain one or more similar characteristic functional groups as smx and major degradation effects occurred on these moieties the previous study has shown that hno2 promoted a diazotization reaction in which a diazonio group replaced the primary aromatic amine of smx and the unstable diazonium cation was further converted to transformation products bílková et al 2019 3 2 kinetics of smx degradation 3 2 1 effect of the initial smx concentration the effect of the initial smx concentration on smx degradation is shown in fig 2 in this experiment all of the processes were carried out using the same amount of oxidants 242 1 mg n l nano2 dissolved in a buffer solution at ph 5 0 the antibiotics were completely eliminated after 6 hours at an initial concentration of lower than 36 0 μm whereas the final removal efficiency decreased to 90 53 when the initial concentration was increased to 105 2 μm these results showed that a higher initial smx concentration led to a decrease in the removal efficiency at the same fna concentration similar degradation characteristics were found for smx degradation by ultraviolet assisted advanced oxidation processes ao and liu 2017 thus the degradation rate was correlated with initial smx concentration 3 2 2 effect of fna on smx elimination as shown in fig 3 the smx concentration did not change during the contrast tests demonstrating that nitrite does not directly react with smx regardless of the smx concentration conversely smx elimination was strongly promoted when the fna concentration was increased from 1 0 mg n l to 5 0 mg n l the removal efficiency was approximately 82 5 after 8 hours at 1 0 mg n l fna and was greater than 99 after 2 hours at 5 0 mg n l fna these results show that fna can react with smx and that the removal efficiency increases with increasing fna concentration thus smx degradation is positively related to the fna concentration which is consistent with previous study that the linear regression between smx removal and fna was demonstrated in the nitrite accumulation environment sun et al 2019 the fna based technique is promising for the enhancing chemical reactions of sulfonamide antibiotics in the nitritation of high concentration ammonium wastewater such as urine landfill leachate and aerobic anaerobic digested sludge 3 2 3 kinetics modeling as mentioned above smx degradation was affected by both the initial smx concentration and the fna concentration thus the overall smx degradation can be expressed as follows 3 d smx dt k s m x a f n a b where a and b represent reaction orders and k represents the smx degradation rate constant xu and long 2013 by calibrating the experimental data using aquasim 2 1 software we obtained the following parameters k 5 71 10 4 μm 1 295h 1 a 0 945 and b 1 35 the degradation rate increased with increasing fna concentration b 1 whereas a high smx concentration reduced the reaction rate a 1 the overall smx degradation was promoted with a total reaction order of 2 295 the kinetics modeling results are presented in fig 2 and fig 3 the reaction order obtained by simulation is similar with the previous study that the abiotic reaction between smx and fna confirmed to second order reaction sun et al 2019 the decrease in the degradation rate at the high smx initial concentration was most likely due to the large number of transformation products generated during the degradation of smx the intermediates can also be oxidized by the consumption of fna leading to a decrease in the smx degradation rate as was noted by sun et al the unstable intermediates of smx undergo numerous consecutive reactions with available oxidants and radicals sun et al 2017 3 3 effect of ph on smx elimination as shown in fig 4 a the final smx concentrations varied under different ph the solution ph significantly influenced smx elimination the final removal efficiency was decreased from 100 to 80 6 when the ph was increased from 2 0 to 4 0 while it was increased to 100 when the ph was increased from 4 0 to 6 0 implying that the final smx removal efficiency was lowest at ph 4 0 by contrast hydrolysis was not observed within this ph range in agreement with previous reports that showed that less than 5 of smx was hydrolyzed at ph 4 0 20 c after one month białk bielińska et al 2012 acid or base catalyzed hydrolysis usually occurs at elevated temperatures of 50 70 c and at temperatures even higher than 100 c saita et al 2018 searles and nukina 1959 graafland et al 1979 providing the necessary activation energy for molecular collisions loftin et al 2008 leffl and grunwald 1963 while the final removal efficiency 100 at 8 h was the same at ph 2 0 3 0 and 6 0 the degradation rates varied the highest degradation rate was observed at ph 2 0 at which complete removal was achieved within 2 hours as shown in fig 4 b the degradation rate constant depended on the solution ph which was decreased by 90 when ph increased from 2 0 to 4 0 based on eq 3 the final smx degradation was described as 4 d smx dt 0 29 e 1 69 p h s m x 0 945 f n a 1 35 the smx degradation rates at different ph were related to the smx molecular states and oxidant efficacy the molecular structure of smx contains two basic groups aniline and heterocyclic base and one acidic group sulfonamide as shown in fig s1 the once protonated cationic form occurring at the aniline amino group was the main species at ph 1 85 pka1 1 85 0 30 the deprotonated anionic form occurring at the sulfonamide group was the main species at ph 5 60 pka2 5 60 0 04 and the neutral form was dominant at ph 4 0 babić et al 2007 ben et al 2017 it was found that under strongly acidic conditions ph 4 0 the cationic species of smx were more reactive with nitrogen intermediates and free radicals such as hydroxyl oh peroxynitrite onoo onooh nitrogen dioxide no2 dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and nitric oxide radical no jiang et al 2013b hartop et al 2017 oldreive and rice evans 2001 so smx degradation was greatly enhanced at ph 2 0 and 3 0 moreover the anionic species were more reactive than the neutral species toward the oxidants ben et al 2017 wang et al 2010 and electrostatic attraction facilitated the combination of the anionic species and nitrogen cations derived from fna takahama and hirota 2012 so the degradation rate was slightly promoted when the ph was increased from 4 0 to 6 0 luo et al also noted that the apparent degradation rates of sulfonamides at neutral species were lower than those at cationic and anionic species during the hydroxyl radical reaction luo et al 2019 3 4 transformation products identification and reaction pathway inference the chemical structures of the transformation byproducts were tentatively identified based on the ms ms spectra and previous studies the molecular formulae molecular masses and proposed structures of the tps are listed in table s4 the esi full ms spectra of the samples and the ms ms spectra of the detected tps are listed in figs s2 s25 based on the observed products we deduced the possible degradation pathways as shown in fig 5 3 4 1 pathway 1 the identified tps were formed through a cleavage reaction p1 substitution by fna p2 and oxidation by oh radicals p3 the first pathway involved sulfonamide bond hydrolysis resulting in the cleavage of the s n or c s bonds tian et al 2019 due to s n bond cleavage p1 1 tp 173 and tp 98 formed which were confirmed to be 4 amino benzene sulfanilic acid and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole respectively however no peak matched tp 98 in this study because the m z 100 was not investigated additionally tp 157 and tp 114 also formed cleavage of the s n bond has been commonly observed in smx degradation by various chemical processes liu et al 2017 the identified tp 109 p aminophenol and tp 162 were attributed to c s bond cleavage p1 2 meanwhile tp 178 was identified and the other moiety was assigned as aniline previous studies have also observed the formation of aniline from the cleavage of the c s bond by photolysis or oxidation reactions driven by nitrite free chlorine chlorine dioxide and ferrate sun et al 2017 ben et al 2017 yang et al 2017 bonvin et al 2012 dodd and huang 2004 sharma et al 2006 3 4 2 pathway 2 nitrosubstitution p2 1 and deamination p2 2 occurred on the amino group of aniline to form 4 nitro smx tp 283 and desamino smx tp 238 respectively sun et al 2019 kassotaki et al 2016 for the protonated smx cations protonated amine was more accessible to hno2 which contained lone pair electrons while for the deprotonated smx anions the electron cloud density was shifted to the sulfonamide bond so a nucleophilic attack was likely to occur on the amine of aniline at the two ionic species larson and weber 1994 tp 283 may result from the substitution of the aromatic nh2 by an aromatic no2 nitro and the fragment ion at m z 282 and 138 in the mass spectrum confirmed this product tp 238 as indicated by the presence of the fragment ion at m z 141 was generated by a loss of the nitro group from tp 283 and was also attributed to the substitution of the aromatic nh2 by hydrogen it has been reported that under acidic or reducing environments in which nitrite is present nitrite can be chemically or biologically reduced to nitric oxide no which can react with aromatic amines in smx to form unstable diazonium cations nödler et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 mcknight et al 1997 and the diazonium cations undergo numerous consecutive reactions with available nitrite or hydrogen to form tp 283 or tp 238 respectively furthermore cleavage of the n s and c s bonds occurs for tp 283 and tp 238 3 4 3 pathway 3 oh can attack the smx molecule in different positions including the benzene ring p3 1 the amino group on the benzene ring p3 2 and the isoxazole ring p3 3 solar et al found that the main oh radical reaction 54 occurred at the ortho position of aniline while 36 of oh reacted directly with the nh2 group solar et al 1986 thus pathway 3 2 was described below while the others are shown in text s2 in pathway p3 2 due to single electron transfer and n h deprotonation ben et al 2017 huang et al 2001 oh reacted with the amino moiety of smx to form hydroxylamine so tp 269 2 may be a hydroxylated derivative of aniline tp269 2 was oxidized to produce a nitroso derivative tp267 that underwent further hydrolysis to form a nitro smx tp 283 ao et al 2018 then the isoxazole ring of tp 283 was opened by oh to form tp 245 ji et al 2015 finally the cleavage of the s n bond led to tp 203 desulfonation pathway p4 was another minor pathway involved in smx degradation resulting in the formation of tp189 in addition the products speculated to be obtained by the oh reaction were likely partly due to the reaction with the reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite zhang et al 2016 among all of the pathways mentioned above we considered nitrosubstitution and deamination of pathway 2 to be the dominant degradation mechanisms because the relative peak areas of 4 nitro smx tp 283 and desamino smx tp 238 in the ms spectrum were higher than those of the other byproducts it was implied that the vast accumulation of fna related nitrogen intermediates and free radicals would further facilitate antibiotics degradation 3 5 toxicity assessment of transformation products bioluminescence inhibition of smx and its transformation products was monitored to detect acute toxicity growth inhibition was conducted on e coli to test the change of antibacterial activity 3 5 1 acute toxicity analysis of byproducts fig 6 shows the acute toxicity of the transformation products and the parent compound the l l0 ratio reflects the sample end point luminescence relative to the initial luminescence a value below 1 0 indicates that luminescence decreased in the test implying that the compounds inhibited luminescence the variation in the l l0 ratio represents the differences in the extent of the inhibition a smaller l l0 ratio corresponds to higher toxicity the relative luminescence ratios of the different amounts of the parent smx are shown for comparison the parent smx inhibited approximately 25 of the luminescence of v fischeri at 0 12 mm compared with the antibiotic free samples with the decrease in smx corresponding to increased removal efficiency the inhibition effects of the parent smx on v fischeri decreased corresponding to the increase in l l0 the observed toxicity of the samples remaining smx tps remained almost unchanged after the reaction suggesting that the toxicity of the transformation products alone increased because the toxicity of the remaining smx decreased the overall toxicity of the sample at the final point in time was nearly equal to the toxicity of the initial compound due to the cleavage of the sulfonamide bond s n 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole appeared increasing the amount of nh2 groups the nh2 group is known to interact with the flavin mononucleotide which is necessary for the luminescence of v fischeri jablonski and deluca 1978 so these aminated products led to higher acute toxicity 3 5 2 antibacterial activity the antibacterial potentials of the parent and the transformation products were measured using e coli which is a representative bacteria for testing antibacterial properties because the transformation products were complex and it was difficult to investigate the antibacterial activity of the individual products we measured the inhibition effect of a mixing sample of the products and residual parent that may coexist in solution and jointly exert an inhibition effect based on the residual smx concentrations of the samples we diluted the stock antibiotics solutions to the determined values and the antibacterial properties of the parent antibiotics at different concentrations were tested concurrently thus the inhibition ratios of the products were observed by subtracting the inhibition ratio of the parent from that of the mixture the obtained inhibition curves of the transformation products and parent are shown in fig 7 it is important to note that the calculated product inhibition was lower than the inhibition of the remaining parent indicating that a negligible antibacterial property was retained by the transformation products during the reaction because of its structural similarity with para aminobenzoic acid paba smx acts by inhibiting the utilization of bacteria on paba nevertheless the original structure of the sulfanilamide toxicophore sulfonamide group bound to aniline in the para position majewsky et al 2014 was destroyed after hydrolysis substitution deamination and hydroxylation so unlike the parent compound products such as desamino smx did not inhibit bacterial growth overall the antibacterial activity of the transformation products was diminished therefore transformation products exhibited acute toxicity on vibrio fischeri and their antibacterial activity on e coli was diminished due to complex substances and abundant microbes in sewage the ecological effects of degradation products on sewage system and receiving waters should be further assessed by developing integrated modelling approach hong et al 2020 4 conclusions this study provides a comprehensive understanding of fna based elimination of typical antibiotics showing the significant value of having a deep understanding of fna based applications for the treatment of micropollutants the fna based chemical elimination of sulfonamides could be characterized by benzenesulfonamide the reaction was successfully described by d s m x d t k s m x 0 945 f n a 1 35 and the degradation rate constant was exponentially correlated to solution ph k 0 29 e 1 69 p h the cationic species of smx were more reactive to fna related active components based on the products identification we inferred the main transformation pathway was nitro substitution and deamination accompanied by sulfonamide bond s n or c s bonds breakage and radical oxidation toxicity and antibacterial activity tests by vibrio fischeri and e coli showed the transformation products exhibited acute toxicity on vibrio fischeri whereas the antibacterial activity was diminished due to destroy of sulfanilamide toxicophore declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17373,free nitrous acid fna based applications have been broadly adopted in the development of novel wastewater management technologies but a basic understanding of the effect of the chemical properties of fna on the elimination of micropollutants is still lacking this study aims to comprehensively evaluate fna based elimination of sulfamethoxazole smx which is a typical species of sulphonamide antibiotics batch experiments were conducted under different influencing factors to investigate the antibiotics elimination processes we found that fna showed specific efficacy on sulphonamides characterized by sulfonamide and aniline functional groups such as smx smx degradation was affected by the initial smx concentration fna concentration and solution ph and described by d s m x dt 0 29 e 1 69 p h s m x 0 945 f n a 1 35 the cationic forms of smx were more reactive towards fna based active components sulfonamide bond s n or c s bonds cleavage nitrosubstitution deamination and radical oxidation were proposed to be the relevant transformation pathways the fna based technique was not effective for diminishing toxicity but this process could strongly control antibacterial activity graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords free nitrous acid sulfamethoxazole transformation pathways toxicity antibacterial activity 1 introduction antibiotics are effective agents for killing or inhibiting microbes and therefore large quantities of antibiotics have been produced and consumed to control infections in humans and animals since the discovery of penicillin in 1929 fleming 1929 global antibiotics usage has been estimated to be 300 000 tons per year with approximately 1 3 of this total used to treat humans wise 2002 the average metabolic rate of all antibiotics used for humans is approximately 30 kümmerer and henninger 2003 so a large amount of residual antibiotics have been excreted and have entered the sewage system in either parent or metabolic forms it is estimated that more than 8000 t of 36 commonly used antibiotics are excreted annually in china zhang et al 2015 although the removal efficiency for most antibiotics in wastewater treatment facilities is higher than 80 their concentrations in effluent still range from ng l 1 to μg l 1 wu et al 2016 ben et al 2018 the toxic byproducts of antibiotics may lead to changes of aquatic microbes yu et al 2014 and nonbiodegradable antibiotics also increase the selective pressure for the transfer and mutations of antibiotics resistance genes in the whole water cycle zhao et al 2019 weakening the antibacterial action of antibiotics and threatening ecological safety hao et al 2015 thus in addition to advanced techniques coupled to conventional treatment processes moreira et al 2016 li et al 2014 novel methods should be developed to promote antibiotics degradation in wastewater treatment plants wwtps researchers found free nitrous acid fna the protonated form of nitrite jiang et al 2011 can react with pollutants such as sulfide jiang et al 2013a catechols khalafi et al 2010 and phenols ridd et al 1991 via direct hydroxylation deamination and nitrosubstitution sun et al 2019 in recent years the fna based technologies have been broadly developed in wastewater management to obtain effects such as controlling corrosion and odor in sewers achieving carbon and energy efficient nitrogen removal during wastewater treatment and improving waste activated sludge reduction and energy recovery duan et al 2020 sun et al found that fna interfered with sulfamethoxazole degradation in the nitrification process but did not fully evaluate the chemical efficacy of fna for antibiotics because the low fna concentration 0 04 mg n l presented a limited sulfamethoxazole removal of 6 16 sun et al 2019 in fact a large amount of fna can be accumulated during the nitritation of anaerobic digestion liquor source separated urine and landfill leachate zheng et al 2017 law et al 2015 however the chemical efficacy and the underlying mechanism of the effect of high fna concentrations on antibiotics are still unclear thus it is essential to investigate the optimal reaction conditions develop a kinetics model analyze the reaction pathway and evaluate the toxicity of byproducts to obtain a deeper understanding of fna based elimination on antibiotics generally aromatic amines readily react with nitric oxide no to form diazonium cations brückner 2004 and the unstable diazonium cations undergo consecutive reactions to form aromatic nitro no2 species in the presence of excess nitrite nödler et al 2012 itoh et al 1996 in addition it is reported that the derivatives of fna i e no n2o3 no2 and n2o4 and the reactive nitrogen intermediates i e no and no2 are hypothesized to intervene with pollutants transformation jiang and yuan 2013b park and lee 1988 the chemical degradation pathway of antibiotics exposed to fna is not determined thus the potential pathways should be inferred according to detectable abundant products currently toxicological evaluation of degradation products is recommended if the transformation products become more or less biologically active than the original chemicals a previous study showed that the transformation products obtained via uv pds oxidation treatment were more toxic than the parent forms zhang et al 2016 whereas the toxicity of the products obtained by fna chemical treatment is unknown in addition since the antibacterial activity of sulfonamides originates from the sulfanilamide toxicophore structure of the sulfonamide group bound to aniline in the para position majewsky et al 2014 the changes of antibacterial activity upon the change of partial functional moieties are unknown thus it is essential to evaluate the biological toxicity and antibacterial properties of the antibiotics byproducts in this work sulfamethoxazole smx is selected as the target micropollutant due to its heavy consumption frequent detection and widespread distribution in natural waters a comprehensive evaluation of fna based elimination of smx is conducted including specific elimination identification kinetics construction transformation pathways inference and toxicity and antibacterial property evaluation the present study is the first to provide a comprehensive understanding of fna based technology for antibiotics control 2 materials and methods 2 1 specific elimination of antibiotics by fna all of the antibiotics 98 purity were purchased from either solarbio beijing china or j k scientific beijing china and their standards 99 purity were purchased from tmrm standard materials center beijing china or were provided by dr ehrenstorfer gmbh augsburg germany stock solutions of representative antibiotics sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp roxithromycin rox enrofloxacin enr and chloramphenicol cp were prepared by dissolving each compound in methanol to a concentration of 100 mg l the stock solutions were stored at 4 c in a refrigerator the major physicochemical properties of these antibiotics are listed in table s1 we obtained different fna concentrations according to the following equation park and bae 2009 1 fna n o 2 e 2300 273 t 10 p h where t is the temperature c and fna and n o 2 are calculated in the units of mg n l to examine the elimination of different antibiotics by fna experiments were conducted under the condition of 3 mg n l fna 145 3 mgn l nano2 27 5 c and 100 mm phosphate buffered solution pb ph 5 0 which was prepared by mixing 100 mm nah2po4 and 100 mm na2hpo4 a mixture of antibiotics was diluted in the buffer solution to obtain a concentration of 0 4 μm for each antibiotic samples were withdrawn at regular intervals filtered and then stored for analysis 2 2 effect of influencing factors on smx elimination 2 2 1 effect of the initial smx concentration as table 1 showed different amounts of smx were added to aqueous solutions 100 ml containing 242 1 mg n l nano2 all of the reactions were conducted in a 100 mm pb solution ph 5 0 to obtain the same fna concentration of 5 0 mg n l 27 5 c magnetic stirring was conducted during the reactions all of the reactions were carried out several times during the experiment aliquots of solutions 1 ml were withdrawn at regular intervals and filtered through 0 22 μm polyvinylidene fluoride membrane filters pvdf millipore massachusetts usa into centrifuge tubes to prevent further reactions occurring in the ph 5 0 solution a naoh 10 m solution 11 5 μl was added to adjust the sample ph to 8 0 the prepared samples were stored at 4 c prior to analysis 2 2 2 effect of fna to investigate the effect of fna on the elimination of antibiotics batch experiments were performed with different amounts of nano2 at the same ph ph 5 0 and room temperature 27 5 c in amber bottles according to the actual fna concentrations adopted for nitritation control with side stream activated sludge treatment duan et al 2020 the initial fna concentration was considered from 1 0 to 5 0 mg n l in batch tests in each test shown in table 2 an aqueous solution 100 ml containing 0 4 μm smx and different concentrations of nano2 was prepared in a 100 mm pb solution ph 5 0 for comparison tests were conducted by adding different amounts of nano2 to 100 mm phosphate buffered solution ph 8 0 because under these conditions the minor fna amounts had a negligible effect on smx the sampling was the same as mentioned above 2 2 3 effect of ph to investigate the effect of ph on smx elimination we set the fixed initial fna concentration by changing the added nano2 concentration according to eq 1 the experimental procedures were as the same as mentioned above buffer solutions at ph 5 0 and 6 0 were prepared by mixing 100 mm nah2po4 and a 100 mm na2hpo4 solution at different ratios and ph 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 solutions were prepared by adding an 85 h3po4 solution dropwise to the 100 mm nah2po4 solution without the addition of nano2 buffer solutions at different ph values only containing smx were prepared for comparison detailed information about these experiments is provided in table 3 the subsequent sampling was the same as mentioned above 2 3 analysis methods 2 3 1 antibiotics concentration analysis the antibiotics concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry agilent 1290 6460 lc

and1500 with a resolution of 70000 for full ms and a resolution of 17500 for dd ms2 the operational conditions are listed in text s1 2 4 model simulation aquasim 2 1 software was implemented to identify and simulate the degradation kinetics reichert 1998 the parameter degradation rate constant k reaction order constant a and b estimation was carried out through minimizing the sum of squares of deviations between the model predictions and the experimentally measured antibiotics concentrations in batch tests with different nitrite concentration antibiotics concentration and ph profiles the 95 confidence intervals of individual parameter estimates were calculated from the mean square fitting errors and the sensitivity of the model to the parameters zheng et al 2018 the significance of modeling results was evaluated by variance analysis in which p 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant and p 0 05 showed statistical insignificance 2 5 toxicity analysis the antimicrobial properties of smx and its transformation byproducts were tested using escherichia coli atcc 25922 the stored strain in 30 v v glycerol was activated and cultured using mueller hinton mh broth based on the bacterial growth curve we obtained the relation between od600 optical density at 600 nm absorbance wavelength and cell density the antibacterial tests were performed in a 96 well sterile microtiter plate by dosing the samples 100 μl withdrawn at different time intervals to each well and inoculating with mh broth 100 μl with a cell density of 1 106 cfu ml a microplate reader synergy h1 usa was used to continuously monitor the growth kinetics of the e coli strain at 37 c for 12 hours the measured od600 was then converted to growth inhibition as follows 2 i n h i b i t i o n 1 o d 600 s a m p l e o d 600 c o n t r o l 100 where od600 sample is the absorbance at 600 nm of the sample aliquot taken at each selected time interval or the background samples only containing nano2 and od600 control is the absorbance of the ultra pure water replacing the samples in the final calculation growth inhibition caused by nano2 was subtracted from the sample inhibition in addition an acute toxicity assessment was conducted against the common vibrio fischeri luminescent bacterium because of the disruption of normal metabolism bioluminescence decreases when the bacteria come in contact with toxic compounds the same samples as above were sent to beijing bixiao bio technologies co ltd for the toxicity tests the nano2 background samples had a negligible impact on the luminescence 3 results and discussion 3 1 specific elimination effect of fna on antibiotics the effect of fna on different antibiotics was investigated as shown in fig 1 in contrast to smx the concentrations of rox tmp enr and cp did not show significant changes during the reaction indicating that fna exerted a specific action on these antibiotics the main structure of smx consists of a sulfonamide moiety an aniline and an isoxazole ring whereas the chemical structures of rox tmp enr and cp table s1 do not contain these characteristic groups this result implied that fna can act on sulfonamides that contain one or more similar characteristic functional groups as smx and major degradation effects occurred on these moieties the previous study has shown that hno2 promoted a diazotization reaction in which a diazonio group replaced the primary aromatic amine of smx and the unstable diazonium cation was further converted to transformation products bílková et al 2019 3 2 kinetics of smx degradation 3 2 1 effect of the initial smx concentration the effect of the initial smx concentration on smx degradation is shown in fig 2 in this experiment all of the processes were carried out using the same amount of oxidants 242 1 mg n l nano2 dissolved in a buffer solution at ph 5 0 the antibiotics were completely eliminated after 6 hours at an initial concentration of lower than 36 0 μm whereas the final removal efficiency decreased to 90 53 when the initial concentration was increased to 105 2 μm these results showed that a higher initial smx concentration led to a decrease in the removal efficiency at the same fna concentration similar degradation characteristics were found for smx degradation by ultraviolet assisted advanced oxidation processes ao and liu 2017 thus the degradation rate was correlated with initial smx concentration 3 2 2 effect of fna on smx elimination as shown in fig 3 the smx concentration did not change during the contrast tests demonstrating that nitrite does not directly react with smx regardless of the smx concentration conversely smx elimination was strongly promoted when the fna concentration was increased from 1 0 mg n l to 5 0 mg n l the removal efficiency was approximately 82 5 after 8 hours at 1 0 mg n l fna and was greater than 99 after 2 hours at 5 0 mg n l fna these results show that fna can react with smx and that the removal efficiency increases with increasing fna concentration thus smx degradation is positively related to the fna concentration which is consistent with previous study that the linear regression between smx removal and fna was demonstrated in the nitrite accumulation environment sun et al 2019 the fna based technique is promising for the enhancing chemical reactions of sulfonamide antibiotics in the nitritation of high concentration ammonium wastewater such as urine landfill leachate and aerobic anaerobic digested sludge 3 2 3 kinetics modeling as mentioned above smx degradation was affected by both the initial smx concentration and the fna concentration thus the overall smx degradation can be expressed as follows 3 d smx dt k s m x a f n a b where a and b represent reaction orders and k represents the smx degradation rate constant xu and long 2013 by calibrating the experimental data using aquasim 2 1 software we obtained the following parameters k 5 71 10 4 μm 1 295h 1 a 0 945 and b 1 35 the degradation rate increased with increasing fna concentration b 1 whereas a high smx concentration reduced the reaction rate a 1 the overall smx degradation was promoted with a total reaction order of 2 295 the kinetics modeling results are presented in fig 2 and fig 3 the reaction order obtained by simulation is similar with the previous study that the abiotic reaction between smx and fna confirmed to second order reaction sun et al 2019 the decrease in the degradation rate at the high smx initial concentration was most likely due to the large number of transformation products generated during the degradation of smx the intermediates can also be oxidized by the consumption of fna leading to a decrease in the smx degradation rate as was noted by sun et al the unstable intermediates of smx undergo numerous consecutive reactions with available oxidants and radicals sun et al 2017 3 3 effect of ph on smx elimination as shown in fig 4 a the final smx concentrations varied under different ph the solution ph significantly influenced smx elimination the final removal efficiency was decreased from 100 to 80 6 when the ph was increased from 2 0 to 4 0 while it was increased to 100 when the ph was increased from 4 0 to 6 0 implying that the final smx removal efficiency was lowest at ph 4 0 by contrast hydrolysis was not observed within this ph range in agreement with previous reports that showed that less than 5 of smx was hydrolyzed at ph 4 0 20 c after one month białk bielińska et al 2012 acid or base catalyzed hydrolysis usually occurs at elevated temperatures of 50 70 c and at temperatures even higher than 100 c saita et al 2018 searles and nukina 1959 graafland et al 1979 providing the necessary activation energy for molecular collisions loftin et al 2008 leffl and grunwald 1963 while the final removal efficiency 100 at 8 h was the same at ph 2 0 3 0 and 6 0 the degradation rates varied the highest degradation rate was observed at ph 2 0 at which complete removal was achieved within 2 hours as shown in fig 4 b the degradation rate constant depended on the solution ph which was decreased by 90 when ph increased from 2 0 to 4 0 based on eq 3 the final smx degradation was described as 4 d smx dt 0 29 e 1 69 p h s m x 0 945 f n a 1 35 the smx degradation rates at different ph were related to the smx molecular states and oxidant efficacy the molecular structure of smx contains two basic groups aniline and heterocyclic base and one acidic group sulfonamide as shown in fig s1 the once protonated cationic form occurring at the aniline amino group was the main species at ph 1 85 pka1 1 85 0 30 the deprotonated anionic form occurring at the sulfonamide group was the main species at ph 5 60 pka2 5 60 0 04 and the neutral form was dominant at ph 4 0 babić et al 2007 ben et al 2017 it was found that under strongly acidic conditions ph 4 0 the cationic species of smx were more reactive with nitrogen intermediates and free radicals such as hydroxyl oh peroxynitrite onoo onooh nitrogen dioxide no2 dinitrogen trioxide n2o3 and nitric oxide radical no jiang et al 2013b hartop et al 2017 oldreive and rice evans 2001 so smx degradation was greatly enhanced at ph 2 0 and 3 0 moreover the anionic species were more reactive than the neutral species toward the oxidants ben et al 2017 wang et al 2010 and electrostatic attraction facilitated the combination of the anionic species and nitrogen cations derived from fna takahama and hirota 2012 so the degradation rate was slightly promoted when the ph was increased from 4 0 to 6 0 luo et al also noted that the apparent degradation rates of sulfonamides at neutral species were lower than those at cationic and anionic species during the hydroxyl radical reaction luo et al 2019 3 4 transformation products identification and reaction pathway inference the chemical structures of the transformation byproducts were tentatively identified based on the ms ms spectra and previous studies the molecular formulae molecular masses and proposed structures of the tps are listed in table s4 the esi full ms spectra of the samples and the ms ms spectra of the detected tps are listed in figs s2 s25 based on the observed products we deduced the possible degradation pathways as shown in fig 5 3 4 1 pathway 1 the identified tps were formed through a cleavage reaction p1 substitution by fna p2 and oxidation by oh radicals p3 the first pathway involved sulfonamide bond hydrolysis resulting in the cleavage of the s n or c s bonds tian et al 2019 due to s n bond cleavage p1 1 tp 173 and tp 98 formed which were confirmed to be 4 amino benzene sulfanilic acid and 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole respectively however no peak matched tp 98 in this study because the m z 100 was not investigated additionally tp 157 and tp 114 also formed cleavage of the s n bond has been commonly observed in smx degradation by various chemical processes liu et al 2017 the identified tp 109 p aminophenol and tp 162 were attributed to c s bond cleavage p1 2 meanwhile tp 178 was identified and the other moiety was assigned as aniline previous studies have also observed the formation of aniline from the cleavage of the c s bond by photolysis or oxidation reactions driven by nitrite free chlorine chlorine dioxide and ferrate sun et al 2017 ben et al 2017 yang et al 2017 bonvin et al 2012 dodd and huang 2004 sharma et al 2006 3 4 2 pathway 2 nitrosubstitution p2 1 and deamination p2 2 occurred on the amino group of aniline to form 4 nitro smx tp 283 and desamino smx tp 238 respectively sun et al 2019 kassotaki et al 2016 for the protonated smx cations protonated amine was more accessible to hno2 which contained lone pair electrons while for the deprotonated smx anions the electron cloud density was shifted to the sulfonamide bond so a nucleophilic attack was likely to occur on the amine of aniline at the two ionic species larson and weber 1994 tp 283 may result from the substitution of the aromatic nh2 by an aromatic no2 nitro and the fragment ion at m z 282 and 138 in the mass spectrum confirmed this product tp 238 as indicated by the presence of the fragment ion at m z 141 was generated by a loss of the nitro group from tp 283 and was also attributed to the substitution of the aromatic nh2 by hydrogen it has been reported that under acidic or reducing environments in which nitrite is present nitrite can be chemically or biologically reduced to nitric oxide no which can react with aromatic amines in smx to form unstable diazonium cations nödler et al 2012 kassotaki et al 2016 mcknight et al 1997 and the diazonium cations undergo numerous consecutive reactions with available nitrite or hydrogen to form tp 283 or tp 238 respectively furthermore cleavage of the n s and c s bonds occurs for tp 283 and tp 238 3 4 3 pathway 3 oh can attack the smx molecule in different positions including the benzene ring p3 1 the amino group on the benzene ring p3 2 and the isoxazole ring p3 3 solar et al found that the main oh radical reaction 54 occurred at the ortho position of aniline while 36 of oh reacted directly with the nh2 group solar et al 1986 thus pathway 3 2 was described below while the others are shown in text s2 in pathway p3 2 due to single electron transfer and n h deprotonation ben et al 2017 huang et al 2001 oh reacted with the amino moiety of smx to form hydroxylamine so tp 269 2 may be a hydroxylated derivative of aniline tp269 2 was oxidized to produce a nitroso derivative tp267 that underwent further hydrolysis to form a nitro smx tp 283 ao et al 2018 then the isoxazole ring of tp 283 was opened by oh to form tp 245 ji et al 2015 finally the cleavage of the s n bond led to tp 203 desulfonation pathway p4 was another minor pathway involved in smx degradation resulting in the formation of tp189 in addition the products speculated to be obtained by the oh reaction were likely partly due to the reaction with the reactive nitrogen species such as peroxynitrite zhang et al 2016 among all of the pathways mentioned above we considered nitrosubstitution and deamination of pathway 2 to be the dominant degradation mechanisms because the relative peak areas of 4 nitro smx tp 283 and desamino smx tp 238 in the ms spectrum were higher than those of the other byproducts it was implied that the vast accumulation of fna related nitrogen intermediates and free radicals would further facilitate antibiotics degradation 3 5 toxicity assessment of transformation products bioluminescence inhibition of smx and its transformation products was monitored to detect acute toxicity growth inhibition was conducted on e coli to test the change of antibacterial activity 3 5 1 acute toxicity analysis of byproducts fig 6 shows the acute toxicity of the transformation products and the parent compound the l l0 ratio reflects the sample end point luminescence relative to the initial luminescence a value below 1 0 indicates that luminescence decreased in the test implying that the compounds inhibited luminescence the variation in the l l0 ratio represents the differences in the extent of the inhibition a smaller l l0 ratio corresponds to higher toxicity the relative luminescence ratios of the different amounts of the parent smx are shown for comparison the parent smx inhibited approximately 25 of the luminescence of v fischeri at 0 12 mm compared with the antibiotic free samples with the decrease in smx corresponding to increased removal efficiency the inhibition effects of the parent smx on v fischeri decreased corresponding to the increase in l l0 the observed toxicity of the samples remaining smx tps remained almost unchanged after the reaction suggesting that the toxicity of the transformation products alone increased because the toxicity of the remaining smx decreased the overall toxicity of the sample at the final point in time was nearly equal to the toxicity of the initial compound due to the cleavage of the sulfonamide bond s n 3 amino 5 methylisoxazole appeared increasing the amount of nh2 groups the nh2 group is known to interact with the flavin mononucleotide which is necessary for the luminescence of v fischeri jablonski and deluca 1978 so these aminated products led to higher acute toxicity 3 5 2 antibacterial activity the antibacterial potentials of the parent and the transformation products were measured using e coli which is a representative bacteria for testing antibacterial properties because the transformation products were complex and it was difficult to investigate the antibacterial activity of the individual products we measured the inhibition effect of a mixing sample of the products and residual parent that may coexist in solution and jointly exert an inhibition effect based on the residual smx concentrations of the samples we diluted the stock antibiotics solutions to the determined values and the antibacterial properties of the parent antibiotics at different concentrations were tested concurrently thus the inhibition ratios of the products were observed by subtracting the inhibition ratio of the parent from that of the mixture the obtained inhibition curves of the transformation products and parent are shown in fig 7 it is important to note that the calculated product inhibition was lower than the inhibition of the remaining parent indicating that a negligible antibacterial property was retained by the transformation products during the reaction because of its structural similarity with para aminobenzoic acid paba smx acts by inhibiting the utilization of bacteria on paba nevertheless the original structure of the sulfanilamide toxicophore sulfonamide group bound to aniline in the para position majewsky et al 2014 was destroyed after hydrolysis substitution deamination and hydroxylation so unlike the parent compound products such as desamino smx did not inhibit bacterial growth overall the antibacterial activity of the transformation products was diminished therefore transformation products exhibited acute toxicity on vibrio fischeri and their antibacterial activity on e coli was diminished due to complex substances and abundant microbes in sewage the ecological effects of degradation products on sewage system and receiving waters should be further assessed by developing integrated modelling approach hong et al 2020 4 conclusions this study provides a comprehensive understanding of fna based elimination of typical antibiotics showing the significant value of having a deep understanding of fna based applications for the treatment of micropollutants the fna based chemical elimination of sulfonamides could be characterized by benzenesulfonamide the reaction was successfully described by d s m x d t k s m x 0 945 f n a 1 35 and the degradation rate constant was exponentially correlated to solution ph k 0 29 e 1 69 p h the cationic species of smx were more reactive to fna related active components based on the products identification we inferred the main transformation pathway was nitro substitution and deamination accompanied by sulfonamide bond s n or c s bonds breakage and radical oxidation toxicity and antibacterial activity tests by vibrio fischeri and e coli showed the transformation products exhibited acute toxicity on vibrio fischeri whereas the antibacterial activity was diminished due to destroy of sulfanilamide toxicophore declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17374,carbonate mineral weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis herein termed coupled carbonate weathering ccw represents a significant carbon sink which is determined by riverine hydrochemical variations the magnitudes variations and mechanisms responsible for the carbon sink produced by ccw are still unclear in this study major ions toc and discharge data at the darongjiang lingqu guilin and yangshuo hydrologic stations in li river basin a karst catchment typical of this geographic region were analysed from january 2012 to december 2015 to elucidate the temporal variations in riverine inorganic and organic carbon and their controlling mechanisms the results show that 1 hco3 was sourced from carbonate weathering and silicate weathering carbonate weathering by carbonic acid being predominant 2 toc was created chiefly by the transformation of bicarbonate to organic carbon by aquatic phototrophs during the non flood period 3 the carbon sink produced by coupled carbonate weathering in the li river basin was calculated to be 14 41 tc km 2 yr 1 comprised of the sink attributable to carbonate weathering 12 17 tc km 2 yr 1 and sink due to the biological carbon pump sbcp 2 24 tc km 2 yr 1 the sbcp thus accounted for approximately 15 54 of the total carbon sink indicating that the proportion of riverine toc sourced by the transformation from bicarbonate to organic carbon by aquatic phototrophs may be high and must be considered in the estimation of carbonate weathering related carbon sinks elsewhere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords karst processes coupled carbonate weathering inorganic and organic carbon carbon sink 1 introduction the chemical composition of river waters provides indications of the weathering of rock and associated co2 consumption biological functions and human activities in their basins gaillardet et al 1999 hindshaw et al 2011 li et al 2011 the ion content is remarkably higher in carbonate terrains than in silicate terrains and dominated by bicarbonate and calcium because of the rapid and sensitive process of carbonate weathering liu and dreybrodt 1997 liu et al 2007 raymond et al 2008 therefore the reaction between carbonate minerals and co2 which increase dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations may impact the carbon cycle and represent a net sink of atmospheric co2 at short time scales martin 2017 in contrast carbonate minerals dissolved by sulfuric and nitric acids may represent an atmospheric sources of co2 with no rapid sink to balance them perrin et al 2008 torres et al 2014 martin 2017 due to the inputs of sulfuric and nitric acids the participation of sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate dissolution was common in karst area li et al 2008 perrin et al 2008 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 li et al 2020 li et al 2021 which are the dominant acids in carbonate weathering should thus be established first in karst basin studies bicarbonate was mainly sourced from carbonate mineral weathering in carbonate terrains and mixed silicate carbonate terrains and can be consumed by aquatic phototrophs and transformed into organic carbon in inland waters liu et al 2011 during the bicarbonate uptake by aquatic phototrophs the hydrochemical characteristics such as hco3 concentration ph dissolved oxygen and carbon isotope of dic changed significantly which has been demonstrated both in laboratory studies liu et al 2010 wu et al 2012 wang et al 2013 in the field in the outflow of springs and subterranean rivers for example zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 and pu et al 2017 and in li river basin zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 such atmospheric co2 uptake by the reaction between carbonate rock and carbonic acid and the resultant bicarbonate transformation into organic carbon by aquatic photosynthesis is termed coupled carbonate weathering ccw liu et al 2018 the balancing of the atmospheric co2 budget is a critical question in research on global climate change at present it is accepted that there is a large residual land sink of 1 8 3 4 pgc a 1 in the global carbon budget melnikov and o neill 2006 lal 2008 ciais et al 2013 le quéré et al 2013 2014 friedlingstein et al 2019 the locations magnitudes variations and controlling mechanisms of this sink need to be more fully understood previous studies show that rock chemical weathering contributes to the atmospheric carbon sink berner et al 1983 liu et al 2010 the contributions of carbonate weathering being greater than 90 liu et al 2018 due to its abundance and comparatively rapid solubility liu et al 2011 the bicarbonate concentration in global rivers ranged from 0 1 to 4 7 mmol l 1 li et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 and global fluxes from rivers to the ocean was 0 211 pgc yr 1 liu et al 2018 based on the ccw model atmospheric co2 uptake by interactions between water carbonate minerals co2 and aquatic phototrophs on land the ccw related carbon sink has been estimated to be as large as 0 5 pgc a 1 liu et al 2018 and thus should be included in global carbon budget calculations ccw related carbon sink estimations should be based on hydrochemical data e g discharge concentrations and sources of the inorganic and organic solutes and suspensions all of which can be strongly impacted by climate by land use changes and other anthropogenic activities liu et al 2010 cao et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 further investigations of the variations mechanisms and accurate estimates of ccw related carbon sinks are needed for river basins with substantial karst rock content this study determines the amounts of bicarbonate transformed organic carbon in the riverine organic carbon and assesses the ccw related carbon sinks based on the sources of inorganic and organic carbon and the discharge through revealing the dynamics of bicarbonate sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid by sulfuric or nitric acid and from silicate weathering over the period from january 2012 to december 2015 at four gauging and sampling stations upstream to downstream along a karst river in southern china the amounts of bicarbonate transformed organic carbon in the riverine organic carbon were determined the ccw related carbon sinks were estimated based on the sources of inorganic and organic carbon and the discharge the analytical results combined with the geological setting will help to improve evaluations of the sources of riverine inorganic and organic carbon and improve our understanding of ccw related carbon sinks 2 methods 2 1 study area the li river basin is a typical karst catchment and located in southwest china fig 1 it is an important tributary of the guijiang river a major tributary of the pearl river as shown in fig 1 the li river basin has a mixture of carbonate and silicate bedrock terrains bare karst areas where the carbonates are fully exposed blue areas in fig 1 and others where they are covered only by quaternary alluvial materials shallow pink areas in fig 1 account for nearly half of the total basin area being especially prominent in the middle and south fig 1 the non karst areas white areas in fig 1 are chiefly silicate rocks sandstones and granite there are no evaporite rocks in the study area the darongjiang dr and lingqu lq hydrological stations are located at the mouths of two main tributaries on the upper li river fig 1 and have catchment areas of 248 and 719 km2 respectively guilin hydrological station gl is in the city of guilin at the middle of the li river and has a catchment area of 2762 km2 yangshuo hydrological station ys is close to the downstream end of the li river in yangshuo county and has a catchment area of 5585 km2 the strata in the study area is sinian to carboniferous cretaceous and quaternary with a small amount of caledonian granite granite is mainly distributed in the cat mountain in the north part of the study area sinian cambrian and ordovician strata are mainly distributed in the northern part of the basin which are mainly clastic rocks with a small amount of carbonate rocks devonian strata are most widely distributed in li river basin mainly locating in the central and southern part of the basin the rongxian formation d3r and donggangling formation d2d in devonian are mainly limestone and dolomite which are the main bare karst distribution areas the lower devonian strata is mainly clastic rocks which are distributed on the east and west sides of the central and southern part of the basin in the middle part in the li river basin limestone strata are covered by quaternary strata in some karst peak forest plain areas which is named the covered karst area as shown in table 1 the percent of karst area bare and covered in the catchments of the four hydrologic stations were calculated from a geologic map and are 48 9 33 and 49 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the strata in non karst area in dr sub basin is mainly cambrian ordovician and lower devonian silicate rocks and caledonian granite in lq sub basin the strata in non karst area is mainly lower devonian silicate rocks for the gl and ys sub basins the strata in non karst area is mainly cambrian and ordovician silicate rock in the north part and lower devonian silicate rock in the south part site dr was located in the cat mountain nature protection area and the upper and middle reaches of the sub basin are dominated by forests while a few villages and farmland are distributed in the lower reaches as shown in fig 1 xing an county is located at the upstream of lq site the gl and ys sites are located in the city of guilin and yangshuo county respectively so the sites lq gl and ys especially site gl are affected more by human activities because the soil is thicker in covered karst areas than in bare karst areas more farmland and constructing land distribute in this area thus lq gl and ys sites are possibly influenced by industrial and agricultural activities aquatic phototrophs such as submerged aquatic plants can often be found along river channels flourishing particularly in the mainstream channel between guilin and yangshuo and in the lingqu tributary 2 2 sampling and analytical approaches water samples were collected at the four hydrological stations one to three times a month from january 2012 to december 2015 temperature ph and specific conductance spc were measured in situ with a multiparameter sensor multi304i wtw germany the resolutions of the temperature ph and spc were 0 1 c 0 01 ph units and 0 1 μs cm 1 respectively alkalinity mainly hco3 was in situ determined by hydrochloric acid titration with an accuracy of 0 1 mg l 1 samples for k na ca2 mg2 were filtered through 0 22 μm membrane filters acidified with ultra purified 6 n hno3 to ph 2 and then determined by icp oes iris intrepid ii xsp thermo fisher scientific usa with an accuracy of 0 1 mg l 1 f cl no3 and so4 2 were measured by ion chromatography 861 advanced compact ic metrohm switzerland with an accuracy of 0 1 mg l 1 toc was determined by total organic carbon analyser multi n c 3100 analytikjena german with an accuracy of 0 1 mg l 1 the average analysis error of cations anions and toc was less than 5 the discharge were obtained from the four national hydrological stations and standardized by the catchment areas discharge per unit area all lab analyses were carried out at the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences 3 results the chemical composition of the water samples is shown in table 2 the averages of the total cation charges tz k na 2ca2 2mg2 at sites lq dr gl and ys were 2297 404 857 257 1555 542 2166 340 μeq l 1 respectively and the averages of the total anion charges tz f cl no3 2so4 2 hco3 were 2341 420 922 249 1601 553 2210 360 μeq l 1 respectively most samples showed a normalized inorganic charge balance nicb of 10 suggesting that the contribution of organic acids and ligands to the charge balance was not significant dalai et al 2002 the mean total dissolved solid tds k na ca2 mg2 f cl no3 so4 2 hco3 of stations lq dr gl and ys were 182 4 32 3 69 8 19 6 122 1 41 9

shows that the hydrochemistry is the hco3 ca type in the li river basin reflecting strong lithological control of the hydrochemistry ca2 dominated the cations being in the mean 87 2 74 3 74 5 and 81 3 of total cation concentration at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the proportions of mg2 and k na in the total cation count were roughly equal fig 2 hco3 was the dominant anion providing 81 5 68 7 70 7 and 81 3 of total anion concentrations in the mean proportions of so4 2 and cl no3 in the total anionic concentration were also roughly equal fig 2 as shown in fig 3 concentrations of all ions decreased in the rainy seasons because of the dilution effects and increased in the dry seasons the composition of the dissolved salts of the world s waters was controlled by three mechanisms atmospheric precipitation rock dominance and the evaporation crystallization process gibbs 1970 as shown in fig 2 the dominance of ca2 and hco3 indicate that carbonate weathering dominates the water chemistry at all sites from plots of the hco3 na versus ca2 na and mg2 na versus ca2 na ratios fig 4 the samples were broadly linearly distributed between simple carbonate and simple silicate weathering end members the samples from sites dr and gl were slightly closer to the silicate end member fig 4 due to the lower percent of carbonate rocks in their basins and high abundances of k na in the river water fig 2 samples from sites lq and ys were closer to the carbonate end member due to the greater proportion of carbonate exposure in their basins fig 4 as previously reported cl is

average of 0 86 which is significantly lower than that of seawater 1 17 bener and berner 1987 silicate weathering is the main source of k and na as established by k na excess calculated as k na cl han and liu 2004 xu and liu 2007 sun et al 2010 the equivalents ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 ranged from 0 96 to 1 72 with an average of 1 18 while ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 ranged from 0 71 to 1 22 with a mean of 0 94 indicating that the carbonate rock weathering is possibly influenced by both carbonic acid and sulfuric nitric acids martin 2017 sun et al 2019 found that sulfuric acid largely sourced from current precipitation and nitric acid from both precipitation and nitrification were both common in the li river hence the chemical reaction of carbonate weathering due to sulfuric nitric acid participation cannot be ignored in the li river the average hco3 was 1890 635 1113 and 1783 μmol l 1 the average toc was 312 117 302 and 253 μmol l 1 and the average of discharge standardized by basin area was 40

mmol l 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the annual averages of toc concentration from 2013 to 2015 were 0 29 0 35 0 10 0 12 0 28 0 32 and 0 22 0 28 mmol l 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the annual averages of discharge standardized by basin area from 2012 to 2015 were 23 31 103 54 44 103 65 63 103 109 06 103 41 74 103 51 00 103 and 39 14 103 62 74 103 m3 s 1 km 2 at

2018 hco3 was the dominant and mainly sourced from chemical weathering of the carbonate and silicate rocks in the study area so carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonic weathering by sulfuric and or nitric acids and silicate weathering were three sources of hco3 as discussed in sun et al 2019 the reactions in li river basin are carbonate weathering by carbonic aicd 0 x 1 1 c a x m g 1 x c

from precipitation and human activity origins the hco3 sourced from silicate weathering hco3 sil was calculated from the na and k concentrations han and liu 2004 xu and liu 2007 sun et al 2010 as discussed above silicate weathering was the main source of k na excess so hco3 sil was calculated from the k na cl concentrations in this study accordingly 5 hc o 3 sil 2 2 k n a c l 6 c a 2 m g 2 sil

subscripts carb and sil for hco3 and ca2 mg2 denote carbonate and silicate origins respectively hco3 carb car and hco3 carb s n denote bicarbonate sourced from reactions of carbonate with carbonic acids and sulfuric nitric acids respectively the proportional sources of hco3 have been calculated from eqs 5 10 as shown in fig 5 the contributions from silicate weathering ranged from 0 to 32 4 with averages of 2 3 14 8 11 5 and 7 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively these accord to the proportions of silicate rocks in the respective basins the remainder of the hco3 came from carbonate weathering which was the dominant source ranging from 67 6 to 100 0 with an average of 91 2 given the participation of sulfuric and nitric acid which are common in the study area the carbonate weathering can be divided into two types weathering by carbonic acid eqs 1 and weathering by sulfuric or nitric acid eqs 2 3 the contribution of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid ranged from 2 1 to 98 7 with average values of 80 9 55 5 59 7 and 78 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the contribution of carbonate weathering by sulfuric nitric acid ranged from 0 3 to 76 9 with averages of 16 8 29 7 28 9 and 14 9 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively fig 5 the average so4 2 no3 hco3 equivalent ratios were 0 19 0 40 0 32 and 0 17 the concentrations of so4 2 and no3 were similar in the four sites but the hco3 concentration was lower at sites dr and gl table 2 so so4 2 no3 hco3 equivalent ratio was higher indicating that the contribution to carbonate weathering from sulfuric nitric acids were significantly higher at these sampling stations the so4 2 no3 hco3 equivalent ratios varied more when the sulfuric and nitric acid concentrations changed in similar proportions because of placing the low hco3 concentration as the denominator table 2 thus the carbonic acid and sulfuric nitric acid effects fluctuated more at the dr and gl sampling sites than at sites lq and ys fig 5 4 2 origin of the toc toc in the li river is impacted by rock weathering photosynthetic activity and fluvial erosion yang et al 2016 sun et al 2007 pointed out that the toc concentrations increased with discharge during floods when relatively more toc came from the allochthonous inputs concentration of toc was positively correlated with discharge if allochthonous organic sources were the dominant input to toc hco3 is the main carbon source for aquatic phototrophs in karst areas mcconnaughey 1998 li et al 2011 lian et al 2011 photosynthesis is more intense and aquatic phototrophs bloom more rapidly when hco3 is higher resulting in toc increase yang et al 2016 the positive correlation of toc concentration with hco3 indicates that autochthonous organic sources were the dominant input to toc when there was no flooding sun et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 b the concentration of toc changed little or decreased slightly with the increase of discharge indicating that the allochthonous inputs had limited effect toc was highest at lq which had the highest hco3 and lowest at dr which had the lowest hco3 as shown in fig 6a toc was positively correlated with hco3 at the four sites because of the higher hco3 and more abundant aquatic phototrophs at lq and ys the correlation coefficients r between hco3 and toc were much higher toc being positively correlated with hco3 at all four sites indicates the dic fertilization effects on the in river primary production thus the toc was chiefly sourced from bicarbonate uptake by aquatic phototrophs in this study 4 3 flux of bicarbonate from different sources as discussed above the bicarbonate was sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonate weathering by sulfuric and or nitric acid and by silicate weathering based on the concentrations of bicarbonate from the different sources computed above and the discharge the bicarbonate fluxes from different sources may be calculated fig 7 11 f sil hc o 3 sil q 12 f carb car hc o 3 carb car q 13 f carb s n hc o 3 carb s n q where subscripts sil carb car and carb s n denote for silicate weathering carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid or nitric acid respectively q denotes discharge standardized by area based on eqs 11 13 the carbon flux depended on hco3 concentration and discharge hco3 was mainly sourced from the weathering of carbonates and silicates so hco3 was a geogenic solute and showed chemostatic responses thompson et al 2011 therefore the concentration of hco3 depended on the geological conditions the proportion of karst area in a basin as shown in fig 8 a at the same discharge standardized by area the hco3 concentration at sites lq and ys were highest followed by site gl and site dr i e concentrations of hco3 increased with the increase of area with karst exposed or shallowly mantled by soil or alluvium as shown in fig 8a the hco3 concentration at each site varied with the discharge in a power function relationship hco3 decreased with the increased discharge because of the dilution effect all four sub basins had mixed carbonate and silicate terrains fig 1 and the concentration of hco3 in the karst areas within them was several times higher than in non karst areas sun et al 2019 because of the spatial inhomogeneity of rainfall upon the karst and non karst areas and the greater retention lower runoff in the former the concentrations of hco3 varied greatly at the same discharge in these four stations on different occasions fig 8a hco3 concentrations varied more greatly and the correlation coefficient between discharge and hco3 were lower at sites gl and ys fig 8a which have the larger basin areas and greater inhomogeneity as shown in fig 7 the variation of discharge was more significant than the variation of hco3 concentrations and the carbon flux was consistent with the discharge due to the large variation in annual mean discharge the annual mean carbon flux also varied greatly from 2012 to 2015 with the maximum being more than twice the minimum table 3 the carbon fluxes from the different sources 2012 2015 are listed in table 3 due to the large annual mean variations in discharge fsi fcarb s n fcarb car also varied greatly during this period the proportion of carbon fluxes with different sources depended on the proportion of hco3 with different sources the percentages of fsi in the total carbon flux were 2 0 15 0 10 2 and 5 7 at sites lq dr gl and ys similar to the contribution of silicate weathering to hco3 discussed above the percentages of fcarb car in the total carbon flux were 78 3 53 0 61 7 and 79 9 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively while percentages of fcarb s n in total carbon flux were 18 8 32 0 28 1 and 14 4 at these sites which is consistent with the contributions of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and sulfuric nitric acids in them 4 4 carbon sink by carbonate weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis both silicate weathering and carbonate weathering involve consumption of co2 which is supplied either directly from the atmosphere or from the soils in these mixed silicate and carbonate terrains liu et al 2010 although the soil co2 comes from the decay of organic matter and not directly from the atmosphere its uptake by weathering decreases the amount that will be released to the atmosphere therefore the uptake of soil co2 by rock weathering must also be regarded as a sink of atmospheric co2 yuan 1997 ludwig et al 1998 liu and zhao 2000 gombert 2002 dupré et al 2003 mortatti and probst 2003 liu et al 2018 qin et al 2020 hco3 which is chiefly sourced from carbonate weathering in the mixed carbonate and silicate terrains is consumed by aquatic phototrophs to form organic carbon liu et al 2010 this process plays an important role in the carbon cycle by means of the so called biological carbon pump bcp longhurst and harrison 1989 sarmiento 1993 passow and carlson 2012 liu et al 2015 and represents a net loss of atmospheric co2 a net carbon sink liu et al 2011 therefore the magnitude of the ccw related carbon sink sccw should be calculated in two parts i carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and ii the bicarbonate transformed into organic carbon by aquatic photosynthesis as shown in eqs 4 all of the hco3 for silicate weathering is derived from atmospheric soil co2 so silicate weathering carbon sink ssi is equal to the flux of hco3 from silicate weathering fsil eqs 14 the ccw related carbon sink sccw includes the sink of carbonate weathering scar and the sink of bcp sbcp as shown in eqs 1 to 3 hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by sulfuric nitric acid is derived only from the carbonates while half of the hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid is derived from atmospheric soil co2 and the remaining half is derived from carbonates therefore scar is equal to half of the flux of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid fcarb car eqs 15 sbcp is the flux of riverine organic carbon derived from the bicarbonate uptake by aquatic phototrophs liu et al 2018 as previous results have shown half of measured toc in the li river basin was sourced from the bicarbonate taken up by aquatic phototrophs sun et al 2019 so sbcp was equal to half of the flux of toc in this study eqs 16 14 s si f sil 15 s car 0 5 f carb car 16 s bcp 0 5 toc q 17 s ccw s car s bcp where ssi scar sbcp and sccw denote the carbon sink from silicate weathering carbon sink from carbonate weathering the biological carbon pump sink and the ccw related carbon sink respectively fsil and fcarb car denote fluxes of bicarbonate sourced from silicate weathering and carbonate weathering by carbonic acid toc denotes the concentration of toc q denotes the river discharges standardized by area as shown in table 3 ssi were 0 43 0 99 1 97 2 83 1 04 2 75 and 1 36 2 70 tc km 2 yr 1 scar were 6 01 13 23 2 55 7 06 4 51 6 36 and 10 05 15 40 tc km 2 yr 1 and sbcp were 1 12 2 93 1 36 2 37 2 30 3 23 and 1 64 3 24 tc km 2 yr 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively controlled by the significant changes in discharge ssi scar and sbcp changed substantially from 2012 to 2015 the ratios of ssi to scar were 7 5 61 2 34 8 and 14 4 at sites lq dr gl and ys in accordance with the proportions of silicate rocks in their catchments sbcp represents approximately 10 2 of the flux of hco3 and 31 5 of scar which was a considerable sink in both the carbonate terrains and the mixed silicate carbonate terrains and should receive more attention in future investigations as shown in eqs 12 15 17 sccw was calculated by discharge hco3 carb car and toc the average concentrations of hco3 and toc are positively correlated with the proportion percentage of karst area affected by the reaction between carbonates and sulfuric acid or nitric acid hco3 carb car differed at different sites that had similar proportions of karst area and concentration of hco3 over different years at a given site fig 5 thus sccw was affected by the three parameters discharge standardized by area proportion of karst area in a basin contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid hence we define discharge as the product of discharge standardized by area and proportion of karst area and discharge as product of discharge standardized by area proportion of karst area and contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid as shown in fig 8b c d ssi had a positive correlation with discharge sbcp with discharge and scar with both discharge and discharge sccw which is the sum of sbcp and scar also had a strong positive correlation with discharge r 0 92 and discharge r 0 93 so we can estimate sccw by discharge proportion of karst area and contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid the karst area proportion is a constant at a given site thus sccw at a site varied with discharge and the contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid which was strongly affected by the inputs of sulfuric and nitric acids finally sccw ranged from 3 90 to 18 65 tc km 2 yr 1 in the four sites yangshuo hydrological station ys is the downstream terminus of the li river basin so the ccw related carbon sink in that basin ranged from 12 20 to 18 65 tc km 2 yr 1 with an average of 14 41 tc km 2 yr 1 these values are similar to those found in the xijing river basin to which the li river contributes 11 06 tc km 2 yr 1 yang et al 2020 as shown in table 3 the ccw related carbon sink in the li river basin included 12 17 tc km 2 yr 1 of scar and 2 24 tc km 2 yr 1 of sbcp 5 conclusions this study focused on temporal variations in riverine inorganic and organic carbon in a typical karst basin the hydrochemistry of the li river displayed significant seasonal variations the concentrations of all ions decreased in the rainy seasons because of the dilution effects and increased in the dry seasons as the study basin was substantially a karst basin the hco3 was derived mainly from the weathering of carbonate rocks and there were positive correlations with the proportions of carbonates in its sampled sub basins hco3 was sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid or nitric acid and from silicate weathering carbonate weathering by carbonic acid was the dominant source of the bicarbonate toc was mainly sourced from processes of in river primary production here the carbon sink produced by coupled carbonate weathering in the li river was estimated from the concentration of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid the toc concentrations and the river discharge the results show that variations in discharge play a dominate role in determining the variations in carbon fluxes the coupled carbonate weathering related carbon sink in the li river basin was calculated to be 14 41 tc km 2 yr 1 which consists of the carbon sink from carbonate weathering 12 17 tc km 2 yr 1 and the sink from the biological carbon pump 2 24 tc km 2 yr 1 the biological carbon pump thus accounted for approximately 15 54 of the total carbon sink and should be considered in estimates of carbonate weathering related carbon sinks elsewhere credit authorship contribution statement ping an sun

17374,carbonate mineral weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis herein termed coupled carbonate weathering ccw represents a significant carbon sink which is determined by riverine hydrochemical variations the magnitudes variations and mechanisms responsible for the carbon sink produced by ccw are still unclear in this study major ions toc and discharge data at the darongjiang lingqu guilin and yangshuo hydrologic stations in li river basin a karst catchment typical of this geographic region were analysed from january 2012 to december 2015 to elucidate the temporal variations in riverine inorganic and organic carbon and their controlling mechanisms the results show that 1 hco3 was sourced from carbonate weathering and silicate weathering carbonate weathering by carbonic acid being predominant 2 toc was created chiefly by the transformation of bicarbonate to organic carbon by aquatic phototrophs during the non flood period 3 the carbon sink produced by coupled carbonate weathering in the li river basin was calculated to be 14 41 tc km 2 yr 1 comprised of the sink attributable to carbonate weathering 12 17 tc km 2 yr 1 and sink due to the biological carbon pump sbcp 2 24 tc km 2 yr 1 the sbcp thus accounted for approximately 15 54 of the total carbon sink indicating that the proportion of riverine toc sourced by the transformation from bicarbonate to organic carbon by aquatic phototrophs may be high and must be considered in the estimation of carbonate weathering related carbon sinks elsewhere graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords karst processes coupled carbonate weathering inorganic and organic carbon carbon sink 1 introduction the chemical composition of river waters provides indications of the weathering of rock and associated co2 consumption biological functions and human activities in their basins gaillardet et al 1999 hindshaw et al 2011 li et al 2011 the ion content is remarkably higher in carbonate terrains than in silicate terrains and dominated by bicarbonate and calcium because of the rapid and sensitive process of carbonate weathering liu and dreybrodt 1997 liu et al 2007 raymond et al 2008 therefore the reaction between carbonate minerals and co2 which increase dissolved inorganic carbon dic concentrations may impact the carbon cycle and represent a net sink of atmospheric co2 at short time scales martin 2017 in contrast carbonate minerals dissolved by sulfuric and nitric acids may represent an atmospheric sources of co2 with no rapid sink to balance them perrin et al 2008 torres et al 2014 martin 2017 due to the inputs of sulfuric and nitric acids the participation of sulfuric and nitric acids in carbonate dissolution was common in karst area li et al 2008 perrin et al 2008 yu et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 li et al 2020 li et al 2021 which are the dominant acids in carbonate weathering should thus be established first in karst basin studies bicarbonate was mainly sourced from carbonate mineral weathering in carbonate terrains and mixed silicate carbonate terrains and can be consumed by aquatic phototrophs and transformed into organic carbon in inland waters liu et al 2011 during the bicarbonate uptake by aquatic phototrophs the hydrochemical characteristics such as hco3 concentration ph dissolved oxygen and carbon isotope of dic changed significantly which has been demonstrated both in laboratory studies liu et al 2010 wu et al 2012 wang et al 2013 in the field in the outflow of springs and subterranean rivers for example zhang et al 2012 chen et al 2014 and pu et al 2017 and in li river basin zhang et al 2017 wang et al 2019 sun et al 2019 such atmospheric co2 uptake by the reaction between carbonate rock and carbonic acid and the resultant bicarbonate transformation into organic carbon by aquatic photosynthesis is termed coupled carbonate weathering ccw liu et al 2018 the balancing of the atmospheric co2 budget is a critical question in research on global climate change at present it is accepted that there is a large residual land sink of 1 8 3 4 pgc a 1 in the global carbon budget melnikov and o neill 2006 lal 2008 ciais et al 2013 le quéré et al 2013 2014 friedlingstein et al 2019 the locations magnitudes variations and controlling mechanisms of this sink need to be more fully understood previous studies show that rock chemical weathering contributes to the atmospheric carbon sink berner et al 1983 liu et al 2010 the contributions of carbonate weathering being greater than 90 liu et al 2018 due to its abundance and comparatively rapid solubility liu et al 2011 the bicarbonate concentration in global rivers ranged from 0 1 to 4 7 mmol l 1 li et al 2019 zhong et al 2020 and global fluxes from rivers to the ocean was 0 211 pgc yr 1 liu et al 2018 based on the ccw model atmospheric co2 uptake by interactions between water carbonate minerals co2 and aquatic phototrophs on land the ccw related carbon sink has been estimated to be as large as 0 5 pgc a 1 liu et al 2018 and thus should be included in global carbon budget calculations ccw related carbon sink estimations should be based on hydrochemical data e g discharge concentrations and sources of the inorganic and organic solutes and suspensions all of which can be strongly impacted by climate by land use changes and other anthropogenic activities liu et al 2010 cao et al 2011 zhang et al 2015 zeng et al 2016 chen et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 further investigations of the variations mechanisms and accurate estimates of ccw related carbon sinks are needed for river basins with substantial karst rock content this study determines the amounts of bicarbonate transformed organic carbon in the riverine organic carbon and assesses the ccw related carbon sinks based on the sources of inorganic and organic carbon and the discharge through revealing the dynamics of bicarbonate sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid by sulfuric or nitric acid and from silicate weathering over the period from january 2012 to december 2015 at four gauging and sampling stations upstream to downstream along a karst river in southern china the amounts of bicarbonate transformed organic carbon in the riverine organic carbon were determined the ccw related carbon sinks were estimated based on the sources of inorganic and organic carbon and the discharge the analytical results combined with the geological setting will help to improve evaluations of the sources of riverine inorganic and organic carbon and improve our understanding of ccw related carbon sinks 2 methods 2 1 study area the li river basin is a typical karst catchment and located in southwest china fig 1 it is an important tributary of the guijiang river a major tributary of the pearl river as shown in fig 1 the li river basin has a mixture of carbonate and silicate bedrock terrains bare karst areas where the carbonates are fully exposed blue areas in fig 1 and others where they are covered only by quaternary alluvial materials shallow pink areas in fig 1 account for nearly half of the total basin area being especially prominent in the middle and south fig 1 the non karst areas white areas in fig 1 are chiefly silicate rocks sandstones and granite there are no evaporite rocks in the study area the darongjiang dr and lingqu lq hydrological stations are located at the mouths of two main tributaries on the upper li river fig 1 and have catchment areas of 248 and 719 km2 respectively guilin hydrological station gl is in the city of guilin at the middle of the li river and has a catchment area of 2762 km2 yangshuo hydrological station ys is close to the downstream end of the li river in yangshuo county and has a catchment area of 5585 km2 the strata in the study area is sinian to carboniferous cretaceous and quaternary with a small amount of caledonian granite granite is mainly distributed in the cat mountain in the north part of the study area sinian cambrian and ordovician strata are mainly distributed in the northern part of the basin which are mainly clastic rocks with a small amount of carbonate rocks devonian strata are most widely distributed in li river basin mainly locating in the central and southern part of the basin the rongxian formation d3r and donggangling formation d2d in devonian are mainly limestone and dolomite which are the main bare karst distribution areas the lower devonian strata is mainly clastic rocks which are distributed on the east and west sides of the central and southern part of the basin in the middle part in the li river basin limestone strata are covered by quaternary strata in some karst peak forest plain areas which is named the covered karst area as shown in table 1 the percent of karst area bare and covered in the catchments of the four hydrologic stations were calculated from a geologic map and are 48 9 33 and 49 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the strata in non karst area in dr sub basin is mainly cambrian ordovician and lower devonian silicate rocks and caledonian granite in lq sub basin the strata in non karst area is mainly lower devonian silicate rocks for the gl and ys sub basins the strata in non karst area is mainly cambrian and ordovician silicate rock in the north part and lower devonian silicate rock in the south part site dr was located in the cat mountain nature protection area and the upper and middle reaches of the sub basin are dominated by forests while a few villages and farmland are distributed in the lower reaches as shown in fig 1 xing an county is located at the upstream of lq site the gl and ys sites are located in the city of guilin and yangshuo county respectively so the sites lq gl and ys especially site gl are affected more by human activities because the soil is thicker in covered karst areas than in bare karst areas more farmland and constructing land distribute in this area thus lq gl and ys sites are possibly influenced by industrial and agricultural activities aquatic phototrophs such as submerged aquatic plants can often be found along river channels flourishing particularly in the mainstream channel between guilin and yangshuo and in the lingqu tributary 2 2 sampling and analytical approaches water samples were collected at the four hydrological stations one to three times a month from january 2012 to december 2015 temperature ph and specific conductance spc were measured in situ with a multiparameter sensor multi304i wtw germany the resolutions of the temperature ph and spc were 0 1 c 0 01 ph units and 0 1

decreased in the rainy seasons because of the dilution effects and increased in the dry seasons the composition of the dissolved salts of the world s waters was controlled by three mechanisms atmospheric precipitation rock dominance and the evaporation crystallization process gibbs 1970 as shown in fig 2 the dominance of ca2 and hco3 indicate that carbonate weathering dominates the water chemistry at all sites from plots of the hco3 na versus ca2 na and mg2 na versus ca2 na ratios fig 4 the samples were broadly linearly distributed between simple carbonate and simple silicate weathering end members the samples from sites dr and gl were slightly closer to the silicate end member fig 4 due to the lower percent of carbonate rocks in their basins and high abundances of k na in the river water fig 2 samples from sites lq and ys were closer to the carbonate end member due to the greater proportion of carbonate exposure in their basins fig 4 as previously reported cl is present only at very low concentrations in the regional rocks and thus must derive mainly from atmospheric inputs négrel et al 1993 roy et al 1999 the cl na ratio ranged from 0 40 to 2 17 with an average of 0 86 which is significantly lower than that of seawater 1 17 bener and berner 1987 silicate weathering is the main source of k and na as established by k na excess calculated as k na cl han and liu 2004 xu and liu 2007 sun et al 2010 the equivalents ratio ca2 mg2 hco3 ranged from 0 96 to 1 72 with an average of 1 18 while ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 no3 ranged from 0 71 to 1 22 with a mean of 0 94 indicating that the carbonate rock weathering is possibly influenced by both carbonic acid and sulfuric nitric acids martin 2017 sun et al 2019 found that sulfuric acid largely sourced from current precipitation and nitric acid from both precipitation and nitrification were both common in the li river hence the chemical reaction of carbonate weathering due to sulfuric nitric acid participation cannot be ignored in the li river the average hco3 was 1890 635 1113 and 1783 μmol l 1 the average toc was 312 117 302 and 253 μmol l 1 and the average of discharge standardized by basin area was 40

mmol l 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the annual averages of toc concentration from 2013 to 2015 were 0 29 0 35 0 10 0 12 0 28 0 32 and 0 22 0 28 mmol l 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the annual averages of discharge standardized by basin area from 2012 to 2015 were 23 31 103 54 44 103 65 63 103 109 06 103 41 74 103 51 00 103 and 39 14 103 62 74 103 m3 s 1 km 2 at

2018 hco3 was the dominant and mainly sourced from chemical weathering of the carbonate and silicate rocks in the study area so carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonic weathering by sulfuric and or nitric acids and silicate weathering were three sources of hco3 as discussed in sun et al 2019 the reactions in li river basin are carbonate weathering by carbonic aicd 0 x 1 1 c a x m g 1 x c

from precipitation and human activity origins the hco3 sourced from silicate weathering hco3 sil was calculated from the na and k concentrations han and liu 2004 xu and liu 2007 sun et al 2010 as discussed above silicate weathering was the main source of k na excess so hco3 sil was calculated from the k na cl concentrations in this study accordingly 5 hc o 3 sil 2 2 k n a c l 6 c a 2 m g 2 sil

subscripts carb and sil for hco3 and ca2 mg2 denote carbonate and silicate origins respectively hco3 carb car and hco3 carb s n denote bicarbonate sourced from reactions of carbonate with carbonic acids and sulfuric nitric acids respectively the proportional sources of hco3 have been calculated from eqs 5 10 as shown in fig 5 the contributions from silicate weathering ranged from 0 to 32 4 with averages of 2 3 14 8 11 5 and 7 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively these accord to the proportions of silicate rocks in the respective basins the remainder of the hco3 came from carbonate weathering which was the dominant source ranging from 67 6 to 100 0 with an average of 91 2 given the participation of sulfuric and nitric acid which are common in the study area the carbonate weathering can be divided into two types weathering by carbonic acid eqs 1 and weathering by sulfuric or nitric acid eqs 2 3 the contribution of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid ranged from 2 1 to 98 7 with average values of 80 9 55 5 59 7 and 78 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively the contribution of carbonate weathering by sulfuric nitric acid ranged from 0 3 to 76 9 with averages of 16 8 29 7 28 9 and 14 9 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively fig 5 the average so4 2 no3 hco3 equivalent ratios were 0 19 0 40 0 32 and 0 17 the concentrations of so4 2 and no3 were similar in the four sites but the hco3 concentration was lower at sites dr and gl table 2 so so4 2 no3 hco3 equivalent ratio was higher indicating that the contribution to carbonate weathering from sulfuric nitric acids were significantly higher at these sampling stations the so4 2 no3 hco3 equivalent ratios varied more when the sulfuric and nitric acid concentrations changed in similar proportions because of placing the low hco3 concentration as the denominator table 2 thus the carbonic acid and sulfuric nitric acid effects fluctuated more at the dr and gl sampling sites than at sites lq and ys fig 5 4 2 origin of the toc toc in the li river is impacted by rock weathering photosynthetic activity and fluvial erosion yang et al 2016 sun et al 2007 pointed out that the toc concentrations increased with discharge during floods when relatively more toc came from the allochthonous inputs concentration of toc was positively correlated with discharge if allochthonous organic sources were the dominant input to toc hco3 is the main carbon source for aquatic phototrophs in karst areas mcconnaughey 1998 li et al 2011 lian et al 2011 photosynthesis is more intense and aquatic phototrophs bloom more rapidly when hco3 is higher resulting in toc increase yang et al 2016 the positive correlation of toc concentration with hco3 indicates that autochthonous organic sources were the dominant input to toc when there was no flooding sun et al 2019 as shown in fig 6 b the concentration of toc changed little or decreased slightly with the increase of discharge indicating that the allochthonous inputs had limited effect toc was highest at lq which had the highest hco3 and lowest at dr which had the lowest hco3 as shown in fig 6a toc was positively correlated with hco3 at the four sites because of the higher hco3 and more abundant aquatic phototrophs at lq and ys the correlation coefficients r between hco3 and toc were much higher toc being positively correlated with hco3 at all four sites indicates the dic fertilization effects on the in river primary production thus the toc was chiefly sourced from bicarbonate uptake by aquatic phototrophs in this study 4 3 flux of bicarbonate from different sources as discussed above the bicarbonate was sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonate weathering by sulfuric and or nitric acid and by silicate weathering based on the concentrations of bicarbonate from the different sources computed above and the discharge the bicarbonate fluxes from different sources may be calculated fig 7 11 f sil hc o 3 sil q 12 f carb car hc o 3 carb car q 13 f carb s n hc o 3 carb s n q where subscripts sil carb car and carb s n denote for silicate weathering carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid or nitric acid respectively q denotes discharge standardized by area based on eqs 11 13 the carbon flux depended on hco3 concentration and discharge hco3 was mainly sourced from the weathering of carbonates and silicates so hco3 was a geogenic solute and showed chemostatic responses thompson et al 2011 therefore the concentration of hco3 depended on the geological conditions the proportion of karst area in a basin as shown in fig 8 a at the same discharge standardized by area the hco3 concentration at sites lq and ys were highest followed by site gl and site dr i e concentrations of hco3 increased with the increase of area with karst exposed or shallowly mantled by soil or alluvium as shown in fig 8a the hco3 concentration at each site varied with the discharge in a power function relationship hco3 decreased with the increased discharge because of the dilution effect all four sub basins had mixed carbonate and silicate terrains fig 1 and the concentration of hco3 in the karst areas within them was several times higher than in non karst areas sun et al 2019 because of the spatial inhomogeneity of rainfall upon the karst and non karst areas and the greater retention lower runoff in the former the concentrations of hco3 varied greatly at the same discharge in these four stations on different occasions fig 8a hco3 concentrations varied more greatly and the correlation coefficient between discharge and hco3 were lower at sites gl and ys fig 8a which have the larger basin areas and greater inhomogeneity as shown in fig 7 the variation of discharge was more significant than the variation of hco3 concentrations and the carbon flux was consistent with the discharge due to the large variation in annual mean discharge the annual mean carbon flux also varied greatly from 2012 to 2015 with the maximum being more than twice the minimum table 3 the carbon fluxes from the different sources 2012 2015 are listed in table 3 due to the large annual mean variations in discharge fsi fcarb s n fcarb car also varied greatly during this period the proportion of carbon fluxes with different sources depended on the proportion of hco3 with different sources the percentages of fsi in the total carbon flux were 2 0 15 0 10 2 and 5 7 at sites lq dr gl and ys similar to the contribution of silicate weathering to hco3 discussed above the percentages of fcarb car in the total carbon flux were 78 3 53 0 61 7 and 79 9 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively while percentages of fcarb s n in total carbon flux were 18 8 32 0 28 1 and 14 4 at these sites which is consistent with the contributions of carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and sulfuric nitric acids in them 4 4 carbon sink by carbonate weathering coupled with aquatic photosynthesis both silicate weathering and carbonate weathering involve consumption of co2 which is supplied either directly from the atmosphere or from the soils in these mixed silicate and carbonate terrains liu et al 2010 although the soil co2 comes from the decay of organic matter and not directly from the atmosphere its uptake by weathering decreases the amount that will be released to the atmosphere therefore the uptake of soil co2 by rock weathering must also be regarded as a sink of atmospheric co2 yuan 1997 ludwig et al 1998 liu and zhao 2000 gombert 2002 dupré et al 2003 mortatti and probst 2003 liu et al 2018 qin et al 2020 hco3 which is chiefly sourced from carbonate weathering in the mixed carbonate and silicate terrains is consumed by aquatic phototrophs to form organic carbon liu et al 2010 this process plays an important role in the carbon cycle by means of the so called biological carbon pump bcp longhurst and harrison 1989 sarmiento 1993 passow and carlson 2012 liu et al 2015 and represents a net loss of atmospheric co2 a net carbon sink liu et al 2011 therefore the magnitude of the ccw related carbon sink sccw should be calculated in two parts i carbonate weathering by carbonic acid and ii the bicarbonate transformed into organic carbon by aquatic photosynthesis as shown in eqs 4 all of the hco3 for silicate weathering is derived from atmospheric soil co2 so silicate weathering carbon sink ssi is equal to the flux of hco3 from silicate weathering fsil eqs 14 the ccw related carbon sink sccw includes the sink of carbonate weathering scar and the sink of bcp sbcp as shown in eqs 1 to 3 hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by sulfuric nitric acid is derived only from the carbonates while half of the hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid is derived from atmospheric soil co2 and the remaining half is derived from carbonates therefore scar is equal to half of the flux of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid fcarb car eqs 15 sbcp is the flux of riverine organic carbon derived from the bicarbonate uptake by aquatic phototrophs liu et al 2018 as previous results have shown half of measured toc in the li river basin was sourced from the bicarbonate taken up by aquatic phototrophs sun et al 2019 so sbcp was equal to half of the flux of toc in this study eqs 16 14 s si f sil 15 s car 0 5 f carb car 16 s bcp 0 5 toc q 17 s ccw s car s bcp where ssi scar sbcp and sccw denote the carbon sink from silicate weathering carbon sink from carbonate weathering the biological carbon pump sink and the ccw related carbon sink respectively fsil and fcarb car denote fluxes of bicarbonate sourced from silicate weathering and carbonate weathering by carbonic acid toc denotes the concentration of toc q denotes the river discharges standardized by area as shown in table 3 ssi were 0 43 0 99 1 97 2 83 1 04 2 75 and 1 36 2 70 tc km 2 yr 1 scar were 6 01 13 23 2 55 7 06 4 51 6 36 and 10 05 15 40 tc km 2 yr 1 and sbcp were 1 12 2 93 1 36 2 37 2 30 3 23 and 1 64 3 24 tc km 2 yr 1 at sites lq dr gl and ys respectively controlled by the significant changes in discharge ssi scar and sbcp changed substantially from 2012 to 2015 the ratios of ssi to scar were 7 5 61 2 34 8 and 14 4 at sites lq dr gl and ys in accordance with the proportions of silicate rocks in their catchments sbcp represents approximately 10 2 of the flux of hco3 and 31 5 of scar which was a considerable sink in both the carbonate terrains and the mixed silicate carbonate terrains and should receive more attention in future investigations as shown in eqs 12 15 17 sccw was calculated by discharge hco3 carb car and toc the average concentrations of hco3 and toc are positively correlated with the proportion percentage of karst area affected by the reaction between carbonates and sulfuric acid or nitric acid hco3 carb car differed at different sites that had similar proportions of karst area and concentration of hco3 over different years at a given site fig 5 thus sccw was affected by the three parameters discharge standardized by area proportion of karst area in a basin contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid hence we define discharge as the product of discharge standardized by area and proportion of karst area and discharge as product of discharge standardized by area proportion of karst area and contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid as shown in fig 8b c d ssi had a positive correlation with discharge sbcp with discharge and scar with both discharge and discharge sccw which is the sum of sbcp and scar also had a strong positive correlation with discharge r 0 92 and discharge r 0 93 so we can estimate sccw by discharge proportion of karst area and contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid the karst area proportion is a constant at a given site thus sccw at a site varied with discharge and the contribution of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid which was strongly affected by the inputs of sulfuric and nitric acids finally sccw ranged from 3 90 to 18 65 tc km 2 yr 1 in the four sites yangshuo hydrological station ys is the downstream terminus of the li river basin so the ccw related carbon sink in that basin ranged from 12 20 to 18 65 tc km 2 yr 1 with an average of 14 41 tc km 2 yr 1 these values are similar to those found in the xijing river basin to which the li river contributes 11 06 tc km 2 yr 1 yang et al 2020 as shown in table 3 the ccw related carbon sink in the li river basin included 12 17 tc km 2 yr 1 of scar and 2 24 tc km 2 yr 1 of sbcp 5 conclusions this study focused on temporal variations in riverine inorganic and organic carbon in a typical karst basin the hydrochemistry of the li river displayed significant seasonal variations the concentrations of all ions decreased in the rainy seasons because of the dilution effects and increased in the dry seasons as the study basin was substantially a karst basin the hco3 was derived mainly from the weathering of carbonate rocks and there were positive correlations with the proportions of carbonates in its sampled sub basins hco3 was sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid or nitric acid and from silicate weathering carbonate weathering by carbonic acid was the dominant source of the bicarbonate toc was mainly sourced from processes of in river primary production here the carbon sink produced by coupled carbonate weathering in the li river was estimated from the concentration of hco3 sourced from carbonate weathering by carbonic acid the toc concentrations and the river discharge the results show that variations in discharge play a dominate role in determining the variations in carbon fluxes the coupled carbonate weathering related carbon sink in the li river basin was calculated to be 14 41 tc km 2 yr 1 which consists of the carbon sink from carbonate weathering 12 17 tc km 2 yr 1 and the sink from the biological carbon pump 2 24 tc km 2 yr 1 the biological carbon pump thus accounted for approximately 15 54 of the total carbon sink and should be considered in estimates of carbonate weathering related carbon sinks elsewhere credit authorship contribution statement ping an sun
