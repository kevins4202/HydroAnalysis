23440,offshore drilling with ultra long drill strings i e longer than 10 000 m creates a new class of technical challenges such as dynamic variation of weight on bit wob this article investigates observational data obtained from a drilling program conducted by the scientific drilling vessel chikyu using an 8000 m drill string which is first of their kind to be recorded the data exhibited longitudinal oscillation of the drill pipe at frequencies higher than that of heave motion to identify the cause of such oscillation one dimensional dynamic simulation to model drill string s behavior was carried out the key component of this model is the detailed modeling of the heave compensator numerical experiments revealed that longitudinal natural vibration was excited in the ultra long drill pipe and the excitation modes corresponded to the behavior of a string with both ends fixed indicating the possible influence of friction in the heave compensator we named this class of phenomena compensator induced vibration civ in addition longitudinal elasticity leads to divergence of the tension variation near surface and downhole wob which calls for the need to directly measure the downhole wob behavior keywords ultra long drill string compensator induced vibration civ heave compensator longitudinal natural vibration friction 1 introduction offshore drilling activities are important in both the commercial and scientific fields currently there is oil and gas exploration in the pre salt regions off brazil reaching depths of 5000 7000 m and some giant petroleum fields e g the tiber field in the gulf of mexico have been discovered at depths greater than 10 000 m railsback 2013 the scope and range of offshore drilling activities continue to advance for instance the international ocean discovery program iodp is attempting deeper drilling to recover data for sub seafloor environment monitoring tobin and kinoshita 2006 their ultimate goal is to reach the mantle which will require more than 7000 m of sea floor drilling at an over water depth of 4000 m illuminating earth s past 2011 chikyu 2013 drilling with ultra long drill pipes i e drill pipes longer than 10 000 m raises a suite of new technical problems one such challenge is the integrity of such pipes with the increasing length and weight of the drill strings requiring larger static axial strength in the drill pipe offshore drilling operations are also confronted with dynamic load variations arising from the suspension of the drill pipe from a floating body on a free surface as the drill string length increases the natural frequency of axial vibration gets closer to that of heave period range which is typically longer than 8 s for large drill ships under such conditions the heave motion may excite additional oscillations in the drill string previous studies have developed analytical model of long riserless drill string to estimate natural periods of longitudinal vibration niedzwecki and thampi 1988a niedzwecki and thampi 1988b they studied the eigen solutions for 27 000 ft 8 230 m drill string with various hydrodynamic approximation and its impact on the natural period although their study was comprehensive the analytical model is for free hanging conditions and do not consider the stick slip motion of the heave compensator to account for such load variation it will be necessary to develop a better understanding of ultra long drill string dynamic behavior inoue et al 2012 heave compensation hc is a common and traditional technique for mitigating the potential influence of heave on the drill string woodall mason tilbeet al 1976 if the drill string is directly exposed to the vessel s heave motion the variation in axial load may cause serious damage to the string both passive and active hc technologies to reduce the impact of heave motion during drilling have been investigated woodacre et al 2015 for instance hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 produced a detailed explanation of a passive drill string compensator in which the dynamic behavior was decomposed into heave motion hc and drill string response in their analysis the heave compensator performance is critical in discussing the dynamic behavior of the drill string in addition hatleskog and dunnigan 2006 concludes through field experience and simulation that a passive compensator can be no more than roughly 80 effective in this study we were privileged to gain access to data on the actual behavior of ultra long drill strings obtained during ultradeep water drilling programs conducted by the scientific drilling vessel chikyu owned by jamstec these drilling observation data from a depth of 8000 m are the first of their kind to be recorded inoue et al 2014 and represent actual observations of the types of technical problems discussed in the literature the purpose of this paper is to use data analysis and dynamic simulation to determine the dynamic behavior of ultra long drill strings in section 2 we elaborate on the configuration of a drill string used in offshore drilling while focusing on the heave compensator data analysis of the chikyu drilling program is provided in section 3 and we develop a dynamic simulation to understand the observed phenomena in section 4 in section 5 we discuss the issue of load variation and end with a conclusion in section 6 the main contribution of this paper is to provide a clarification of the excitation mechanism for high frequency vibration of drill pipes observed during ultradeep water drilling dynamic simulation of drill string behavior reveals that such vibrations are the result of natural frequency excitation in the long drill pipe the excited vibrational modes correspond to the behavior of a string with both ends fixed indicating the potential influence of friction in the heave compensator we have named this class of phenomena compensator induced vibration civ 2 about the chikyu offshore drilling system 2 1 specifics of chikyu the scientific deep sea drilling vessel chikyu which is owned by jamstec has the capability of drilling to a 10 000 m depth and is designed to drill with and without drilling risers starting with its first scientific drilling under the direction of the international integrated ocean drilling program iodp at the nankai trough in 2007 it has engaged in many ultradeep water drilling programs inoue et al 2012 2 2 overview of the drilling system fig 1 shows a schematic of the chikyu offshore drilling system the heave compensator is mounted on the derrick while the traveling block and power swivel are suspended from the heave compensator with wire rope the wire rope is connected to a draw works from which it is reeled to raise and lower the drilling assembly not depicted a power swivel holds and rotates the drill string which comprises a drill pipe and a bottom hole assembly containing drill collars a stabilizer and a drill bit during drilling most of the total weight of the drill string is supported by the vessel with the remaining weight compensated by the normal force from the seabed this normal force which is called the weight on bit wob provides the essential force for drilling to ensure efficient drilling and maintain the integrity of the drill pipe it is important to maintain a constant wob within a certain range 2 3 heave compensator because the vessel is exposed to wave induced heave motion the distance between the seabed and vessel is not constant considering the stiffness of seabed the motion of the drill string must be strongly constrained therefore the main purpose of hc is to mitigate the relative displacement between the vessel and the top position of the drill string this is accomplished via a spring like mechanism that can be employed through either passive or active compensation systems an overall review of heave compensator mechanisms can be found in the literature woodacre et al 2015 herein we focus on the crown mount compensator cmc produced by national oilwell varco nov that is equipped in chikyu the cmc is a passive compensation system that comprises a crown block a compensator cylinder and a sheave link system which are described below and modeled later on in this paper chikyu also has an active heave compensation ahc system that was not used during the drilling program assessed in this paper and is therefore beyond the present scope previous analysis of the performance of the passive heave compensator on chikyu based on observational data led to the suggestion that further investigation of the dynamic tension behavior is necessary inoue et al 2012 this is addressed in this paper through an in depth analysis of the hc behavior the crown block cb is the main body of the cmc that supports the weight of the drill string the cb is not fixed to the drilling vessel but is instead connected to the ship through the compensator cylinder and sheave link system during hc the relative position of the cb and the vessel denoted from here on as the cb position changes to compensate for the heave motion the strike range of the cb position is from 3 8 to 3 8 m around the mid stroke point at the equilibrium position the forces produced by the compensator cylinder and sheave link system statically support the weight of the cb and drill string our main interest is dynamic load variation for which deviation from the equilibrium force is important and therefore the equilibrium condition is treated as the origin the forces from the two supporting mechanisms are dependent on the cb position and both mechanisms have non linear behavior the dynamical details of each system are given below several variables are defined here to present a simplified picture of drill string dynamics the same configuration will be used again in the data analysis in section 3 the vertical displacement of the mth component is z m and the equilibrium position of each component is set to z m 0 where a positive value of z represents upward displacement the first component is that of the drilling vessel for which z 1 is the heave displacement z 2 represents the cb displacement from origin the cb position is defined as z 2 z 1 displacement of the drill string is then expressed using z 3 z 4 2 3 1 compensator cylinder a two compensator cylinder connects the vessel to the cb the cylinder is fixed to the vessel and the piston rod is fixed to the cb with the pressure in the cylinder kept high to support the cb the cylinder is further connected through accumulators to air pressure vessels apvs containing compressed air chikyu has 11 apvs each of 1 6 m 3 volume the number of apvs connected to each cylinder can be changed depending on the operational situation the piston stroke action produces variability between the relative displacement of the cb and the vessel s heave motion as the volume of the cylinder changes with the piston displacement the pressure force behaves as a pneumatic spring for example when the cb moves upwards an increase in the cylinder volume causes the pressure to decrease compensation for heave motion modifies the pressure required to support the cb which in turn results in load variation on the drill string in the isothermal and adiabatic conditions p v and p v k respectively are constant k depends on the polytropic curve and is set here to k 1 33 based on the results of a previous study azpiazu et al 1983 the volume of interest v is the total volume of the connected apvs pipework and the cylinder itself thus the number of apvs connected to the cylinder affects the pneumatic spring s performance 1 p v k c o n s t where 2 v v a p v s v p i p e w o r k v c y l i n d e r each cylinder experiences several frictional and damping forces the friction of a cylinder is in turn a combination of forces including coulomb friction which is proportional to the pressure level viscous friction which is proportional to the relative velocity of motion and stribeck friction which is important at low velocity each cylinder has two seals grips one for the piston and another for the gland seal in such seals coulomb friction i e seal friction is known to be dominant hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 haaø et al 2012 and korde 1998 for cylinder type compensators static friction were too large for the load to overcome easily and suffered from the problem of cylinder stick kidera 1983 the seal grips incur a stick slip friction of f s f which can be modeled in a simplified manner as follows 3 f s f μ 2 s i g n z 2 z 1 cylinder motion is resisted by a combination of seal and other frictional sources in cases of relative motion between the cb and the vessel the frictional force can be simply assumed to be proportional to the relative velocity and we denote the overall friction as f f r which is expressed as follows 4 f f r c 2 z 2 z 1 the model used here assumes linear friction although this is commonly done in the interest of model simplicity care should be taken to ensure accuracy do and pan 2008 2 3 2 linkage sheave system although relative motion is compensated by the cylinder the resulting load variation can be troublesome for the drilling operation the linkage sheave system is therefore introduced to reduce the load variation during the strike motion by maintaining a more stable wob the linkage sheave system comprises a wire and a pair of sheave links as shown in fig 2 inoue et al 2012 one end of the system is attached to a draw works while the other end is fixed to the deadline anchor the tension in the wire which is connected to the traveling block suspends the entire weight of drill string thus at z 2 0 the tension is proportional to the hook load the arm is connected to the cb and moves with its striking motion the changing geometry of the linkage sheave system modifies the vertical force applied to the cb the vertical force from the linkage sheave system to the cb can be estimated from the static equilibrium of forces as constrained by the geometry of the system senga 2016 the distinctive feature of the sheave system is that its force variations oppose those of the cylinder when the cb moves upwards the sheave system s upward force increases this positive feedback which corresponds to a negative spring coefficient compensates the load variation caused by the cylinder 2 3 3 overall behavior fig 3 shows the relation between the cb position and the total force on the cb from the cylinder and sheave link system for different configurations of the cmc for example panel a shows the mid stroke initial position i e x 0 0 and a p v n u m 11 it is seen that the load variation is strongly non linear and remains insignificant compared to that in a normal linear spring however when n a p v decreases the total force does not balance and the force from the cylinder begins to dominate n a p v 2 in fig 3 b and n a p v 6 in fig 3 c in this condition the cmc behavior is close to that of a pneumatic spring poor hc performance as the result of load variation in a small number of apvs was shown previously in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 during actual operation under harsh offshore conditions a large heave motion makes it very difficult to set the equilibrium point at mid stroke fig 3 d illustrates a case in which the initial position is not adjusted to mid stroke but rather set at 1 m below the mid stroke position although the difference between forces is not large in this case actual cmc behavior could differ significantly as a result of non linearity a major obstacle to fully understanding hc performance is the presence of unknown values such as frictional forces and damping coefficients which are critical to the heave compensator performance furthermore factors such as friction are prone to deterioration over time of operation thus the effective use of a passive heave compensator with or without concurrent use of an ahc requires a thorough understanding of each component 2 4 drill pipe a unique approach in this study is the dynamic analysis of a drill pipe s longitudinal elasticity which will be addressed later in this paper a long drill pipe is assembled by connecting many 9 m long drill pipes as the weight of the drill string is almost entirely supported by top tension most of the drill pipe will be exposed to tensile load with compressive load appearing only near the bottom as the dimensions of the drill pipe are determined based on the drill string weight and load the configuration of the drill pipe will depend on the specific requirements of the drilling program a schematic of a drill pipe is shown in fig 4 petroleum and natural gas industries 2000 the tool joints t j hereafter and upsets at both ends of the pipe have increased thicknesses to ensure integrity at the connection points the physical properties guaranteed length and weight of each drill pipe are provided by the supplier as catalog values the stiffness k of a drill pipe is calculated from its material modulus e the cross sectional area a and the length of the drill pipe l to reflect the increased cross sectional area for the t j and upsets the axial stiffness of each drill pipe is given as 5 the drill pipes are connected in series which corresponds to increasing l and reducing k the drill pipe walls are manufactured with some redundancy in terms of thickness to compensate for production tolerance private communication with tenarisnkktubes in addition drill pipes are prone to wear during drilling which reduces their weight and thickness such variations in dimension cannot be considered within the scope of this study but they represent possible sources of uncertainty 5 1 k 0 1 e a n o m i n a l l n o m i n a l 1 e a u p s e t l u p s e t 1 e a t j l t j 2 5 bottom hole assembly the bottom hole assembly bha comprises a drill collar stabilizer and drill bit the drill collar has an increased diameter to resist the compression load the drill bit is the interface between the drill string and seabed and the combined force of the drill bit rotation and the wob makes drilling possible the wob is an important indicator of drilling performance and its steady control is desirable although the actual wob acting on the bit should be measured in the downhole it is difficult to place sensors there while there have been some attempts to measure downhole wob including the use of logging while drilling lwd inoue et al 2011 the sampling rates have proven to be too low in actual measurements the wob is calculated from the difference between the total weight of the drill string and the hook load the hook load is measured using load pins on the traveling block as this measurement occurs near the top of the drill string load variation along the string is not considered we call the wob measured at the surface the top tension to distinguish it from the downhole wob the limitations in sensor collocation ability arising from the discrepancy between top tension and downhole wob underlines the importance of the use of simulation in studies 3 analysis of observed data a unique contribution of this paper is the insight it provides from the data obtained during ultradeep water drilling activities we used data obtained from chikyu s drilling control and instrumentation system dcis which gathers information for use in drilling operations inoue et al 2012 in this section we analyze measurement data taken during two drilling programs at depths of around 4000 and 8000 m respectively a description of the drilling program and the analysis results are provided in this section 3 1 description of drilling program the data sets obtained during two ultradeep water drilling programs conducted by chikyu were provided by jamstec the first set taken from a drilling program in the nankai trough conducted in 2012 was obtained with a total drill string length of about 4 000 m at a 1 967 5 m water depth 2 005 5 m below the seabed the sea state was moderate during the drilling program hereafter we will refer to this case as the 4 000 m case the second drilling program named jfast inoue et al 2014 took place in ultradeep water near japan in 2012 jfast involved an urgent operation to monitor the geothermal temperature after a major earthquake the total drill string length was about 8 000 m at a 6 918 0 m water depth 844 5 m below the seabed the sea state was very calm during this drilling program as mentioned previously this program acquired the deepest core obtained to date hereafter we will refer this case as the 8 000 m case chikyu has a good dps dynamic positioning system to maintain its horizontal position during drilling murata et al 2005 so the possible impact of currents on the drilling system would be through the drill string vibration i e viv current data is observed at a sampling rate of 5 min at chikyu although the high frequency fluctuation of currents are not observed we can address the possibility of viv occurrence on drill strings 4000 m case is riser drilling and the drill pipe has no direct effect from the current no riser viv was observed during this drilling operation and the effect of current is negligible for 8000 m the maximum surface current was weak less than 1 kt inoue et al 2014 previous study on chikyu kitada et al 2011 mentions drill pipe viv are well suppressed when less than 1 kt we believe the influence from current are negligible in both conditions monitored data include the surface measured wob hook position heave hook load drilling depth etc the output sampling rate was 1 h z although the system actually employed a higher internal sampling rate details of the measurement data taken by chikyu are given by inoue et al 2009 3 2 analysis of the 4000 m case the configuration of the drill string in the 4000 m case is given in table 1 fig 5 shows the observed time series of the vessel s heave motion and the wob both oscillate with a similar behavior but with opposite phase suggesting that the relation between heave motion and wob can be roughly estimated using linear spring behavior in which a downward heave motion compresses the drill string to strengthen the wob by contrast the behavior of cb is non smooth despite the continuous variation of vessel heave motion the cb position remains constant over a specific time window as depicted in fig 6 this indicates that hc performance was absent in the cmc during this time even though the heave motion itself was relatively small as mentioned in section 2 the cmc is subject to several frictional forces the influence of which are clearly shown in these results 3 3 analysis of the 8000 m case the configuration of the drill string in the 8000 m case is given in table 2 fig 7 shows the observed time series of the vessel s heave motion and wob the result is clearly different from that in the 4000 m case the wob shows high frequency oscillation that is not seen in the heave motion fft analysis reveals that the high frequency oscillation has a frequency of around see fig 8 0 35 h z as the heave motion does not show a strong signal in such frequency bands we assume that some natural frequency mode has been excited in this case the movement of the cb position is also very weak in this case the drilling operation was conducted under a moderate wave condition and the heave motion was very small thus friction seems to dominate the behavior of the cmc in this case several questions arise from the observational data discussed above e g what is the cause and mechanism underlying the high frequency mode oscillation is the behavior of the downhole wob affected by such oscillation what is the impact of such oscillation on the drill string integrity and how can it be reduced the goal of the remainder of this paper is to answer these outstanding questions 4 dynamic simulation of drill string 4 1 lumped mass model configuration to simplify computation we developed a one degree of freedom lumped mass model with the only dimension in the vertical direction the main difference between this model and other dynamic simulation models such as hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 is in how the drill string itself is decomposed although this approach is highly simplified its use here is crucial in considering the axial load variation throughout the drill pipe we consider the dynamics of the longitudinal elastic behavior to be dominant in determining the high frequency oscillation thus in our model the horizontal displacement of drill pipes is neglected although bending by ocean currents or vortex induced vibrations viv can cause such horizontal displacement we assumed these to be negligible in the cases studied here our lumped mass model focuses on the vertical behavior from ship to the bottom end of the drill string see fig 9 the upper end of the model is the vessel where the heave motion is input the vessel is connected to the crown block through the heave compensator where the behavior of the cylinder and the sheave link system are modeled as a non linear spring and damper the traveling block and power swivel are considered to be a single large component that moves together with the crown block and is connected to the drill pipe which is segmented into elements of constant length the drill pipe is followed by the bha which is also segmented finally the bottom of the bha contacts the sea bed the drill string is configured as a drill pipe with several dimensions segmentation is applied only to drill pipes with the same dimension for each element the mass and stiffness are calculated from the element length l the material density ρ the material modulus e and the cross sectional area a the drill collar is treated similarly the stiffness of the sea bed can vary widely for example from 500 to 5000 k n m hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 depending on the formation the damping coefficient is estimated in terms of the critical damping value with the parameter ε constants and variables are listed in table 3 and the model specifications are listed in table 4 6 c ε 2 m k the parameters z n stand for the displacement of each element in the model with a positive value of z denoting an upward displacement z n 0 is the equilibrium position z 1 is the heave motion and the displacements of the cb and top of the drill string are given by z 2 and z 3 respectively with z k denoting the following drill string elements and z n denoting the seabed the basic configuration of the model is represented as a spring damper system we denote the spring and damping coefficients between z i and z i 1 as k i and c i respectively for each mass m i the equation of motion can be written as eq 7 the equations are solved using a fourth order runge kutta process as follows 7 m i a i k i z i z i 1 k i 1 z i z i 1 v i z i z i 1 v i 1 z i z i 1 where 8 z 1 h e a v e t the measured heave motion is input for z 1 as the heave data were obtained at a 1 h z sampling rate a fourth order polynomial approximation is applied for smooth interpolation to 100 or 1 000 h z the remaining displacements z 2 z 3 z n are calculated based on the equation the downhole wob is calculated from the spring coefficient k n z n 1 and the surface measured wob is calculated from the tension between the top drive and the traveling block the heave data are updated at every time step 4 2 model for heave compensator the heave compensator produces non linear behavior between z 1 and z 2 corresponding to k 1 as the spring coefficient is dependent on the cb position z 1 z 2 we developed a look up table for k 1 the damping coefficient c 1 is represented by the friction term for any type of passive hc the load can be modeled as a combination of forces dependent on displacement velocity acceleration inertia and friction terms f f r in turn f f r depend on the direction of the relative velocity the sum of the forces from the cylinder and sheave link system depends on the displacement of cb position the stick slip phenomena occurring in cylinder seals were modeled using constant threshold models for each time step the relative inertia of the cb is compared with the stick slip friction f s t i c k if the inertia value is greater the motion of the cb is evaluated in a manner similar to the other components in the lumped mass model if the inertia value is lesser the distance between z 1 and z 2 is maintained from the previous step as f s t i c k is not specified in the design the parameter must be estimated from monitored data 4 3 estimation of cmc parameters cmc behavior is the key factor in the dynamic simulation of drill strings most parameters such as k 1 can be estimated from a physical description of the related phenomena however parameters such as the static and dynamic friction coefficients and the damping coefficient are unspecified both the equilibrium position and the sea bed stiffness are operationally dependent and must be estimated from the observational data for each program for this study the 4000 m case cb position data were used to calibrate the above parameters first the sea bed stiffness was roughly estimated from the relation between the heave cb position and tension variation at the surface based on this the friction and damping coefficients and the equilibrium position were optimized using a genetic algorithm to find the parameter set with smallest root mean square errors a 5 min time window chosen arbitrarily as t 2 500 to t 2 800 was used for the calibration an example of the simulation results obtained using the optimized parameter sets is depicted in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 the agreement of the simulation results with the observations is fairly high particularly in terms of the velocity of cb movement the estimated sea bed stiffness and f s t i c k were evaluated to be around 500 k n m and 14 000 n respectively which is in fairly close agreement with the corresponding parameter magnitudes described in previous studies hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 4 4 model results for the 8000 m case next the 8000 m case was simulated based on the parameters optimized in the 4000 m case here the sea bed stiffness and equilibrium position were re optimized to fit the cb position data from the 8000 m case resulting in an estimated sea bed stiffness value of around 5 000 k n m the simulation results successfully reproduced the wob under high frequency oscillation fig 13 shows a comparison between the top tension measured wob and the simulation results 5 discussion 5 1 compensator induced vibration our simulation model successfully reproduced the high frequency vibration that was observed in the 8000 m depth drilling operation occurrence of such high frequency modes has been anticipated for ultradeep water drilling with hatleskog hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 mentioning bit bouncing at the bottom as a possible trigger of high frequency vibration although our model does not consider such mechanisms it still reproduced the high frequency vibration here we discuss the cause of these phenomena while focusing on the friction of the hc system based on several numerical experiments we conducted on the model after removing the cmc friction term the resulting numerical analysis did not produce any signs of high frequency vibration as depicted in fig 14 and fig 15 this suggests that cmc friction plays an important role in the mechanism of high frequency vibration as such friction is common in any hc system we define the related phenomena as civ compensator friction makes the drill string behave as a system with both ends fixed for which we can assume that the first mode of the natural frequency has been excited under such conditions natural frequency vibration can be excited via either resonance with heave motion or via a transient response to a shock load both of these excitation mechanisms can be considered feasible under the conditions of the two drilling programs when the drill string is very long the natural frequency coincides with the spectral range of heave motion i e around 0 7 hz in the 4000 m case and 0 3 hz in the 8000 m case thus even a small amount of energy input within the heave motion spectrum can continuously provide energy for steady vibration in the resonant mode on the other hand stick slip motion of the heave compensator could cause impulse shock loading on the drill string exciting a transient response two additional numerical experiments were conducted to further analyze the 8000 m case first a low pass filter was applied to the heave motion input data to exclude resonant vibration this produced a result with fewer signs of high frequency vibration suggesting that both resonance and transient response contribute to the excitation of high frequency vibration the second numerical experiment involved the application of heave motion in the form of continuous 0 1 hz waves of various amplitudes below and above a specific amplitude range high frequency vibration did not occur at small amplitudes friction was higher than the heave motion force and the heave compensator remained stuck at large amplitudes the heave compensator could move smoothly i e in slip condition an irregular heave motion is an important cause of the stick slip condition which is the trigger for transient response similar analysis of the 4000 m case produced weak signs of high frequency vibration which was not observed in the actual data we believe that this divergence can be attributed to two potential causes first the 4000 m case has a higher frequency resonant mode in which damping is stronger the model may have failed to reproduce this damping effect second as the sampling rate for surface tension was 1 hz high frequency fluctuation could have been more difficult to observe another reason maybe the duration time of cmc stick the duration time of cmc stick for 4000 m case is much shorter than that of the 8 000 m case since the natural frequency mode is for the both end fixed condition the occurrence of high frequency mode is limited during stick condition smaller movement of cmc i e longer stick condition of 8 000 m case can be explained by the higher elasticity of the drill string where the heave moment is absorbed by the deformation of the long drill pipe although the excitation frequencies in the simulations were close to those in the observed data they did not precisely coincide the natural frequency is highly dependent on drill pipe dimensions especially mass and elasticity as mentioned in section 2 the actual drill pipe is fabricated with some redundancy to enhance its reliability simulation results that consider the redundant thickness would be expected to produce a lower elasticity and thus a higher natural frequency the divergence in these results suggests the importance of considering the actual drill pipe dimensions in accurately estimating the natural frequency and we presume that measurements from actual drill pipes would improve the correspondence between simulation and actual observation 5 2 surface and downhole wob drilling efficiency and drill pipe integrity depend significantly on the wob however the drill string assembly architecture makes it difficult to gain direct access to drill bit information on the seabed except for some very low sampling rate lwd inoue et al 2011 there is no current technique for real time monitoring of the actual wob therefore our experiments used the traditional wob estimation method for measuring the load near the top of the drill string however the assumption that the wob estimated near the surface coincides with the actual wob only applies when a rigid and non elastic drill string is considered our results suggest that the elasticity of the drill pipe observed in ultradeep water drilling cases could cause divergence between the surface estimated and actual wobs fig 16 compared the fourier transform spectra of the surface and downhole wobs for the 4000 m case simulation results here there is no significant difference between the two sets of results however in fig 17 which shows the fourier transform spectra from the 8000 m case simulation results peaks are observed near the heave frequency 6 15 s and higher regions 3 s corresponding to the excited natural frequency mode the spectrum energy near the heave oscillation period increases at the downhole wob on the other hand natural frequency oscillation decreases in magnitude at the bottom it is clear that the top tension and downhole wob have different behavior which we will examine in further detail the energy profile of each region was investigated to determine the excited mode fig 18 shows the depth profile for the near heave spectrum and higher regions it is seen that the energy or variance increases near the heave mode which can be attributed to the inertial force distribution along the drill string the acceleration increases near the surface which decreases the load on the drill string behavior that corresponds to the first mode of a string with a free top end and a fixed bottom end on the other hand the high frequency regions show a v shaped distribution fig 19 and fig 20 show the typical variation of load amplitude by natural frequency mode for axial vibration for both fixed and free fixed beams it is clear that the v shaped distribution corresponds to the first mode of fix fix mode natural frequency this result supports our assumption that the heave compensator behaves as a fixed end for such high frequency oscillation phenomena 5 3 challenge to 12 000 m depth to complete the proposed mantle expedition described in section 1 it will be necessary to drill up to 12 000 m we conducted a simulation to observe the technical challenges that will be involved in attaining this goal in these simulations we used the vessel data from the 4000 m case and the drill pipe configuration from the 8000 m case but extended the length of each component by a factor of 1 5 fig 21 shows three peaks in the fourier transform spectrum of the wob suggesting the excitation of another resonant mode the depth profile of each frequency region suggests that the second fix fix mode has been excited see fig 22 excitation of longitudinal resonant oscillation consistently occurs in drilling operations involving ultra long drill pipes such oscillations can cause serious damage to drill pipes especially as the result of fatigue loads and care must be taken to either mitigate such loads or implement repair strategies lwd measurements for operation with ultra long drill strings would be useful in confirming the findings of this study 5 4 consideration of the questions we provide our best assumption to the questions raised in section 3 3 what is the cause and mechanism underlying the high frequency mode oscillation the high frequency mode oscillation was the first mode longitudinal natural vibration with both ends fixed such condition was possibly triggered by the friction in the heave compensator we named this class of phenomena compensator induced vibration civ is the behavior of the downhole wob affected by such oscillation yes the high frequency oscillation seen in surface tension variation is predicted to occur at downhole wob as well different oscillation mode cause difference in amplitude for tension variation at surface and downhole oscillation at heave frequency is larger at downhole where high frequency oscillation is larger near surface what is the impact of such oscillation on the drill string integrity and how can it be reduced at this moment we can only say that high frequency oscillation does exists although the observed amplitude is small it is a potential cause of fatigue adequate management of drill pipe s operational integrity considering such fatigue load is a practical solution further investigation would require more field observation one possible solution for the mitigation of high frequency mode is eliminating the friction of heave compensation this is not easy for cylinder type heave compensation but maybe possible with draw works type heave compensation 5 5 future works our study was based on observational data and simulation models the lumped mass model used in the study is a simplified model to examine the dominant phenomena behind high frequency oscillation and although it was sufficient to achieve this purpose some improvements can be made to assess results in a more quantitative manner some physics that may have been simplified or neglected in this paper are listed as follows the behavior of the hc is estimated under simplified assumptions the friction model is simplified to include only static and dynamic friction coupling with horizontal displacement and rotation of the drill pipe have been neglected the fluid effect inside and outside the drill pipe niedzwecki and thampi 1988a in the drill riser and in the well have been neglected the sea bed stiffness was assumed to be very large whereas hatleskog and dunnigan 2012 noted the possibility of bit bounce caused by contact instability at the seabed the dimensions of the drill pipe are subject to variance during fabrication and wear under operation 6 conclusion this paper analyzed drill string behavior for ultra long drill strings during offshore operation data obtained during drilling with an 8000 m drill string showed oscillations at frequencies higher than the heave motion in the wob this was the first time that such oscillations had been observed and it provided the motivation for this study a one dimensional drill string dynamic model based on non linear behavior and including friction in the hc system components was developed a ga was used to apply parameter optimization to match the modeled hc behavior with measurement data obtained from a 4000 m drilling operation the results showed a good correlation with the measured data especially in terms of the stick slick motion of the heave compensator the modified model results for the 8000 m drilling case successfully reproduced high frequency oscillations seen in the observed data the simulation results also revealed oscillatory behavior along the drill string the high frequency oscillations were verified to be resulting from excitation of longitudinal resonant vibrations in a beam with both ends fixed in which the amplitude of an oscillated natural frequency mode weakens in the middle and recovers at the bottom end the model experiments suggested the possible influence of friction in the heave compensator which acted as a trigger to impulse loading and produced fixed end behavior at the drill string top we call this vibrational phenomenon civ the amplitude of heave mode oscillation increases as it approaches the bottom of the string and the difference between the surface measured and downhole wob depends on the oscillation mode these phenomena will remain as the drilling depth increases as revealed in our modeling of a 12 000 m case overall the results of this study help to lay out and explain the dynamical challenges to ultradeep water drilling it was shown that hc performance plays an important role in ultradeep drilling as the impact of heave motion is assumed to be larger at the seabed acknowledgements we thank jamstec for providing the observational data

23440,offshore drilling with ultra long drill strings i e longer than 10 000 m creates a new class of technical challenges such as dynamic variation of weight on bit wob this article investigates observational data obtained from a drilling program conducted by the scientific drilling vessel chikyu using an 8000 m drill string which is first of their kind to be recorded the data exhibited longitudinal oscillation of the drill pipe at frequencies higher than that of heave motion to identify the cause of such oscillation one dimensional dynamic simulation to model drill string s behavior was carried out the key component of this model is the detailed modeling of the heave compensator numerical experiments revealed that longitudinal natural vibration was excited in the ultra long drill pipe and the excitation modes corresponded to the behavior of a string with both ends fixed indicating the possible influence of friction in the heave compensator we named this class of phenomena compensator induced vibration civ in addition longitudinal elasticity leads to divergence of the tension variation near surface and downhole wob which calls for the need to directly measure the downhole wob behavior keywords ultra long drill string compensator induced vibration civ heave compensator longitudinal natural vibration friction 1 introduction offshore drilling activities are important in both the commercial and scientific fields currently there is oil and gas exploration in the pre salt regions off brazil reaching depths of 5000 7000 m and some giant petroleum fields e g the tiber field in the gulf of mexico have been discovered at depths greater than 10 000 m railsback 2013 the scope and range of offshore drilling activities continue to advance for instance the international ocean discovery program iodp is attempting deeper drilling to recover data for sub seafloor environment monitoring tobin and kinoshita 2006 their ultimate goal is to reach the mantle which will require more than 7000 m of sea floor drilling at an over water depth of 4000 m illuminating earth s past 2011 chikyu 2013 drilling with ultra long drill pipes i e drill pipes longer than 10 000 m raises a suite of new technical problems one such challenge is the integrity of such pipes with the increasing length and weight of the drill strings requiring larger static axial strength in the drill pipe offshore drilling operations are also confronted with dynamic load variations arising from the suspension of the drill pipe from a floating body on a free surface as the drill string length increases the natural frequency of axial vibration gets closer to that of heave period range which is typically longer than 8 s for large drill ships under such conditions the heave motion may excite additional oscillations in the drill string previous studies have developed analytical model of long riserless drill string to estimate natural periods of longitudinal vibration niedzwecki and thampi 1988a niedzwecki and thampi 1988b they studied the eigen solutions for 27 000 ft 8 230 m drill string with various hydrodynamic approximation and its impact on the natural period although their study was comprehensive the analytical model is for free hanging conditions and do not consider the stick slip motion of the heave compensator to account for such load variation it will be necessary to develop a better understanding of ultra long drill string dynamic behavior inoue et al 2012 heave compensation hc is a common and traditional technique for mitigating the potential influence of heave on the drill string woodall mason tilbeet al 1976 if the drill string is directly exposed to the vessel s heave motion the variation in axial load may cause serious damage to the string both passive and active hc technologies to reduce the impact of heave motion during drilling have been investigated woodacre et al 2015 for instance hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 produced a detailed explanation of a passive drill string compensator in which the dynamic behavior was decomposed into heave motion hc and drill string response in their analysis the heave compensator performance is critical in discussing the dynamic behavior of the drill string in addition hatleskog and dunnigan 2006 concludes through field experience and simulation that a passive compensator can be no more than roughly 80 effective in this study we were privileged to gain access to data on the actual behavior of ultra long drill strings obtained during ultradeep water drilling programs conducted by the scientific drilling vessel chikyu owned by jamstec these drilling observation data from a depth of 8000 m are the first of their kind to be recorded inoue et al 2014 and represent actual observations of the types of technical problems discussed in the literature the purpose of this paper is to use data analysis and dynamic simulation to determine the dynamic behavior of ultra long drill strings in section 2 we elaborate on the configuration of a drill string used in offshore drilling while focusing on the heave compensator data analysis of the chikyu drilling program is provided in section 3 and we develop a dynamic simulation to understand the observed phenomena in section 4 in section 5 we discuss the issue of load variation and end with a conclusion in section 6 the main contribution of this paper is to provide a clarification of the excitation mechanism for high frequency vibration of drill pipes observed during ultradeep water drilling dynamic simulation of drill string behavior reveals that such vibrations are the result of natural frequency excitation in the long drill pipe the excited vibrational modes correspond to the behavior of a string with both ends fixed indicating the potential influence of friction in the heave compensator we have named this class of phenomena compensator induced vibration civ 2 about the chikyu offshore drilling system 2 1 specifics of chikyu the scientific deep sea drilling vessel chikyu which is owned by jamstec has the capability of drilling to a 10 000 m depth and is designed to drill with and without drilling risers starting with its first scientific drilling under the direction of the international integrated ocean drilling program iodp at the nankai trough in 2007 it has engaged in many ultradeep water drilling programs inoue et al 2012 2 2 overview of the drilling system fig 1 shows a schematic of the chikyu offshore drilling system the heave compensator is mounted on the derrick while the traveling block and power swivel are suspended from the heave compensator with wire rope the wire rope is connected to a draw works from which it is reeled to raise and lower the drilling assembly not depicted a power swivel holds and rotates the drill string which comprises a drill pipe and a bottom hole assembly containing drill collars a stabilizer and a drill bit during drilling most of the total weight of the drill string is supported by the vessel with the remaining weight compensated by the normal force from the seabed this normal force which is called the weight on bit wob provides the essential force for drilling to ensure efficient drilling and maintain the integrity of the drill pipe it is important to maintain a constant wob within a certain range 2 3 heave compensator because the vessel is exposed to wave induced heave motion the distance between the seabed and vessel is not constant considering the stiffness of seabed the motion of the drill string must be strongly constrained therefore the main purpose of hc is to mitigate the relative displacement between the vessel and the top position of the drill string this is accomplished via a spring like mechanism that can be employed through either passive or active compensation systems an overall review of heave compensator mechanisms can be found in the literature woodacre et al 2015 herein we focus on the crown mount compensator cmc produced by national oilwell varco nov that is equipped in chikyu the cmc is a passive compensation system that comprises a crown block a compensator cylinder and a sheave link system which are described below and modeled later on in this paper chikyu also has an active heave compensation ahc system that was not used during the drilling program assessed in this paper and is therefore beyond the present scope previous analysis of the performance of the passive heave compensator on chikyu based on observational data led to the suggestion that further investigation of the dynamic tension behavior is necessary inoue et al 2012 this is addressed in this paper through an in depth analysis of the hc behavior the crown block cb is the main body of the cmc that supports the weight of the drill string the cb is not fixed to the drilling vessel but is instead connected to the ship through the compensator cylinder and sheave link system during hc the relative position of the cb and the vessel denoted from here on as the cb position changes to compensate for the heave motion the strike range of the cb position is from 3 8 to 3 8 m around the mid stroke point at the equilibrium position the forces produced by the compensator cylinder and sheave link system statically support the weight of the cb and drill string our main interest is dynamic load variation for which deviation from the equilibrium force is important and therefore the equilibrium condition is treated as the origin the forces from the two supporting mechanisms are dependent on the cb position and both mechanisms have non linear behavior the dynamical details of each system are given below several variables are defined here to present a simplified picture of drill string dynamics the same configuration will be used again in the data analysis in section 3 the vertical displacement of the mth component is z m and the equilibrium position of each component is set to z m 0 where a positive value of z represents upward displacement the first component is that of the drilling vessel for which z 1 is the heave displacement z 2 represents the cb displacement from origin the cb position is defined as z 2 z 1 displacement of the drill string is then expressed using z 3 z 4 2 3 1 compensator cylinder a two compensator cylinder connects the vessel to the cb the cylinder is fixed to the vessel and the piston rod is fixed to the cb with the pressure in the cylinder kept high to support the cb the cylinder is further connected through accumulators to air pressure vessels apvs containing compressed air chikyu has 11 apvs each of 1 6 m 3 volume the number of apvs connected to each cylinder can be changed depending on the operational situation the piston stroke action produces variability between the relative displacement of the cb and the vessel s heave motion as the volume of the cylinder changes with the piston displacement the pressure force behaves as a pneumatic spring for example when the cb moves upwards an increase in the cylinder volume causes the pressure to decrease compensation for heave motion modifies the pressure required to support the cb which in turn results in load variation on the drill string in the isothermal and adiabatic conditions p v and p v k respectively are constant k depends on the polytropic curve and is set here to k 1 33 based on the results of a previous study azpiazu et al 1983 the volume of interest v is the total volume of the connected apvs pipework and the cylinder itself thus the number of apvs connected to the cylinder affects the pneumatic spring s performance 1 p v k c o n s t where 2 v v a p v s v p i p e w o r k v c y l i n d e r each cylinder experiences several frictional and damping forces the friction of a cylinder is in turn a combination of forces including coulomb friction which is proportional to the pressure level viscous friction which is proportional to the relative velocity of motion and stribeck friction which is important at low velocity each cylinder has two seals grips one for the piston and another for the gland seal in such seals coulomb friction i e seal friction is known to be dominant hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 haaø et al 2012 and korde 1998 for cylinder type compensators static friction were too large for the load to overcome easily and suffered from the problem of cylinder stick kidera 1983 the seal grips incur a stick slip friction of f s f which can be modeled in a simplified manner as follows 3 f s f μ 2 s i g n z 2 z 1 cylinder motion is resisted by a combination of seal and other frictional sources in cases of relative motion between the cb and the vessel the frictional force can be simply assumed to be proportional to the relative velocity and we denote the overall friction as f f r which is expressed as follows 4 f f r c 2 z 2 z 1 the model used here assumes linear friction although this is commonly done in the interest of model simplicity care should be taken to ensure accuracy do and pan 2008 2 3 2 linkage sheave system although relative motion is compensated by the cylinder the resulting load variation can be troublesome for the drilling operation the linkage sheave system is therefore introduced to reduce the load variation during the strike motion by maintaining a more stable wob the linkage sheave system comprises a wire and a pair of sheave links as shown in fig 2 inoue et al 2012 one end of the system is attached to a draw works while the other end is fixed to the deadline anchor the tension in the wire which is connected to the traveling block suspends the entire weight of drill string thus at z 2 0 the tension is proportional to the hook load the arm is connected to the cb and moves with its striking motion the changing geometry of the linkage sheave system modifies the vertical force applied to the cb the vertical force from the linkage sheave system to the cb can be estimated from the static equilibrium of forces as constrained by the geometry of the system senga 2016 the distinctive feature of the sheave system is that its force variations oppose those of the cylinder when the cb moves upwards the sheave system s upward force increases this positive feedback which corresponds to a negative spring coefficient compensates the load variation caused by the cylinder 2 3 3 overall behavior fig 3 shows the relation between the cb position and the total force on the cb from the cylinder and sheave link system for different configurations of the cmc for example panel a shows the mid stroke initial position i e x 0 0 and a p v n u m 11 it is seen that the load variation is strongly non linear and remains insignificant compared to that in a normal linear spring however when n a p v decreases the total force does not balance and the force from the cylinder begins to dominate n a p v 2 in fig 3 b and n a p v 6 in fig 3 c in this condition the cmc behavior is close to that of a pneumatic spring poor hc performance as the result of load variation in a small number of apvs was shown previously in hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 during actual operation under harsh offshore conditions a large heave motion makes it very difficult to set the equilibrium point at mid stroke fig 3 d illustrates a case in which the initial position is not adjusted to mid stroke but rather set at 1 m below the mid stroke position although the difference between forces is not large in this case actual cmc behavior could differ significantly as a result of non linearity a major obstacle to fully understanding hc performance is the presence of unknown values such as frictional forces and damping coefficients which are critical to the heave compensator performance furthermore factors such as friction are prone to deterioration over time of operation thus the effective use of a passive heave compensator with or without concurrent use of an ahc requires a thorough understanding of each component 2 4 drill pipe a unique approach in this study is the dynamic analysis of a drill pipe s longitudinal elasticity which will be addressed later in this paper a long drill pipe is assembled by connecting many 9 m long drill pipes as the weight of the drill string is almost entirely supported by top tension most of the drill pipe will be exposed to tensile load with compressive load appearing only near the bottom as the dimensions of the drill pipe are determined based on the drill string weight and load the configuration of the drill pipe will depend on the specific requirements of the drilling program a schematic of a drill pipe is shown in fig 4 petroleum and natural gas industries 2000 the tool joints t j hereafter and upsets at both ends of the pipe have increased thicknesses to ensure integrity at the connection points the physical properties guaranteed length and weight of each drill pipe are provided by the supplier as catalog values the stiffness k of a drill pipe is calculated from its material modulus e the cross sectional area a and the length of the drill pipe l to reflect the increased cross sectional area for the t j and upsets the axial stiffness of each drill pipe is given as 5 the drill pipes are connected in series which corresponds to increasing l and reducing k the drill pipe walls are manufactured with some redundancy in terms of thickness to compensate for production tolerance private communication with tenarisnkktubes in addition drill pipes are prone to wear during drilling which reduces their weight and thickness such variations in dimension cannot be considered within the scope of this study but they represent possible sources of uncertainty 5 1 k 0 1 e a n o m i n a l l n o m i n a l 1 e a u p s e t l u p s e t 1 e a t j l t j 2 5 bottom hole assembly the bottom hole assembly bha comprises a drill collar stabilizer and drill bit the drill collar has an increased diameter to resist the compression load the drill bit is the interface between the drill string and seabed and the combined force of the drill bit rotation and the wob makes drilling possible the wob is an important indicator of drilling performance and its steady control is desirable although the actual wob acting on the bit should be measured in the downhole it is difficult to place sensors there while there have been some attempts to measure downhole wob including the use of logging while drilling lwd inoue et al 2011 the sampling rates have proven to be too low in actual measurements the wob is calculated from the difference between the total weight of the drill string and the hook load the hook load is measured using load pins on the traveling block as this measurement occurs near the top of the drill string load variation along the string is not considered we call the wob measured at the surface the top tension to distinguish it from the downhole wob the limitations in sensor collocation ability arising from the discrepancy between top tension and downhole wob underlines the importance of the use of simulation in studies 3 analysis of observed data a unique contribution of this paper is the insight it provides from the data obtained during ultradeep water drilling activities we used data obtained from chikyu s drilling control and instrumentation system dcis which gathers information for use in drilling operations inoue et al 2012 in this section we analyze measurement data taken during two drilling programs at depths of around 4000 and 8000 m respectively a description of the drilling program and the analysis results are provided in this section 3 1 description of drilling program the data sets obtained during two ultradeep water drilling programs conducted by chikyu were provided by jamstec the first set taken from a drilling program in the nankai trough conducted in 2012 was obtained with a total drill string length of about 4 000 m at a 1 967 5 m water depth 2 005 5 m below the seabed the sea state was moderate during the drilling program hereafter we will refer to this case as the 4 000 m case the second drilling program named jfast inoue et al 2014 took place in ultradeep water near japan in 2012 jfast involved an urgent operation to monitor the geothermal temperature after a major earthquake the total drill string length was about 8 000 m at a 6 918 0 m water depth 844 5 m below the seabed the sea state was very calm during this drilling program as mentioned previously this program acquired the deepest core obtained to date hereafter we will refer this case as the 8 000 m case chikyu has a good dps dynamic positioning system to maintain its horizontal position during drilling murata et al 2005 so the possible impact of currents on the drilling system would be through the drill string vibration i e viv current data is observed at a sampling rate of 5 min at chikyu although the high frequency fluctuation of currents are not observed we can address the possibility of viv occurrence on drill strings 4000 m case is riser drilling and the drill pipe has no direct effect from the current no riser viv was observed during this drilling operation and the effect of current is negligible for 8000 m the maximum surface current was weak less than 1 kt inoue et al 2014 previous study on chikyu kitada et al 2011 mentions drill pipe viv are well suppressed when less than 1 kt we believe the influence from current are negligible in both conditions monitored data include the surface measured wob hook position heave hook load drilling depth etc the output sampling rate was 1 h z although the system actually employed a higher internal sampling rate details of the measurement data taken by chikyu are given by inoue et al 2009 3 2 analysis of the 4000 m case the configuration of the drill string in the 4000 m case is given in table 1 fig 5 shows the observed time series of the vessel s heave motion and the wob both oscillate with a similar behavior but with opposite phase suggesting that the relation between heave motion and wob can be roughly estimated using linear spring behavior in which a downward heave motion compresses the drill string to strengthen the wob by contrast the behavior of cb is non smooth despite the continuous variation of vessel heave motion the cb position remains constant over a specific time window as depicted in fig 6 this indicates that hc performance was absent in the cmc during this time even though the heave motion itself was relatively small as mentioned in section 2 the cmc is subject to several frictional forces the influence of which are clearly shown in these results 3 3 analysis of the 8000 m case the configuration of the drill string in the 8000 m case is given in table 2 fig 7 shows the observed time series of the vessel s heave motion and wob the result is clearly different from that in the 4000 m case the wob shows high frequency oscillation that is not seen in the heave motion fft analysis reveals that the high frequency oscillation has a frequency of around see fig 8 0 35 h z as the heave motion does not show a strong signal in such frequency bands we assume that some natural frequency mode has been excited in this case the movement of the cb position is also very weak in this case the drilling operation was conducted under a moderate wave condition and the heave motion was very small thus friction seems to dominate the behavior of the cmc in this case several questions arise from the observational data discussed above e g what is the cause and mechanism underlying the high frequency mode oscillation is the behavior of the downhole wob affected by such oscillation what is the impact of such oscillation on the drill string integrity and how can it be reduced the goal of the remainder of this paper is to answer these outstanding questions 4 dynamic simulation of drill string 4 1 lumped mass model configuration to simplify computation we developed a one degree of freedom lumped mass model with the only dimension in the vertical direction the main difference between this model and other dynamic simulation models such as hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 is in how the drill string itself is decomposed although this approach is highly simplified its use here is crucial in considering the axial load variation throughout the drill pipe we consider the dynamics of the longitudinal elastic behavior to be dominant in determining the high frequency oscillation thus in our model the horizontal displacement of drill pipes is neglected although bending by ocean currents or vortex induced vibrations viv can cause such horizontal displacement we assumed these to be negligible in the cases studied here our lumped mass model focuses on the vertical behavior from ship to the bottom end of the drill string see fig 9 the upper end of the model is the vessel where the heave motion is input the vessel is connected to the crown block through the heave compensator where the behavior of the cylinder and the sheave link system are modeled as a non linear spring and damper the traveling block and power swivel are considered to be a single large component that moves together with the crown block and is connected to the drill pipe which is segmented into elements of constant length the drill pipe is followed by the bha which is also segmented finally the bottom of the bha contacts the sea bed the drill string is configured as a drill pipe with several dimensions segmentation is applied only to drill pipes with the same dimension for each element the mass and stiffness are calculated from the element length l the material density ρ the material modulus e and the cross sectional area a the drill collar is treated similarly the stiffness of the sea bed can vary widely for example from 500 to 5000 k n m hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 depending on the formation the damping coefficient is estimated in terms of the critical damping value with the parameter ε constants and variables are listed in table 3 and the model specifications are listed in table 4 6 c ε 2 m k the parameters z n stand for the displacement of each element in the model with a positive value of z denoting an upward displacement z n 0 is the equilibrium position z 1 is the heave motion and the displacements of the cb and top of the drill string are given by z 2 and z 3 respectively with z k denoting the following drill string elements and z n denoting the seabed the basic configuration of the model is represented as a spring damper system we denote the spring and damping coefficients between z i and z i 1 as k i and c i respectively for each mass m i the equation of motion can be written as eq 7 the equations are solved using a fourth order runge kutta process as follows 7 m i a i k i z i z i 1 k i 1 z i z i 1 v i z i z i 1 v i 1 z i z i 1 where 8 z 1 h e a v e t the measured heave motion is input for z 1 as the heave data were obtained at a 1 h z sampling rate a fourth order polynomial approximation is applied for smooth interpolation to 100 or 1 000 h z the remaining displacements z 2 z 3 z n are calculated based on the equation the downhole wob is calculated from the spring coefficient k n z n 1 and the surface measured wob is calculated from the tension between the top drive and the traveling block the heave data are updated at every time step 4 2 model for heave compensator the heave compensator produces non linear behavior between z 1 and z 2 corresponding to k 1 as the spring coefficient is dependent on the cb position z 1 z 2 we developed a look up table for k 1 the damping coefficient c 1 is represented by the friction term for any type of passive hc the load can be modeled as a combination of forces dependent on displacement velocity acceleration inertia and friction terms f f r in turn f f r depend on the direction of the relative velocity the sum of the forces from the cylinder and sheave link system depends on the displacement of cb position the stick slip phenomena occurring in cylinder seals were modeled using constant threshold models for each time step the relative inertia of the cb is compared with the stick slip friction f s t i c k if the inertia value is greater the motion of the cb is evaluated in a manner similar to the other components in the lumped mass model if the inertia value is lesser the distance between z 1 and z 2 is maintained from the previous step as f s t i c k is not specified in the design the parameter must be estimated from monitored data 4 3 estimation of cmc parameters cmc behavior is the key factor in the dynamic simulation of drill strings most parameters such as k 1 can be estimated from a physical description of the related phenomena however parameters such as the static and dynamic friction coefficients and the damping coefficient are unspecified both the equilibrium position and the sea bed stiffness are operationally dependent and must be estimated from the observational data for each program for this study the 4000 m case cb position data were used to calibrate the above parameters first the sea bed stiffness was roughly estimated from the relation between the heave cb position and tension variation at the surface based on this the friction and damping coefficients and the equilibrium position were optimized using a genetic algorithm to find the parameter set with smallest root mean square errors a 5 min time window chosen arbitrarily as t 2 500 to t 2 800 was used for the calibration an example of the simulation results obtained using the optimized parameter sets is depicted in fig 10 fig 11 and fig 12 the agreement of the simulation results with the observations is fairly high particularly in terms of the velocity of cb movement the estimated sea bed stiffness and f s t i c k were evaluated to be around 500 k n m and 14 000 n respectively which is in fairly close agreement with the corresponding parameter magnitudes described in previous studies hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 4 4 model results for the 8000 m case next the 8000 m case was simulated based on the parameters optimized in the 4000 m case here the sea bed stiffness and equilibrium position were re optimized to fit the cb position data from the 8000 m case resulting in an estimated sea bed stiffness value of around 5 000 k n m the simulation results successfully reproduced the wob under high frequency oscillation fig 13 shows a comparison between the top tension measured wob and the simulation results 5 discussion 5 1 compensator induced vibration our simulation model successfully reproduced the high frequency vibration that was observed in the 8000 m depth drilling operation occurrence of such high frequency modes has been anticipated for ultradeep water drilling with hatleskog hatleskog and dunnigan 2007 mentioning bit bouncing at the bottom as a possible trigger of high frequency vibration although our model does not consider such mechanisms it still reproduced the high frequency vibration here we discuss the cause of these phenomena while focusing on the friction of the hc system based on several numerical experiments we conducted on the model after removing the cmc friction term the resulting numerical analysis did not produce any signs of high frequency vibration as depicted in fig 14 and fig 15 this suggests that cmc friction plays an important role in the mechanism of high frequency vibration as such friction is common in any hc system we define the related phenomena as civ compensator friction makes the drill string behave as a system with both ends fixed for which we can assume that the first mode of the natural frequency has been excited under such conditions natural frequency vibration can be excited via either resonance with heave motion or via a transient response to a shock load both of these excitation mechanisms can be considered feasible under the conditions of the two drilling programs when the drill string is very long the natural frequency coincides with the spectral range of heave motion i e around 0 7 hz in the 4000 m case and 0 3 hz in the 8000 m case thus even a small amount of energy input within the heave motion spectrum can continuously provide energy for steady vibration in the resonant mode on the other hand stick slip motion of the heave compensator could cause impulse shock loading on the drill string exciting a transient response two additional numerical experiments were conducted to further analyze the 8000 m case first a low pass filter was applied to the heave motion input data to exclude resonant vibration this produced a result with fewer signs of high frequency vibration suggesting that both resonance and transient response contribute to the excitation of high frequency vibration the second numerical experiment involved the application of heave motion in the form of continuous 0 1 hz waves of various amplitudes below and above a specific amplitude range high frequency vibration did not occur at small amplitudes friction was higher than the heave motion force and the heave compensator remained stuck at large amplitudes the heave compensator could move smoothly i e in slip condition an irregular heave motion is an important cause of the stick slip condition which is the trigger for transient response similar analysis of the 4000 m case produced weak signs of high frequency vibration which was not observed in the actual data we believe that this divergence can be attributed to two potential causes first the 4000 m case has a higher frequency resonant mode in which damping is stronger the model may have failed to reproduce this damping effect second as the sampling rate for surface tension was 1 hz high frequency fluctuation could have been more difficult to observe another reason maybe the duration time of cmc stick the duration time of cmc stick for 4000 m case is much shorter than that of the 8 000 m case since the natural frequency mode is for the both end fixed condition the occurrence of high frequency mode is limited during stick condition smaller movement of cmc i e longer stick condition of 8 000 m case can be explained by the higher elasticity of the drill string where the heave moment is absorbed by the deformation of the long drill pipe although the excitation frequencies in the simulations were close to those in the observed data they did not precisely coincide the natural frequency is highly dependent on drill pipe dimensions especially mass and elasticity as mentioned in section 2 the actual drill pipe is fabricated with some redundancy to enhance its reliability simulation results that consider the redundant thickness would be expected to produce a lower elasticity and thus a higher natural frequency the divergence in these results suggests the importance of considering the actual drill pipe dimensions in accurately estimating the natural frequency and we presume that measurements from actual drill pipes would improve the correspondence between simulation and actual observation 5 2 surface and downhole wob drilling efficiency and drill pipe integrity depend significantly on the wob however the drill string assembly architecture makes it difficult to gain direct access to drill bit information on the seabed except for some very low sampling rate lwd inoue et al 2011 there is no current technique for real time monitoring of the actual wob therefore our experiments used the traditional wob estimation method for measuring the load near the top of the drill string however the assumption that the wob estimated near the surface coincides with the actual wob only applies when a rigid and non elastic drill string is considered our results suggest that the elasticity of the drill pipe observed in ultradeep water drilling cases could cause divergence between the surface estimated and actual wobs fig 16 compared the fourier transform spectra of the surface and downhole wobs for the 4000 m case simulation results here there is no significant difference between the two sets of results however in fig 17 which shows the fourier transform spectra from the 8000 m case simulation results peaks are observed near the heave frequency 6 15 s and higher regions 3 s corresponding to the excited natural frequency mode the spectrum energy near the heave oscillation period increases at the downhole wob on the other hand natural frequency oscillation decreases in magnitude at the bottom it is clear that the top tension and downhole wob have different behavior which we will examine in further detail the energy profile of each region was investigated to determine the excited mode fig 18 shows the depth profile for the near heave spectrum and higher regions it is seen that the energy or variance increases near the heave mode which can be attributed to the inertial force distribution along the drill string the acceleration increases near the surface which decreases the load on the drill string behavior that corresponds to the first mode of a string with a free top end and a fixed bottom end on the other hand the high frequency regions show a v shaped distribution fig 19 and fig 20 show the typical variation of load amplitude by natural frequency mode for axial vibration for both fixed and free fixed beams it is clear that the v shaped distribution corresponds to the first mode of fix fix mode natural frequency this result supports our assumption that the heave compensator behaves as a fixed end for such high frequency oscillation phenomena 5 3 challenge to 12 000 m depth to complete the proposed mantle expedition described in section 1 it will be necessary to drill up to 12 000 m we conducted a simulation to observe the technical challenges that will be involved in attaining this goal in these simulations we used the vessel data from the 4000 m case and the drill pipe configuration from the 8000 m case but extended the length of each component by a factor of 1 5 fig 21 shows three peaks in the fourier transform spectrum of the wob suggesting the excitation of another resonant mode the depth profile of each frequency region suggests that the second fix fix mode has been excited see fig 22 excitation of longitudinal resonant oscillation consistently occurs in drilling operations involving ultra long drill pipes such oscillations can cause serious damage to drill pipes especially as the result of fatigue loads and care must be taken to either mitigate such loads or implement repair strategies lwd measurements for operation with ultra long drill strings would be useful in confirming the findings of this study 5 4 consideration of the questions we provide our best assumption to the questions raised in section 3 3 what is the cause and mechanism underlying the high frequency mode oscillation the high frequency mode oscillation was the first mode longitudinal natural vibration with both ends fixed such condition was possibly triggered by the friction in the heave compensator we named this class of phenomena compensator induced vibration civ is the behavior of the downhole wob affected by such oscillation yes the high frequency oscillation seen in surface tension variation is predicted to occur at downhole wob as well different oscillation mode cause difference in amplitude for tension variation at surface and downhole oscillation at heave frequency is larger at downhole where high frequency oscillation is larger near surface what is the impact of such oscillation on the drill string integrity and how can it be reduced at this moment we can only say that high frequency oscillation does exists although the observed amplitude is small it is a potential cause of fatigue adequate management of drill pipe s operational integrity considering such fatigue load is a practical solution further investigation would require more field observation one possible solution for the mitigation of high frequency mode is eliminating the friction of heave compensation this is not easy for cylinder type heave compensation but maybe possible with draw works type heave compensation 5 5 future works our study was based on observational data and simulation models the lumped mass model used in the study is a simplified model to examine the dominant phenomena behind high frequency oscillation and although it was sufficient to achieve this purpose some improvements can be made to assess results in a more quantitative manner some physics that may have been simplified or neglected in this paper are listed as follows the behavior of the hc is estimated under simplified assumptions the friction model is simplified to include only static and dynamic friction coupling with horizontal displacement and rotation of the drill pipe have been neglected the fluid effect inside and outside the drill pipe niedzwecki and thampi 1988a in the drill riser and in the well have been neglected the sea bed stiffness was assumed to be very large whereas hatleskog and dunnigan 2012 noted the possibility of bit bounce caused by contact instability at the seabed the dimensions of the drill pipe are subject to variance during fabrication and wear under operation 6 conclusion this paper analyzed drill string behavior for ultra long drill strings during offshore operation data obtained during drilling with an 8000 m drill string showed oscillations at frequencies higher than the heave motion in the wob this was the first time that such oscillations had been observed and it provided the motivation for this study a one dimensional drill string dynamic model based on non linear behavior and including friction in the hc system components was developed a ga was used to apply parameter optimization to match the modeled hc behavior with measurement data obtained from a 4000 m drilling operation the results showed a good correlation with the measured data especially in terms of the stick slick motion of the heave compensator the modified model results for the 8000 m drilling case successfully reproduced high frequency oscillations seen in the observed data the simulation results also revealed oscillatory behavior along the drill string the high frequency oscillations were verified to be resulting from excitation of longitudinal resonant vibrations in a beam with both ends fixed in which the amplitude of an oscillated natural frequency mode weakens in the middle and recovers at the bottom end the model experiments suggested the possible influence of friction in the heave compensator which acted as a trigger to impulse loading and produced fixed end behavior at the drill string top we call this vibrational phenomenon civ the amplitude of heave mode oscillation increases as it approaches the bottom of the string and the difference between the surface measured and downhole wob depends on the oscillation mode these phenomena will remain as the drilling depth increases as revealed in our modeling of a 12 000 m case overall the results of this study help to lay out and explain the dynamical challenges to ultradeep water drilling it was shown that hc performance plays an important role in ultradeep drilling as the impact of heave motion is assumed to be larger at the seabed acknowledgements we thank jamstec for providing the observational data

23441,the present paper studies the soil structure interaction ssi effects on the dynamic properties of offshore wind turbines owt founded on monopiles for that purpose a three degrees of freedom substructuring model based on modal parameters is proposed the whole superstructure is reduced to a punctual mass by its fundamental modal mass and height while the pile soil stiffness is represented by the corresponding impedance functions the proposed model together with characteristic relations between the fixed base fundamental frequency and the modal parameters obtained from data of existent owts found in the literature is used to analyse the influence of the superstructure and foundation dimensions and soil profile on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena the obtained results confirm the relevance of including the foundation stiffness in the design stage of owt systems as variations in the fundamental frequency close to 15 can be produced the homogeneous assumption even if c s 30 mean values are assumed yields to misleading results if the actual soil profile presents properties that vary with depth the superficial layers of the soil profile are found to play a major role in the estimation of the owt system fundamental frequency and damping when the ssi phenomena are included keywords offshore wind turbines soil structure interaction monopile impedance functions modal analysis multilayered half space 1 introduction in the last years the use of offshore wind turbines owt has experienced a great increment owing to the reduction in cost and the increase in the generators size and power however further research is demanded in order to better understand the dynamic behaviour of their supporting structure and so that design and lifespan can be improved the principal foundation type for owts is the monopile 80 1 of the owt installed in europe are founded on monopiles according to ewea 2016 monopile foundations consist of a short hollow pile with large diameter that is driven into the seabed and are commonly used for water depths of 20 40 m the simplicity of the construction and assembly is the principal advantage of this foundation type however the pile is a very slender structure and consequently more flexible than other foundation configurations e g gravity based or jackets the soil structure interaction ssi effects have to be carefully considered when studying the dynamical behaviour of the owt being these effects highly dependent of the foundation typology used one of the principal effects of the ssi is the change of dynamic properties i e fundamental frequency and damping of the foundation structure system with respect to the fixed base structure the variation in the eigenfrequency has to be carefully considered when designing the owt structure in order to avoid resonance with the excitation frequencies and the corresponding increase in fatigue damage besides the wind and wave loads that present a frequency content below 0 1 hz the principal frequencies to avoid are the rotor frequency 1p and the blade passing frequency 3p or 2p depending on the number of blades the first corresponds to rotor or aerodynamic unbalance loads while the latter is produced by the shadowing effect from the wind of the blades passing the tower the dnv 2002 recommendation is to keep the tower frequency outside the 10 range of these frequencies additionally depending on the relation between the tower fundamental frequency and the aforementioned frequencies three classical designs are distinguished kühn 2001 van der tempel 2006 soft soft if the tower frequency is below the 1p soft stiff if it is between 1p and 3p and stiff stiff when the structural eigenfrequency is higher than 3p the soft soft design is usually avoided as it corresponds to very flexible structures and shows the eigenfrequency near to the wind and wave loads on the other hand the stiff stiff design is not a common choice owing to the high material requirements in order to reach the desired frequencies thus the soft stiff design is the one that is usually adopted this design causes the owt natural frequency to be within a very narrow range highlighting the importance of an accurate estimation despite giving a proper literature review is out of the scope of the present paper the authors want to refer the interested readers to the works of galvín et al 2017 bisoi and haldar 2015 damgaard et al 2014a or zaaijer 2006 where numerous recent studies addressing the influence of the ssi effects on the variation of the owt tower eigenfrequency and damping are presented the present work proposes a simplified substructuring model based on modal parameters to analyse the variations in the fundamental frequency and damping of owt systems due to the ssi effects the whole superstructure is reduced to a punctual mass through its modal mass and height on the other hand the foundation stiffness is addressed through impedance functions obtained numerically by an integral time harmonic model this model makes use of green s functions for the layered half space to represent the soil behaviour and treats the pile discretized by the fem as a timoshenko beam as a load line acting within the soil the one degree of freedom mass and the impedance functions are then coupled together into the proposed simplified substructuring model and the modal approach is validated against a more elaborated substructuring fem model considering the complete superstructure dimensions then the proposed methodology is applied to study the influence of the soil structure system properties on the magnitude of the ssi effects paying special attention to the soil profile the analyses are carried out by assuming characteristic structural properties obtained from data of actual owt systems and soil profiles based on boreholes of the north sea 2 problem statement 2 1 problem definition this paper addresses the dynamic characterization of owt structures founded on monopiles the system is assumed to be composed by a conical hollow tower rotor and generator nacelle located at the tower top and a monopile acting as foundation see fig 1 the tower is connected to the monopile through a transition piece which is a cylindrical hollow beam presenting some working platforms that give access to the owt structure for maintenance or repair activities the monopile is assumed to be a cylindrical hollow beam that is driven into the seabed and that is composed by two different parts the above soil portion and the embedded portion both presenting the same cross section the tower and pile are assumed to be made of the same material the system geometrical and material properties are tower length h t tower top and bottom external diameters d top and d bot ratio between the tower cross section inner and outer diameters δ t henceforth thickness ratio mass of the blades and generator nacelle m r n a above soil pile length h p pile embedded length l p pile external diameter d p pile thickness ratio δ p young s modulus e and density ρ owing to the small aspect ratios that the embedded pile can present in this type of constructions the timoshenko s beam theory is used to model it thus additional geometrical and material properties are required for the embedded pile poisson s ratio ν p shear coefficient α and material hysteretic damping ratio ξ p finally the problem is completely defined by knowing the water depth h w and density ρ w and the soil profile given by the shear wave velocity c s which can change depending on the depth and soil poisson s ratio ν s soil density ρ s and soil hysteretic damping ratio ξ s which are assumed to keep the same value for the whole profile the owt system can be divided into two different parts the superstructure above soil and foundation under soil by considering an infinite rigid base the superstructure dynamic behaviour can be easily characterized by its fundamental frequency f n and damping ratio ξ however if the foundation flexibility is included in the analysis the ssi effects produce a reduction in the system fundamental frequency and changes in the damping ratio the aims of this paper are computing these changes by obtaining the flexible base fundamental frequency f n and equivalent damping ratio ξ and studying how the superstructure the foundation and the soil profile characteristics affect them 2 2 set of existent owts taken as starting point different owt systems that can be found in the literature are selected for analysis in this study their properties and details are presented in table 1 owts 1 12 were extracted from the work of lombardi 2010 and correspond to wind turbines from different wind farms already built in the uk for each farm a range of hub heights was indicated so the maximum and minimum values are considered only information about diameters and thickness of the vestas towers was available so these dimensions are assumed for the siemens towers too on the other hand owts 13 and 14 correspond to systems that have been widely studied in different works e g adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 arany et al 2015 bisoi and haldar 2014 lombardi et al 2013 thus more detailed information about them was accessible however for the selected cases there are very few details available about the dimensions of the transition piece and the length of the pile outside the seabed for this reason the transition from pile to tower is assumed to be produced at water level so the pile length is equal to the water depth h p h w on the other hand some structures present a constant wall thickness while others have a thickness that varies along the height in order to define all the studied owt systems in a coherent way the thickness ratio is kept constant for the whole length by doing so thicker walls are presented at the tower base where the largest diameter is located the values of δ t presented in table 1 are obtained as the mean value of the ones corresponding to the tower top and bottom sections for all the structures the towers and piles are assumed to be made of steel thus a young s modulus e 210 gpa a poisson s ratio ν p 0 25 and a density ρ 7850 kg m3 are assumed in addition for the embedded piles the hysteretic damping coefficient is set to ξ p 2 and the shear coefficient of a hollow circular cross section α 0 5 is used on the other hand a fixed base modal damping ratio of the structure ξ 1 is assumed for the water density ρ w 1000 kg m3 is considered 2 3 soil profile definition the soil profiles assumed for the sites in the analyses are presented in terms of the shear wave velocity c s in fig 2 the value of the c s 30 eurocode 2004 for each profile is also displayed above each plot as it is widely used to characterize the soil the selected profiles corresponds to c 180 c s 30 360 m s or d soils c s 30 180 m s which are the ones where owt systems are usually founded on the principal profiles are two typical boreholes nelson field and hutton tlp of the north sea see bond et al 1997 which consist of different layers of clay and sand the values of the shear wave velocity depend on the soil material and depth and are estimated through eq 1 proposed by ohta and goto 1978 and where p 1 000 1 260 or 1 286 for clay fine sand and medium sand respectively 1 c s 78 98 z 0 312 p m s additionally two soils formed only by clay or medium sand are studied as limit scenarios finally two homogeneous and two variable profiles with identical values of c s 30 180 and 360 m s are selected in order to present results for a wider range of soils and being able to analyse the effects of the soil non homogeneity the latter variable profiles follow the evolution with depth presented in eq 1 as depicted in fig 2 the studied profiles are discretized by piece wise homogeneous layers of 1 m thickness see section 3 1 for depths greater than 80 m the shear velocity is assumed to be constant with depth half space domain soil density ρ s 1800 kg m3 poisson s ratio ν s 0 35 and hysteretic damping factor ξ s 5 are kept constant for the whole profile these soil properties are similar to the ones used in other works for study monopiled owt systems see for instance damgaard et al 2014b 2015 or zania 2014 and can be considered to be representative of common foundation grounds for this type of structures modelled as equivalent elastic media in regard to the aspects studied in this piece of research the influence of the poisson s ratio on the parameters analysed herein was studied and found to be negligible after obtaining virtually the same results for ν s 0 35 0 49 not shown for the sake of brevity which agrees with the conclusions recently drawn by damgaard et al 2015 3 methodology the proposed methodology consists of a three step procedure which results in a simplified model that allows to study the variation of the fundamental frequency and damping due to the foundation stiffness fig 3 sketches out these steps first of all the fixed base superstructure system is reduced to a single degree of freedom system in terms of its shear effective modal mass and height b then the foundation stiffness is modelled through the corresponding impedance functions c finally both parts are coupled together into a three degrees of freedom substructuring model d in the following sections each step is further detailed 3 1 foundation modelling the foundation stiffness is represented by a set of impedance functions k i j which relates the force moment in direction i with the displacement rotation in direction j impedance functions are frequency dependent and complex valued with real and imaginary terms representing the stiffness and damping components respectively as the lateral response of the structure is studied only the lateral rocking and coupled lateral rocking impedances are needed fig 3c the impedance functions are obtained by a previously developed three dimensional time harmonic numerical model álamo et al 2016 where the soil is represented by an integral formulation based on the dynamical reciprocal theorem and the use of pak and guzina 2002 green s functions for a multilayered half space the pile is modelled by the fem as a timoshenko beam and considered as a load line within the soil domain so that its presence does not alter the soil continuity linear behaviour of soil and piles is assumed as well as welded boundary contact condition in the pile soil interface similar assumptions were made by padrón et al 2007 2011 the soil equations are obtained from the integral expression of the reciprocal theorem in elastodynamics wheeler and sternberg 1968 2 γ p u dγ ω b u dω γ p u dγ ω b u dω where u u are the displacements at any point of the domain under study ω layered half space p p are the tractions acting over the boundary γ ω b b are the body forces acting inside the domain and the star index denotes the variables of the fundamental solution considering that the green s functions used as fundamental solution already satisfy the free surface and layer interfaces boundary conditions and that in the studied problem the only forces acting over the domain correspond to the load lines representing the piles the expression of the reciprocal theorem can be reduced to 3 u κ γ l u q l s d γ l where u κ are the displacements at the collocation point κ u the tensor that contains the fundamental solution when the unit load is placed at point κ and q l s the tractions along the load line γ l representing the pile soil interaction tractions acting on the soil discretizing the pile and applying eq 3 to all the pile nodes results in the matrix equation 4 u g q s being u the nodal displacements of the pile g the matrix of coefficients obtained by integrating the fundamental solution times the elemental shape functions and q s the pile soil tractions acting on the soil at the pile nodes on the other hand the pile fem equation is 5 k u q q p f top where k is obtained from the stiffness and mass matrices as k k 1 2 i ξ p ω 2 m being i the imaginary unit and ω the angular frequency q is the matrix that transforms the distributed soil pile tractions acting along the pile q p into nodal forces and f top are the external forces acting on the pile head both formulations are coupled imposing compatibility and equilibrium q s q p conditions along the load lines resulting in a system of linear equations for the computation of each impedance term the corresponding pile head displacements boundary conditions are established and the system of equations is solved for the pile head forces 3 2 fem model for the dynamic characterization of the superstructure the application of the simplified three step procedure mentioned above implies the need of defining effective masses and heights for every configuration these are often obtained through explicit expressions derived for simplified geometries in the present case the realistic geometrical properties assumed herein for the problem under study do not allow following the same strategy for this reason the mass and height that will be used below for the characterization of the superstructure are obtained through a modal analysis based on a finite elements representation of the system which will also allow the assumption of different properties for each structural section at this step fixed base conditions will be assumed the superstructure composed by the conical tower and the above soil portion of the slender pile is modelled as bernoulli beams for this type of structures differences with respect to a more elaborated timoshenko theory are negligible arany et al 2015 constant section two noded four degrees of freedom hermitian beam elements are used for the discretization of both the cylindrical pile and conical tower lengths a high enough number of elements set by proper convergence studies is used to correctly represent the conical tower stiffness the generator and rotor masses are added as a punctual mass at the tower tip node the hydrodynamic water added mass plus the mass of the internal water are also considered for the submerged elements this additional mass is included by using a modified density ρ ρ ρ w c m δ 2 1 δ 2 for the computation of the translational inertia mass matrix of the submerged beam elements an added mass coefficient c m 1 is assumed in this study the consideration of the additional water mass despite significantly increasing the system total mass does not affect the obtained results for the fundamental mode of vibration as observed by zania 2014 considering harmonic displacement and forces the fundamental frequency and its modal shape are obtained by solving the eigenvalues problem 6 k ω 2 m 0 where k and m are the superstructure stiffness and mass matrices obtained by the assembly of the elemental ones as this equation is used to obtain the system modes of vibration no damping is considered the fundamental frequency ω n 2 π f n and its modal shape ϕ n are obtained as the smallest eigenvalue frequency and its eigenvector shape once the modal shape is known the base shear effective modal mass m and height h of the system to a base acceleration excitation can be obtained through see e g chopra 2001 7 m ϕ n t m ι 2 ϕ n t m ϕ n h h t m ϕ n ϕ n t m ι where ι is the influence vector presenting unitary values in the terms that corresponds to lateral displacements and zeros in the components corresponding to rotations and h is the vector containing the height of each node in the terms that correspond to its lateral displacements and unitary values in the components corresponding to rotations the base shear effective modal mass henceforth modal mass coincides with the mass of a single degree of freedom system that produces the same base shear force as the complete system vibrating at the corresponding modal frequency on the other hand the base moment effective modal height henceforth modal height is the height of the aforementioned modal mass at which its inertia force produces the same base overturning moment as the distributed masses of the system at the modal frequency the modal mass and height can also be obtained for all the modes of vibration by using expression 7 with the corresponding modal shapes for higher modes negative modal heights can be obtained which would imply that the base shear force and moment have opposite algebraic signs the choice of these parameters to represent the system is made as the base shear force and moment are the reactions that interact with the foundation impedance functions 3 3 substructuring model for the analysis of the system once the modal parameters of the owt in fixed base conditions and the impedance functions representing the soil foundation system are obtained they are coupled together reducing the problem to a three degrees of freedom model representing the complete system as depicted in fig 3d where u is the mass lateral displacement relative to the base and u b and θ b are the base displacement and rotation in coherence with the model used for the computation of the fixed base modal parameters a given harmonic free field ground lateral acceleration u g is defined as system excitation the equations of motion of the simplified problem can then be expressed in matrix form as 8 k 0 0 0 k h h ω k h r ω 0 k r h ω k r r ω m ω 2 1 1 h 1 1 h h h h 2 u u b θ b m u g 1 1 h where k 2 π f n 2 m 1 2 i ξ is the lateral structural stiffness associated with the first mode that also includes the structural damping through the modal damping factor ξ and k h h ω k r r ω k h r ω and k r h ω are the lateral rocking and coupled dynamic stiffness and damping functions in order to obtain the flexible base fundamental frequency and damping ratio the methodology of finding an equivalent single degree of freedom oscillator that reproduces the system response is used see e g veletsos and meek 1974 medina et al 2013 in this study a hysteretically damped oscillator with natural frequency ω n and damping ratio ξ is assumed and the equivalence is established in terms of the transfer function 9 q ω ω n 2 u u g 1 1 ω 2 ω n 2 2 i ξ which represents the shear force at the base of the structure per effective seismic force chopra 2001 as the single degree of freedom system can not reproduce the response of the substructuring model in all the frequency range the maximum value q m of the transfer function is chosen as common point between both models this maximum value is obtained by iteratively solving eq 8 the flexible base fundamental frequency corresponds to the frequency at which this maximum value takes place while the equivalent damping ratio is computed as ξ 1 2 q m in order to validate the ability of the proposed formulation to correctly capture the flexible base fundamental frequency an enhanced fem model where the presence of the soil pile system is included through the corresponding impedance functions is used for that purpose the displacement of the superstructure due to the ground horizontal acceleration and considering the foundation stiffness and damping is obtained by solving the equation 10 k ω ω 2 m u m ι u g being k ω the superstructure stiffness matrix including the foundation dynamic stiffness and damping functions in the terms that correspond to the ground node and u the vector containing the nodal lateral displacements and rotations relative to the ground displacement the flexible base fundamental frequency is then obtained as the one at which the maximum response in terms of q ω takes place the flexible base fundamental frequencies of the owts defined in table 1 are computed through both the proposed three step and the enhanced fem formulations table 2 shows the computed modified eigenfrequencies together with the errors committed with respect to the enhanced fem model considering the nelson field soil profile the results show negligible differences between both methodologies revealing the ability of the proposed strategy to correctly represent the effects of the foundation on the system fundamental frequency results for harder soils were also obtained producing smaller differences but are not presented for simplicity s sake it is important to notice that both the three step and the fem approaches are substructuring methodologies as they incorporate the foundation impedance functions the principal difference between them is that the three step formulation makes use of the fundamental modal mass and height concepts and therefore considers the fundamental mode only while the fem model does not and takes all modes into account the validation results show that the flexible base fundamental frequency can be accurately estimated by using the three step approach owing to the fact that the first mode of the soil structure system is principally influenced by the first mode of the fixed base structure however the three step methodology does not guarantee a correct estimation of the modified natural frequencies for higher modes the principal advantage of the proposed three step methodology lies in its efficiency and suitability for undertaking parametric studies 4 results 4 1 analysis of the modal properties of the set of owts the results of the modal analysis following the methodology presented in section 3 2 for the studied owt systems are shown in table 3 for each structure their fixed base fundamental frequency and modal mass and height are listed the latter parameters are also presented as the ratio with respect to the system total mass m total including the mass of submerged pile tower nacelle and water added mass or the system total height h total obtained as the sum of the submerged pile and tower lengths the fixed base fundamental frequencies are found to be between 0 2 and 0 55 hz agreeing with the typical range for owt constructions on the other hand the values of the modal mass and height are related to the structural dimensions the modal mass is found to be 25 35 of the system total mass while the modal height coincides with 85 90 of the system total height the obtained modal parameters for the studied owt systems are plotted against each other in fig 4 a strong correlation is found for all the three possible combinations a particularly high dependence between the modal height and fixed base fundamental frequency is found in order to derive an expression that relates the modal parameters the computed modal mass and height values are fitted by first and second order polynomials as functions of the superstructure fixed base eigenfrequency yielding the following expressions 11a h f n 130 138 f n m 11b m f n 4 24 4 84 f n 10 5 kg 12a h f n 161 341 f n 292 f n 2 m 12b m f n 5 92 8 97 f n 4 89 f n 2 10 5 kg the proposed polynomials are also plotted in fig 4a and b as solid lines showing that modal height and mass can be fitted without significant errors by both the linear and quadratic expressions dispersion is higher for modal mass than for modal height the modal mass corresponding to owt number 14 is the only one that does not adequately fit in the obtained mass frequency relations this structure has a higher modal mass owing to its thick tower and pile walls when compared to the rest of the studied systems finally fig 4c shows the relations between modal mass and height obtained by using the proposed polynomials eqs 11 or 12 correctly represent the relation between both parameters the use of these expressions is not recommended outside the frequency range 0 15 0 60 hz shown in fig 4a and b now and once the fixed base fundamental frequency is set modal mass and modal height can be accurately modelled through eq 11 or 12 reducing the number of parameters needed to represent the superstructure by doing so instead of a discrete number of structures a wider set of owt systems representing the typical dimensions for this type of constructions can be included in the results presented in the following sections both the quadratic and linear expressions are used the first fits the data better while the constant slope of the latter allows to easily understand the contribution of each parameter 4 2 analysis of the pile dimensions of the set of owts now that the superstructure is completely defined it is necessary to establish the dimensions of the monopile foundations following the same procedure as for the modal parameters fig 5 presents the relation between the pile diameter a or pile embedded length b and the modal parameters for the owt systems defined in table 1 the data are fitted again by first and second order polynomials a high correlation is found between the pile diameter and the superstructure fixed base fundamental frequency showing that smaller pile diameters tend to correspond to shorter and more rigid structures the fitting procedure yields to the following expressions plotted as solid lines in fig 5a 13 d p f n 4 97 2 40 f n m 14 d p f n 5 40 5 15 f n 3 93 f n 2 m the use of these expressions together with eqs 11 and 12 adequately represents the relations between the pile diameter and superstructure modal mass and height too as shown by the dashed lines in fig 5a on the other hand the pile length can not be correctly adjusted by the polynomial fitting as a function of the fixed base fundamental frequency in this type of constructions the pile embedded length is more dependent on the soil properties than on the superstructural dimensions thus different values of the pile length can be assumed independently of the fixed base fundamental frequency finally the pile wall thickness value is established following the api 2000 recommendation as a function of the pile diameter 15 t p 6 37 d p 100 mm note that δ p d p 2 t p d p 4 3 definition of the characteristic properties for the parametric analysis as commented in the previous section if eq 11 or 12 are used the superstructure can be defined by setting the fixed base fundamental frequency and the structural modal damping values between 0 15 and 0 60 hz are used as a common range within which the owt fixed base eigenfrequency is found on the other hand for the fixed base modal damping ratio a value of ξ 1 is chosen following the recommendation of the gl 2005 guideline the pile diameter and wall thickness are also known once the fixed base fundamental frequency is set by using eqs 13 or 14 and 15 respectively aiming at studying different foundation geometries three values of pile embedded length l p 15 25 and 35 m are considered 4 4 influence of the superstructures parameters on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena in order to explore the influence of the owt fundamental frequency and damping on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena fig 6 presents the ratios f n f n flexible to fixed base natural frequencies ratio and ξ ξ equivalent to structural dampings ratio as functions of the fixed base fundamental frequency of the superstructure computed as detailed in section 3 3 the results are obtained assuming the nelson field soil profile the crosses correspond to the results for the studied owt systems whose modal properties are defined in table 3 and pile dimensions in table 1 on the other hand the lines present the results that are obtained by using the regressions 11 to 15 and assuming a pile embedded length l p 25 m attending to fig 6 the curves from the fitted polynomials follow the overall trends of the points representing the actual owt systems both in the frequency and damping variations thus the use of the fitting expressions is justified for the general study of the ssi effects on the dynamic properties of owt structures at low frequencies f n 0 45 hz virtually the same results are obtained from the use of both the linear or quadratic fitting however at higher frequencies f n 0 45 hz the curves diverge owing to the differences that are produced at these frequencies in the regression polynomials specially the ones of the modal mass and height see fig 4 the quadratic expressions are found to better adjust the real points but as only two points are available within this frequency range one can not discern if it represents the real trend or if it is produced by overfitting issues in order to explain the curve shapes and the differences observed between the results of the real and fitted data one has to consider the influence of each modal parameter fixed base frequency modal mass and height on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena all of these parameters have the same effect increasing its value amplifies the magnitude of the ssi i e fundamental frequency reduction and damping gain this can be easily explained for the modal mass and fixed base fundamental frequency when one of these parameters augments while keeping the other constant an increment of the system stiffness is produced thus the foundation becomes relatively softer compared to the superstructure resulting in more significant ssi phenomena taking place on the other hand the increasing importance of ssi effects for higher wind turbines is in line with the results of zania 2014 and also agrees with the conclusions of veletsos and meek 1974 or stewart et al 1999 showing that the ssi effects becomes more evident as the wave parameter σ c s h f n decreases attending to this the shape of the curves in fig 6 can be explained considering that in their first part f n 0 45 hz the magnitude of the ssi phenomena increases with the fixed base natural frequency while in the second part f n 0 45 hz the effect of the reduction in the modal mass and height fig 4 overtakes the effect of the increment in the eigenfrequency if the linear expressions are used on the other hand if the quadratic relations are considered only the frequency effect is present as the modal mass and height remain practically the same in the high frequency range explaining why the magnitude of the ssi phenomena continues increasing with the fixed base natural frequency these results also prove the importance of including the ssi effects in the preliminary designs of owt structures for f n 0 25 hz the f n f n ratio is found to be around 0 92 8 reduction while for f n 0 25 this reduction can be greater than 15 with one data point at f n 0 25 yielding a f n f n ratio much smaller than the one obtained from the fitted expressions and with the effects of ssi growing with the fixed base fundamental frequency of the superstructure the results in terms of the flexible to fixed base fundamental frequencies ratio f n f n and equivalent to structural dampings ratio ξ ξ for the set of studied owt systems are also presented in table 4 together with the real and imaginary components of each impedance term evaluated at the flexible base fundamental frequency this information gives an insight into the magnitude of the stiffness and damping contribution of the foundation and how it changes depending on the monopile dimensions on the other hand the impedance functions together with the f n f n and ξ ξ ratios corresponding to the use of the regressed expressions and assuming the different soil profiles can be consulted as supplementary material in the online version of the manuscript 4 5 parametric analysis of the influence of the ssi effects on the dynamic properties of owt on monopiles 4 5 1 influence of soil profile figs 7 and 8 present the flexible to fixed base natural frequencies ratio and the equivalent to structural dampings ratio as a function of the fixed base fundamental frequency of the superstructure for the configurations described in section 4 3 the results are grouped according to the use of the linear or the quadratic fitting all soil profiles introduced in section 2 3 are considered first fig 7 shows the results for the two typical north sea s profiles nelson and hutton the sand and clay profiles and the homogeneous soil with c s 30 180 m s as its value is the closest to the one of the nelson field profile then fig 8 compares the results obtained for the homogeneous and variable profiles with c s 30 180 and 360 m s in order to study the effects of harder soils and the influence of the variable with depth profile the soil properties and profile evolution with depth have a direct influence on the magnitude of the ssi effects producing higher variations as the soil becomes softer however the obtained results show the necessity of using a good measure to characterize the soil flexibility using the c s 30 as a value to define the soil seems not to be a feasible option profiles with close e g nelson field and homogeneous in fig 7 or even the same fig 8 value of this mean shear wave velocity produce different frequency and damping variations depending on the evolution with depth of the profile moreover the homogeneous assumption is a non conservative hypothesis as those profiles produce smaller variations in both the fundamental frequency and equivalent damping than variable profiles with similar or higher values of c s 30 the superficial layers are the ones that govern the effects of the ssi on the dynamic properties of the studied structures fig 7 shows that nelson field hutton tlp and clay profiles which present identical properties along the first 10 meters produce virtually the same variations in the system fundamental frequency and damping this is related to the fact that the horizontal impedance of piles in non homogeneous soils is principally determined by the superficial layers kaynia and kausel 1991 miura et al 1994 being this impedance term of crucial importance to the studied problem as expected the magnitude of the ssi phenomena is less significant in harder soils fig 8 however variations over 10 in the system fundamental frequency and over 30 in the structural damping can be produced even for these hard soils fig 8 shows again the importance of accurately knowing the actual soil profile results for the variable with depth soil with c s 30 360 m s are closer to the ones for the c s 30 180 m s homogeneous profile rather than to the homogeneous soil with the same mean velocity 4 5 2 influence of pile diameter the pile diameter has a decisive role in the variations in the fundamental frequency and damping of the superstructure produced due to ssi effects as the foundation stiffness strongly depends on the pile diameter increasing its value results in a great reduction of the shifts in both the system eigenfrequency and damping however this role is not clearly seen in the previous results as the diameter is implicitly defined as a function of the fixed base fundamental frequency fig 9 presents the flexible to fixed base natural frequencies ratio and the equivalent to structural dampings ratio obtained by assuming three frequency independent pile diameters in addition to the results corresponding to the use of the diameter linear regression eq 13 as the same effects are found for all the studied cases only the results corresponding to the linear expressions and for two soils profiles nelson field and homogeneous c s 30 360 m s representing soft and hard soils respectively are shown the curves obtained through the regressed pile diameter present an increment in the magnitude of the ssi phenomena as the fixed base frequency augments due to the reduction in the pile diameter see fig 5 the effect of the pile diameter is almost independent of the pile length or the soil profile however for the softest soil profile the differences between the results of the higher and lower diameters increase e g for nelson field the highest variation in the system fundamental frequency goes from 0 81 to 0 91 depending on the diameter while for the homogeneous c s 30 360 m s this variation goes from 0 89 to 0 95 4 5 3 influence of pile length fig 9 also presents the results obtained assuming two different pile embedment lengths l p 15 m and l p 25 m contrary to the diameter the pile length has little importance on the effects of the foundation on the system fundamental frequency only for the highest diameter and softest soil profile some differences can be seen between the 15 m piles and the longer one this is produced because of the fact that for higher diameters smaller l d ratios the active length of the pile increases moreover the differences between the 15 and 25 m lengths increase for the variable with depth profiles where longer piles can reach stiffer layers the above mentioned effects are also manifested for the damping variations in a greater extent l p 25 m is found to be larger than the active pile length in all cases as results obtained for l p 35 m are completely coincident with those of l p 25 m not shown for the sake of clarity on the other hand for harder soils homogeneous c s 30 360 m s the active length for all diameters is below the 15 m thus no differences are observed between the studied lengths in both the frequency and damping variations 5 conclusions in this paper a substructuring procedure based on modal parameters is presented and used to compute the variations in the structural fundamental frequency and damping due to ssi effects the superstructure is represented by its fixed base fundamental frequency and the first mode base shear effective modal mass and height while the foundation stiffness is considered through impedance functions the proposed modal procedure is applied to owt structures founded on monopiles and validated against an enhanced substructuring fem formulation resulting in a good agreement data from different medium sized existent owt systems that are found in the literature is used to obtain characteristic relations between the fixed base fundamental frequency and the first mode effective height and mass these relations are then employed to study the dynamic behaviour of general owt structures founded on different monopiles and soil profiles the obtained results confirm the importance of considering the foundation stiffness in the design stage of owt systems in order to keep its fundamental frequency within the allowed range and to estimate the equivalent damping ratio of the structure this is specially relevant for foundations consisting of small diameter monopiles on soft soils the magnitude of the ssi phenomenon is significant for f n 0 25 hz and specially for f n 0 45 hz this frequency range usually corresponds to a soft stiff design so special attention is required for those systems whose fundamental frequency is close to the 1p frequency the recommendation of keeping the structural fundamental frequency 10 away from the 1p and 3p or 2p for two bladed rotors frequencies may not be enough if the foundation structure fundamental frequency is not adequately computed as the ssi effects can reduce the fixed base fundamental frequency more than a 15 the present study also highlights the importance of an accurate knowledge of the soil properties and their evolution with depth when evaluating the foundation effects mean values such as c s 30 are insufficient for characterizing the soil stiffness when the assumption of soil homogeneity is unavoidable authors recommend the use of soil properties close to the ones corresponding to the superficial layers as they are the ones that govern the changes in the

23441,the present paper studies the soil structure interaction ssi effects on the dynamic properties of offshore wind turbines owt founded on monopiles for that purpose a three degrees of freedom substructuring model based on modal parameters is proposed the whole superstructure is reduced to a punctual mass by its fundamental modal mass and height while the pile soil stiffness is represented by the corresponding impedance functions the proposed model together with characteristic relations between the fixed base fundamental frequency and the modal parameters obtained from data of existent owts found in the literature is used to analyse the influence of the superstructure and foundation dimensions and soil profile on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena the obtained results confirm the relevance of including the foundation stiffness in the design stage of owt systems as variations in the fundamental frequency close to 15 can be produced the homogeneous assumption even if c s 30 mean values are assumed yields to misleading results if the actual soil profile presents properties that vary with depth the superficial layers of the soil profile are found to play a major role in the estimation of the owt system fundamental frequency and damping when the ssi phenomena are included keywords offshore wind turbines soil structure interaction monopile impedance functions modal analysis multilayered half space 1 introduction in the last years the use of offshore wind turbines owt has experienced a great increment owing to the reduction in cost and the increase in the generators size and power however further research is demanded in order to better understand the dynamic behaviour of their supporting structure and so that design and lifespan can be improved the principal foundation type for owts is the monopile 80 1 of the owt installed in europe are founded on monopiles according to ewea 2016 monopile foundations consist of a short hollow pile with large diameter that is driven into the seabed and are commonly used for water depths of 20 40 m the simplicity of the construction and assembly is the principal advantage of this foundation type however the pile is a very slender structure and consequently more flexible than other foundation configurations e g gravity based or jackets the soil structure interaction ssi effects have to be carefully considered when studying the dynamical behaviour of the owt being these effects highly dependent of the foundation typology used one of the principal effects of the ssi is the change of dynamic properties i e fundamental frequency and damping of the foundation structure system with respect to the fixed base structure the variation in the eigenfrequency has to be carefully considered when designing the owt structure in order to avoid resonance with the excitation frequencies and the corresponding increase in fatigue damage besides the wind and wave loads that present a frequency content below 0 1 hz the principal frequencies to avoid are the rotor frequency 1p and the blade passing frequency 3p or 2p depending on the number of blades the first corresponds to rotor or aerodynamic unbalance loads while the latter is produced by the shadowing effect from the wind of the blades passing the tower the dnv 2002 recommendation is to keep the tower frequency outside the 10 range of these frequencies additionally depending on the relation between the tower fundamental frequency and the aforementioned frequencies three classical designs are distinguished kühn 2001 van der tempel 2006 soft soft if the tower frequency is below the 1p soft stiff if it is between 1p and 3p and stiff stiff when the structural eigenfrequency is higher than 3p the soft soft design is usually avoided as it corresponds to very flexible structures and shows the eigenfrequency near to the wind and wave loads on the other hand the stiff stiff design is not a common choice owing to the high material requirements in order to reach the desired frequencies thus the soft stiff design is the one that is usually adopted this design causes the owt natural frequency to be within a very narrow range highlighting the importance of an accurate estimation despite giving a proper literature review is out of the scope of the present paper the authors want to refer the interested readers to the works of galvín et al 2017 bisoi and haldar 2015 damgaard et al 2014a or zaaijer 2006 where numerous recent studies addressing the influence of the ssi effects on the variation of the owt tower eigenfrequency and damping are presented the present work proposes a simplified substructuring model based on modal parameters to analyse the variations in the fundamental frequency and damping of owt systems due to the ssi effects the whole superstructure is reduced to a punctual mass through its modal mass and height on the other hand the foundation stiffness is addressed through impedance functions obtained numerically by an integral time harmonic model this model makes use of green s functions for the layered half space to represent the soil behaviour and treats the pile discretized by the fem as a timoshenko beam as a load line acting within the soil the one degree of freedom mass and the impedance functions are then coupled together into the proposed simplified substructuring model and the modal approach is validated against a more elaborated substructuring fem model considering the complete superstructure dimensions then the proposed methodology is applied to study the influence of the soil structure system properties on the magnitude of the ssi effects paying special attention to the soil profile the analyses are carried out by assuming characteristic structural properties obtained from data of actual owt systems and soil profiles based on boreholes of the north sea 2 problem statement 2 1 problem definition this paper addresses the dynamic characterization of owt structures founded on monopiles the system is assumed to be composed by a conical hollow tower rotor and generator nacelle located at the tower top and a monopile acting as foundation see fig 1 the tower is connected to the monopile through a transition piece which is a cylindrical hollow beam presenting some working platforms that give access to the owt structure for maintenance or repair activities the monopile is assumed to be a cylindrical hollow beam that is driven into the seabed and that is composed by two different parts the above soil portion and the embedded portion both presenting the same cross section the tower and pile are assumed to be made of the same material the system geometrical and material properties are tower length h t tower top and bottom external diameters d top and d bot ratio between the tower cross section inner and outer diameters δ t henceforth thickness ratio mass of the blades and generator nacelle m r n a above soil pile length h p pile embedded length l p pile external diameter d p pile thickness ratio δ p young s modulus e and density ρ owing to the small aspect ratios that the embedded pile can present in this type of constructions the timoshenko s beam theory is used to model it thus additional geometrical and material properties are required for the embedded pile poisson s ratio ν p shear coefficient α and material hysteretic damping ratio ξ p finally the problem is completely defined by knowing the water depth h w and density ρ w and the soil profile given by the shear wave velocity c s which can change depending on the depth and soil poisson s ratio ν s soil density ρ s and soil hysteretic damping ratio ξ s which are assumed to keep the same value for the whole profile the owt system can be divided into two different parts the superstructure above soil and foundation under soil by considering an infinite rigid base the superstructure dynamic behaviour can be easily characterized by its fundamental frequency f n and damping ratio ξ however if the foundation flexibility is included in the analysis the ssi effects produce a reduction in the system fundamental frequency and changes in the damping ratio the aims of this paper are computing these changes by obtaining the flexible base fundamental frequency f n and equivalent damping ratio ξ and studying how the superstructure the foundation and the soil profile characteristics affect them 2 2 set of existent owts taken as starting point different owt systems that can be found in the literature are selected for analysis in this study their properties and details are presented in table 1 owts 1 12 were extracted from the work of lombardi 2010 and correspond to wind turbines from different wind farms already built in the uk for each farm a range of hub heights was indicated so the maximum and minimum values are considered only information about diameters and thickness of the vestas towers was available so these dimensions are assumed for the siemens towers too on the other hand owts 13 and 14 correspond to systems that have been widely studied in different works e g adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 arany et al 2015 bisoi and haldar 2014 lombardi et al 2013 thus more detailed information about them was accessible however for the selected cases there are very few details available about the dimensions of the transition piece and the length of the pile outside the seabed for this reason the transition from pile to tower is assumed to be produced at water level so the pile length is equal to the water depth h p h w on the other hand some structures present a constant wall thickness while others have a thickness that varies along the height in order to define all the studied owt systems in a coherent way the thickness ratio is kept constant for the whole length by doing so thicker walls are presented at the tower base where the largest diameter is located the values of δ t presented in table 1 are obtained as the mean value of the ones corresponding to the tower top and bottom sections for all the structures the towers and piles are assumed to be made of steel thus a young s modulus e 210 gpa a poisson s ratio ν p 0 25 and a density ρ 7850 kg m3 are assumed in addition for the embedded piles the hysteretic damping coefficient is set to ξ p 2 and the shear coefficient of a hollow circular cross section α 0 5 is used on the other hand a fixed base modal damping ratio of the structure ξ 1 is assumed for the water density ρ w 1000 kg m3 is considered 2 3 soil profile definition the soil profiles assumed for the sites in the analyses are presented in terms of the shear wave velocity c s in fig 2 the value of the c s 30 eurocode 2004 for each profile is also displayed above each plot as it is widely used to characterize the soil the selected profiles corresponds to c 180 c s 30 360 m s or d soils c s 30 180 m s which are the ones where owt systems are usually founded on the principal profiles are two typical boreholes nelson field and hutton tlp of the north sea see bond et al 1997 which consist of different layers of clay and sand the values of the shear wave velocity depend on the soil material and depth and are estimated through eq 1 proposed by ohta and goto 1978 and where p 1 000 1 260 or 1 286 for clay fine sand and medium sand respectively 1 c s 78 98 z 0 312 p m s additionally two soils formed only by clay or medium sand are studied as limit scenarios finally two homogeneous and two variable profiles with identical values of c s 30 180 and 360 m s are selected in order to present results for a wider range of soils and being able to analyse the effects of the soil non homogeneity the latter variable profiles follow the evolution with depth presented in eq 1 as depicted in fig 2 the studied profiles are discretized by piece wise homogeneous layers of 1 m thickness see section 3 1 for depths greater than 80 m the shear velocity is assumed to be constant with depth half space domain soil density ρ s 1800 kg m3 poisson s ratio ν s 0 35 and hysteretic damping factor ξ s 5 are kept constant for the whole profile these soil properties are similar to the ones used in other works for study monopiled owt systems see for instance damgaard et al 2014b 2015 or zania 2014 and can be considered to be representative of common foundation grounds for this type of structures modelled as equivalent elastic media in regard to the aspects studied in this piece of research the influence of the poisson s ratio on the parameters analysed herein was studied and found to be negligible after obtaining virtually the same results for ν s 0 35 0 49 not shown for the sake of brevity which agrees with the conclusions recently drawn by damgaard et al 2015 3 methodology the proposed methodology consists of a three step procedure which results in a simplified model that allows to study the variation of the fundamental frequency and damping due to the foundation stiffness fig 3 sketches out these steps first of all the fixed base superstructure system is reduced to a single degree of freedom system in terms of its shear effective modal mass and height b then the foundation stiffness is modelled through the corresponding impedance functions c finally both parts are coupled together into a three degrees of freedom substructuring model d in the following sections each step is further detailed 3 1 foundation modelling the foundation stiffness is represented by a set of impedance functions k i j which relates the force moment in direction i with the displacement rotation in direction j impedance functions are frequency dependent and complex valued with real and imaginary terms representing the stiffness and damping components respectively as the lateral response of the structure is studied only the lateral rocking and coupled lateral rocking impedances are needed fig 3c the impedance functions are obtained by a previously developed three dimensional time harmonic numerical model álamo et al 2016 where the soil is represented by an integral formulation based on the dynamical reciprocal theorem and the use of pak and guzina 2002 green s functions for a multilayered half space the pile is modelled by the fem as a timoshenko beam and considered as a load line within the soil domain so that its presence does not alter the soil continuity linear behaviour of soil and piles is assumed as well as welded boundary contact condition in the pile soil interface similar assumptions were made by padrón et al 2007 2011 the soil equations are obtained from the integral expression of the reciprocal theorem in elastodynamics wheeler and sternberg 1968 2 γ p u dγ ω b u dω γ p u dγ ω b u dω where u u are the displacements at any point of the domain under study ω layered half space p p are the tractions acting over the boundary γ ω b b are the body forces acting inside the domain and the star index denotes the variables of the fundamental solution considering that the green s functions used as fundamental solution already satisfy the free surface and layer interfaces boundary conditions and that in the studied problem the only forces acting over the domain correspond to the load lines representing the piles the expression of the reciprocal theorem can be reduced to 3 u κ γ l u q l s d γ l where u κ are the displacements at the collocation point κ u the tensor that contains the fundamental solution when the unit load is placed at point κ and q l s the tractions along the load line γ l representing the pile soil interaction tractions acting on the soil discretizing the pile and applying eq 3 to all the pile nodes results in the matrix equation 4 u g q s being u the nodal displacements of the pile g the matrix of coefficients obtained by integrating the fundamental solution times the elemental shape functions and q s the pile soil tractions acting on the soil at the pile nodes on the other hand the pile fem equation is 5 k u q q p f top where k is obtained from the stiffness and mass matrices as k k 1 2 i ξ p ω 2 m being i the imaginary unit and ω the angular frequency q is the matrix that transforms the distributed soil pile tractions acting along the pile q p into nodal forces and f top are the external forces acting on the pile head both formulations are coupled imposing compatibility and equilibrium q s q p conditions along the load lines resulting in a system of linear equations for the computation of each impedance term the corresponding pile head displacements boundary conditions are established and the system of equations is solved for the pile head forces 3 2 fem model for the dynamic characterization of the superstructure the application of the simplified three step procedure mentioned above implies the need of defining effective masses and heights for every configuration these are often obtained through explicit expressions derived for simplified geometries in the present case the realistic geometrical properties assumed herein for the problem under study do not allow following the same strategy for this reason the mass and height that will be used below for the characterization of the superstructure are obtained through a modal analysis based on a finite elements representation of the system which will also allow the assumption of different properties for each structural section at this step fixed base conditions will be assumed the superstructure composed by the conical tower and the above soil portion of the slender pile is modelled as bernoulli beams for this type of structures differences with respect to a more elaborated timoshenko theory are negligible arany et al 2015 constant section two noded four degrees of freedom hermitian beam elements are used for the discretization of both the cylindrical pile and conical tower lengths a high enough number of elements set by proper convergence studies is used to correctly represent the conical tower stiffness the generator and rotor masses are added as a punctual mass at the tower tip node the hydrodynamic water added mass plus the mass of the internal water are also considered for the submerged elements this additional mass is included by using a modified density ρ ρ ρ w c m δ 2 1 δ 2 for the computation of the translational inertia mass matrix of the submerged beam elements an added mass coefficient c m 1 is assumed in this study the consideration of the additional water mass despite significantly increasing the system total mass does not affect the obtained results for the fundamental mode of vibration as observed by zania 2014 considering harmonic displacement and forces the fundamental frequency and its modal shape are obtained by solving the eigenvalues problem 6 k ω 2 m 0 where k and m are the superstructure stiffness and mass matrices obtained by the assembly of the elemental ones as this equation is used to obtain the system modes of vibration no damping is considered the fundamental frequency ω n 2 π f n and its modal shape ϕ n are obtained as the smallest eigenvalue frequency and its eigenvector shape once the modal shape is known the base shear effective modal mass m and height h of the system to a base acceleration excitation can be obtained through see e g chopra 2001 7 m ϕ n t m ι 2 ϕ n t m ϕ n h h t m ϕ n ϕ n t m ι where ι is the influence vector presenting unitary values in the terms that corresponds to lateral displacements and zeros in the components corresponding to rotations and h is the vector containing the height of each node in the terms that correspond to its lateral displacements and unitary values in the components corresponding to rotations the base shear effective modal mass henceforth modal mass coincides with the mass of a single degree of freedom system that produces the same base shear force as the complete system vibrating at the corresponding modal frequency on the other hand the base moment effective modal height henceforth modal height is the height of the aforementioned modal mass at which its inertia force produces the same base overturning moment as the distributed masses of the system at the modal frequency the modal mass and height can also be obtained for all the modes of vibration by using expression 7 with the corresponding modal shapes for higher modes negative modal heights can be obtained which would imply that the base shear force and moment have opposite algebraic signs the choice of these parameters to represent the system is made as the base shear force and moment are the reactions that interact with the foundation impedance functions 3 3 substructuring model for the analysis of the system once the modal parameters of the owt in fixed base conditions and the impedance functions representing the soil foundation system are obtained they are coupled together reducing the problem to a three degrees of freedom model representing the complete system as depicted in fig 3d where u is the mass lateral displacement relative to the base and u b and θ b are the base displacement and rotation in coherence with the model used for the computation of the fixed base modal parameters a given harmonic free field ground lateral acceleration u g is defined as system excitation the equations of motion of the simplified problem can then be expressed in matrix form as 8 k 0 0 0 k h h ω k h r ω 0 k r h ω k r r ω m ω 2 1 1 h 1 1 h h h h 2 u u b θ b m u g 1 1 h where k 2 π f n 2 m 1 2 i ξ is the lateral structural stiffness associated with the first mode that also includes the structural damping through the modal damping factor ξ and k h h ω k r r ω k h r ω and k r h ω are the lateral rocking and coupled dynamic stiffness and damping functions in order to obtain the flexible base fundamental frequency and damping ratio the methodology of finding an equivalent single degree of freedom oscillator that reproduces the system response is used see e g veletsos and meek 1974 medina et al 2013 in this study a hysteretically damped oscillator with natural frequency ω n and damping ratio ξ is assumed and the equivalence is established in terms of the transfer function 9 q ω ω n 2 u u g 1 1 ω 2 ω n 2 2 i ξ which represents the shear force at the base of the structure per effective seismic force chopra 2001 as the single degree of freedom system can not reproduce the response of the substructuring model in all the frequency range the maximum value q m of the transfer function is chosen as common point between both models this maximum value is obtained by iteratively solving eq 8 the flexible base fundamental frequency corresponds to the frequency at which this maximum value takes place while the equivalent damping ratio is computed as ξ 1 2 q m in order to validate the ability of the proposed formulation to correctly capture the flexible base fundamental frequency an enhanced fem model where the presence of the soil pile system is included through the corresponding impedance functions is used for that purpose the displacement of the superstructure due to the ground horizontal acceleration and considering the foundation stiffness and damping is obtained by solving the equation 10 k ω ω 2 m u m ι u g being k ω the superstructure stiffness matrix including the foundation dynamic stiffness and damping functions in the terms that correspond to the ground node and u the vector containing the nodal lateral displacements and rotations relative to the ground displacement the flexible base fundamental frequency is then obtained as the one at which the maximum response in terms of q ω takes place the flexible base fundamental frequencies of the owts defined in table 1 are computed through both the proposed three step and the enhanced fem formulations table 2 shows the computed modified eigenfrequencies together with the errors committed with respect to the enhanced fem model considering the nelson field soil profile the results show negligible differences between both methodologies revealing the ability of the proposed strategy to correctly represent the effects of the foundation on the system fundamental frequency results for harder soils were also obtained producing smaller differences but are not presented for simplicity s sake it is important to notice that both the three step and the fem approaches are substructuring methodologies as they incorporate the foundation impedance functions the principal difference between them is that the three step formulation makes use of the fundamental modal mass and height concepts and therefore considers the fundamental mode only while the fem model does not and takes all modes into account the validation results show that the flexible base fundamental frequency can be accurately estimated by using the three step approach owing to the fact that the first mode of the soil structure system is principally influenced by the first mode of the fixed base structure however the three step methodology does not guarantee a correct estimation of the modified natural frequencies for higher modes the principal advantage of the proposed three step methodology lies in its efficiency and suitability for undertaking parametric studies 4 results 4 1 analysis of the modal properties of the set of owts the results of the modal analysis following the methodology presented in section 3 2 for the studied owt systems are shown in table 3 for each structure their fixed base fundamental frequency and modal mass and height are listed the latter parameters are also presented as the ratio with respect to the system total mass m total including the mass of submerged pile tower nacelle and water added mass or the system total height h total obtained as the sum of the submerged pile and tower lengths the fixed base fundamental frequencies are found to be between 0 2 and 0 55 hz agreeing with the typical range for owt constructions on the other hand the values of the modal mass and height are related to the structural dimensions the modal mass is found to be 25 35 of the system total mass while the modal height coincides with 85 90 of the system total height the obtained modal parameters for the studied owt systems are plotted against each other in fig 4 a strong correlation is found for all the three possible combinations a particularly high dependence between the modal height and fixed base fundamental frequency is found in order to derive an expression that relates the modal parameters the computed modal mass and height values are fitted by first and second order polynomials as functions of the superstructure fixed base eigenfrequency yielding the following expressions 11a h f n 130 138 f n m 11b m f n 4 24 4 84 f n 10 5 kg 12a h f n 161 341 f n 292 f n 2 m 12b m f n 5 92 8 97 f n 4 89 f n 2 10 5 kg the proposed polynomials are also plotted in fig 4a and b as solid lines showing that modal height and mass can be fitted without significant errors by both the linear and quadratic expressions dispersion is higher for modal mass than for modal height the modal mass corresponding to owt number 14 is the only one that does not adequately fit in the obtained mass frequency relations this structure has a higher modal mass owing to its thick tower and pile walls when compared to the rest of the studied systems finally fig 4c shows the relations between modal mass and height obtained by using the proposed polynomials eqs 11 or 12 correctly represent the relation between both parameters the use of these expressions is not recommended outside the frequency range 0 15 0 60 hz shown in fig 4a and b now and once the fixed base fundamental frequency is set modal mass and modal height can be accurately modelled through eq 11 or 12 reducing the number of parameters needed to represent the superstructure by doing so instead of a discrete number of structures a wider set of owt systems representing the typical dimensions for this type of constructions can be included in the results presented in the following sections both the quadratic and linear expressions are used the first fits the data better while the constant slope of the latter allows to easily understand the contribution of each parameter 4 2 analysis of the pile dimensions of the set of owts now that the superstructure is completely defined it is necessary to establish the dimensions of the monopile foundations following the same procedure as for the modal parameters fig 5 presents the relation between the pile diameter a or pile embedded length b and the modal parameters for the owt systems defined in table 1 the data are fitted again by first and second order polynomials a high correlation is found between the pile diameter and the superstructure fixed base fundamental frequency showing that smaller pile diameters tend to correspond to shorter and more rigid structures the fitting procedure yields to the following expressions plotted as solid lines in fig 5a 13 d p f n 4 97 2 40 f n m 14 d p f n 5 40 5 15 f n 3 93 f n 2 m the use of these expressions together with eqs 11 and 12 adequately represents the relations between the pile diameter and superstructure modal mass and height too as shown by the dashed lines in fig 5a on the other hand the pile length can not be correctly adjusted by the polynomial fitting as a function of the fixed base fundamental frequency in this type of constructions the pile embedded length is more dependent on the soil properties than on the superstructural dimensions thus different values of the pile length can be assumed independently of the fixed base fundamental frequency finally the pile wall thickness value is established following the api 2000 recommendation as a function of the pile diameter 15 t p 6 37 d p 100 mm note that δ p d p 2 t p d p 4 3 definition of the characteristic properties for the parametric analysis as commented in the previous section if eq 11 or 12 are used the superstructure can be defined by setting the fixed base fundamental frequency and the structural modal damping values between 0 15 and 0 60 hz are used as a common range within which the owt fixed base eigenfrequency is found on the other hand for the fixed base modal damping ratio a value of ξ 1 is chosen following the recommendation of the gl 2005 guideline the pile diameter and wall thickness are also known once the fixed base fundamental frequency is set by using eqs 13 or 14 and 15 respectively aiming at studying different foundation geometries three values of pile embedded length l p 15 25 and 35 m are considered 4 4 influence of the superstructures parameters on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena in order to explore the influence of the owt fundamental frequency and damping on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena fig 6 presents the ratios f n f n flexible to fixed base natural frequencies ratio and ξ ξ equivalent to structural dampings ratio as functions of the fixed base fundamental frequency of the superstructure computed as detailed in section 3 3 the results are obtained assuming the nelson field soil profile the crosses correspond to the results for the studied owt systems whose modal properties are defined in table 3 and pile dimensions in table 1 on the other hand the lines present the results that are obtained by using the regressions 11 to 15 and assuming a pile embedded length l p 25 m attending to fig 6 the curves from the fitted polynomials follow the overall trends of the points representing the actual owt systems both in the frequency and damping variations thus the use of the fitting expressions is justified for the general study of the ssi effects on the dynamic properties of owt structures at low frequencies f n 0 45 hz virtually the same results are obtained from the use of both the linear or quadratic fitting however at higher frequencies f n 0 45 hz the curves diverge owing to the differences that are produced at these frequencies in the regression polynomials specially the ones of the modal mass and height see fig 4 the quadratic expressions are found to better adjust the real points but as only two points are available within this frequency range one can not discern if it represents the real trend or if it is produced by overfitting issues in order to explain the curve shapes and the differences observed between the results of the real and fitted data one has to consider the influence of each modal parameter fixed base frequency modal mass and height on the magnitude of the ssi phenomena all of these parameters have the same effect increasing its value amplifies the magnitude of the ssi i e fundamental frequency reduction and damping gain this can be easily explained for the modal mass and fixed base fundamental frequency when one of these parameters augments while keeping the other constant an increment of the system stiffness is produced thus the foundation becomes relatively softer compared to the superstructure resulting in more significant ssi phenomena taking place on the other hand the increasing importance of ssi effects for higher wind turbines is in line with the results of zania 2014 and also agrees with the conclusions of veletsos and meek 1974 or stewart et al 1999 showing that the ssi effects becomes more evident as the wave parameter σ c s h f n decreases attending to this the shape of the curves in fig 6 can be explained considering that in their first part f n 0 45 hz the magnitude of the ssi phenomena increases with the fixed base natural frequency while in the second part f n 0 45 hz the effect of the reduction in the modal mass and height fig 4 overtakes the effect of the increment in the eigenfrequency if the linear expressions are used on the other hand if the quadratic relations are considered only the frequency effect is present as the modal mass and height remain practically the same in the high frequency range explaining why the magnitude of the ssi phenomena continues increasing with the fixed base natural frequency these results also prove the importance of including the ssi effects in the preliminary designs of owt structures for f n 0 25 hz the f n f n ratio is found to be around 0 92 8 reduction while for f n 0 25 this reduction can be greater than 15 with one data point at f n 0 25 yielding a f n f n ratio much smaller than the one obtained from the fitted expressions and with the effects of ssi growing with the fixed base fundamental frequency of the superstructure the results in terms of the flexible to fixed base fundamental frequencies ratio f n f n and equivalent to structural dampings ratio ξ ξ for the set of studied owt systems are also presented in table 4 together with the real and imaginary components of each impedance term evaluated at the flexible base fundamental frequency this information gives an insight into the magnitude of the stiffness and damping contribution of the foundation and how it changes depending on the monopile dimensions on the other hand the impedance functions together with the f n f n and ξ ξ ratios corresponding to the use of the regressed expressions and assuming the different soil profiles can be consulted as supplementary material in the online version of the manuscript 4 5 parametric analysis of the influence of the ssi effects on the dynamic properties of owt on monopiles 4 5 1 influence of soil profile figs 7 and 8 present the flexible to fixed base natural frequencies ratio and the equivalent to structural dampings ratio as a function of the fixed base fundamental frequency of the superstructure for the configurations described in section 4 3 the results are grouped according to the use of the linear or the quadratic fitting all soil profiles introduced in section 2 3 are considered first fig 7 shows the results for the two typical north sea s profiles nelson and hutton the sand and clay profiles and the homogeneous soil with c s 30 180 m s as its value is the closest to the one of the nelson field profile then fig 8 compares the results obtained for the homogeneous and variable profiles with c s 30 180 and 360 m s in order to study the effects of harder soils and the influence of the variable with depth profile the soil properties and profile evolution with depth have a direct influence on the magnitude of the ssi effects producing higher variations as the soil becomes softer however the obtained results show the necessity of using a good measure to characterize the soil flexibility using the c s 30 as a value to define the soil seems not to be a feasible option profiles with close e g nelson field and homogeneous in fig 7 or even the same fig 8 value of this mean shear wave velocity produce different frequency and damping variations depending on the evolution with depth of the profile moreover the homogeneous assumption is a non conservative hypothesis as those profiles produce smaller variations in both the fundamental frequency and equivalent damping than variable profiles with similar or higher values of c s 30 the superficial layers are the ones that govern the effects of the ssi on the dynamic properties of the studied structures fig 7 shows that nelson field hutton tlp and clay profiles which present identical properties along the first 10 meters produce virtually the same variations in the system fundamental frequency and damping this is related to the fact that the horizontal impedance of piles in non homogeneous soils is principally determined by the superficial layers kaynia and kausel 1991 miura et al 1994 being this impedance term of crucial importance to the studied problem as expected the magnitude of the ssi phenomena is less significant in harder soils fig 8 however variations over 10 in the system fundamental frequency and over 30 in the structural damping can be produced even for these hard soils fig 8 shows again the importance of accurately knowing the actual soil profile results for the variable with depth soil with c s 30 360 m s are closer to the ones for the c s 30 180 m s homogeneous profile rather than to the homogeneous soil with the same mean velocity 4 5 2 influence of pile diameter the pile diameter has a decisive role in the variations in the fundamental frequency and damping of the superstructure produced due to ssi effects as the foundation stiffness strongly depends on the pile diameter increasing its value results in a great reduction of the shifts in both the system eigenfrequency and damping however this role is not clearly seen in the previous results as the diameter is implicitly defined as a function of the fixed base fundamental frequency fig 9 presents the flexible to fixed base natural frequencies ratio and the equivalent to structural dampings ratio obtained by assuming three frequency independent pile diameters in addition to the results corresponding to the use of the diameter linear regression eq 13 as the same effects are found for all the studied cases only the results corresponding to the linear expressions and for two soils profiles nelson field and homogeneous c s 30 360 m s representing soft and hard soils respectively are shown the curves obtained through the regressed pile diameter present an increment in the magnitude of the ssi phenomena as the fixed base frequency augments due to the reduction in the pile diameter see fig 5 the effect of the pile diameter is almost independent of the pile length or the soil profile however for the softest soil profile the differences between the results of the higher and lower diameters increase e g for nelson field the highest variation in the system fundamental frequency goes from 0 81 to 0 91 depending on the diameter while for the homogeneous c s 30 360 m s this variation goes from 0 89 to 0 95 4 5 3 influence of pile length fig 9 also presents the results obtained assuming two different pile embedment lengths l p 15 m and l p 25 m contrary to the diameter the pile length has little importance on the effects of the foundation on the system fundamental frequency only for the highest diameter and softest soil profile some differences can be seen between the 15 m piles and the longer one this is produced because of the fact that for higher diameters smaller l d ratios the active length of the pile increases moreover the differences between the 15 and 25 m lengths increase for the variable with depth profiles where longer piles can reach stiffer layers the above mentioned effects are also manifested for the damping variations in a greater extent l p 25 m is found to be larger than the active pile length in all cases as results obtained for l p 35 m are completely coincident with those of l p 25 m not shown for the sake of clarity on the other hand for harder soils homogeneous c s 30 360 m s the active length for all diameters is below the 15 m thus no differences are observed between the studied lengths in both the frequency and damping variations 5 conclusions in this paper a substructuring procedure based on modal parameters is presented and used to compute the variations in the structural fundamental frequency and damping due to ssi effects the superstructure is represented by its fixed base fundamental frequency and the first mode base shear effective modal mass and height while the foundation stiffness is considered through impedance functions the proposed modal procedure is applied to owt structures founded on monopiles and validated against an enhanced substructuring fem formulation resulting in a good agreement data from different medium sized existent owt systems that are found in the literature is used to obtain characteristic relations between the fixed base fundamental frequency and the first mode effective height and mass these relations are then employed to study the dynamic behaviour of general owt structures founded on different monopiles and soil profiles the obtained results confirm the importance of considering the foundation stiffness in the design stage of owt systems in order to keep its fundamental frequency within the allowed range and to estimate the equivalent damping ratio of the structure this is specially relevant for foundations consisting of small diameter monopiles on soft soils the magnitude of the ssi phenomenon is significant for f n 0 25 hz and specially for f n 0 45 hz this frequency range usually corresponds to a soft stiff design so special attention is required for those systems whose fundamental frequency is close to the 1p frequency the recommendation of keeping the structural fundamental frequency 10 away from the 1p and 3p or 2p for two bladed rotors frequencies may not be enough if the foundation structure fundamental frequency is not adequately computed as the ssi effects can reduce the fixed base fundamental frequency more than a 15 the present study also highlights the importance of an accurate knowledge of the soil properties and their evolution with depth when evaluating the foundation effects mean values such as c s 30 are insufficient for characterizing the soil stiffness when the assumption of soil homogeneity is unavoidable authors recommend the use of soil properties close to the ones corresponding to the superficial layers as they are the ones that govern the changes in the fundamental frequency and damping ratio due to ssi effects acknowledgements this work was supported by the ministerio de economía industria y competitividad mineco and the agencia estatal de

23442,the present study deals with the derivation of an empirical formula for determining the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater the formulation is achieved in terms of variables representing the porosities of seaward side and shoreward side vertical walls gap between the walls and depth of water this formula is derived based on the results of experimental and theoretical studies carried out on a structure consisting of two vertical porous walls separated by some space the theoretical model is developed by employing the method of eigenfunction expansion which aids the prediction of such hydrodynamic coefficients as transmission reflection and energy dissipation coefficients the values of friction coefficient are calculated by means of a best fit between the predicted and experimental values of hydrodynamic coefficients the validity of the proposed formula is evaluated by conducting experiments and by comparing with published results the results indicate that the proposed empirical formula can be effectively applied for the direct estimation of the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater within the specified range keywords friction coefficient empirical formula vertical breakwater porosity transmission reflection energy dissipation eigenfunction expansion 1 introduction permeable and slender coastal protection systems are emerging due to their relative economy and easy constructability over conventional type breakwaters like rubble mound and gravity breakwaters traditional breakwaters prevent water circulation resulting in deterioration in the quality of water near the coast and hinder fishes and bottom dwelling organisms from passing across rageh and koraim 2010 the width and the weight of the traditional type breakwaters increase with water depth requiring a considerable amount of construction material rageh and koraim 2010 on the other hand permeable breakwaters allow excellent circulation of water thereby improving water quality in harbours and minimizing obstruction to aquatic life compared to conventional rubble mound breakwaters the operative inner harbour space for mooring of vessels can be increased by using vertical permeable breakwaters moreover the use of vertical permeable structures tends to reduce the construction costs for increased water depths the main advantage of these permeable structures is that they considerably reduce disturbances of the coastal environment huang et al 2011 researchers have developed different theoretical models to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of permeable breakwaters huang and ghidaoui 2007 koutandos and prinos 2011 losada et al 1993 the theory of wave energy transmission for an immersed rigid vertical thin barrier was proposed by wiegel 1960 the approximate solution assumed that the transmitted wave power average wave energy per unit time is equal to the wave power below the vertical breakwater wiegel s theory was validated through experiments by reddy and neelamani 1992 hayashi and kano 1966 theoretically and experimentally investigated the hydraulic properties of closely spaced pile breakwaters they presented a theory for the thrust and bending moment exerted on each pile by the waves and for the transmitted waves as well the higher harmonic component effects generated by a barrier on fundamental wave scattering was studied by mei et al 1974 by performing a numerical analysis based on nonlinear matching conditions mei 1989 examined rectangular obstacles to propose a method to solve wave transmission and reflection coefficients theoretically as a function of relative obstacle length and height koley et al 2015 investigated the oblique surface wave scattering by a submerged vertical flexible porous plate in both the cases of water of finite and infinite depths using green s function technique they concluded that the porous effect parameter has small influence on the motion of a highly flexible plate and membrane barriers acting under the influence of higher tensile force the design formulae for the hydraulic design and prediction of response of jarlan type breakwaters were proposed from studies conducted by fugazza and natale 1992 on the wave reduction produced by a perforated vertical barrier with multiple chambers baquerizo et al 2002 analyzed scattering of an edge wave propagating on an infinitely long straight coastline impinging on a permeable coastal structure perpendicular to the coastline the edge wave interaction problem was solved by a mode matching method including a head loss at the structure by assuming that the width of the structure is considerably smaller than the wavelength they established that the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure depend on a friction coefficient f which should be determined experimentally avila et al 2008 improved the model of baquerizo et al 2002 to deal with the edge wave problem for an arbitrary beach profile the studies on linear waves impinging obliquely on rigid vertical thin barriers by applying linear wave theory were performed by losada et al 1992 they used eigenfunction expansion method to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients theoretically the amplitude of the reflected wave reduced with an increase in the angle of incident waves isaacson et al 1999 performed laboratory tests to investigate the wave interactions with double walled vertical permeable structures a numerical model based on an eigenfunction expansion method was developed to validate and compare the results the experimental investigations on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a double vertical wall with impermeable upper part and permeable lower part were conducted by koraim et al 2011 the authors also developed a theoretical model based on an eigenfunction method to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the structure somervell et al 2017 experimentally and theoretically studied hydrodynamic characteristics of a vertical cellular breakwater with double wall and different upper and lower part porosities eigenfunction expansion method was used to develop a theoretical model to study the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater sahoo et al 2000a discussed the scattering problem of surface waves which were obliquely incident on a vertical permeable barrier in finite depth of water for varying barrier configurations with the help of eigenfunction expansion method they observed that the incident wave angle and porosity of the barriers had reduced the reflection of waves amplitude and the hydrodynamic pressure exerted on the barriers sahoo et al 2000b analyzed the wave trapping phenomena by vertical permeable barriers with varying configurations in this case the wave trapping was found to be very sensitive to the position of barrier and porous effect parameter the scattering of oblique waves was studied by behera et al 2016 for a permeable barrier with stepped bottom topography they developed a semi analytic model for the study and established that the model and methodology could be employed to analyze similar problems liu and faraci 2014 developed a semi analytical solution to examine the horizontal wave forces acting on combined caissons breakwater having an inner rubble mound slope the calculated results of the wave forces were validated using the results of multi domain boundary element method they found that the total horizontal wave force was insensitive to the depth of submergence of the front barrier the wave energy dissipation effectiveness of combined caissons breakwaters was investigated by faraci et al 2015 with the help of experiments they established that when the ratio of the depth of water to wavelength increased the reflection coefficient calculated decreased the eigenfunction expansion method is a widely used and acceptable theoretical method to estimate the hydrodynamic characteristics of single and double wall vertical permeable breakwaters ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 huang 2007 isaacson et al 1999 koraim et al 2011 nallayarasu et al 1995 rageh and koraim 2010 teh and venugopal 2013 usha and gayathri 2005 wang et al 2016 the determination of hydrodynamic characteristics of breakwater using eigenfunction expansion method utilizes the values of friction coefficient and added mass coefficient in the case of permeable structures the effect of added mass is usually small in most practical conditions mei et al 1974 urashima et al 1986 so that the added mass coefficient can be considered as zero isaacson et al 1998 1999 koraim 2011 koraim et al 2011 koraim and rageh 2013 losada et al 1993 the friction coefficient is an empirical coefficient that accounts for the viscous effects related to the flow through a porous material and arises from a linearization of the velocity squared term associated with the head loss isaacson et al 2000 usually the values of friction coefficient are determined by means of a best fit between the predicted values and experimental results of various hydrodynamic coefficients with a fixed added mass coefficient ji and suh 2010 koraim 2011 koraim and rageh 2013 rageh and koraim 2010 suh et al 2010 suh and kim 2008 an experimental study of these type of breakwaters is time consuming and laborious moreover it requires an excellent laboratory facility an empirical formula for determining the friction coefficient enables direct estimation of hydrodynamic characteristics of vertical permeable breakwaters with reasonable accuracy suh et al 2011 proposed an empirical formula to calculate the friction coefficient of a perforated wall in terms of porosity and thickness of the perforated wall and the water depth they carried out experiments and used the results of other researchers to obtain the empirical formula the proposed formula was employed to predict the reflection and transmission coefficients of different types of structures including a perforated wall li et al 2006 proposed an empirical equation for estimating the friction coefficient f in terms of b h where b is the thickness of the perforated wall and h is the water depth this equation was obtained by using the least square technique and it compared well with the suggestions of several previous authors kondo 1979 tanimoto and yoshimoto 1982 twu and lin 1991 zhu and chwang 2001 koley and sahoo 2017 developed a coupled eigenfunction expansion boundary element method to analyze the interaction of surface gravity waves with a submerged semicircular porous breakwater placed on a porous seabed in water of finite depth the friction coefficient defined in sollitt and cross model is computed by approximating the spatial dependency of the seepage velocity with the average velocity within the porous media an algorithm for determining the friction coefficient is provided the wave absorbing ability of double walled breakwater is higher than that of a single walled structure fugazza and natale 1992 huang 2007 williams et al 2000 however to the best of the authors knowledge direct estimation of the friction coefficient for double walled permeable vertical breakwaters has not been reported in the published literature so far an empirical formula would be very beneficial for engineers to compute the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater in this work an empirical formula is proposed to determine the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater the methodology involves experimental and theoretical investigation of the hydrodynamic characteristics viz transmission reflection and energy dissipation coefficients of a structure consists of two vertical porous walls separated by some space in order to evaluate the variation in friction coefficient in terms of porosity ε the gap between the vertical walls b and water depth h three pairs of vertical walls are fabricated with porosities ε 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 a theoretical model based on the eigenfunction expansion method is used to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of the structure the values of friction coefficient in the permeability parameter of the structure are estimated by means of best fit between the predicted and experimental values of hydrodynamic coefficients to evaluate the validity of the proposed empirical formula physical model studies are carried out with a prefabricated porous double walled breakwater supported by piles for further validation the theoretical results of this study are compared with the results of a double walled breakwater presented by koraim et al 2011 2 formulation of theoretical model the structure considered in this study consists of two vertical permeable walls separated by some space b 2a a schematic diagram of the structure considered is shown in fig 1 the structure is assumed to be interacting with a monochromatic linear wave of height h i and angular wave frequency ω propagates in constant water depth h a 2 dimensional model of the porous wall structure with a cartesian coordinate system x z is considered here the origin of the coordinate system is located mid way between the vertical walls at still water level the horizontal coordinate x is measured positive towards the shore direction of wave propagation and the z axis is vertical measured upwards from the still water level the fluid domain considered in the formulation is divided into three different regions seaward of the structure is considered as region 1 at x a region 2 represents the space in between the vertical walls at a x a and shoreward of the structure is referred as region 3 at x a the effect of horizontal connections between the vertical walls is neglected the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow is irrotational therefore fluid motion can be described by the velocity potential ϕ p x z t which satisfies the laplace equation the expression for velocity potential is given by isaacson et al 1999 1 ϕ p x z t re i g h i 2 ω 1 cosh k h ϕ p x z e i ω t p 1 2 3 where re the real part of the argument g is the acceleration due to gravity k is the wave number k 2π l l is the wavelength i 1 and p 1 2 3 refers to the three wave regions 2 1 boundary conditions the velocity potential ϕ p x z t satisfies the following boundary

vertical wall where the proportionality constants g 1 g 1 b1 and g 2 g 2 b 2 g 1 and g 2 are the generally complex permeability parameters b 1 and b 2 are the thickness of the seaward and shoreward side walls respectively the real parts g 1 and g 2 correspond to slot resistances and the imaginary parts represent the phase differences between velocity and the pressure the constants g 1 and g 2 have been expressed in several ways by various researchers in the present study the method proposed by isaacson et al 1999 is adopted g 1 and g 2 are expressed as 7 g j ε j f i s j j 1 2 in which ε j are the porosities of the seaward side and shoreward wall respectively and f is the friction coefficient to be determined sollit and cross 1972 employed lorentz principle of equivalent work in the formulation and calculated friction coefficient implicitly through an iterative procedure but an iterative calculation is not feasible when a porous boundary condition is used to solve velocity potentials in the region around structure also the value of f is required to resolve the velocity potential in the present study the values of f are calculated on the basis of a best fit between the theoretical and experimental results also s j is the inertia coefficient given by 8 s j 1 c m 1 ε j ε j j 1 2 in which c m is the added mass coefficient which is considered as constant c m 0 as recommended by isaacson et al 1999 and koraim 2011 2 2 solution of the flow potential an eigenfunction expansion method is employed to obtain the reduced velocity potentials ϕ 1 ϕ 2 and ϕ 3 that satisfy the conditions at the seabed free surface radiation and the conditions at the two walls along x a the expressions for velocity potentials are represented in terms of unknown expansion complex

tank of the offshore structures laboratory of national institute of technology calicut india a single flapped wave maker with maximum stroke distance of 0 38 m generates trains of waves in the wave tank a 0 8 m wide flume is constructed inside the wave tank an artificial beach is constructed with a porous corrugated sheet at the downstream end of the flume to minimize beach reflection the reflection coefficient obtained for the beach is found to be less than 0 10 in the absence of the structure the composite waves formed by superposition of beach reflection and transmission from the porous walls are avoided from the recorded wave data while measuring the transmitted wave heights hence chances of the transmission coefficient values being affected by waves reflected from beach are avoided the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is presented in fig 2 the porous walls are placed at a distance of 7 50 m from the wave paddle two water surface elevation recording positions p1 and p2 were fixed in front of the porous walls to measure the incident h i and reflected wave heights h r as shown in fig 2 p1 and p2 are set at a distance of 0 2 and 0 6 times the incident wavelength 0 2l and 0 6l respectively from the seaward side wall to measure the transmitted wave heights h t another recording position is determined 1 m behind the shoreward side wall more details about the procedure to resolve the incident and reflected wave heights using the two point method is available in goda and suzuki 1976 the measured values of the incident transmitted and reflected wave heights are utilized to determine the wave transmission and reflection coefficients using the following expressions 36 wave transmission coefficient k t h t h i 37 wave reflection coefficient k r h r h i the wave energy dissipation coefficient due to the vertical walls is determined by eq 35 three pairs of vertical walls are fabricated with 25 mm galvanized iron square rods with porosity 0 1 0

proposed empirical formula for friction coefficient froude scaling is adopted for physical modeling and considering the experimental facilities and wave testing conditions a scale of 1 30 is chosen for fixing the model dimensions and wave properties three breakwater models are tested by combining four breakwater walls with different upper part porosities and different upper part depths the porosity of the lower part breakwater walls is kept constant at 0 50 the schematic diagram of the double walled breakwater is shown in fig 3 details of the models tested are presented in table 2 fig 4

development of empirical formula several waves and structural parameters affecting the friction coefficient of vertical permeable breakwaters with single wall have been investigated previously li et al 2006 considered porosity of the wall water depth and perforated wall thickness for evaluating the friction coefficient for a thin porous wall an empirical formula for friction coefficient is proposed by suh et al 2011 in terms of water depth the porosity of the wall and wall thickness in the present study a double walled perforated structure is considered the various wave and structural parameters involved in the process considered are water depth h incident wave height h i wave length l breakwater wall thickness b porosity of the seaward side wall ε 1 porosity of the shoreward side wall ε 2 and gap between the vertical walls b the relationship between friction coefficient and the nondimensional parameters indicating wave and structure characteristics is expressed as 38 f f h l b h ε 1 ε 2 b h and h i l where f is a function the thickness of the vertical wall b and water depth h are kept constant in the present study thus the effect of b h can be neglected the hydrodynamic characteristics k t k r and k d of the double walled vertical permeable structure are investigated for seven different incident wave heights h i and wave lengths l one set of experiment many researchers isaacson et al 1998 1999 koraim et al 2011 losada et al 1993 rageh and koraim 2010 yu 1995 zhu and chwang 2001 have theoretically estimated the hydrodynamic coefficients of vertical permeable breakwater with different values of f initially the theoretical estimates of these hydrodynamic coefficients results were compared with the experimental results and the values of f were estimated on the basis of a best fit between the theoretical and experimental results in this study thirty six sets of experiments are performed to determine the friction coefficient f as a function of the wall porosities ε 1 and ε 2 and the relative gap between the walls b h each set of experiment is obtained by varying the porosities ε 1 and ε 2 and the gap between the vertical walls b for each set wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients are computed for seven different wave periods therefore 252 different experimental conditions table 1 shows the different combinations of parameters employed for deriving the friction coefficient simultaneously these coefficients are calculated using the theoretical model by varying the friction coefficient from 0 1 to 10 0 at an increment of 0 1 the friction coefficient value corresponding to the least root mean squared error rmse between the theoretical model and experimental results is considered the friction coefficient for that particular set root mean squared error is a statistical parameter frequently used to evaluate models in the physical sciences willmott 1981 comparison between the experimental and theoretical results of hydrodynamic coefficients of experiment set 6 table 1 for different f is presented in fig 5 as a random sample it can be observed from fig 5 that a good agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical results of hydrodynamic coefficients when the value of f is between 4 and 5 the friction coefficient value corresponding to the least root mean squared error rmse between the theoretical model and experimental results is obtained for f 4 4 this indicates that the variation of friction coefficient f is insignificant with respect to the seven different incident wave heights h i and wave lengths l employed in the experiments fig 5 therefore the friction coefficients are calculated for each set of seven experiments assuming f to be constant for a set hence the effects of h l and h i l are neglected and the final collection of dimensionless groups can be written as 39 f f ε 1 ε 2 and b h the fitting procedure is repeated for all the 36 cases the variation in friction coefficient f with respect to b h ε 1 and ε 2 are presented in figs 6 8 respectively it is observed from fig 6 that the friction coefficient f decreases with increasing b h similarly the friction coefficient f decreases with increasing porosities of vertical walls ε 1 and ε 2 figs 7 and 8 respectively even though the variations of f with b h ε 1 and ε 2 are significant it is not practical to derive f as a function of only b h or ε 1 or ε 2 since the values are scattered figs 6 8 fig 9 shows the relationship between f and bε 1 ε 2 h it is evident from fig 9 that the friction coefficient decreases with increasing bε 1 ε 2 h and the plot is relatively less scattered when compared with figs 6 8 therefore it is sensible to represent the friction coefficient f in terms of bε 1 ε 2 h the equation for the best fit curve is obtained as 40 f 1 964 b ε 1 ε 2 h 0 174 the correlation coefficient is 0 893 the empirical formula can be used safely in the range 0 25 b h 1 00 0 10 ε 1 0 50 and 0 10 ε 2 0 50 the validity of the proposed formula is restricted to the incoming wave characteristics considered in the study and for constant b h 5 validation of the empirical formula 5 1 comparison with experimental results of a double walled vertical permeable breakwater the validity of the proposed empirical formula for friction coefficient is examined by comparing the theoretical results with the experimental results of a double walled vertical permeable breakwater details of the models tested are presented in table 2 a schematic diagram of the double walled breakwater is also presented fig 3 three breakwater models are tested by combining four breakwater walls with different upper part porosities and different upper part depths from swl the lower part porosity of the breakwater walls is kept constant and equal to 0 50 readers could refer to somervell et al 2017 for details of the formulation of the theoretical model to determine the wave transmission and wave reflection coefficients except for the calculation of permeability parameter g the friction coefficient f associated with the calculation of the permeability parameter g is replaced by the proposed empirical formula for f the friction coefficients of upper part f u and lower part f l of the breakwater are expressed as 41 f u 1 964 b ε u 1 ε u 2 h 0 174 42 f l 1 964 b ε l 1 ε l 2 h 0 174 where ε u1 and ε u2 represent the upper part porosities of the seaward side and the shoreward side breakwater walls respectively ε l1 and ε l2 represent the lower part porosities of the seaward side and the shoreward side breakwater walls respectively in the present case ε l1 ε l2 0 50 the wave energy dissipation coefficient k d of the breakwater is calculated using eq 35 the photographs of breakwater walls used to conduct experiments are shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the experimental and theoretical values of different hydrodynamic coefficients of the breakwater model 1 for different values of h l when b h 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 from fig 11a it is observed that the transmission coefficient k t decreases as h l increases this is due to the combined effect of wave energy and upper part porosity of breakwater for low values of h l h l 0 50 the wave energy is distributed almost constant throughout the water depth due to the relatively high porous lower part a significant portion of wave energy is transmitted through the lower part of the breakwater this is the reason for the high values of transmission coefficient for low values of h l for high values of h l h l 0 50 the wave energy is concentrated towards the swl therefore a major portion of the wave energy is reflected back due to the relatively less porous upper of the breakwater this is the reason for the significant reduction in k t values as h l increases the effect of the gap between the breakwater walls b h is not significant for low values of h l h l 0 50 for h l 0 30 and 2a h 1 00 k t values show a comparatively increasing trend due to the transmission of multi reflected waves also because of the same reason the k t values of 2a h 0 50 and 2a h 0 75 cross each other at h l 0 40 for deep waters h l 0 50 as the gap increases the transmission characteristics become more complex due to the multiple reflections in between the walls as reported by isaacson et al 1999 it is observed from fig 11b that the reflection coefficient k r decreases up to h l 0 20 and then increases this is due to the combined effect of turbulence caused by water particle velocity and depth of the upper part with comparatively low porosity for smaller values of h l water particle velocities are also smaller and more transmission occurs through the lower part of seaward side wall of breakwater this transmission creates turbulence between the two walls as h l increases the turbulence produced also increases and reflection decreases the effect of turbulence dominates up to h l 0 20 and after that the effect of the upper part slowly becomes evident for deep waters the kinetic energy of waves are concentrated towards the still water level reddy and neelamani 1992 and the less porous upper part of the breakwater reflects a major percentage of waves for low values of h l h l 0 20 as gap increases the reflection coefficient decreases this is due to the cushion effect discussed by somervell et al 2017 as h l increases further reflection also increases due to the reflection of waves from the seaward side of the breakwater for deep waters h l 0 50 as the gap b h increases the reflection coefficients found oscillating and become more complex due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves in between the walls of breakwater fig 11c shows the variation of the energy dissipation coefficient k d with respect to h l for different b h as shown in the figure k d increases up to h l 0 25 0 30 and then decreases the increase in the value of k d is due to the fact that when h l is small the wave energy distribution is almost constant throughout the water depth hence the available wave energy at the bottom portion of breakwater is more when compared to deep waters this energy is used for transmission through the lower part of the seaward side wall of breakwater porosity ɛ 1l 0 50 and energy of wave dissipated between the breakwater walls due to the turbulence the maximum wave energy is concentrated towards the swl and considerably reduces towards the seabed for higher h l values hence the effective wave energy available for transmission is relatively less when compared to the case of lower h l values neelamani and rajendran 2002a b the slight reduction in k d for h l 0 30 is due to the increase in reflection of waves from the breakwater k d slightly increases as b h increases up to h l 0 25 and then decreases for deep waters h l 0 50 as gap b h increases k d values found oscillating due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves in between the breakwater walls isaacson et al 1999 fig 12 presents the experimental and theoretical results of hydrodynamic characteristics of model 2 for different values of relative depth h l when the relative spacing between the walls b h 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 it is observed from fig 12a that k t decreases as the relative depth h l increases the transmission coefficient k t slightly decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 35 for higher values of h l h l 0 40 k t remains almost constant for b h 0 50 and 0 75 the k t value for b h 1 00 shows a decrease after h l 0 50 due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves an initial reduction in reflection coefficient k r is observed in fig 12b up to h l 0 20 after that the value of k r increases k r decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 20 and then increases k d increases as h l increases up to some limit h l 0 25 fig 12c and then it declines for higher values of h l h l 0 25 also k d slightly increases with increase in b h up to h l 0 25 and after that decreases fig 13 presents the experimental and theoretical results of wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of model 3 for different values of relative depth h l when the relative spacing between the walls b h 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 as shown in fig 13a it is observed that the transmission coefficient decreases as h l increases k t slightly decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 30 and after that the values follow a reverse trend an initial reduction in reflection coefficient k r is observed in fig 13b up to h l 0 20 after that the value of k r increases k r decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 20 and then increases the effect of b h is evident in fig 13b due to the comparatively high porous seaward side wall of model 3 the energy dissipation coefficient of model 3 increases for smaller values of h l h l 0 35 and reduces for higher values of h l h l 0 35 fig 13c the k d value for b h 1 00 shows an increase after h l 0 50 due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves comparison of the results reveal that a reasonable agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical model results but in some cases the theoretical model slightly underestimates the reflection and transmission coefficients 5 2 comparison with previous predictions and experiments for further validation of the proposed empirical formula the theoretical results of this study were compared with the experimental and theoretical results for a double walled breakwater presented by koraim et al 2011 the upper part of the breakwater was impermeable and lower part with porosity 0 5 they conducted experimental and theoretical investigations with variable relative upper part submergence d h 0 16 and 0 48 and the variable relative gap between the breakwater walls b h 0 40 and 0 80 the tests were conducted with a constant water depth h of 0 40 m and with regular wave trains of fourteen different wave periods in the present study the hydrodynamic coefficients of the breakwater were determined by using the same theoretical model presented by koraim et al 2011 except for the calculation of permeability parameter g the friction coefficient f associated with the computation of the permeability parameter g is replaced by the proposed empirical formula for f koraim et al 2011 used a fixed value for f f 3 while applying the proposed empirical formula the values of f obtained for b h 0 40 and 0 80 are 2 93 and 2 59 respectively figs 14 and 15 present comparison of the results of koraim et al 2011 and results obtained by using the proposed empirical formula for friction coefficient it is evident from figs 14 and 15 that the theoretical model estimates the values of the hydrodynamic coefficients very well however for some low values of h l h l 0 40 the theoretical model slightly overestimates the transmission coefficients 6 conclusions an empirical formula for the friction coefficient f for a double walled permeable breakwater is proposed in the present study as a function of variables such as the porosities of seaward side and shoreward side vertical walls ε 1 and ε 2 the gap between the walls b and water depth h to develop the empirical formula hydraulic experiments and theoretical studies are carried out with a structure consists of two vertical porous walls separated by some space a theoretical model based on an eigenfunction expansion method is used to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure the proposed empirical formula enables the direct estimation of friction coefficient f and permeability parameter g by eqs 40 and 7 respectively without calculating f on the basis of a best fit between the observed and predicted values of various hydrodynamic coefficients the correlation coefficient of the proposed formula is obtained as 0 893 and the formula can be applied effectively for relative gap of range 0 25 1 00 0 25 b h 1 00 and porosity of seaward side and shoreward side wall ranges in between 0 10 and 0 50 0 10 ε 1 0 50 and 0 10 ε 2 0 50 the validity of the proposed formula is restricted to the incoming wave characteristics considered in the study and for constant b h the proposed formula is evaluated by conducting experiments and by comparing with the published results of koraim et al 2011 koraim et al 2011 have used a fixed value for f f 3 while applying the proposed empirical formula the values of f obtained for b h 0 4 and 0 8 are 2 93 and 2 59 respectively comparison of the experimental and theoretical model results reveal that the variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients predicted by the theoretical model with reasonable accuracy results of the study indicate that the proposed empirical formula can be effectively applied for the direct estimation of the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater within the range specified acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance provided by govt of india through

results indicate that the proposed empirical formula can be effectively applied for the direct estimation of the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater within the specified range keywords friction coefficient empirical formula vertical breakwater porosity transmission reflection energy dissipation eigenfunction expansion 1 introduction permeable and slender coastal protection systems are emerging due to their relative economy and easy constructability over conventional type breakwaters like rubble mound and gravity breakwaters traditional breakwaters prevent water circulation resulting in deterioration in the quality of water near the coast and hinder fishes and bottom dwelling organisms from passing across rageh and koraim 2010 the width and the weight of the traditional type breakwaters increase with water depth requiring a considerable amount of construction material rageh and koraim 2010 on the other hand permeable breakwaters allow excellent circulation of water thereby improving water quality in harbours and minimizing obstruction to aquatic life compared to conventional rubble mound breakwaters the operative inner harbour space for mooring of vessels can be increased by using vertical permeable breakwaters moreover the use of vertical permeable structures tends to reduce the construction costs for increased water depths the main advantage of these permeable structures is that they considerably reduce disturbances of the coastal environment huang et al 2011 researchers have developed different theoretical models to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of permeable breakwaters huang and ghidaoui 2007 koutandos and prinos 2011 losada et al 1993 the theory of wave energy transmission for an immersed rigid vertical thin barrier was proposed by wiegel 1960 the approximate solution assumed that the transmitted wave power average wave energy per unit time is equal to the wave power below the vertical breakwater wiegel s theory was validated through experiments by reddy and neelamani 1992 hayashi and kano 1966 theoretically and experimentally investigated the hydraulic properties of closely spaced pile breakwaters they presented a theory for the thrust and bending moment exerted on each pile by the waves and for the transmitted waves as well the higher harmonic component effects generated by a barrier on fundamental wave scattering was studied by mei et al 1974 by performing a numerical analysis based on nonlinear matching conditions mei 1989 examined rectangular obstacles to propose a method to solve wave transmission and reflection coefficients theoretically as a function of relative obstacle length and height koley et al 2015 investigated the oblique surface wave scattering by a submerged vertical flexible porous plate in both the cases of water of finite and infinite depths using green s function technique they concluded that the porous effect parameter has small influence on the motion of a highly flexible plate and membrane barriers acting under the influence of higher tensile force the design formulae for the hydraulic design and prediction of response of jarlan type breakwaters were proposed from studies conducted by fugazza and natale 1992 on the wave reduction produced by a perforated vertical barrier with multiple chambers baquerizo et al 2002 analyzed scattering of an edge wave propagating on an infinitely long straight coastline impinging on a permeable coastal structure perpendicular to the coastline the edge wave interaction problem was solved by a mode matching method including a head loss at the structure by assuming that the width of the structure is considerably smaller than the wavelength they established that the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure depend on a friction coefficient f which should be determined experimentally avila et al 2008 improved the model of baquerizo et al 2002 to deal with the edge wave problem for an arbitrary beach profile the studies on linear waves impinging obliquely on rigid vertical thin barriers by applying linear wave theory were performed by losada et al 1992 they used eigenfunction expansion method to determine the hydrodynamic coefficients theoretically the amplitude of the reflected wave reduced with an increase in the angle of incident waves isaacson et al 1999 performed laboratory tests to investigate the wave interactions with double walled vertical permeable structures a numerical model based on an eigenfunction expansion method was developed to validate and compare the results the experimental investigations on the hydrodynamic characteristics of a double vertical wall with impermeable upper part and permeable lower part were conducted by koraim et al 2011 the authors also developed a theoretical model based on an eigenfunction method to study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the structure somervell et al 2017 experimentally and theoretically studied hydrodynamic characteristics of a vertical cellular breakwater with double wall and different upper and lower part porosities eigenfunction expansion method was used to develop a theoretical model to study the hydrodynamic performance of the breakwater sahoo et al 2000a discussed the scattering problem of surface waves which were obliquely incident on a vertical permeable barrier in finite depth of water for varying barrier configurations with the help of eigenfunction expansion method they observed that the incident wave angle and porosity of the barriers had reduced the reflection of waves amplitude and the hydrodynamic pressure exerted on the barriers sahoo et al 2000b analyzed the wave trapping phenomena by vertical permeable barriers with varying configurations in this case the wave trapping was found to be very sensitive to the position of barrier and porous effect parameter the scattering of oblique waves was studied by behera et al 2016 for a permeable barrier with stepped bottom topography they developed a semi analytic model for the study and established that the model and methodology could be employed to analyze similar problems liu and faraci 2014 developed a semi analytical solution to examine the horizontal wave forces acting on combined caissons breakwater having an inner rubble mound slope the calculated results of the wave forces were validated using the results of multi domain boundary element method they found that the total horizontal wave force was insensitive to the depth of submergence of the front barrier the wave energy dissipation effectiveness of combined caissons breakwaters was investigated by faraci et al 2015 with the help of experiments they established that when the ratio of the depth of water to wavelength increased the reflection coefficient calculated decreased the eigenfunction expansion method is a widely used and acceptable theoretical method to estimate the hydrodynamic characteristics of single and double wall vertical permeable breakwaters ahmed and schlenkhoff 2014 huang 2007 isaacson et al 1999 koraim et al 2011 nallayarasu et al 1995 rageh and koraim 2010 teh and venugopal 2013 usha and gayathri 2005 wang et al 2016 the determination of hydrodynamic characteristics of breakwater using eigenfunction expansion method utilizes the values of friction coefficient and added mass coefficient in the case of permeable structures the effect of added mass is usually small in most practical conditions mei et al 1974 urashima et al 1986 so that the added mass coefficient can be considered as zero isaacson et al 1998 1999 koraim 2011 koraim et al 2011 koraim and rageh 2013 losada et al 1993 the friction coefficient is an empirical coefficient that accounts for the viscous effects related to the flow through a porous material and arises from a linearization of the velocity squared term associated with the head loss isaacson et al 2000 usually the values of friction coefficient are determined by means of a best fit between the predicted values and experimental results of various hydrodynamic coefficients with a fixed added mass coefficient ji and suh 2010 koraim 2011 koraim and rageh 2013 rageh and koraim 2010 suh et al 2010 suh and kim 2008 an experimental study of these type of breakwaters is time consuming and laborious moreover it requires an excellent laboratory facility an empirical formula for determining the friction coefficient enables direct estimation of hydrodynamic characteristics of vertical permeable breakwaters with reasonable accuracy suh et al 2011 proposed an empirical formula to calculate the friction coefficient of a perforated wall in terms of porosity and thickness of the perforated wall and the water depth they carried out experiments and used the results of other researchers to obtain the empirical formula the proposed formula was employed to predict the reflection and transmission coefficients of different types of structures including a perforated wall li et al 2006 proposed an empirical equation for estimating the friction coefficient f in terms of b h where b is the thickness of the perforated wall and h is the water depth this equation was obtained by using the least square technique and it compared well with the suggestions of several previous authors kondo 1979 tanimoto and yoshimoto 1982 twu and lin 1991 zhu and chwang 2001 koley and sahoo 2017 developed a coupled eigenfunction expansion boundary element method to analyze the interaction of surface gravity waves with a submerged semicircular porous breakwater placed on a porous seabed in water of finite depth the friction coefficient defined in sollitt and cross model is computed by approximating the spatial dependency of the seepage velocity with the average velocity within the porous media an algorithm for determining the friction coefficient is provided the wave absorbing ability of double walled breakwater is higher than that of a single walled structure fugazza and natale 1992 huang 2007 williams et al 2000 however to the best of the authors knowledge direct estimation of the friction coefficient for double walled permeable vertical breakwaters has not been reported in the published literature so far an empirical formula would be very beneficial for engineers to compute the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater in this work an empirical formula is proposed to determine the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater the methodology involves experimental and theoretical investigation of the hydrodynamic characteristics viz transmission reflection and energy dissipation coefficients of a structure consists of two vertical porous walls separated by some space in order to evaluate the variation in friction coefficient in terms of porosity ε the gap between the vertical walls b and water depth h three pairs of vertical walls are fabricated with porosities ε 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 a theoretical model based on the eigenfunction expansion method is used to predict the hydrodynamic characteristics of the structure the values of friction coefficient in the permeability parameter of the structure are estimated by means of best fit between the predicted and experimental values of hydrodynamic coefficients to evaluate the validity of the proposed empirical formula physical model studies are carried out with a prefabricated porous double walled breakwater supported by piles for further validation the theoretical results of this study are compared with the results of a double walled breakwater presented by koraim et al 2011 2 formulation of theoretical model the structure considered in this study consists of two vertical permeable walls separated by some space b 2a a schematic diagram of the structure considered is shown in fig 1 the structure is assumed to be interacting with a monochromatic linear wave of height h i and angular wave frequency ω propagates in constant water depth h a 2 dimensional model of the porous wall structure with a cartesian coordinate system x z is considered here the origin of the coordinate system is located mid way between the vertical walls at still water level the horizontal coordinate x is measured positive towards the shore direction of wave propagation and the z axis is vertical measured upwards from the still water level the fluid domain considered in the formulation is divided into three different regions seaward of the structure is considered as region 1 at x a region 2 represents the space in between the vertical walls at a x a and shoreward of the structure is referred as region 3 at x a the effect of horizontal connections between the vertical walls is neglected the fluid is assumed to be incompressible and inviscid and the flow is irrotational therefore fluid motion can be described by the velocity potential ϕ p x z t which satisfies the laplace equation the expression for velocity potential is given by isaacson et al 1999 1 ϕ p x z t re i g h i 2 ω 1 cosh k h ϕ p x z e i ω t p 1 2 3 where re the real part of the argument g is the acceleration due to

tank of the offshore structures laboratory of national institute of technology calicut india a single flapped wave maker with maximum stroke distance of 0 38 m generates trains of waves in the wave tank a 0 8 m wide flume is constructed inside the wave tank an artificial beach is constructed with a porous corrugated sheet at the downstream end of the flume to minimize beach reflection the reflection coefficient obtained for the beach is found to be less than 0 10 in the absence of the structure the composite waves formed by superposition of beach reflection and transmission from the porous walls are avoided from the recorded wave data while measuring the transmitted wave heights hence chances of the transmission coefficient values being affected by waves reflected from beach are avoided the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is presented in fig 2 the porous walls are placed at a distance of 7 50 m from the wave paddle two water surface elevation recording positions p1 and p2 were fixed in front of the porous walls to measure the incident h i and reflected wave heights h r as shown in fig 2 p1 and p2 are set at a distance of 0 2 and 0 6 times the incident wavelength 0 2l and 0 6l respectively from the seaward side wall to measure the transmitted wave heights h t another recording position is determined 1 m behind the shoreward side wall more details about the procedure to resolve the incident and reflected wave heights using the two point method is available in goda and suzuki 1976 the measured values of the incident transmitted and reflected wave heights are utilized to determine the wave transmission and reflection coefficients using the following expressions 36 wave transmission coefficient k t h t h i 37 wave reflection coefficient k r h r h i the wave energy dissipation coefficient due to the vertical walls is determined by eq 35 three pairs of vertical walls are fabricated with 25 mm galvanized iron square rods with porosity 0 1 0

proposed empirical formula for friction coefficient froude scaling is adopted for physical modeling and considering the experimental facilities and wave testing conditions a scale of 1 30 is chosen for fixing the model dimensions and wave properties three breakwater models are tested by combining four breakwater walls with different upper part porosities and different upper part depths the porosity of the lower part breakwater walls is kept constant at 0 50 the schematic diagram of the double walled breakwater is shown in fig 3 details of the models tested are presented in table 2 fig 4

development of empirical formula several waves and structural parameters affecting the friction coefficient of vertical permeable breakwaters with single wall have been investigated previously li et al 2006 considered porosity of the wall water depth and perforated wall thickness for evaluating the friction coefficient for a thin porous wall an empirical formula for friction coefficient is proposed by suh et al 2011 in terms of water depth the porosity of the wall and wall thickness in the present study a double walled perforated structure is considered the various wave and structural parameters involved in the process considered are water depth h incident wave height h i wave length l breakwater wall thickness b porosity of the seaward side wall ε 1 porosity of the shoreward side wall ε 2 and gap between the vertical walls b the relationship between friction coefficient and the nondimensional parameters indicating wave and structure characteristics is expressed as 38 f f h l b h ε 1 ε 2 b h and h i l where f is a function the thickness of the vertical wall b and water depth h are kept constant in the present study thus the effect of b h can be neglected the hydrodynamic characteristics k t k r and k d of the double walled vertical permeable structure are investigated for seven different incident wave heights h i and wave lengths l one set of experiment many researchers isaacson et al 1998 1999 koraim et al 2011 losada et al 1993 rageh and koraim 2010 yu 1995 zhu and chwang 2001 have theoretically estimated the hydrodynamic coefficients of vertical permeable breakwater with different values of f initially the theoretical estimates of these hydrodynamic coefficients results were compared with the experimental results and the values of f were estimated on the basis of a best fit between the theoretical and experimental results in this study thirty six sets of experiments are performed to determine the friction coefficient f as a function of the wall porosities ε 1 and ε 2 and the relative gap between the walls b h each set of experiment is obtained by varying the porosities ε 1 and ε 2 and the gap between the vertical walls b for each set wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation coefficients are computed for seven different wave periods therefore 252 different experimental conditions table 1 shows the different combinations of parameters employed for deriving the friction coefficient simultaneously these coefficients are calculated using the theoretical model by varying the friction coefficient from 0 1 to 10 0 at an increment of 0 1 the friction coefficient value corresponding to the least root mean squared error rmse between the theoretical model and experimental results is considered the friction coefficient for that particular set root mean squared error is a statistical parameter frequently used to evaluate models in the physical sciences willmott 1981 comparison between the experimental and theoretical results of hydrodynamic coefficients of experiment set 6 table 1 for different f is presented in fig 5 as a random sample it can be observed from fig 5 that a good agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical results of hydrodynamic coefficients when the value of f is between 4 and 5 the friction coefficient value corresponding to the least root mean squared error rmse between the theoretical model and experimental results is obtained for f 4 4 this indicates that the variation of friction coefficient f is insignificant with respect to the seven different incident wave heights h i and wave lengths l employed in the experiments fig 5 therefore the friction coefficients are calculated for each set of seven experiments assuming f to be constant for a set hence the effects of h l and h i l are neglected and the final collection of dimensionless groups can be written as 39 f f ε 1 ε 2 and b h the fitting procedure is repeated for all the 36 cases the variation in friction coefficient f with respect to b h ε 1 and ε 2 are presented in figs 6 8 respectively it is observed from fig 6 that the friction coefficient f decreases with increasing b h similarly the friction coefficient f decreases with increasing porosities of vertical walls ε 1 and ε 2 figs 7 and 8 respectively even though the variations of f with b h ε 1 and ε 2 are significant it is not practical to derive f as a function of only b h or ε 1 or ε 2 since the values are scattered figs 6 8 fig 9 shows the relationship between f and bε 1 ε 2 h it is evident from fig 9 that the friction coefficient decreases with increasing bε 1 ε 2 h and the plot is relatively less scattered when compared with figs 6 8 therefore it is sensible to represent the friction coefficient f in terms of bε 1 ε 2 h the equation for the best fit curve is obtained as 40 f 1 964 b ε 1 ε 2 h 0 174 the correlation coefficient is 0 893 the empirical formula can be used safely in the range 0 25 b h 1 00 0 10 ε 1 0 50 and 0 10 ε 2 0 50 the validity of the proposed formula is restricted to the incoming wave characteristics considered in the study and for constant b h 5 validation of the empirical formula 5 1 comparison with experimental results of a double walled vertical permeable breakwater the validity of the proposed empirical formula for friction coefficient is examined by comparing the theoretical results with the experimental results of a double walled vertical permeable breakwater details of the models tested are presented in table 2 a schematic diagram of the double walled breakwater is also presented fig 3 three breakwater models are tested by combining four breakwater walls with different upper part porosities and different upper part depths from swl the lower part porosity of the breakwater walls is kept constant and equal to 0 50 readers could refer to somervell et al 2017 for details of the formulation of the theoretical model to determine the wave transmission and wave reflection coefficients except for the calculation of permeability parameter g the friction coefficient f associated with the calculation of the permeability parameter g is replaced by the proposed empirical formula for f the friction coefficients of upper part f u and lower part f l of the breakwater are expressed as 41 f u 1 964 b ε u 1 ε u 2 h 0 174 42 f l 1 964 b ε l 1 ε l 2 h 0 174 where ε u1 and ε u2 represent the upper part porosities of the seaward side and the shoreward side breakwater walls respectively ε l1 and ε l2 represent the lower part porosities of the seaward side and the shoreward side breakwater walls respectively in the present case ε l1 ε l2 0 50 the wave energy dissipation coefficient k d of the breakwater is calculated using eq 35 the photographs of breakwater walls used to conduct experiments are shown in fig 10 fig 11 shows the experimental and theoretical values of different hydrodynamic coefficients of the breakwater model 1 for different values of h l when b h 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 from fig 11a it is observed that the transmission coefficient k t decreases as h l increases this is due to the combined effect of wave energy and upper part porosity of breakwater for low values of h l h l 0 50 the wave energy is distributed almost constant throughout the water depth due to the relatively high porous lower part a significant portion of wave energy is transmitted through the lower part of the breakwater this is the reason for the high values of transmission coefficient for low values of h l for high values of h l h l 0 50 the wave energy is concentrated towards the swl therefore a major portion of the wave energy is reflected back due to the relatively less porous upper of the breakwater this is the reason for the significant reduction in k t values as h l increases the effect of the gap between the breakwater walls b h is not significant for low values of h l h l 0 50 for h l 0 30 and 2a h 1 00 k t values show a comparatively increasing trend due to the transmission of multi reflected waves also because of the same reason the k t values of 2a h 0 50 and 2a h 0 75 cross each other at h l 0 40 for deep waters h l 0 50 as the gap increases the transmission characteristics become more complex due to the multiple reflections in between the walls as reported by isaacson et al 1999 it is observed from fig 11b that the reflection coefficient k r decreases up to h l 0 20 and then increases this is due to the combined effect of turbulence caused by water particle velocity and depth of the upper part with comparatively low porosity for smaller values of h l water particle velocities are also smaller and more transmission occurs through the lower part of seaward side wall of breakwater this transmission creates turbulence between the two walls as h l increases the turbulence produced also increases and reflection decreases the effect of turbulence dominates up to h l 0 20 and after that the effect of the upper part slowly becomes evident for deep waters the kinetic energy of waves are concentrated towards the still water level reddy and neelamani 1992 and the less porous upper part of the breakwater reflects a major percentage of waves for low values of h l h l 0 20 as gap increases the reflection coefficient decreases this is due to the cushion effect discussed by somervell et al 2017 as h l increases further reflection also increases due to the reflection of waves from the seaward side of the breakwater for deep waters h l 0 50 as the gap b h increases the reflection coefficients found oscillating and become more complex due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves in between the walls of breakwater fig 11c shows the variation of the energy dissipation coefficient k d with respect to h l for different b h as shown in the figure k d increases up to h l 0 25 0 30 and then decreases the increase in the value of k d is due to the fact that when h l is small the wave energy distribution is almost constant throughout the water depth hence the available wave energy at the bottom portion of breakwater is more when compared to deep waters this energy is used for transmission through the lower part of the seaward side wall of breakwater porosity ɛ 1l 0 50 and energy of wave dissipated between the breakwater walls due to the turbulence the maximum wave energy is concentrated towards the swl and considerably reduces towards the seabed for higher h l values hence the effective wave energy available for transmission is relatively less when compared to the case of lower h l values neelamani and rajendran 2002a b the slight reduction in k d for h l 0 30 is due to the increase in reflection of waves from the breakwater k d slightly increases as b h increases up to h l 0 25 and then decreases for deep waters h l 0 50 as gap b h increases k d values found oscillating due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves in between the breakwater walls isaacson et al 1999 fig 12 presents the experimental and theoretical results of hydrodynamic characteristics of model 2 for different values of relative depth h l when the relative spacing between the walls b h 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 it is observed from fig 12a that k t decreases as the relative depth h l increases the transmission coefficient k t slightly decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 35 for higher values of h l h l 0 40 k t remains almost constant for b h 0 50 and 0 75 the k t value for b h 1 00 shows a decrease after h l 0 50 due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves an initial reduction in reflection coefficient k r is observed in fig 12b up to h l 0 20 after that the value of k r increases k r decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 20 and then increases k d increases as h l increases up to some limit h l 0 25 fig 12c and then it declines for higher values of h l h l 0 25 also k d slightly increases with increase in b h up to h l 0 25 and after that decreases fig 13 presents the experimental and theoretical results of wave transmission reflection and energy dissipation characteristics of model 3 for different values of relative depth h l when the relative spacing between the walls b h 0 50 0 75 and 1 00 as shown in fig 13a it is observed that the transmission coefficient decreases as h l increases k t slightly decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 30 and after that the values follow a reverse trend an initial reduction in reflection coefficient k r is observed in fig 13b up to h l 0 20 after that the value of k r increases k r decreases as b h increases up to h l 0 20 and then increases the effect of b h is evident in fig 13b due to the comparatively high porous seaward side wall of model 3 the energy dissipation coefficient of model 3 increases for smaller values of h l h l 0 35 and reduces for higher values of h l h l 0 35 fig 13c the k d value for b h 1 00 shows an increase after h l 0 50 due to the multiple reflections of shorter waves comparison of the results reveal that a reasonable agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical model results but in some cases the theoretical model slightly underestimates the reflection and transmission coefficients 5 2 comparison with previous predictions and experiments for further validation of the proposed empirical formula the theoretical results of this study were compared with the experimental and theoretical results for a double walled breakwater presented by koraim et al 2011 the upper part of the breakwater was impermeable and lower part with porosity 0 5 they conducted experimental and theoretical investigations with variable relative upper part submergence d h 0 16 and 0 48 and the variable relative gap between the breakwater walls b h 0 40 and 0 80 the tests were conducted with a constant water depth h of 0 40 m and with regular wave trains of fourteen different wave periods in the present study the hydrodynamic coefficients of the breakwater were determined by using the same theoretical model presented by koraim et al 2011 except for the calculation of permeability parameter g the friction coefficient f associated with the computation of the permeability parameter g is replaced by the proposed empirical formula for f koraim et al 2011 used a fixed value for f f 3 while applying the proposed empirical formula the values of f obtained for b h 0 40 and 0 80 are 2 93 and 2 59 respectively figs 14 and 15 present comparison of the results of koraim et al 2011 and results obtained by using the proposed empirical formula for friction coefficient it is evident from figs 14 and 15 that the theoretical model estimates the values of the hydrodynamic coefficients very well however for some low values of h l h l 0 40 the theoretical model slightly overestimates the transmission coefficients 6 conclusions an empirical formula for the friction coefficient f for a double walled permeable breakwater is proposed in the present study as a function of variables such as the porosities of seaward side and shoreward side vertical walls ε 1 and ε 2 the gap between the walls b and water depth h to develop the empirical formula hydraulic experiments and theoretical studies are carried out with a structure consists of two vertical porous walls separated by some space a theoretical model based on an eigenfunction expansion method is used to predict the hydrodynamic coefficients of the structure the proposed empirical formula enables the direct estimation of friction coefficient f and permeability parameter g by eqs 40 and 7 respectively without calculating f on the basis of a best fit between the observed and predicted values of various hydrodynamic coefficients the correlation coefficient of the proposed formula is obtained as 0 893 and the formula can be applied effectively for relative gap of range 0 25 1 00 0 25 b h 1 00 and porosity of seaward side and shoreward side wall ranges in between 0 10 and 0 50 0 10 ε 1 0 50 and 0 10 ε 2 0 50 the validity of the proposed formula is restricted to the incoming wave characteristics considered in the study and for constant b h the proposed formula is evaluated by conducting experiments and by comparing with the published results of koraim et al 2011 koraim et al 2011 have used a fixed value for f f 3 while applying the proposed empirical formula the values of f obtained for b h 0 4 and 0 8 are 2 93 and 2 59 respectively comparison of the experimental and theoretical model results reveal that the variation of the hydrodynamic coefficients predicted by the theoretical model with reasonable accuracy results of the study indicate that the proposed empirical formula can be effectively applied for the direct estimation of the friction coefficient of a double walled permeable vertical breakwater within the range specified acknowledgement the authors would like to acknowledge the financial assistance provided by govt of india through

23443,this study presents an empirical parameterization of wave steepness and asymmetries used in the characterization of extreme waves in nearshore environment a large amount of experimental datasets is analyzed for determining possible values of the wave geometric parameters results indicate that the steepness and asymmetries of extreme waves increase with water depth become shallower for the data used here the local relative wave height h s d play a crucial role in determining the geometric parameters of extreme waves different from that in deep water a set of empirical formulas developed based on data analysis establish relationship between the wave geometric parameters and other parameters of engineering interest specifically the first formula expresses the extreme wave steep as a function of the local relative wave height the second formula defines the skewness and asymmetry for extreme waves as a function of the local ursell number from comparisons of the fitted results for different bottom slope it is shown that the bottom slope has a negligible effect on the variations in crest rear steepness mean steepness and horizontal asymmetry but obviously affects the crest front and vertical asymmetry of extreme waves keywords parameterization extreme waves nonlinear interaction shallow water geometric parameter 1 introduction the breaking of ocean waves is a common occurrence and is a crucial element in many oceanographic coastal and ocean engineering problems ramberg and griffin 1987 as a critical limit state extreme waves are usually accompanied by breaking events obtaining a full understanding of such wave breaking and the ability to predict its onset have become the key research areas in these fields based on this issue some criteria based on extreme waves have been proposed to predict the onset of breaking and breaking severity of surface waves the traditional kinematic mechanism simply states that breaking occurs when the horizontal crest particle velocity u exceeds the phase speed c stokes 1880 nepf et al 1998 wu and nepf 2002 along with this mechanism is the breaking criterion that involves the particle acceleration breaking occurs when du dt 0 5g longuet higgins 1963 however application of this criterions to irregular waves is complicated due to the difficulty in measuring crest particle velocity and unable to accurately define the phase velocity for irregular waves tian et al 2008 so these criteria play a limited role in the evolution of nonlinear irregular wave fields perlin et al 2013 to avoid complex calculation while retaining suitability for application in shallow water geometric criteria which typically use limiting steepness and local wave geometry as characteristic parameters are more widely used to predict breaking onset stokes 1880 were the first to theoretically predict that a regular stationary wave is symmetrical and becomes unstable and breaks only if the angle between two lines tangential to its surface profile at the wave crest is 120 which corresponds to a wave steepness of kh 2 0 443 where k 2π l is the wave number h is the wave height and l is the wave length however with decreasing water depth gravity waves become nonlinear and their geometry becomes horizontally asymmetric due to wave crest steepening and wave trough flattening nielsen 1992 drake and calantoni 2001 moreover the wave also exhibits fore aft asymmetry because of wave crest front face steepening toffoli et al 2010 perlin et al 2013 so it is inappropriate to use symmetric wave theory to describe the onset of wave breaking considering the special geometry of extreme waves before breaking longuet higgins 1952 investigated the statistics of extreme waves in a random sea and implied that breaking occurs when the wave height is 0 12 0 14 times the wavelength kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 first investigated the individual limiting wave geometries through field observation in the norwegian sea they explained that the total wave steepness ε h l is not sufficient for asymmetric waves and the crest front steepness ε f as well as the crest rear steepness ε r should be analyzed detailed expressions of these parameters could be seen in section 2 statistical results show that the ε f is between 0 32 and 0 78 and ε r range of 0 26 0 39 inspired by their research duncan 1981 1983 measured the limiting wave height h and wavelength l of steady breaking waves in the laboratory and found the limiting steepness to be 0 31 ramberg and griffin 1987 observed that the mean of h gt 2 where h is the limiting wave height t is the wave period and g is gravitational acceleration associated with spilling breakers was 0 021 corresponding to a limiting mean steepness of 0 41 bonmarin 1989 observed breaking wave profiles from a moving carriage and measured a mean steepness increased from approximately 0 25 to 0 55 subsequent research concentrated on incipient wave breaking due to dispersive focusing and found that breaking could occur at a much lower steepness from 0 15 to 0 22 rapp and melville 1990 yao and wu 2004 recently babanin et al 2010 observed breaking waves due to modulational instability and found that the limiting steepness increased from incipient breakers at about 0 40 to final breakers at 0 44 although wave steepness plays a crucial role in describing extreme waves it is simply defined as the relationship between wave height and wave length hence it cannot represent the horizontal and the vertical wave crest asymmetries tian et al 2008 kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 introduced vertical asymmetry asymmetry a s and horizontal asymmetry skewness s k to better describe the geometry of breaking crests they reported that the limiting vertical and horizontal asymmetry parameters as large as 2 0 and 0 9 respectively bonmarin 1989 measured photos that recorded the whole process of breaking and reported a vertical asymmetry range from 1 20 to 2 14 and a horizontal asymmetry range from 0 69 to 0 77 the aforementioned studies have mainly concentrated on deep and intermediate water depths and relatively little research have been conducted in shallow water condition however breaking events in nearshore region seems more frequent and threaten coastal structures hence a complete understanding of the mechanics of wave breaking in shallow water and the efficient prediction of its onset are important tasks for ocean engineering the studies above generally conclude with either a set of critical parameter values or some change intervals but do not include the specific evolutional process so as the primary motivation of the present research the empirical parameterizations of geometric characteristics for extreme wave are developed moreover many researches revealed that bottom topography has a vital effect on wave transformation in shallow water battjes 1974 dong et al 2014 but this has been rarely considered in previous ocean wave studies therefore the second objective of this paper is to assess the bottom slope effect on extreme waves following the introduction a brief description of wave geometric parameters is presented in section 2 the experimental set

capture the features of extreme events a well defined quantitative description of the geometry of extreme waves is a fundamental key to understanding and then predicting wave breaking kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 babanin et al 2007 the statistics of wave steepness and asymmetry are often used to depict extreme waves babanin et al 2007 toffoli et al 2010 perlin et al 2013 and can be determined easily from the extracted individual profile see fig 1 nevertheless kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 kjeldsen et al 1980 have pointed out that the definition of limiting steepness using zero downcrossing or upcrossing method will obtain different result toffoli et al 2010 defined individual wave steepness which extracted by using zero upcrossing method as crest front steepness and downcrossing method as crest rear steepness in this study both the front and the rear steepness are considered meanwhile the mean steepness which considering both the front and the rear geometries of the extreme waves is also investigated the detailed expression of this set of steepness is defined as follow crest front steepness 1 ε f π η c η f l f crest rear steepness 2 ε r π η c η r l r mean steepness 3 ε m π η c η

where above mentioned η c η f and η r were the elevations of the crest the front trough and the rear trough respectively and λ f λ r λ m were the local wave length determined from the dispersion

noteworthy that the extreme wave steepness and asymmetry parameters are determined by wave probes however the measured profiles were a function of time not space and as such they do not represent exactly the geometry of the surfaces yao and wu 2006 perlin et al 2013 therefore the measured extreme wave profiles only provide some sort of average surface elevations ma et al 2013 3 experimental set up and measuring procedure 3 1 wave flume the experiments were conducted in a wave flume located at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the flume is 50 m long and 3 m wide and used with a water depth of 0 52 m the detailed experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the flume is equipped with a servo motor driven piston type wavemaker with x 0 m defined as the mean position of the wavemaker at the other end of the flume wave absorbers were installed to mitigate wave reflection to ensure the desired two dimensionality associated with unidirectional waves and prevent the occurrence of cross tank modulation the flume is subdivided into two sections by a smooth perspex panel consistent with minimizing viscous effects the narrow section of 1 2 m width is conducted as a working section the present paper concerns data relating to three bottom slopes β 1 15 1 30 1 45 in each case they are constructed using concrete to ensuring the absolutely impermeability to avoid the reflection of waves near the shoreline a horizontal region with a depth of 0 2 m was used data were recorded as time series of water surface elevations by means of capacitance gauges at 10 different locations along the flume the absolute accuracy of each gauge is of order 1 mm prior to probe use each wave gauge was examined for soundness and then calibrated no 1 gauge located at x 13 m was used to measure the initial wave parameters in deep water and to insure the integrity of the shore directed waves nos 2 and 3 gauges located at x 20 6 m 22 4 m along the slope used to measure the deformation of waves nos 5 6 and 7 gauges separately located at 24 m 24 6 m and 26 5 m used to measure the wave conditions in surf zone according to the breaking events happened in each experiment no 4 gauge was removed to the incipient breaking point hence could capture the extreme waves nos 8 9 and 10 gauges were located on the crest used to estimate the reflection from wave absorbers prior experiments have shown that the reflection coefficient is less than 5 thus the effects of reflection are neglected 3 2 wave conditions in the present investigation 14 cases of random waves generating from jonswap spectra with varying peak wave period t p and root mean square wave height h rms are simulated the initial spectra of mechanically generated waves are given by using the modified jonswap spectra suggested by goda 1999 which is expressed by eq 9 9 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the spectral shape parameter σ 0 07 when f 1 t p otherwise σ 0 09 t p is the peak period of spectra f is the frequency and γ is the peak enhancement factor s f is spectra density function and β j is defined as a function of spectrum bandwidths as follow 10 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 the initial surface displacements are given as linear combinations of cosine waves 11 η t i 1 m a i cos ω i t ε i where η t is the surface displacement of the initial wave the value m indicates the number of the component waves m 250 in this research means each spectrum is divided into 250 frequency components ω i 2πf i is circular frequency f i represent the component frequencies ε i denote the initial phase of the i th component wave which is given by uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 2π a i is the amplitude of component waves and could be derived by followed eq 12 12 a i 2 s ω i δ ω i where ω i is the i th component wave and δω i denotes the small interval of circular frequency between w i 1 and w i ῶ i is the representative circular frequency it is a random number between w i 1 and w i δω i could be expressed by 13 δ ω i ω i ω i 1 each record is 163 84s in length with a sample interval of 0 02 s to obtain sufficient number of limiting waves for the statistical analysis for each wave test 20 wave trains are simulated with different initial phases the detailed information regarding these random waves is listed in table 1 ramberg and griffin 1987 pointed out that both spilling and plunging breakers appear to have the same steepness limit although the occurrence of plunging is readily associated with greater energy losing perlin et al 2013 noticed that the steepness of some spillers was not necessarily smaller than that of some plungers which indicated that the magnitude of wave steepness does not influenced by wave breaking strength in this experiment both of these two breaking type were included in order to classify the breaking type we adopt the surf similarity parameter battjes 1974 14 ζ tan β h r m s 0 l 0 where l 0 is the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency and h rms0 is root mean square wave height in deep water the two parameters are estimated based on the data measured at no 1 gauge if ζ 0 4 it suggests predominantly the spilling breakers within the surf zone while if ζ 0 4 plunging breaker is dominant battjes 1974 the visual observation during the experiments approximately coincides the parameter ζ prediction table 2 3 3 preliminary observation paddle calibration is essential to ensure that the generated wave conditions are consistent with the target wave trains outlined in table 1 in this paper the input spectrum which are from theoretical jonswap spectrum are used to contrast those corresponding output spectrum measured from no 1 gauge the six subplots of fig 3 provide comparisons between the target and measured energy spectra s f for a set of selected wave cases with varying period and wave height respectively it is clearly to see that each set of two corresponding energy spectrum are nearly the same which provide the evidence of the success of the adopted calibration to distinguish with the previous researches which were carried out in deep and intermediate water depth it is essential to verify whether the wave states obey the whole shoaling process in shallow water goda 1985 recommended using the shoaling coeffients k s to describe this nonlinear process and was adopted by many researches or designing works 15 k s h h 0 1 1 4 π d l sinh 4 π d l tanh 2 π d l where h and l represent the shoaling wave height and wave length in the location of water depth d h 0 denotes the wave height in deep water correspond to h preliminary tests using k s to assess the wave condition were undertaken regular waves of varying period 0 8 s t 2 0 s are generated at the wave paddle the detailed information of these regular waves is listed in table 3 the statistical evolutions of k s derived from those 7 records were used to contrast the theoretical shoaling coefficients expressed by eq 15 in all cases these data are nearly obey eq 15 which indicate that the experimental data of shallow water are valid fig 4 fig 5 shows the fourier energy spectrum for selected irregular wave case 6 at four different locations in the flume owing to the nonlinear interactions among wave components the energy transfer from primary to higher harmonics is significantly pronounced at the offshore location fig 5a d 0 52 m energy is mostly concentrated on the primary waves with decrease of the water depth wave energy is clearly transferred from the primary waves to the higher harmonics fig 5b and c when waves are at the extreme wave location as can be seen in fig 5c gauge 4 d 0 23 m the second and third harmonics develop more remarkable after breaking fig 5d the entire spectrum loses energy with the exception of the low frequency modes the evolution of the experimental wave energy further proves that this experiment set up could model the transformation of irregular waves in shallow water 3 4 measuring procedure it is well known that the breaking waves deform rapidly hence hard to be captured perlin et al 2013 during the present experimental program no 4 gauge was moved to the incipient breaking point according to the visual observation hence the extreme wave could occur just in the location where probe was arranged and could be captured by this removable gauge as shown in fig 6 the measured wave surface of no 4 and its adjacent no 5 gauge were given the wave surface attained a maximum height in 150s of fig 6a and quickly decreased in the next surface recorded by adjacent gauge fig 6b the detailed individual waves are shown in fig 6a 1 and 6b 1 undoubtedly this decreasing of wave height is due to the occurrence of breaking in such case the individual wave near 150s was thought to be an extreme wave and was extracted to analysis 4 discussion of results 4 1 estimation of limiting wave height limiting wave height is an important parameter for understanding the characteristics of extreme waves thus it has frequently been measured according to the theory of second order stokes waves the coefficient between the limiting wave height h and gt 2 is 0 027 however ramberg and griffin 1987 pointed out that in intermediate water depths the measured wave heights are well below the stokes limiting value and this is mainly caused by increasing nonlinearity they found the relationship coefficient between the two parameters to be 0 021 the measured limiting wave height in this paper is shown in fig 7 the formulas proposed by ramberg and griffin 1987 and the conclusion of second order stoke theory are also presented for convenient comparison it can be seen that the conclusion of second order stoke theory clearly overestimates our measured data which means that water depth has a significant influence on the limiting wave height the data from the 1 15 and 1 30 slopes are a nearly fit with the formulae proposed by ramberg and griffin 1987 though slightly smaller however the limiting wave height measured on the 1 45 slope showed significant deviation from this formulae and was more closely to the stokes theory the primary reason for this could be the slope effect which means that a gentler slope corresponds to weaker nonlinearity at the same water depth 4 2 limiting wave steepness 4 2 1 crest front steepness from the analysis of limiting wave height discussed above the significant roles of nonlinearity and the slope effect on extreme waves can be clearly seen it is well known that the local wave nonlinearity could be measured using the relative wave height h s d goda 1977 battjes and groenendijk 2000 rattanapitikon and shibayama 2007 hence the relationships between the geometric characteristics of extreme wave and the local parameter of h s d are examined first fig 8 shows the evolution of limiting crest front steepness versus local parameter h s d on each slope the open circles represent the data measured on each slope it can be seen that the crest front steepness is initially about 0 52 and then it slowly climbs to about 0 6 in shallower water depth the steepness increase is mainly caused by increasing nonlinearity the initial value acquired in this paper is less than the 0 55 acquired by toffoli et al 2010 kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 reported a range of values between 0 32 and 0 78 which is wider than the range in this paper it should be mentioned that the limiting steepness of a second order stokes wave is 0 446 which still smaller than the initial value in fig 8 this means that the crest front shape of limiting waves is different from second order stokes waves even in relatively deep water in addition to the relative wave height affecting the nonlinear process another important factor is the gradient of the bottom slope battjes 1974 kashima et al 2012 gramstad et al 2013 to investigate the bottom slope effect three sets of data were combined into one picture in fig 9 it can be seen that at the start when h s d 0 45 the data development is almost identical and the slope effect can be neglected however in the following stage when h s d 0 45 the crest front steepness measured in the 1 15 slope is clearly larger than that in the 1 30 and 1 45 slopes this confirms that the slope effect significantly affects the crest front steepness of limiting waves in shallow water the relationships between crest front steepness ε f and local relative wave height parameter h s d are as follow 16 β 1 30 ε f 0 17 h s d 2 5 0 52 17 β 1 30 ε f 0 1 h s d 2 5 0 52 4 2 2 crest rear steepness crest rear steepness ε r is another important parameter related to the characteristic of extreme waves toffoli et al 2010 used steepness distribution to compare crest front and crest rear steepness they reported that the crest rear steepness slightly above 0 44 which was smaller than the crest front steepness of 0 55 they also pointed out that during the process of breaking the crest rear trough almost maintains its shape compared with the crest front trough deepens fig 10 depicts the transformation of ε r relative to water depth for each bottom slope with a decrease in water depth ε r increases slowly from 0 42 to 0 50 the variation in ε r is much smaller than in ε f which could be attributed to a stable form of the crest rear trough it should be pointed out that the initial value of ε r 0 42 is closed to the second order stokes limiting value of 0 446 this implies that during shoaling process the evolution of the crest front trough is more intense than that of the troughs behind the crest furthermore developments of these data are almost identical which illustrates that the slope effect can be neglected as a result the transformation of crest rear steepness is defined as 18 ε r 0 18 h s d 2 0 42 4 2 3 mean steepness although crest front and crest rear steepness can separately depict the front and rear parts of an extreme wave however in some condition both the front and rear geometries of the extreme wave should be considered so it is worthwhile investigating the evolution of mean steepness compared to the consistently increasing trends of ε f and ε r the mean steepness showed an interesting evolution fig 11 shows mean steepness ε m versus local water depth for the three slopes it can be seen that ε m remains quiescent when h s d 0 45 but shows a more intense increase when in the region of h s d 0 45 this indicates that before the water depth decreases to a certain lever the middle part of an extreme wave almost retains its shape it is worth mentioning that the ε m acquired in deep and intermediate water depth by babanin et al 2010 was 0 40 0 44 and ramberg and griffin 1987 found the threshold of ε m to be about 0 41 both these conclusions are closed to the initial value of 0 4 in fig 11 fig 12 which shows data from all three slopes in one picture clearly highlights the slope effect in the evolution of ε m it can be seen that in the first stage when h s d 0 45 the development of these data is almost identical and the slope effect can be neglected however in the following stages caused by the slope effect the data begins to separate into different sections data from the 1 15 slope blue circles seems to increase more rapidly than that from the 1 30 and 1 45 slopes therefore a piecewise function was adopted to describe this trend 19 h s d 0 45 ε m 0 4 h s d 0 45 20 β 1 30 ε m 1 71 h s d 0 37 21 β 1 30 ε m 0 84 h s d 0 02 4 3 further discussion from investigating the evolution of steepness in shallow water it was found that the parameter of local relative wave height is a crucial parameter influencing the distribution of steepness when h s d is below about 0 45 the limiting steepness holds its initial value and has virtually no increase however the evolution of steepness shows an evident increase when water depth decreases to a certain degree and is obviously different from that in deep water some further insight into this phenomenon can be obtained by looking at the wave height distribution at different locations on the slope katsardi and swan 2011 katsardi et al 2013 figs 13 16 concern the relative wave height h d distributions recorded in case 2 and case 11 table 1 in water depth of d 0 30 m 0 23 m 0 15 m and 0 12 m at four different locations on each slope the data recorded by no 1 gauges d 0 52 m are included to provide direct comparison with wave height distributions in deep water for convenient comparison the rayleigh distribution is also plotted the results show that at the initial location on the slope fig 13 d 0 3 m the h d distribution nearly coincide with that measured in deep water and also near the rayleigh distribution due to the weak nonlinear wave interactions with decreasing water depth d 0 23 m fig 14 the relative wave height distribution evidently deviates from that measured in deep water this phenomenon becomes more evident in shallower water d 0 15 and 0 12 m figs 15 and 16 and more far away from rayleigh distribution through observing these figures it should be noticed that when h d 0 45 the statistics on relative wave height measured at different locations are almost identical however this statistical value increases when water depth become shallower when h d 0 45 this verifies the theory reported by katsardi and swan 2011 which states that water depth is the most significant factor controlling the distribution of the largest wave height furthermore the threshold value of h d 0 45 plays a significant role in understanding extreme wave occurrence in shallower water regions in addition the deviation on the 1 15 slope is clearer than that on 1 30 and 1 45 slopes which is another indication of the bottom slope effect 4 4 limiting wave asymmetry skewness and asymmetry of breaking waves are closely related to the sediment transport and then the process of morphology in nearshore region furthermore the evolution of the skewness s k and the asymmetry a s for breaking waves is crucial to understand the structure failure of a coastal defense due to the toe scour and the functionality of a coastal defense to protect the beach behind it from wave attacks and erosions zou and peng 2011 in this section these two parameters of the extreme wave were examined it is found that s k a s can be related to the ursell number defined as 22 u r h s l m d 3 where l m is the local mean wavelength and is determined by the linear dispersion relationship fig 17 showed the skewness and asymmetry of extreme waves versus local u r on each slopes from fig 17a it can be seen that s k is positive and slightly increases with the increase of local ursell number then attains a maximum value about 1 5 the range of s k acquired in this paper is about 0 1 5 wider than the deep water theory of 0 1 which is reported by babanin et al 2007 2010 and toffoli et al 2010 for stokes second order waves s k is 0 61 corresponding to the limiting steepness of 0 443 this could be argued that the skewness of extreme wave in shallower water is larger than that in deep water by comparing of these three slope data in fig 17a it is clearly that the bottom slope has negligible effect on the transformation of s k furthermore kjeldsen et al 1981 presented that the value of s k in deep water was around 0 hence s k 0 as an initial value was considered into the empirical formulae which depict the relationship between s k and u r as follow 23 s k 3 2 tanh 82 u r 1 the evolution of a s versus local u r for each slope are shown in fig 17b it could be seen that a s evolutes in the opposite direction of the coordinate and range from 0 9 to 0 8 kjeldsen et al 1981 reported that the maximum value of a s in deep water could reach to 0 9 which is nearly coincide to the initial value in this paper moreover through an observation in intermediate water depth toffoli et al 2010 presented that the range of a s was between 0 4 and 0 8 narrower than the range in this paper considering the geometric characteristic of a s represented it could be argued that in shallower water breaking waves tilted forward more serious than it in deep water from observing of fig 17b which embeds all these three slope data in one picture there is obvious deviation for a s on different slopes absolute value of a s measured on 1 15 slope is clearly larger than that on slopes 1 30 and 1 45 it is known that asymmetry is the index of energy transfer herbers et al 2000 and the energy transferred on steeper slope is more extensive than those on milder slope kashima et al 2012 dong et al 2014 these revealed that the slope effect could not be neglected in estimating the asymmetry of extreme waves empirical formulae for extreme wave asymmetry are obtained as follow 24 β 1 30 a s 5 9 tanh 100 u r 5 25 β 1 30 a s 6 8 tanh 115 u r 5 9 5 conclusion physical experiments were conducted to develop the empirical formulas describe the geometric characteristics of extreme wave in shallow water and the effect of bottom slope on them was investigated to achieve this objective a number of random waves were generated based on the jonswap spectrum and three bottom slopes β 1 15 1 30 and 1 45 were considered to acquire the geometric parameters such as wave steepness and asymmetries individual extreme waves were captured from wave trains the first sets of formulas provide the parameterization of extreme wave steep in terms of the local relative wave height parameter the second formulas related the asymmetries of extreme wave to the local ursell number by comparing our results with the conclusions of previous studies four main conclusions of this study are 1 the local relative wave height plays a crucial role on the spatial development of extreme wave steepness for the data used here when h s d is below about 0 45 the limiting steepness holds its initial value and has virtually no increase however the evolution of steepness shows an evident increase when water depth decreases to a certain degree and is obviously different from that in deep water 2 the value of extreme wave steepness gradually increases with increasing relative wave height the range of crest front steepness acquired in this paper is about 0 52 0 6 and the crest rear steepness ranges of 0 42 0 5 narrower than the range of crest front steepness mean steepness remains constant value 0 4 at the initial stage but shows a more intense increase when relative wave height become larger moreover the absolute value of skewness and asymmetry for extreme wave is spatially varying increases with a larger ursell number for the data used here the range of skewness and asymmetry acquired in this paper is about 0 1 5 and 0 9 0 8 wider than the deep water theory 3 it was found that the bottom slope effect is significant to the transformation of the crest front steepness mean steepness and asymmetry when β 1 30 however the slope effect on crest rear steepness and skewness is very small and can be neglected 4 the practical applications of our proposed formulas are many these formulas are applicable to predict the location for breaking onset and calculate the geometric characteristics of extreme wave in random wave trains if the corresponding characteristic wave height and local water depth are used as input those proposed formulas also has potential applications in various type of numerical model e g sediment transport model to better capture the coastal dynamic behavior and the evolution of morphology acknowledgement this research is supported financially by the open fund of state key laboratory of coastal and offshore

23443,this study presents an empirical parameterization of wave steepness and asymmetries used in the characterization of extreme waves in nearshore environment a large amount of experimental datasets is analyzed for determining possible values of the wave geometric parameters results indicate that the steepness and asymmetries of extreme waves increase with water depth become shallower for the data used here the local relative wave height h s d play a crucial role in determining the geometric parameters of extreme waves different from that in deep water a set of empirical formulas developed based on data analysis establish relationship between the wave geometric parameters and other parameters of engineering interest specifically the first formula expresses the extreme wave steep as a function of the local relative wave height the second formula defines the skewness and asymmetry for extreme waves as a function of the local ursell number from comparisons of the fitted results for different bottom slope it is shown that the bottom slope has a negligible effect on the variations in crest rear steepness mean steepness and horizontal asymmetry but obviously affects the crest front and vertical asymmetry of extreme waves keywords parameterization extreme waves nonlinear interaction shallow water geometric parameter 1 introduction the breaking of ocean waves is a common occurrence and is a crucial element in many oceanographic coastal and ocean engineering problems ramberg and griffin 1987 as a critical limit state extreme waves are usually accompanied by breaking events obtaining a full understanding of such wave breaking and the ability to predict its onset have become the key research areas in these fields based on this issue some criteria based on extreme waves have been proposed to predict the onset of breaking and breaking severity of surface waves the traditional kinematic mechanism simply states that breaking occurs when the horizontal crest particle velocity u exceeds the phase speed c stokes 1880 nepf et al 1998 wu and nepf 2002 along with this mechanism is the breaking criterion that involves the particle acceleration breaking occurs when du dt 0 5g longuet higgins 1963 however application of this criterions to irregular waves is complicated due to the difficulty in measuring crest particle velocity and unable to accurately define the phase velocity for irregular waves tian et al 2008 so these criteria play a limited role in the evolution of nonlinear irregular wave fields perlin et al 2013 to avoid complex calculation while retaining suitability for application in shallow water geometric criteria which typically use limiting steepness and local wave geometry as characteristic parameters are more widely used to predict breaking onset stokes 1880 were the first to theoretically predict that a regular stationary wave is symmetrical and becomes unstable and breaks only if the angle between two lines tangential to its surface profile at the wave crest is 120 which corresponds to a wave steepness of kh 2 0 443 where k 2π l is the wave number h is the wave height and l is the wave length however with decreasing water depth gravity waves become nonlinear and their geometry becomes horizontally asymmetric due to wave crest steepening and wave trough flattening nielsen 1992 drake and calantoni 2001 moreover the wave also exhibits fore aft asymmetry because of wave crest front face steepening toffoli et al 2010 perlin et al 2013 so it is inappropriate to use symmetric wave theory to describe the onset of wave breaking considering the special geometry of extreme waves before breaking longuet higgins 1952 investigated the statistics of extreme waves in a random sea and implied that breaking occurs when the wave height is 0 12 0 14 times the wavelength kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 first investigated the individual limiting wave geometries through field observation in the norwegian sea they explained that the total wave steepness ε h l is not sufficient for asymmetric waves and the crest front steepness ε f as well as the crest rear steepness ε r should be analyzed detailed expressions of these parameters could be seen in section 2 statistical results show that the ε f is between 0 32 and 0 78 and ε r range of 0 26 0 39 inspired by their research duncan 1981 1983 measured the limiting wave height h and wavelength l of steady breaking waves in the laboratory and found the limiting steepness to be 0 31 ramberg and griffin 1987 observed that the mean of h gt 2 where h is the limiting wave height t is the wave period and g is gravitational acceleration associated with spilling breakers was 0 021 corresponding to a limiting mean steepness of 0 41 bonmarin 1989 observed breaking wave profiles from a moving carriage and measured a mean steepness increased from approximately 0 25 to 0 55 subsequent research concentrated on incipient wave breaking due to dispersive focusing and found that breaking could occur at a much lower steepness from 0 15 to 0 22 rapp and melville 1990 yao and wu 2004 recently babanin et al 2010 observed breaking waves due to modulational instability and found that the limiting steepness increased from incipient breakers at about 0 40 to final breakers at 0 44 although wave steepness plays a crucial role in describing extreme waves it is simply defined as the relationship between wave height and wave length hence it cannot represent the horizontal and the vertical wave crest asymmetries tian et al 2008 kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 introduced vertical asymmetry asymmetry a s and horizontal asymmetry skewness s k to better describe the geometry of breaking crests they reported that the limiting vertical and horizontal asymmetry parameters as large as 2 0 and 0 9 respectively bonmarin 1989 measured photos that recorded the whole process of breaking and reported a vertical asymmetry range from 1 20 to 2 14 and a horizontal asymmetry range from 0 69 to 0 77 the aforementioned studies have mainly concentrated on deep and intermediate water depths and relatively little research have been conducted in shallow water condition however breaking events in nearshore region seems more frequent and threaten coastal structures hence a complete understanding of the mechanics of wave breaking in shallow water and the efficient prediction of its onset are important tasks for ocean engineering the studies above generally conclude with either a set of critical parameter values or some change intervals but do not include the specific evolutional process so as the primary motivation of the present research the empirical parameterizations of geometric characteristics for extreme wave are developed moreover many researches revealed that bottom topography has a vital effect on wave transformation in shallow water battjes 1974 dong et al 2014 but this has been rarely considered in previous ocean wave studies therefore the second objective of this paper is to assess the bottom slope effect on extreme waves following the introduction a brief description of wave geometric parameters is presented in section 2 the experimental set up involving some validation and measuring procedure is introduced in section 3 the results are presented in section 4 and conclusions are given in section 5 2 basic definitions of geometry parameters for extreme wave as discussed in introduction some distinct extreme waves were formed during the evolution of waves investigation on the characteristics of individual waves is an effective way to capture the features of extreme events a well defined quantitative description of the geometry of extreme waves is a fundamental key to understanding and then predicting wave breaking kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 babanin et al 2007 the statistics of wave steepness and asymmetry are often used to depict extreme waves babanin et al 2007 toffoli et al 2010 perlin et al 2013 and can be determined easily from the extracted individual profile see fig 1 nevertheless kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 kjeldsen et al 1980 have pointed out that the definition of limiting steepness using zero downcrossing or upcrossing method will obtain different result toffoli et al 2010 defined individual wave steepness which extracted by using zero upcrossing method as crest front steepness and downcrossing method as crest rear steepness in this study both the front and the rear steepness are considered meanwhile the mean steepness which considering both the front and the rear geometries of the extreme waves is also investigated the detailed expression of this set of steepness is defined as follow crest front steepness 1 ε f π η c η f l f crest rear steepness 2 ε r π η c η r l r mean steepness 3 ε m π η c η f η r 2 l m following kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 and babanin et al 2007 the horizontal asymmetry s k skewness and vertical asymmetry a s asymmetry are defined as 4 s k 2 η c η f η r 1 5 a s t f t r 1 where above mentioned η c η f and η r were the elevations of the crest the front trough and the rear trough respectively and λ f λ r λ m were the local wave length determined from the dispersion relationship 6 2 π t f t f t r 2 g l f tanh 2 π d l f 7 2 π t r t r t f 2 g l r tanh 2 π d l r 8 2 π t 2 g l m tanh 2 π d l m here t f t r t f t r and t represent time interval d is water depth it is noteworthy that the extreme wave steepness and asymmetry parameters are determined by wave probes however the measured profiles were a function of time not space and as such they do not represent exactly the geometry of the surfaces yao and wu 2006 perlin et al 2013 therefore the measured extreme wave profiles only provide some sort of average surface elevations ma et al 2013 3 experimental set up and measuring procedure 3 1 wave flume the experiments were conducted in a wave flume located at the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering dalian university of technology china the flume is 50 m long and 3 m wide and used with a water depth of 0 52 m the detailed experimental setup is shown in fig 2 the flume is equipped with a servo motor driven piston type wavemaker with x 0 m defined as the mean position of the wavemaker at the other end of the flume wave absorbers were installed to mitigate wave reflection to ensure the desired two dimensionality associated with unidirectional waves and prevent the occurrence of cross tank modulation the flume is subdivided into two sections by a smooth perspex panel consistent with minimizing viscous effects the narrow section of 1 2 m width is conducted as a working section the present paper concerns data relating to three bottom slopes β 1 15 1 30 1 45 in each case they are constructed using concrete to ensuring the absolutely impermeability to avoid the reflection of waves near the shoreline a horizontal region with a depth of 0 2 m was used data were recorded as time series of water surface elevations by means of capacitance gauges at 10 different locations along the flume the absolute accuracy of each gauge is of order 1 mm prior to probe use each wave gauge was examined for soundness and then calibrated no 1 gauge located at x 13 m was used to measure the initial wave parameters in deep water and to insure the integrity of the shore directed waves nos 2 and 3 gauges located at x 20 6 m 22 4 m along the slope used to measure the deformation of waves nos 5 6 and 7 gauges separately located at 24 m 24 6 m and 26 5 m used to measure the wave conditions in surf zone according to the breaking events happened in each experiment no 4 gauge was removed to the incipient breaking point hence could capture the extreme waves nos 8 9 and 10 gauges were located on the crest used to estimate the reflection from wave absorbers prior experiments have shown that the reflection coefficient is less than 5 thus the effects of reflection are neglected 3 2 wave conditions in the present investigation 14 cases of random waves generating from jonswap spectra with varying peak wave period t p and root mean square wave height h rms are simulated the initial spectra of mechanically generated waves are given by using the modified jonswap spectra suggested by goda 1999 which is expressed by eq 9 9 s f β j h 1 3 2 t p 4 f 5 exp 5 4 t p f 4 γ exp f f p 1 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the spectral shape parameter σ 0 07 when f 1 t p otherwise σ 0 09 t p is the peak period of spectra f is the frequency and γ is the peak enhancement factor s f is spectra density function and β j is defined as a function of spectrum bandwidths as follow 10 β j 0 06238 1 094 0 01915 ln γ 0 23 0 0336 γ 0 185 1 9 γ 1 the initial surface displacements are given as linear combinations of cosine waves 11 η t i 1 m a i cos ω i t ε i where η t is the surface displacement of the initial wave the value m indicates the number of the component waves m 250 in this research means each spectrum is divided into 250 frequency components ω i 2πf i is circular frequency f i represent the component frequencies ε i denote the initial phase of the i th component wave which is given by uniformly distributed random numbers between 0 and 2π a i is the amplitude of component waves and could be derived by followed eq 12 12 a i 2 s ω i δ ω i where ω i is the i th component wave and δω i denotes the small interval of circular frequency between w i 1 and w i ῶ i is the representative circular frequency it is a random number between w i 1 and w i δω i could be expressed by 13 δ ω i ω i ω i 1 each record is 163 84s in length with a sample interval of 0 02 s to obtain sufficient number of limiting waves for the statistical analysis for each wave test 20 wave trains are simulated with different initial phases the detailed information regarding these random waves is listed in table 1 ramberg and griffin 1987 pointed out that both spilling and plunging breakers appear to have the same steepness limit although the occurrence of plunging is readily associated with greater energy losing perlin et al 2013 noticed that the steepness of some spillers was not necessarily smaller than that of some plungers which indicated that the magnitude of wave steepness does not influenced by wave breaking strength in this experiment both of these two breaking type were included in order to classify the breaking type we adopt the surf similarity parameter battjes 1974 14 ζ tan β h r m s 0 l 0 where l 0 is the wavelength corresponding to the peak frequency and h rms0 is root mean square wave height in deep water the two parameters are estimated based on the data measured at no 1 gauge if ζ 0 4 it suggests predominantly the spilling breakers within the surf zone while if ζ 0 4 plunging breaker is dominant battjes 1974 the visual observation during the experiments approximately coincides the parameter ζ prediction table 2 3 3 preliminary observation paddle calibration is essential to ensure that the generated wave conditions are consistent with the target wave trains outlined in table 1 in this paper the input spectrum which are from theoretical jonswap spectrum are used to contrast those corresponding output spectrum measured from no 1 gauge the six subplots of fig 3 provide comparisons between the target and measured energy spectra s f for a set of selected wave cases with varying period and wave height respectively it is clearly to see that each set of two corresponding energy spectrum are nearly the same which provide the evidence of the success of the adopted calibration to distinguish with the previous researches which were carried out in deep and intermediate water depth it is essential to verify whether the wave states obey the whole shoaling process in shallow water goda 1985 recommended using the shoaling coeffients k s to describe this nonlinear process and was adopted by many researches or designing works 15 k s h h 0 1 1 4 π d l sinh 4 π d l tanh 2 π d l where h and l represent the shoaling wave height and wave length in the location of water depth d h 0 denotes the wave height in deep water correspond to h preliminary tests using k s to assess the wave condition were undertaken regular waves of varying period 0 8 s t 2 0 s are generated at the wave paddle the detailed information of these regular waves is listed in table 3 the statistical evolutions of k s derived from those 7 records were used to contrast the theoretical shoaling coefficients expressed by eq 15 in all cases these data are nearly obey eq 15 which indicate that the experimental data of shallow water are valid fig 4 fig 5 shows the fourier energy spectrum for selected irregular wave case 6 at four different locations in the flume owing to the nonlinear interactions among wave components the energy transfer from primary to higher harmonics is significantly pronounced at the offshore location fig 5a d 0 52 m energy is mostly concentrated on the primary waves with decrease of the water depth wave energy is clearly transferred from the primary waves to the higher harmonics fig 5b and c when waves are at the extreme wave location as can be seen in fig 5c gauge 4 d 0 23 m the second and third harmonics develop more remarkable after breaking fig 5d the entire spectrum loses energy with the exception of the low frequency modes the evolution of the experimental wave energy further proves that this experiment set up could model the transformation of irregular waves in shallow water 3 4 measuring procedure it is well known that the breaking waves deform rapidly hence hard to be captured perlin et al 2013 during the present experimental program no 4 gauge was moved to the incipient breaking point according to the visual observation hence the extreme wave could occur just in the location where probe was arranged and could be captured by this removable gauge as shown in fig 6 the measured wave surface of no 4 and its adjacent no 5 gauge were given the wave surface attained a maximum height in 150s of fig 6a and quickly decreased in the next surface recorded by adjacent gauge fig 6b the detailed individual waves are shown in fig 6a 1 and 6b 1 undoubtedly this decreasing of wave height is due to the occurrence of breaking in such case the individual wave near 150s was thought to be an extreme wave and was extracted to analysis 4 discussion of results 4 1 estimation of limiting wave height limiting wave height is an important parameter for understanding the characteristics of extreme waves thus it has frequently been measured according to the theory of second order stokes waves the coefficient between the limiting wave height h and gt 2 is 0 027 however ramberg and griffin 1987 pointed out that in intermediate water depths the measured wave heights are well below the stokes limiting value and this is mainly caused by increasing nonlinearity they found the relationship coefficient between the two parameters to be 0 021 the measured limiting wave height in this paper is shown in fig 7 the formulas proposed by ramberg and griffin 1987 and the conclusion of second order stoke theory are also presented for convenient comparison it can be seen that the conclusion of second order stoke theory clearly overestimates our measured data which means that water depth has a significant influence on the limiting wave height the data from the 1 15 and 1 30 slopes are a nearly fit with the formulae proposed by ramberg and griffin 1987 though slightly smaller however the limiting wave height measured on the 1 45 slope showed significant deviation from this formulae and was more closely to the stokes theory the primary reason for this could be the slope effect which means that a gentler slope corresponds to weaker nonlinearity at the same water depth 4 2 limiting wave steepness 4 2 1 crest front steepness from the analysis of limiting wave height discussed above the significant roles of nonlinearity and the slope effect on extreme waves can be clearly seen it is well known that the local wave nonlinearity could be measured using the relative wave height h s d goda 1977 battjes and groenendijk 2000 rattanapitikon and shibayama 2007 hence the relationships between the geometric characteristics of extreme wave and the local parameter of h s d are examined first fig 8 shows the evolution of limiting crest front steepness versus local parameter h s d on each slope the open circles represent the data measured on each slope it can be seen that the crest front steepness is initially about 0 52 and then it slowly climbs to about 0 6 in shallower water depth the steepness increase is mainly caused by increasing nonlinearity the initial value acquired in this paper is less than the 0 55 acquired by toffoli et al 2010 kjeldsen and myrhaug 1979 reported a range of values between 0 32 and 0 78 which is wider than the range in this paper it should be mentioned that the limiting steepness of a second order stokes wave is 0 446 which still smaller than the initial value in fig 8 this means that the crest front shape of limiting waves is different from second order stokes waves even in relatively deep water in addition to the relative wave height affecting the nonlinear process another important factor is the gradient of the bottom slope battjes 1974 kashima et al 2012 gramstad et al 2013 to investigate the bottom slope effect three sets of data were combined into one picture in fig 9 it can be seen that at the start when h s d 0 45 the data development is almost identical and the slope effect can be neglected however in the following stage when h s d 0 45 the crest front steepness measured in the 1 15 slope is clearly larger than that in the 1 30 and 1 45 slopes this confirms that the slope effect significantly affects the crest front steepness of limiting waves in shallow water the relationships between crest front steepness ε f and local relative wave height parameter h s d are as follow 16 β 1 30 ε f 0 17 h s d 2 5 0 52 17 β 1 30 ε f 0 1 h s d 2 5 0 52 4 2 2 crest rear steepness crest rear steepness ε r is another important parameter related to the characteristic of extreme waves toffoli et al 2010 used steepness distribution to compare crest front and crest rear steepness they reported that the crest rear steepness slightly above 0 44 which was smaller than the crest front steepness of 0 55 they also pointed out that during the process of breaking the crest rear trough almost maintains its shape compared with the crest front trough deepens fig 10 depicts the transformation of ε r relative to water depth for each bottom slope with a decrease in water depth ε r increases slowly from 0 42 to 0 50 the variation in ε r is much smaller than in ε f which could be attributed to a stable form of the crest rear trough it should be pointed out that the initial value of ε r 0 42 is closed to the second order stokes limiting value of 0 446 this implies that during shoaling process the evolution of the crest front trough is more intense than that of the troughs behind the crest furthermore developments of these data are almost identical which illustrates that the slope effect can be neglected as a result the transformation of crest rear steepness is defined as 18 ε r 0 18 h s d 2 0 42 4 2 3 mean steepness although crest front and crest rear steepness can separately depict the front and rear parts of an extreme wave however in some condition both the front and rear geometries of the extreme wave should be considered so it is worthwhile investigating the evolution of mean steepness compared to the consistently increasing trends of ε f and ε r the mean steepness showed an interesting evolution fig 11 shows mean steepness ε m versus local water depth for the three slopes it can be seen that ε m remains quiescent when h s d 0 45 but shows a more intense increase when in the region of h s d 0 45 this indicates that before the water depth decreases to a certain lever the middle part of an extreme wave almost retains its shape it is worth mentioning that the ε m acquired in deep and intermediate water depth by babanin et al 2010 was 0 40 0 44 and ramberg and griffin 1987 found the threshold of ε m to be about 0 41 both these conclusions are closed to the initial value of 0 4 in fig 11 fig 12 which shows data from all three slopes in one picture clearly highlights the slope effect in the evolution of ε m it can be seen that in the first stage when h s d 0 45 the development of these data is almost identical and the slope effect can be neglected however in the following stages caused by the slope effect the data begins to separate into different sections data from the 1 15 slope blue circles seems to increase more rapidly than that from the 1 30 and 1 45 slopes therefore a piecewise function was adopted to describe this trend 19 h s d 0 45 ε m 0 4 h s d 0 45 20 β 1 30 ε m 1 71 h s d 0 37 21 β 1 30 ε m 0 84 h s d 0 02 4 3 further discussion from investigating the evolution of steepness in shallow water it was found that the parameter of local relative wave height is a crucial parameter influencing the distribution of steepness when h s d is below about 0 45 the limiting steepness holds its initial value and has virtually no increase however the evolution of steepness shows an evident increase when water depth decreases to a certain degree and is obviously different from that in deep water some further insight into this phenomenon can be obtained by looking at the wave height distribution at different locations on the slope katsardi and swan 2011 katsardi et al 2013 figs 13 16 concern the relative wave height h d distributions recorded in case 2 and case 11 table 1 in water depth of d 0 30 m 0 23 m 0 15 m and 0 12 m at four different locations on each slope the data recorded by no 1 gauges d 0 52 m are included to provide direct comparison with wave height distributions in deep water for convenient comparison the rayleigh distribution is also plotted the results show that at the initial location on the slope fig 13 d 0 3 m the h d distribution nearly coincide with that measured in deep water and also near the rayleigh distribution due to the weak nonlinear wave interactions with decreasing water depth d 0 23 m fig 14 the relative wave height distribution evidently deviates from that measured in deep water this phenomenon becomes more evident in shallower water d 0 15 and 0 12 m figs 15 and 16 and more far away from rayleigh distribution through observing these figures it should be noticed that when h d 0 45 the statistics on relative wave height measured at different locations are almost identical however this statistical value increases when water depth become shallower when h d 0 45 this verifies the theory reported by katsardi and swan 2011 which states that water depth is the most significant factor controlling the distribution of the largest wave height furthermore the threshold value of h d 0 45 plays a significant role in understanding extreme wave occurrence in shallower water regions in addition the deviation on the 1 15 slope is clearer than that on 1 30 and 1 45 slopes which is another indication of the bottom slope effect 4 4 limiting wave asymmetry skewness and asymmetry of breaking waves are closely related to the sediment transport and then the process of morphology in nearshore region furthermore the evolution of the skewness s k and the asymmetry a s for breaking waves is crucial to understand the structure failure of a coastal defense due to the toe scour and the functionality of a coastal defense to protect the beach behind it from wave attacks and erosions zou and peng 2011 in this section these two parameters of the extreme wave were examined it is found that s k a s can be related to the ursell number defined as 22 u r h s l m d 3 where l m is the local mean wavelength and is determined by the linear dispersion relationship fig 17 showed the skewness and asymmetry of extreme waves versus local u r on each slopes from fig 17a it can be seen that s k is positive and slightly increases with the increase of local ursell number then attains a maximum value about 1 5 the range of s k acquired in this paper is about 0 1 5 wider than the deep water theory of 0 1 which is reported by babanin et al 2007 2010 and toffoli et al 2010 for stokes second order waves s k is 0 61 corresponding to the limiting steepness of 0 443 this could be argued that the skewness of extreme wave in shallower water is larger than that in deep water by comparing of these three slope data in fig 17a it is clearly that the bottom slope has negligible effect on the transformation of s k furthermore kjeldsen et al 1981 presented that the value of s k in deep water was around 0 hence s k 0 as an initial value was considered into the empirical formulae which depict the relationship between s k and u r as follow 23 s k 3 2 tanh 82 u r 1 the evolution of a s versus local u r for each slope are shown in fig 17b it could be seen that a s evolutes in the opposite direction of the coordinate and range from 0 9 to 0 8 kjeldsen et al 1981 reported that the maximum value of a s in deep water could reach to 0 9 which is nearly coincide to the initial value in this paper moreover through an observation in intermediate water depth toffoli et al 2010 presented that the range of a s was between 0 4 and 0 8 narrower than the range in this paper considering the geometric characteristic of a s represented it could be argued that in shallower water breaking waves tilted forward more serious than it in deep water from observing of fig 17b which embeds all these three slope data in one picture there is obvious deviation for a s on different slopes absolute value of a s measured on 1 15 slope is clearly larger than that on slopes 1 30 and 1 45 it is known that asymmetry is the index of energy transfer herbers et al 2000 and the energy transferred on steeper slope is more extensive than those on milder slope kashima et al 2012 dong et al 2014 these revealed that the slope effect could not be neglected in estimating the asymmetry of extreme waves empirical formulae for extreme wave asymmetry are obtained as follow 24 β 1 30 a s 5 9 tanh 100 u r 5 25 β 1 30 a s 6 8 tanh 115 u r 5 9 5 conclusion physical experiments were conducted to develop the empirical formulas describe the geometric characteristics of extreme wave in shallow water and the effect of bottom slope on them was investigated to achieve this objective a number of random waves were generated based on the jonswap spectrum and three bottom slopes β 1 15 1 30 and 1 45 were considered to acquire the geometric parameters such as wave steepness and asymmetries individual extreme waves were captured from wave trains the first sets of formulas provide the parameterization of extreme wave steep in terms of the local relative wave height parameter the second formulas related the asymmetries of extreme wave to the local ursell number by comparing our results with the conclusions of previous studies four main conclusions of this study are 1 the local relative wave height plays a crucial role on the spatial development of extreme wave steepness for the data used here when h s d is below about 0 45 the limiting steepness holds its initial value and has virtually no increase however the evolution of steepness shows an evident increase when water depth decreases to a certain degree and is obviously different from that in deep water 2 the value of extreme wave steepness gradually increases with increasing relative wave height the range of crest front steepness acquired in this paper is about 0 52 0 6 and the crest rear steepness ranges of 0 42 0 5 narrower than the range of crest front steepness mean steepness remains constant value 0 4 at the initial stage but shows a more intense increase when relative wave height become larger moreover the absolute value of skewness and asymmetry for extreme wave is spatially varying increases with a larger ursell number for the data used here the range of skewness and asymmetry acquired in this paper is about 0 1 5 and 0 9 0 8 wider than the deep water theory 3 it was found that the bottom slope effect is significant to the transformation of the crest front steepness mean steepness and asymmetry when β 1 30 however the slope effect on crest rear steepness and skewness is very small and can be neglected 4 the practical applications of our proposed formulas are many these formulas are applicable to predict the location for breaking onset and calculate the geometric characteristics of extreme wave in random wave trains if the corresponding characteristic wave height and local water depth are used as input those proposed formulas also has potential applications in various type of numerical model e g sediment transport model to better capture the coastal dynamic behavior and the evolution of morphology acknowledgement this research is supported financially by the open fund of state key laboratory of coastal and offshore

in the present model 1 genuine detonation with real explosive materials 2 coupled ale arbitrary lagrangian eulerian lagrangian algorithm for large seabed deformation and 3 u p formulation considering pore water pressure effect the proposed explosion model is validated against experiment data available in the literature several parametric studies are carried out to investigate seabed response considering various soil types and tnt equivalent time series of total stress and pore pressure from sandy bed and clayey bed subjected to explosive loads are presented special attention is given to the distribution of peak total stress and pore pressure during propagation of blast wave to facilitate engineering practice a series of formulas for evaluating attenuation of peak total stress and pore water pressure are proposed keywords underwater explosion fully saturated soil pore water pressure attenuation formulas 1 introduction seabed stability must be secured to ensure the safe operation of marine structures such as pipelines and platforms under oceanic accidental loads accidental load that may act on submerged structures includes wave load tidal load or seismic load in addition further load in emergency would possibly give rise to fatal damage underwater explosion which may cause critical risk of foundation instability is one of the most critical events threatening security of submerged structures this study is intent to develop a novel numerical method to forecast saturated marine sediment response in dealing with such fatal risk since explosion is a representative load in extreme conditions it generates blast wave with high frequency transient duration and extreme energy density marine sediments could be degraded or even destroyed by underwater explosion premeditatedly or accidentally to avoid the great loss of explosive disasters numerous studies on explosion have been carried out over the last few decades yang 1997 has studied the response of buried shelters to blast load using a commercial fem finite element method software abaqus in the study a viscoelastic constitutive relationship was utilized to simulate soil behavior although the explosion effect has been simplified into time dependent load which obviously cannot reflect the real detonation process the viscoelastic model gave a reasonable prediction of dynamic soil behavior under high loading rate a comparative analysis between numerical simulation and experimental test of landmine explosion is carried out using numerical code named dyna3d by wang 2001 it has been demonstrated that the numerical method might underestimate the dynamic response of soil compared with experimental data in terms of maximum pore water pressure displacement and velocity lu and hanyga 2005a b c analyzed dynamic response of layered porous media based on transmission and reflection matrices method coupling biot s theory a novel linear dynamic model was also proposed based on one energy approach for dynamic response of porous media saturated by immiscible fluids dynamic response of wave field was investigated by johnson koplik dashen dynamic permeability model incorporating with biot s theory feldgun et al 2007 developed a coupled approach with a combination of variational principle and modified godunov s method based on the fixed eulerian mesh to simulate an axisymmetric explosion inside a pipeline although the discontinuity between pipeline and soil has been well captured the pore water pressure of soil cannot be predicted due to fixed eulerian mesh in recent researches jayasinghe et al 2013a b 2014 studied response of piles subjected to blast loading on commercial software ls dyna the fhwa federal highway administration constitutive relationship is utilized to simulate saturated soil response however the calculation of pore water pressure is based on an empirical relationship that is proportional to plastic volumetric strain leading to omission of the interaction between soil and water dynamic response of submerged structures subjected to underwater explosion is a hot topic that draws great attention in recent years and plenty of work dedicating to explore the protective effect of burial depth and concrete thickness has been carried out an analytic method was proposed to analyze possible plastic deformation and failure mode by gong et al 2000 and lam et al 2001 monte carlo method was utilized to obtain bending moment distribution of pipeline the double asymptotic approximation was implemented into fem code abaqus to study response of laminated pipeline to underwater shock directly over it lam et al 2003 however the blast load and wave attenuation function are governed by empirical formula and effect of pore water is neglected lai 2007 studied response of submerged sphere shell to underwater explosion based on daa double asymptotic approximation in the study response modes with different failure criterion and stand off distance are concluded from parametric analysis hung et al 2009 studied dynamic response of cylindrical structure subjected to underwater explosion and the 50 m critical distance was obtained by a series of model tests a brief numerical simulation was carried out to verify experimental result simultaneously van den abeele and verleysen 2013 utilized the display algorithm to simulate underwater explosion on the axial direction of a floating pipeline the research findings are presented to facilitate the assessment of the safety of submerged pipelines in the vicinity of explosive koneshwaran et al 2015a b c studied blast response of underground tunnels with a sph fe coupled model the fhwa model is adopted to simulate dry sand and the effect of pore water pressure is neglected spontaneously overall there have been extensive researches on dynamic response of ocean structure subjected to underwater explosion however the blast loading and wave attenuation are mostly governed by empirical formula other than material charge coupled calculation furthermore the influence of marine sediment on submerged structures is generally neglected in addition pore water pressure effect which is crucial in the estimation of seabed instability is not considered in previous researches in this paper a comprehensive numerical model is established based on u p equations incorporated into fem this paper adopted a fully coupled technique incorporating ale and lagrangian algorithm to simulate large deformation and propagation of blast waves in marine soils a brief description of background has been presented at the beginning of this paper the second section introduces primary theory and numerical methods validation of prototype model according to available experimental data from tm 5 855 1 fundamentals of protective design for conventional weapons is presented in section 3 in section 4 we carried out a comprehensive parametric analysis of explosion in marine sediments with various soil properties finally a series of empirical equations for evaluating attenuation of peak total stress and pore water pressure are proposed to facilitate engineering practice 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 coupled hydro mechanical model for dynamic response in this paper the extended biot dynamic equations are adopted for soil response under blast loading the governing equations involve equilibrium of porous medium equilibrium of fluid phrase and the mass conservation of fluid phase can be expressed as zienkiewicz et al 1980 1 σ i j j ρ u i ρ f w i ρ g i 0

fluid in the pores g i is body force acceleration u i is displacement of the soil skeleton w i is average displacement of pore fluid phase k is soil permeability and n is porosity of soil material k f is bulk modulus of the fluid ρ f and ρ represent pore fluid density and soil density respectively it could be written as ρ 1 n ρ s n ρ f in which ρ s is density of the soil skeleton in general the governing equations should be solved simultaneously to consider the interaction of soil skeleton displacement u i fluid displacement w i and pore water pressure p neglect the fluid acceleration relative to the soil skeleton w and substitute w i in 2 into 3 then a simplified u p dynamic form zienkiewicz et al 1980 is taken in this study in which soil skeleton displacement u i and pore water pressure p are the only unknowns to be solved through the governing equations the spatial discretized form of the governing equations in the u p form can be expressed as follows 4 m u c u k u q p f u

f is reset to one if exceeds one and p e o s is the pressure from the eos noted in former section 2 3 soil constitutive law marine sediments are usually considered as a three phase medium consisting of solid particles water and air the seabed soil is treated as fully saturated soil generally speaking its behavior is very complex to predict due to the interaction of solid particle and pore water especially under high rate blast load since soil response is very sensitive to strain rate and explosion is a kind of highly nonlinear loading the mat 147 model lewis 2004 reid et al 2004 developed by federal highway administration fhwa is adopted in this paper in this model the effects of strain softening strain rate element deletion kinematic hardening and excess pore water have be taken into account moreover many research findings have demonstrated its ability to simulate soil behavior under high strain rate lee 2006 presented sensitivity of material parameters based on results of pore water pressure which is proportion to effective plastic strain a half sin function is incorporated with empirical pwp function to obtain a more actual accumulation mode of pore water pressure which is not able to obtain accurate peak pwp and dissipation of pore pressure jayasinghe et al 2013a b 2014 utilized the model to simulate underground blast response of pile in saturated soil without discussion of pore water effect since mat 147 can behave like saturated soil koneshwaran et al 2015a b c also adopted the model to simulate dry sand for its excellent response under impact loading the fhwa soil model is developed based on a modified version of mohr coulomb yield criterion the main parameters in this model are mass density specific gravity bulk modulus shear modulus peak shear strength angle cohesion and moisture content which are defined by laboratory test and empirical formula other parameters adopted in this paper refer to existing studies mentioned in the previous section it should be noted that the pore water pressure effect in fhwa model is not coupled calculation of soil and water therefore we utilize the u p governing equations to realize fluid soil coupling calculation the parameters adopted in this paper are based on marine sediments on the yangtze river estuary region major component of marine sediment is saturated soft muddy clay the average density is about 1 95 g cm3 special gravity is 2 75 no unit and moisture content is about 0 35 the soil strength parameters have a close relation with loading rate hence the strength parameters could be underestimated massively using laboratory result the bulk modulus and shear modulus adopted in this paper is determined by calculation formula of wave and test result a mohr coulomb surface is widely utilized to simulate yield behavior of soil for its concise format and high computational efficiency moreover a smooth hyperbolic surface was implemented into original mohr coulomb surface to address numerical and efficiency problems in the plasticity algorithm caused by the singularity at the intersection of yield surface and pressure axis as shown in fig 1 the fhwa model based on a modified mohr coulomb surface was adopted ultimately to accomplish the investigation in this paper 11 f p sin φ j 2 k θ 2 a 2 sin 2 φ c cos φ where a is a parameter for determining how close the modified surface is fitted to the standard mohr coulomb yield surface p is pressure and ϕ is internal friction angle k θ is function of the angle θ in the deviatoric plane c is cohesion j 2 is the second invariant of the stress deviator the yield surface should be able to become triangular in space at low confinement pressures based on the experimental evidence while the standard mohr coulomb surface is hexagonal or circular in the deviatoric plane a k θ function used by klisinski replace the standard mohr coulomb function to remedy the deficiency 12 k θ 4 1 e 2 cos 2 θ 2 e 1 2 2 1 e 2 cos 2 θ 2 e 1 4 1 e 2 cos 2 θ 5 e 2 4 e 1 2 where cos 3 θ 3 3 j 3 2 j 2 3 2 j 3 is the third invariant of the stress deviator and e is material input parameter describing the ratio of triaxial extension strength to triaxial compression strength which is crucial to simulate soil behavior under rarefaction wave soil material will not behave as it does in quasi static condition under dynamic environments since the blast wave emanating from detonation can alter the normal behavior along its path strain rate effect is very important for simulation accuracy the two parameter devaut lions viscoplastic update algorithm is adopted with an interpolation between the inviscid stress and elastic trial stress the inviscid stresses are presented as 13 σ v p 1 ς σ ς σ t r i a l where ς 1 δ t η 1 and η γ ε n 1 n the parameters γ is a viscosity parameter and n is viscosity exponent the value of the two parameters are 1 10 4 and 2 respectively 3 model description and verification 3 1 description of present model the present study was carried out using dynamic simulation techniques based on the finite element code ls dyna 2007 the prototype model is 1200 m in length 15 m in width and depth as shown in fig 2 considering the possible large deformation near the denotation zone we divide the whole model into two parts i e near explosion part 0 60 m and far field part 60 1200 m in the vicinity of explosive large deformation and distortion caused by detonation will decrease computational accuracy and efficiency severely while eulerian algorithm provides extensive ability for such numerical problems then the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation that can combine advantages of lagrangian formulation and eulerian formulation was adopted for the explosive and its adjacent area within 60 m to explosive the one point multi material ale solver elform 11 was initiated for mentioned region unlike conventional lagrangian formulation material in ale is unrestrained from element boundary that is extreme deformation of material will not lead to severe mesh distortion furthermore systematic error brought in by coarse mesh would accumulate as the blast wave propagate to the far field a very fine mesh is capable of treating large deformation and assuring adequate precision effectively then the regional mesh size is set to 30 cm after a great deal of numerical calculation since blast energy attenuates significantly when travelling to far field zone the lagrangian algorithm was adopted for the rest part beyond the near explosion range because of its high efficiency and low computational demand the constant stress solid formulation elform 1 was used for far field soil element besides the mesh size is set to 167 cm in far field region it should be noted that the prototype model with mesh size less than 100 cm was beyond computational capabilities and results of peak pressure is more sensitive to output interval rather than mesh size at last mesh size in far field region was ascertained for the 167 cm mesh had provided enough efficiency and accuracy for calculation hence the coupled ale lagrangian approach was utilized to reveal propagation of blast wave in marine sediment and the mesh sizes for each part were determined without sacrifice of efficiency and accuracy as shown in fig 2 the bottom of the porous seabed with finite thickness is treated as impermeable and rigid and no displacement occurs in the bottom boundary the boundary parallel to y z plane confines element movement in x direction non reflecting boundaries are adopted in the prototype model to avoid disturbance from wave reflection gravity load is applied to provide initial stress state and hydrostatic pressure the cm μs g dimension is chosen in this paper for lightning propagation of blast wave 3 2 verification of present model explosion theory has been studied extensively during world war ii scholars have carried out plenty of field tests on explosion in the ground lampson 1946 firstly proposed the cube root scaling based on a series of explosion tests to reveal the attenuation of blast wave in various soil types sachs and swift 1954 vaile 1952 and many other scholars conducted comprehensive experimental research in various soil with tnt equivalent from grams to tons ground shock data from the previous tests was summarized in the army design manual tm 5 855 1 fundamentals of protective design for conventional weapons in this section the proposed models in this paper are verified against test data from tm 5 855 1 the peak total stress within 100 m are taken to be calibrated since the test data is limited by detecting distance monitor points are set at the same buried depth of explosive according to tm 5 855 1 the verification results with 250 kg 300 kg and 350 kg explosive are presented in fig 3 considering the actual tnt equivalent in world war ii generally attenuation of peak total stress curves correspond to test data from tm 5 855 1 though the calculation result at vicinity of detonation is relatively lower than empirical value considering blast wave velocity is much higher than seismic velocity within 10 times radius of explosive and the numerical result is extracted by interpolation and extrapolation of output file it is acceptable to obtain a smaller result within a specific region what s more it is unpractical to output numerical result with very small interval with a storage space limitation dynamic response of sandy seabed subjected to underwater explosion is also studied in this paper the tnt equivalent ranges from 50 kg to 400 kg attenuation of peak total stress in sandy seabed correspond to test data of explosion in very wet sandy clay shear modulus and bulk modulus of dry sand are larger than clay however it goes another way under fully saturated condition explosion energy attenuates faster in a relative softer medium as shown in fig 4 it is very difficult to get soil parameters under dynamic load from ordinary geotechnical test numerical results demonstrate that dynamic strength parameters of soil are much larger than parameters obtained from static loading test since soil response is sensitive to strain rate hence the input parameters of marine sediment adopted in this paper are ascertained according to geologic exploration data of the yangtze river estuary region and previous research findings furthermore the objective of this paper is to make a proof of concept for blast response of marine sediments with various soil types the following research is carried out based on the two sets of parameters as shown in table 2 4 result and discussion in this section the propagation of blast wave is presented firstly then effect of pore pressure is discussed based on the coupled hydro mechanical model a comparative analysis on variation of dynamic responses of two types of typical marine sediments subjected to underwater explosion is carried out major fraction of marine sediments in model i is fully saturated muddy clay and major component in model ii is fully saturated sandy soil after that attenuation of peak total stress and maximum value of pore pressure are discussed for engineering practice fitting attenuation curves for marine sediment with various soil types are proposed to provide reference to engineering design 4 1 blast wave propagation in soil the underwater explosion phenomena are caused by detonation of explosive a detonation reaction is the break down progress of the original explosive material into explosion product a sudden energy release conduces to a formation of a superheated highly compressed gas bubble and a stimulated shock wave in the detonation zone the temperature in the product gas is about 3000 c and the overpressure is up to 5 gpa rajendran and narasimhan 2006 the propagation velocity decreases rapidly to the material sound velocity within ten times the charge radius keil 1956 as shown in fig 5 element pressure jumps to summit value and decays exponentially in a few milliseconds when the compressive wave reaches the solid element and then passes away followed by rarefaction wave the solid element sustains tension force and tends to expand under the following rarefaction wave the peak pressure value diminishes and load duration elongates when the blast wave propagates to a farther distance as shown in fig 6 4 2 analysis of pore water effect in marine sediments in order to investigate pore water effect two finite element models are established based on prototype model shown in fig 2 one is coupled hydro mechanical model and the other is standard model that neglects pore water in porous media fig 7 presents the attenuation of peak total stress along the wave propagation direction which shows that total stress in coupled hydro mechanical model presents a higher peak value than that in standard model fig 8 presents time series of soil total stress at 80 m away from detonation blast response of seabed in hydro mechanical model is more intense than that in standard model fully saturated soil is more sensitive since the bulk modulus of water is 2 2 gpa which indicates that the soil is nearly incompressible soil particles in standard model collapses easily under dynamic load while soil water interaction will decrease deformability of soil element solid element in hydro mechanical model has a larger peak value by approximately 20 and presents a similar steady stage as that in standard model there have been thousands of offshore structures installed in marine sediment offshore structures will show a more violent response for its higher structural stiffness it is unreliable to calculate structural capacity with the standard model that will underestimate blast response of marine sediment 4 3 dynamic response of marine sediments the physicists classify compression wave into body wave and surface wave according to propagation position the body wave contains p wave and s wave with secondary classification by vibration direction both of which contain considerable energy when are generated by explosion s wave will fall behind p wave gradually for propagation velocity of p wave is much larger than that of s wave therefore the peak wave stimulated by p wave will be weaker than that from s wave beyond a certain distance for rapider propagation and faster attenuation of p wave fig 9 shows the time series of gauging points located at 5 m a 20 m b 50 m c 80 m d and 300 m e measured horizontally away from the 300 kg tnt in model i the attenuation of these waves can be clearly seen in these figures in which pressure magnitude is pretty large in the vicinity of the charge and then decreases with distance duration of blast wave at point a is quite shorter than that from other distances total stress at point b from charge maintained negative after 200 ms for the gauging point located at the edge of 18 m explosion craters time history of point c shows s wave further falls behind p wave and the peak total stress decreases to 2 3 mpa meanwhile there is a complete separation between p wave and s wave at point d and the negative phase is very obvious between the two peak value when the blast wave propagates to point e peak pressure induced by s wave surpasses that induce by p wave overall element total stress rises instantly and decays exponentially even to a negative value duration of blast wave elongates with propagation distance peak pressure stimulated by s wave will surpass that from p wave for bulk modulus is lager than shear modulus generally for marine sediment at last the residual stress remains at a certain level residual stress of soil element remains 0 4 mpa within 50 m from detonation which indicates that the soil has sustained a critical plastic strain the stable value of point d and e is 0 3 mpa and 0 15 mpa respectively the residual stress attenuates quite slowly since s wave attenuates slowly in fully saturated muddy clay with a large poisson s ratio on the other hand small pressure with longer duration time seems to be more efficient to densification of marine sediment than great pressure with a transient duration fig 10 shows the time series of excess pore water pressure epwp in soil element located at 100 m f 200 m g 400 m h and 500 m i from 300 kg tnt measured horizontally in model i variation tendency of excess pore pressure synchronizes that of total stress pore pressure arises transiently when frontier of blast wave reaches the soil element and then plunges to 0 when the rarefaction wave reaches the gauging point following the compressive wave since water is incapable of bearing tensile stress the peak pore pressure at point f is about 0 55 mpa the second peak of pore pressure induced by s wave reaches about 0 05 mpa at 300 ms and the residual pore pressure maintains at 0 02 mpa the peak pore pressure of point g is 0 35 mpa and maintains at 0 1 mpa eventually which is greater than the stable value at point f there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon one is the stress state induced by s wave could lead to disturbance of marine sediment at point f that is s wave weakens densification achieved by p wave the other reason is that wave with smaller peak value and longer duration could lead to more effective accumulation of pore pressure than wave with greater value and more transient duration as has been mentioned in the last paragraph when blast wave spreads to point h peak pore pressure drops to 0 25 mpa and residual value is a little less than 0 01mpa and it should be noted that p wave had been feebler than s wave beyond 400 m meanwhile the peak value of pore pressure is only 0 2 mpa at point i this is because blast energy has already lost the capability of stimulating accumulation of pore pressure which means the soil element stays in an elastic stage at this distance above all the peak pore pressure declines with stand off distance however the residual pore pressure increases first and plunges later with stand off distance and dissipates beyond 500 m eventually fig 11 presents the stress wave propagation induced by explosion of 400 kg tnt in model ii the gauging points locate at 5 m j 20 m k and 50 m l measured horizontally it should be noted that length of ale region along x axis was reduced to 30 m since blast wave attenuated faster in sandy porous media epwp of soil element could be obtained from lagrangian mesh close to detonation the time series of total stress presents a sharp triangle with 17 mpa peak value and very short duration at point j the peak value drops to 2 8 mpa when blast wave propagates to point k the second peak value induced by s wave has been obvious in fig 11 as p wave has decayed severely and the residual pressure maintains negative for the same reason as point b in model i average value of total stress is smaller than that from point b since the cohesion force of sand could be neglected in contrast to clay time series of point l indicate the p wave has decayed to the same magnitude as s wave the residual stress is only about 0 15 mpa sandy soil possesses a greater bulk modulus and shear modulus than clay however the soil strength reverses completely when the soil voids is filled with pore water moreover sandy soil behaves more compressible with a relatively smaller poisson s ratio than clay this phenomenon could be confirmed by higher decay rate and smaller magnitude of peak total stress in model ii time series of epwp from gauging points located at 50 m m 80 m n and 100 m o is presented in fig 12 pore pressure rises rapidly and decays exponentially when blast wave propagates to point m pore pressure accumulates ineffectively for sandy marine sediment displays obvious dilatancy under shear stress generally time series of pore pressure at point n and point o also present a similar pattern besides peak pore pressure declines linearly with propagation distance as the peak value of point m point n and point o is 1 4 mpa 1 25 mpa and 1 1 mpa respectively previous researches mostly focus on attenuation of peak total stress and pore pressure when studying propagation of blast wave in porous media structures buried in the soil cannot survive if the peak pressure exceeds ultimate strength moreover increase of peak pore pressure can significantly degrade structure stability even with a transient duration meanwhile the peak values represent energy density of blast wave at a certain distance excess vibration can also lead to structural buckling effect of pore water is an inevitable topic when studying explosion in saturated soil damping ability of soil declines sharply with increase of saturation degree enormous damage takes place in marine sediments when suffering extreme load like underwater explosion in addition we cannot neglect the secondary destruction induced by degradation of soil property hence effect of pore water pressure is investigated comprehensively in following paragraphs in general the explosive charge directly affects dynamic response of marine sediment in order to explore effect of charge weight the explosive charge varies from 60 kg tnt to 600 kg tnt model i and model ii prospective studies will be carried out to investigate effect of specific soil parameters fig 13 presents attenuation of peak total stress in model i much attention was paid on peak total stress of soil element beyond 5 m from detonation since ocean structures could barely survive from contact explosion peak total stress attenuates exponentially with stand off distance to denotation peak total stress drops to 5 mpa as blast wave propagates to 30 m it can be obtained from fig 13 that peak total stress presents a positive correlation with explosive charge moreover decay rate is an essential feature determined by soil properties according to the preliminary study an exponential function p a x b is adopted to fit the attenuation problem where a is defined as explosive energy coefficient b is attenuation coefficient and x is the distance from gauging point to detonation the units of p and x are mega pascal and meter respectively the whole analysis progress is based on the least squares algorithm as tabulated in table 3 since the hypothesis that decay rate only relates to soil property is adopted in this paper the unified attenuation coefficient is set to 1 4 in model i moreover explosive energy coefficient is just correlative with explosive charge the exponential form stood out during data fitting by various function forms at last the attenuation equation of peak total stress in saturated muddy seabed is ascertained as p 3 6 m 0 8223 x 1 4 as illustrated in fig 14 attenuation of peak total stress is similar in model ii take the 250 kg tnt case as an example peak value of total stress is half of that in model i large deformation in the donation adjacent zone absorbs more blast energy in the sandy seabed peak total stress curves get into stable stage beyond 30 m from denotation point and blast wave decays quickly for the smaller strength parameter in sandy seabed eventually the global attenuation coefficient is determined as 1 35 for sandy seabed and the attenuation function is p 15 6 m 0 4 x 1 35 as shown in table 4 it has been indicated that peak pore pressure attenuates exponentially with stand off distancd as shown in fig 15 peak pore pressure decays with peak pressure synchronously with poor drainage condition under blast load then peak pore pressure decreases linearly over 400 m at which s wave energy has been dominant position for blast wave we can deduce that soil skeleton processes residual strength which indicates soil element does not get fully plastic beyond 400 m besides peak pore pressure attenuates quickly for the reason that blast wave continues to get shorter and fatter the fitting attenuation function of peak pore pressure in model i can be obtained by the same analysis process as shown in table 5 p e p w p 0 612 m 0 5 x 0 6 attenuation curve of peak pore pressure in model ii is quite different as shown in fig 16 it can be observed that peak pore pressure decreases with distance almost linearly sandy soil has a lower strength than clay in the fully saturated state therefore peak pore pressure in sandy soil will surpass that in saturated muddy clay permeability is much higher in sandy soil and hence attenuation of peak pore pressure presents a linear tendency approximately moreover slope of attenuation curves gets smaller with increase of explosive charge in order to simplify the analysis process and enhance practicability of fitting work linear formula is adopted to match the data in fig 16 though there seems to be an infection point around 100 m assuming that constant and slope coefficient are only linked to explosive charge we can obtain the final formula of attenuation of peak pore pressure p e p w p 0 00016 m 0 4 x 0 125 m 0 4 as tabulated in table 6 a forecast model is established with 600 kg tnt detonated in the two kinds of marine sediment forecasting formulas of peak total stress and pore pressure correspond to numerical results in model i as shown in fig 17 a b forecasting result of model ii does not behave that perfect the forecast formula fits pretty well within 50 m but underestimate peak total stress beyond that range as shown in fig 17 c p wave accomplished much of attenuation within 50 m beyond which s wave decays slowly with small shear modulus in model ii a piecewise form is better for attenuation of peak total stress the first stage is exponential decay and the last stage is linear decay clarification of the infection point turns to be the major issue for forecasting curve prospective research will focus on this topic fig 17 d presents forecast result of peak pore pressure and numerical result calculated by the case that 600 kg tnt exploded in model ii attenuation of peak pore pressure is a concave curve generally the fitted line is able to predict curve trend in addition the numerical result implies the advantage of piecewise pattern in last paragraph the above procedure is based on a series of numerical cases presented in this paper more comprehensive investigations are required in the future to enhance the knowledge dynamic response of marine sediment induced by explosion 5 conclusions the dynamic seabed response to underwater explosion has been studied using fem code ls dyna with incorporation of u p model the modeling method was compared and validated by available experiment data in the literature based on the results presented the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a genuine process of explosion in the marine sediment is simulated in this paper large deformation is solved through a coupled ale lagrangian computational scheme effect of pore pressure is taken into account with incorporation of u p formula parameters and models adopted in this paper are ascertained with least discretization error method after plenty of numerical tests 2 numerical models adopted in this paper are verified against test data from tm 5 855 1 attenuation curve of peak total stress from both of the models correspond to experiment data models and parameters in this paper can be adopted in the succeeding parametric study 3 dynamic response of different marine sediments subjected to various explosive charge has been studied in this paper time history of total stress in the model conforms to standard variation of stress induced by blast loading peak value of total stress induced by s wave will separate from that induced by p wave for velocity of s wave is much smaller than p wave time history of epwp shows a similar trend with that of total stress residual pore pressure increases instantly and then decrease for blast wave with longer duration is more effective for accumulation of pore water pressure in muddy clay residual pore pressure in sandy soil drops close to zero because of larger permeability and dilatancy of sand 4 attenuation formulas of peak total stress and pore pressure are obtained based on numerical results with various explosive charge from 50 kg to 350 kg peak value of total stress decays exponentially in both models stress level and residual stress are larger in muddy clay than sand peak value of pore pressure decays in the same way as illustrated with attenuation curve of peak total stress in model i however there is an approximately linear attenuation pattern in model ii despite the proposed forecasting formulas are concluded within explosive charge of 400 kg tnt it also gives a good prediction with the result of 600 kg tnt case acknowledgments the authors are

23444,this paper developed a three dimensional numerical model for saturated soil response induced by underwater explosion in marine environment unlike previous studies three new features are included in the present model 1 genuine detonation with real explosive materials 2 coupled ale arbitrary lagrangian eulerian lagrangian algorithm for large seabed deformation and 3 u p formulation considering pore water pressure effect the proposed explosion model is validated against experiment data available in the literature several parametric studies are carried out to investigate seabed response considering various soil types and tnt equivalent time series of total stress and pore pressure from sandy bed and clayey bed subjected to explosive loads are presented special attention is given to the distribution of peak total stress and pore pressure during propagation of blast wave to facilitate engineering practice a series of formulas for evaluating attenuation of peak total stress and pore water pressure are proposed keywords underwater explosion fully saturated soil pore water pressure attenuation formulas 1 introduction seabed stability must be secured to ensure the safe operation of marine structures such as pipelines and platforms under oceanic accidental loads accidental load that may act on submerged structures includes wave load tidal load or seismic load in addition further load in emergency would possibly give rise to fatal damage underwater explosion which may cause critical risk of foundation instability is one of the most critical events threatening security of submerged structures this study is intent to develop a novel numerical method to forecast saturated marine sediment response in dealing with such fatal risk since explosion is a representative load in extreme conditions it generates blast wave with high frequency transient duration and extreme energy density marine sediments could be degraded or even destroyed by underwater explosion premeditatedly or accidentally to avoid the great loss of explosive disasters numerous studies on explosion have been carried out over the last few decades yang 1997 has studied the response of buried shelters to blast load using a commercial fem finite element method software abaqus in the study a viscoelastic constitutive relationship was utilized to simulate soil behavior although the explosion effect has been simplified into time dependent load which obviously cannot reflect the real detonation process the viscoelastic model gave a reasonable prediction of dynamic soil behavior under high loading rate a comparative analysis between numerical simulation and experimental test of landmine explosion is carried out using numerical code named dyna3d by wang 2001 it has been demonstrated that the numerical method might underestimate the dynamic response of soil compared with experimental data in terms of maximum pore water pressure displacement and velocity lu and hanyga 2005a b c analyzed dynamic response of layered porous media based on transmission and reflection matrices method coupling biot s theory a novel linear dynamic model was also proposed based on one energy approach for dynamic response of porous media saturated by immiscible fluids dynamic response of wave field was investigated by johnson koplik dashen dynamic permeability model incorporating with biot s theory feldgun et al 2007 developed a coupled approach with a combination of variational principle and modified godunov s method based on the fixed eulerian mesh to simulate an axisymmetric explosion inside a pipeline although the discontinuity between pipeline and soil has been well captured the pore water pressure of soil cannot be predicted due to fixed eulerian mesh in recent researches jayasinghe et al 2013a b 2014 studied response of piles subjected to blast loading on commercial software ls dyna the fhwa federal highway administration constitutive relationship is utilized to simulate saturated soil response however the calculation of pore water pressure is based on an empirical relationship that is proportional to plastic volumetric strain leading to omission of the interaction between soil and water dynamic response of submerged structures subjected to underwater explosion is a hot topic that draws great attention in recent years and plenty of work dedicating to explore the protective effect of burial depth and concrete thickness has been carried out an analytic method was proposed to analyze possible plastic deformation and failure mode by gong et al 2000 and lam et al 2001 monte carlo method was utilized to obtain bending moment distribution of pipeline the double asymptotic approximation was implemented into fem code abaqus to study response of laminated pipeline to underwater shock directly over it lam et al 2003 however the blast load and wave attenuation function are governed by empirical formula and effect of pore water is neglected lai 2007 studied response of submerged sphere shell to underwater explosion based on daa double asymptotic approximation in the study response modes with different failure criterion and stand off distance are concluded from parametric analysis hung et al 2009 studied dynamic response of cylindrical structure subjected to underwater explosion and the 50 m critical distance was obtained by a series of model tests a brief numerical simulation was carried out to verify experimental result simultaneously van den abeele and verleysen 2013 utilized the display algorithm to simulate underwater explosion on the axial direction of a floating pipeline the research findings are presented to facilitate the assessment of the safety of submerged pipelines in the vicinity of explosive koneshwaran et al 2015a b c studied blast response of underground tunnels with a sph fe coupled model the fhwa model is adopted to simulate dry sand and the effect of pore water pressure is neglected spontaneously overall there have been extensive researches on dynamic response of ocean structure subjected to underwater explosion however the blast loading and wave attenuation are mostly governed by empirical formula other than material charge coupled calculation furthermore the influence of marine sediment on submerged structures is generally neglected in addition pore water pressure effect which is crucial in the estimation of seabed instability is not considered in previous researches in this paper a comprehensive numerical model is established based on u p equations incorporated into fem this paper adopted a fully coupled technique incorporating ale and lagrangian algorithm to simulate large deformation and propagation of blast waves in marine soils a brief description of background has been presented at the beginning of this paper the second section introduces primary theory and numerical methods validation of prototype model according to available experimental data from tm 5 855 1 fundamentals of protective design for conventional weapons is presented in section 3 in section 4 we carried out a comprehensive parametric analysis of explosion in marine sediments with various soil properties finally a series of empirical equations for evaluating attenuation of peak total stress and pore water pressure are proposed to facilitate engineering practice 2 theoretical formulations 2 1 coupled hydro mechanical model for dynamic response in this paper the extended biot dynamic equations are adopted for soil response under blast loading the governing equations involve equilibrium of porous medium equilibrium of fluid phrase and the mass conservation of fluid phase can be expressed as zienkiewicz et al 1980 1 σ i j j ρ u i ρ f w i ρ g i 0 2 p i ρ f g i k w i ρ f u i ρ f n w i ρ f g i 0 3 u i i w i i n k f p 0 where σ i j is total stress which is sum of effective stress σ i j acting on the soil skeleton and pore water pressure p for the fluid in the pores g i is body force acceleration u i is displacement of the soil skeleton w i is average displacement of pore fluid phase k is soil permeability and n is porosity of soil material k f is bulk modulus of the fluid ρ f and ρ represent pore fluid density and soil density respectively it could be written as ρ 1 n ρ s n ρ f in which ρ s is density of the soil skeleton in general the governing equations should be solved simultaneously to consider the interaction of soil skeleton displacement u i fluid displacement w i and pore water pressure p neglect the fluid acceleration relative to the soil skeleton w and substitute w i in 2 into 3 then a simplified u p dynamic form zienkiewicz et al 1980 is taken in this study in which soil skeleton displacement u i and pore water pressure p are the only unknowns to be solved through the governing equations the spatial discretized form of the governing equations in the u p form can be expressed as follows 4 m u c u k u q p f u 5 g u q t u s p h p f p where m is global mass matrix c is viscous damping matrix k is stiffness matrix q is coupling matrix g is dynamic seepage force matrix s is compressibility matrix and h is permeability matrix u and p are the soil displacement and pore water pressure vectors respectively f u represents the effect of external forces and f p represents fluid flux for more details about the u p formulations readers can refer to zienkiewicz et al 1980 2 2 material explosive model explosion pressure is applied to the porous marine sediments indirectly the high explosive burn and the jones wilkins lee jwl equation of state eos are adopted to model the detonation of tnt ls dyna 2007 the jwl eos defines the pressure p as a function of the relative volume v and initial energy per volume e using an exponential function form as follow 6 p c 1 1 ω r 1 v e r 1 v c 2 1 ω r 2 v e r 2 v ω e v where c 1 c 2 r 1 r 2 ω are material constants defined by experiment and tnt and eos parameters adopted in this paper are listed in table 1 an eos is used to simulate overpressure subjected to detonation and the burn fractions f controls the release of chemical energy in the high explosive burn material model the burn fraction is taken as follow 7 f max f 1 f 2 8 f 1 2 t t 1 d 3 δ x 9 f 2 1 v 1 v c j in which d is the detonation velocity ρ is the density v c j is the chapman jouget volume v is the relative volume t 1 is lighting time t is the current time and x is characteristic length of element the pressure in a high explosive element is given by 10 p f p e o s v e where burn fraction f is reset to one if exceeds one and p e o s is the pressure from the eos noted in former section 2 3 soil constitutive law marine sediments are usually considered as a three phase medium consisting of solid particles water and air the seabed soil is treated as fully saturated soil generally speaking its behavior is very complex to predict due to the interaction of solid particle and pore water especially under high rate blast load since soil response is very sensitive to strain rate and explosion is a kind of highly nonlinear loading the mat 147 model lewis 2004 reid et al 2004 developed by federal highway administration fhwa is adopted in this paper in this model the effects of strain softening strain rate element deletion kinematic hardening and excess pore water have be taken into account moreover many research findings have demonstrated its ability to simulate soil behavior under high strain rate lee 2006 presented sensitivity of material parameters based on results of pore water pressure which is proportion to effective plastic strain a half sin function is incorporated with empirical pwp function to obtain a more actual accumulation mode of pore water pressure which is not able to obtain accurate peak pwp and dissipation of pore pressure jayasinghe et al 2013a b 2014 utilized the model to simulate underground blast response of pile in saturated soil without discussion of pore water effect since mat 147 can behave like saturated soil koneshwaran et al 2015a b c also adopted the model to simulate dry sand for its excellent response under impact loading the fhwa soil model is developed based on a modified version of mohr coulomb yield criterion the main parameters in this model are mass density specific gravity bulk modulus shear modulus peak shear strength angle cohesion and moisture content which are defined by laboratory test and empirical formula other parameters adopted in this paper refer to existing studies mentioned in the previous section it should be noted that the pore water pressure effect in fhwa model is not coupled calculation of soil and water therefore we utilize the u p governing equations to realize fluid soil coupling calculation the parameters adopted in this paper are based on marine sediments on the yangtze river estuary region major component of marine sediment is saturated soft muddy clay the average density is about 1 95 g cm3 special gravity is 2 75 no unit and moisture content is about 0 35 the soil strength parameters have a close relation with loading rate hence the strength parameters could be underestimated massively using laboratory result the bulk modulus and shear modulus adopted in this paper is determined by calculation formula of wave and test result a mohr coulomb surface is widely utilized to simulate yield behavior of soil for its concise format and high computational efficiency moreover a smooth hyperbolic surface was implemented into original mohr coulomb surface to address numerical and efficiency problems in the plasticity algorithm caused by the singularity at the intersection of yield surface and pressure axis as shown in fig 1 the fhwa model based on a modified mohr coulomb surface was adopted ultimately to accomplish the investigation in this paper 11 f p sin φ j 2 k θ 2 a 2 sin 2 φ c cos φ where a is a parameter for determining how close the modified surface is fitted to the standard mohr coulomb yield surface p is pressure and ϕ is internal friction angle k θ is function of the angle θ in the deviatoric plane c is cohesion j 2 is the second invariant of the stress deviator the yield surface should be able to become triangular in space at low confinement pressures based on the experimental evidence while the standard mohr coulomb

strength to triaxial compression strength which is crucial to simulate soil behavior under rarefaction wave soil material will not behave as it does in quasi static condition under dynamic environments since the blast wave emanating from detonation can alter the normal behavior along its path strain rate effect is very important for simulation accuracy the two parameter devaut lions viscoplastic update algorithm is adopted with an interpolation between the inviscid stress and elastic trial stress the inviscid stresses are presented as 13 σ v p 1 ς σ ς σ t r i a l where ς 1 δ t η 1 and η γ ε n 1 n the parameters γ is a viscosity parameter and n is viscosity exponent the value of the two parameters are 1 10 4 and 2 respectively 3 model description and verification 3 1 description of present model the present study was carried out using dynamic simulation techniques based on the finite element code ls dyna 2007 the prototype model is 1200 m in length 15 m in width and depth as shown in fig 2 considering the possible large deformation near the denotation zone we divide the whole model into two parts i e near explosion part 0 60 m and far field part 60 1200 m in the vicinity of explosive large deformation and distortion caused by detonation will decrease computational accuracy and efficiency severely while eulerian algorithm provides extensive ability for such numerical problems then the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale formulation that can combine advantages of lagrangian formulation and eulerian formulation was adopted for the explosive and its adjacent area within 60 m to explosive the one point multi material ale solver elform 11 was initiated for mentioned region unlike conventional lagrangian formulation material in ale is unrestrained from element boundary that is extreme deformation of material will not lead to severe mesh distortion furthermore systematic error brought in by coarse mesh would accumulate as the blast wave propagate to the far field a very fine mesh is capable of treating large deformation and assuring adequate precision effectively then the regional mesh size is set to 30 cm after a great deal of numerical calculation since blast energy attenuates significantly when travelling to far field zone the lagrangian algorithm was adopted for the rest part beyond the near explosion range because of its high efficiency and low computational demand the constant stress solid formulation elform 1 was used for far field soil element besides the mesh size is set to 167 cm in far field region it should be noted that the prototype model with mesh size less than 100 cm was beyond computational capabilities and results of peak pressure is more sensitive to output interval rather than mesh size at last mesh size in far field region was ascertained for the 167 cm mesh had provided enough efficiency and accuracy for calculation hence the coupled ale lagrangian approach was utilized to reveal propagation of blast wave in marine sediment and the mesh sizes for each part were determined without sacrifice of efficiency and accuracy as shown in fig 2 the bottom of the porous seabed with finite thickness is treated as impermeable and rigid and no displacement occurs in the bottom boundary the boundary parallel to y z plane confines element movement in x direction non reflecting boundaries are adopted in the prototype model to avoid disturbance from wave reflection gravity load is applied to provide initial stress state and hydrostatic pressure the cm μs g dimension is chosen in this paper for lightning propagation of blast wave 3 2 verification of present model explosion theory has been studied extensively during world war ii scholars have carried out plenty of field tests on explosion in the ground lampson 1946 firstly proposed the cube root scaling based on a series of explosion tests to reveal the attenuation of blast wave in various soil types sachs and swift 1954 vaile 1952 and many other scholars conducted comprehensive experimental research in various soil with tnt equivalent from grams to tons ground shock data from the previous tests was summarized in the army design manual tm 5 855 1 fundamentals of protective design for conventional weapons in this section the proposed models in this paper are verified against test data from tm 5 855 1 the peak total stress within 100 m are taken to be calibrated since the test data is limited by detecting distance monitor points are set at the same buried depth of explosive according to tm 5 855 1 the verification results with 250 kg 300 kg and 350 kg explosive are presented in fig 3 considering the actual tnt equivalent in world war ii generally attenuation of peak total stress curves correspond to test data from tm 5 855 1 though the calculation result at vicinity of detonation is relatively lower than empirical value considering blast wave velocity is much higher than seismic velocity within 10 times radius of explosive and the numerical result is extracted by interpolation and extrapolation of output file it is acceptable to obtain a smaller result within a specific region what s more it is unpractical to output numerical result with very small interval with a storage space limitation dynamic response of sandy seabed subjected to underwater explosion is also studied in this paper the tnt equivalent ranges from 50 kg to 400 kg attenuation of peak total stress in sandy seabed correspond to test data of explosion in very wet sandy clay shear modulus and bulk modulus of dry sand are larger than clay however it goes another way under fully saturated condition explosion energy attenuates faster in a relative softer medium as shown in fig 4 it is very difficult to get soil parameters under dynamic load from ordinary geotechnical test numerical results demonstrate that dynamic strength parameters of soil are much larger than parameters obtained from static loading test since soil response is sensitive to strain rate hence the input parameters of marine sediment adopted in this paper are ascertained according to geologic exploration data of the yangtze river estuary region and previous research findings furthermore the objective of this paper is to make a proof of concept for blast response of marine sediments with various soil types the following research is carried out based on the two sets of parameters as shown in table 2 4 result and discussion in this section the propagation of blast wave is presented firstly then effect of pore pressure is discussed based on the coupled hydro mechanical model a comparative analysis on variation of dynamic responses of two types of typical marine sediments subjected to underwater explosion is carried out major fraction of marine sediments in model i is fully saturated muddy clay and major component in model ii is fully saturated sandy soil after that attenuation of peak total stress and maximum value of pore pressure are discussed for engineering practice fitting attenuation curves for marine sediment with various soil types are proposed to provide reference to engineering design 4 1 blast wave propagation in soil the underwater explosion phenomena are caused by detonation of explosive a detonation reaction is the break down progress of the original explosive material into explosion product a sudden energy release conduces to a formation of a superheated highly compressed gas bubble and a stimulated shock wave in the detonation zone the temperature in the product gas is about 3000 c and the overpressure is up to 5 gpa rajendran and narasimhan 2006 the propagation velocity decreases rapidly to the material sound velocity within ten times the charge radius keil 1956 as shown in fig 5 element pressure jumps to summit value and decays exponentially in a few milliseconds when the compressive wave reaches the solid element and then passes away followed by rarefaction wave the solid element sustains tension force and tends to expand under the following rarefaction wave the peak pressure value diminishes and load duration elongates when the blast wave propagates to a farther distance as shown in fig 6 4 2 analysis of pore water effect in marine sediments in order to investigate pore water effect two finite element models are established based on prototype model shown in fig 2 one is coupled hydro mechanical model and the other is standard model that neglects pore water in porous media fig 7 presents the attenuation of peak total stress along the wave propagation direction which shows that total stress in coupled hydro mechanical model presents a higher peak value than that in standard model fig 8 presents time series of soil total stress at 80 m away from detonation blast response of seabed in hydro mechanical model is more intense than that in standard model fully saturated soil is more sensitive since the bulk modulus of water is 2 2 gpa which indicates that the soil is nearly incompressible soil particles in standard model collapses easily under dynamic load while soil water interaction will decrease deformability of soil element solid element in hydro mechanical model has a larger peak value by approximately 20 and presents a similar steady stage as that in standard model there have been thousands of offshore structures installed in marine sediment offshore structures will show a more violent response for its higher structural stiffness it is unreliable to calculate structural capacity with the standard model that will underestimate blast response of marine sediment 4 3 dynamic response of marine sediments the physicists classify compression wave into body wave and surface wave according to propagation position the body wave contains p wave and s wave with secondary classification by vibration direction both of which contain considerable energy when are generated by explosion s wave will fall behind p wave gradually for propagation velocity of p wave is much larger than that of s wave therefore the peak wave stimulated by p wave will be weaker than that from s wave beyond a certain distance for rapider propagation and faster attenuation of p wave fig 9 shows the time series of gauging points located at 5 m a 20 m b 50 m c 80 m d and 300 m e measured horizontally away from the 300 kg tnt in model i the attenuation of these waves can be clearly seen in these figures in which pressure magnitude is pretty large in the vicinity of the charge and then decreases with distance duration of blast wave at point a is quite shorter than that from other distances total stress at point b from charge maintained negative after 200 ms for the gauging point located at the edge of 18 m explosion craters time history of point c shows s wave further falls behind p wave and the peak total stress decreases to 2 3 mpa meanwhile there is a complete separation between p wave and s wave at point d and the negative phase is very obvious between the two peak value when the blast wave propagates to point e peak pressure induced by s wave surpasses that induce by p wave overall element total stress rises instantly and decays exponentially even to a negative value duration of blast wave elongates with propagation distance peak pressure stimulated by s wave will surpass that from p wave for bulk modulus is lager than shear modulus generally for marine sediment at last the residual stress remains at a certain level residual stress of soil element remains 0 4 mpa within 50 m from detonation which indicates that the soil has sustained a critical plastic strain the stable value of point d and e is 0 3 mpa and 0 15 mpa respectively the residual stress attenuates quite slowly since s wave attenuates slowly in fully saturated muddy clay with a large poisson s ratio on the other hand small pressure with longer duration time seems to be more efficient to densification of marine sediment than great pressure with a transient duration fig 10 shows the time series of excess pore water pressure epwp in soil element located at 100 m f 200 m g 400 m h and 500 m i from 300 kg tnt measured horizontally in model i variation tendency of excess pore pressure synchronizes that of total stress pore pressure arises transiently when frontier of blast wave reaches the soil element and then plunges to 0 when the rarefaction wave reaches the gauging point following the compressive wave since water is incapable of bearing tensile stress the peak pore pressure at point f is about 0 55 mpa the second peak of pore pressure induced by s wave reaches about 0 05 mpa at 300 ms and the residual pore pressure maintains at 0 02 mpa the peak pore pressure of point g is 0 35 mpa and maintains at 0 1 mpa eventually which is greater than the stable value at point f there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon one is the stress state induced by s wave could lead to disturbance of marine sediment at point f that is s wave weakens densification achieved by p wave the other reason is that wave with smaller peak value and longer duration could lead to more effective accumulation of pore pressure than wave with greater value and more transient duration as has been mentioned in the last paragraph when blast wave spreads to point h peak pore pressure drops to 0 25 mpa and residual value is a little less than 0 01mpa and it should be noted that p wave had been feebler than s wave beyond 400 m meanwhile the peak value of pore pressure is only 0 2 mpa at point i this is because blast energy has already lost the capability of stimulating accumulation of pore pressure which means the soil element stays in an elastic stage at this distance above all the peak pore pressure declines with stand off distance however the residual pore pressure increases first and plunges later with stand off distance and dissipates beyond 500 m eventually fig 11 presents the stress wave propagation induced by explosion of 400 kg tnt in model ii the gauging points locate at 5 m j 20 m k and 50 m l measured horizontally it should be noted that length of ale region along x axis was reduced to 30 m since blast wave attenuated faster in sandy porous media epwp of soil element could be obtained from lagrangian mesh close to detonation the time series of total stress presents a sharp triangle with 17 mpa peak value and very short duration at point j the peak value drops to 2 8 mpa when blast wave propagates to point k the second peak value induced by s wave has been obvious in fig 11 as p wave has decayed severely and the residual pressure maintains negative for the same reason as point b in model i average value of total stress is smaller than that from point b since the cohesion force of sand could be neglected in contrast to clay time series of point l indicate the p wave has decayed to the same magnitude as s wave the residual stress is only about 0 15 mpa sandy soil possesses a greater bulk modulus and shear modulus than clay however the soil strength reverses completely when the soil voids is filled with pore water moreover sandy soil behaves more compressible with a relatively smaller poisson s ratio than clay this phenomenon could be confirmed by higher decay rate and smaller magnitude of peak total stress in model ii time series of epwp from gauging points located at 50 m m 80 m n and 100 m o is presented in fig 12 pore pressure rises rapidly and decays exponentially when blast wave propagates to point m pore pressure accumulates ineffectively for sandy marine sediment displays obvious dilatancy under shear stress generally time series of pore pressure at point n and point o also present a similar pattern besides peak pore pressure declines linearly with propagation distance as the peak value of point m point n and point o is 1 4 mpa 1 25 mpa and 1 1 mpa respectively previous researches mostly focus on attenuation of peak total stress and pore pressure when studying propagation of blast wave in porous media structures buried in the soil cannot survive if the peak pressure exceeds ultimate strength moreover increase of peak pore pressure can significantly degrade structure stability even with a transient duration meanwhile the peak values represent energy density of blast wave at a certain distance excess vibration can also lead to structural buckling effect of pore water is an inevitable topic when studying explosion in saturated soil damping ability of soil declines sharply with increase of saturation degree enormous damage takes place in marine sediments when suffering extreme load like underwater explosion in addition we cannot neglect the secondary destruction induced by degradation of soil property hence effect of pore water pressure is investigated comprehensively in following paragraphs in general the explosive charge directly affects dynamic response of marine sediment in order to explore effect of charge weight the explosive charge varies from 60 kg tnt to 600 kg tnt model i and model ii prospective studies will be carried out to investigate effect of specific soil parameters fig 13 presents attenuation of peak total stress in model i much attention was paid on peak total stress of soil element beyond 5 m from detonation since ocean structures could barely survive from contact explosion peak total stress attenuates exponentially with stand off distance to denotation peak total stress drops to 5 mpa as blast wave propagates to 30 m it can be obtained from fig 13 that peak total stress presents a positive correlation with explosive charge moreover decay rate is an essential feature determined by soil properties according to the preliminary study an exponential function p a x b is adopted to fit the attenuation problem where a is defined as explosive energy coefficient b is attenuation coefficient and x is the distance from gauging point to detonation the units of p and x are mega pascal and meter respectively the whole analysis progress is based on the least squares algorithm as tabulated in table 3 since the hypothesis that decay rate only relates to soil property is adopted in this paper the unified attenuation coefficient is set to 1 4 in model i moreover explosive energy coefficient is just correlative with explosive charge the exponential form stood out during data fitting by various function forms at last the attenuation equation of peak total stress in saturated muddy seabed is ascertained as p 3 6 m 0 8223 x 1 4 as illustrated in fig 14 attenuation of peak total stress is similar in model ii take the 250 kg tnt case as an example peak value of total stress is half of that in model i large deformation in the donation adjacent zone absorbs more blast energy in the sandy seabed peak total stress curves get into stable stage beyond 30 m from denotation point and blast wave decays quickly for the smaller strength parameter in sandy seabed eventually the global attenuation coefficient is determined as 1 35 for sandy seabed and the attenuation function is p 15 6 m 0 4 x 1 35 as shown in table 4 it has been indicated that peak pore pressure attenuates exponentially with stand off distancd as shown in fig 15 peak pore pressure decays with peak pressure synchronously with poor drainage condition under blast load then peak pore pressure decreases linearly over 400 m at which s wave energy has been dominant position for blast wave we can deduce that soil skeleton processes residual strength which indicates soil element does not get fully plastic beyond 400 m besides peak pore pressure attenuates quickly for the reason that blast wave continues to get shorter and fatter the fitting attenuation function of peak pore pressure in model i can be obtained by the same analysis process as shown in table 5 p e p w p 0 612 m 0 5 x 0 6 attenuation curve of peak pore pressure in model ii is quite different as shown in fig 16 it can be observed that peak pore pressure decreases with distance almost linearly sandy soil has a lower strength than clay in the fully saturated state therefore peak pore pressure in sandy soil will surpass that in saturated muddy clay permeability is much higher in sandy soil and hence attenuation of peak pore pressure presents a linear tendency approximately moreover slope of attenuation curves gets smaller with increase of explosive charge in order to simplify the analysis process and enhance practicability of fitting work linear formula is adopted to match the data in fig 16 though there seems to be an infection point around 100 m assuming that constant and slope coefficient are only linked to explosive charge we can obtain the final formula of attenuation of peak pore pressure p e p w p 0 00016 m 0 4 x 0 125 m 0 4 as tabulated in table 6 a forecast model is established with 600 kg tnt detonated in the two kinds of marine sediment forecasting formulas of peak total stress and pore pressure correspond to numerical results in model i as shown in fig 17 a b forecasting result of model ii does not behave that perfect the forecast formula fits pretty well within 50 m but underestimate peak total stress beyond that range as shown in fig 17 c p wave accomplished much of attenuation within 50 m beyond which s wave decays slowly with small shear modulus in model ii a piecewise form is better for attenuation of peak total stress the first stage is exponential decay and the last stage is linear decay clarification of the infection point turns to be the major issue for forecasting curve prospective research will focus on this topic fig 17 d presents forecast result of peak pore pressure and numerical result calculated by the case that 600 kg tnt exploded in model ii attenuation of peak pore pressure is a concave curve generally the fitted line is able to predict curve trend in addition the numerical result implies the advantage of piecewise pattern in last paragraph the above procedure is based on a series of numerical cases presented in this paper more comprehensive investigations are required in the future to enhance the knowledge dynamic response of marine sediment induced by explosion 5 conclusions the dynamic seabed response to underwater explosion has been studied using fem code ls dyna with incorporation of u p model the modeling method was compared and validated by available experiment data in the literature based on the results presented the following conclusions can be drawn 1 a genuine process of explosion in the marine sediment is simulated in this paper large deformation is solved through a coupled ale lagrangian computational scheme effect of pore pressure is taken into account with incorporation of u p formula parameters and models adopted in this paper are ascertained with least discretization error method after plenty of numerical tests 2 numerical models adopted in this paper are verified against test data from tm 5 855 1 attenuation curve of peak total stress from both of the models correspond to experiment data models and parameters in this paper can be adopted in the succeeding parametric study 3 dynamic response of different marine sediments subjected to various explosive charge has been studied in this paper time history of total stress in the model conforms to standard variation of stress induced by blast loading peak value of total stress induced by s wave will separate from that induced by p wave for velocity of s wave is much smaller than p wave time history of epwp shows a similar trend with that of total stress residual pore pressure increases instantly and then decrease for blast wave with longer duration is more effective for accumulation of pore water pressure in muddy clay residual pore pressure in sandy soil drops close to zero because of larger permeability and dilatancy of sand 4 attenuation formulas of peak total stress and pore pressure are obtained based on numerical results with various explosive charge from 50 kg to 350 kg peak value of total stress decays exponentially in both models stress level and residual stress are larger in muddy clay than sand peak value of pore pressure decays in the same way as illustrated with attenuation curve of peak total stress in model i however there is an approximately linear attenuation pattern in model ii despite the proposed forecasting formulas are concluded within explosive charge of 400 kg tnt it also gives a good prediction with the result of 600 kg tnt case acknowledgments the authors are
