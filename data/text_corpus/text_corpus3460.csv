17300,reservoirs are a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o but there are few data on n2o in the world s largest reservoirs and limited understanding of the factors controlling their emission rates here we analyzed high resolution measurements of dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes in a typical tributary bay of three gorges reservoir the surface water was oversaturated in n2o during both low and high water level 8 6 16 4 nmol l 107 180 saturation and n2o fluxes varied nearly tenfold 0 2 and 1 6 μmol m2 h dissolved n2o concentrations were characterized by pronounced vertical gradients which were controlled by bidirectional density currents the river water with high concentrations entered the bay as an underflow along the riverbed the upper part of the water column was formed by intrusive backwater of three gorges reservoir having significantly lower n2o concentrations in consequence the n2o emission potential of the impoundment was reduced compared to pre impoundment conditions these results reveal the importance of hydraulic conditions on n2o emission from large reservoirs and suggest that flow regulation can be a potential tool for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from manmade impoundments keywords greenhouse gas dissolved n2o n2o emission bidirectional density currents three gorges reservoir 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an atmospheric trace gas with a 298 fold higher global warming potential as co2 and responsible for 6 of current global warming ipcc 2013 in addition it currently is the most important anthropogenic emission responsible for depletion of stratospheric ozone and is expected to remain the largest contributor throughout the 21st century ravishankara et al 2009 identification and quantification of important anthropogenic and natural sources of n2o require improved understanding of the mechanisms controlling its formation and emission schreiber et al 2012 a growing number of studies indicate that manmade reservoirs are n2o sources beaulieu et al 2010 2015 descloux et al 2017 guérin et al 2008 huttunen et al 2002 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2019 with high emission rates because of their distinctive characteristics from natural aquatic systems deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 current estimates suggest that emissions from river networks are equivalent to 10 of the global anthropogenic n2o emission beaulieu et al 2011 reservoirs account for 1 3 of the global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions deemer et al 2016 and produce most n2o per unit area maavara et al 2018 controlled by dam operation dissolved n2o concentrations in reservoirs are characterized by high spatial and temporal heterogeneity beaulieu et al 2014 chen et al 2014 deemer et al 2011 liang et al 2019 and it requires high precision measuring equipment to detect its distribution and dynamics the three gorges project is the world s largest hydropower project but there are limited studies on n2o emission in three gorges reservoir tgr compared to co2 or ch4 yu et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 zhu et al 2013 the few existing reports were subject to limitations in the sampling and analytical technique and could not resolve the spatial and temporal variability of dissolved n2o concentrations cheng et al 2019 le et al 2014 confluence zones of reservoir tributaries with the yangtze river have been identified as hotspots of biogeochemical cycling and pollutant transfer in the tgr area with frequent occurrence of serious algal blooms holbach et al 2014 liu et al 2012 density currents i e bidirectional exchange flows between the main reservoir and its tributaries are important hydrodynamic features which control the water environment in these zones ji et al 2017 liu et al 2012 yang et al 2018b their effect on greenhouse gas emissions is currently unknown as a typical eutrophic tributary of tgr we measured n2o emission from the xiangxi river we used a novel fast response automated gas equilibrator xiao et al 2020 in combination with a fast response n2o analyzer for high resolution mapping of dissolved n2o concentrations along vertical profiles and at the water surface we related the spatial distribution of n2o concentrations to atmospheric emissions in the tributary and explore the role of density driven exchange flows with tgr the results provide novel insights into n2o concentrations and emission dynamics in large reservoirs which potentially support the development of reservoir operation rules for mitigating n2o release to the atmosphere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling overview xiangxi river xxr is a typical tributary of the yangtze river covered by the tgr backwater its river mouth is located about 32 km upstream of three gorges dam fig 1 xxr flows through a v shaped valley with steep mountains more than 1000 m high on both sides luo et al 2017 when the tgr is operated at a low water level of 156 m xxr was covered by backwater up to approximately 32 km from the river mouth this area is called xiangxi bay xxb when tgr is operated at the maximum water level of 175 m the backwater extends to approximately 40 km in xxr field investigations were carried out on july 23rd 25th and october 25th 31th 2019 ten sampling sites at equal distances of approximately 3 km along the thalweg were established in xxb and designated as xx00 xx09 in succession from the river mouth to the end of the backwater fig 1 additional sampling sites were located at the yangtze river main stream in tgr cjxx and in the free flowing section of xxr upstream of the backwater designated as inflow at the sites xx00 xx09 and at cjxx we measured vertical profiles of dissolved n2o concentration current velocity water temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen concentration do as well as the flux of n2o across the air water interface for measuring vertical profiles a water pump and sensors were slowly lowered from the water surface to the bottom with approximately 9 measurements per meter of the water column measurement details are described below at the inflow site water samples were collected and sealed underwater near the bank and dissolved n2o concentrations were immediately measured in a field laboratory water temperature at the inflow site was measured continuously by a micro thermometer solo3 t rbr canada because of bad weather conditions heavy rain the sites cjxx and xx00 xx03 were measured on july 24th and the remaining sites and the inflow site were measured on jul 25th in october measurements at all sites were completed on single days and repeated surveys were conducted on oct 25th and from 27th to 30th respectively nitrous oxide concentration at the inflow site was measured on october 31th due to technical failure we lost measurements of water characteristics from oct 27th hence also the n2o concentration data of that day were excluded from the results in order to obtain two dimensional distributions of the measured parameters in the bay the profile measurements xx00 xx09 were interpolated by the natural neighbor method using the surfer software surfer 15 golden software usa on jul 23rd and oct 26th we additionally mapped the spatial distribution of n2o concentration and temperature at the water surface 0 5 m depth at high resolution continuous measurements were conducted while cruising with the boat in zigzag courses from cjxx to xx09 fig 1 the sampling locations were recorded by gps surface concentration mapping resulted in more than 104 individual measurements of n2o concentration each day and approximately 2600 thinned data to match gps records were used to interpolate the measurements over the entire bay surface by kriging to explore the fate of dissolved n2o in water triplicate water samples from the middle layer at site xx06 were collected and sealed in pvc water bags 10 l tuban china the samples were collected without gas bubbles and stored in a laboratory incubator at in situ water temperature dissolved n2o concentrations were measured for seven days 2 2 measurements and analyses current velocity was measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vector nortek as norway attached to an anchored rope and held for 30 seconds every 2 meters water temperature electrical conductivity specific conductivity corrected for temperature dependence do turbidity and chlorophyll were measured at depth intervals of 1 m using a multiprobe exo2 ysi usa fluxes of n2o across the air water interface were measured using a floating chamber attached to a n2o analyzer n2om1 916 lgr canada the chamber had a height of 24 cm and 25 cm diameter with a small fan 1 5 v on the top inside chamber edges were submerged approximately 1 cm below the water surface fluxes were obtained by the slopes of the observed n2o concentrations in the chamber over at least 5 min when the slopes were approximately linear r2 0 9 during each flux measurement wind speed was measured on the boat with a portable anemometer ygy qxy yigu china the measurements were conducted at 2 m height and adjusted to a standard measurement height of 10 m u10 according to amorocho and devries 1980 the gas transfer velocity k of n2o was calculated using the wanninkhof 2014 formulation eq 1 and normalized to a schmidt number sc of 600 k600 following liss and merlivat 1986 eq 2 the temperature dependent schmidt number of n2o was calculated according to wanninkhof 2014 eq 3 where t is temperature in c 1 k 0 251 10 10 2 sc 660 0 5 2 k 600 k 600 sc 2 3 3 s c n 2 o 2141 2 152 56 t 5 8963 t 2 0 12411 t 3 0 0010655 t 4 dissolved n2o concentrations in water were measured by coupling the gas analyzer n2om1 916 lgr canada to a fast response gas equilibrator as described in xiao et al 2020 the equilibrator is briefly described as follows sample water was constantly pumped at a rate of 250 ml min to a 50 ml unit and mixed with small bubbles of dinitrogen gas which was released through an air stone the two flows kept exchanging gas along a 2 m long coiled tubing tygon inner diameter 4 mm subsequently the gas was separated from the sample water and analyzed by the n2o analyzer n2o concentration in the dinitrogen gas was measured as a background concentration before the measurement of each site and subtracted from all measurements the sampled n2o mole fraction was converted to dissolved concentration in the sample water using a device specific calibration curve which accounted for partial equilibration in the device xiao et al 2020 and temperature dependent solubility weiss price 1980 the saturation concentration in water at given temperature was estimated using a global average atmospheric n2o concentration of 329 ppb wmo 2018 3 results 3 1 water characteristics the two seasonal surveys covered periods of low water and high water level in tgr during summer 151 to 153 5 m above sea level between jul 23rd and 25th and fall 173 4 m to 174 7 m between oct 25th and 30th the latter survey coincided with the start of the highest water level 175 m operating stage of tgr during both surveys the flow from the yangtze river intruded into the xxr as an interflow the intrusion depth varied between 10 and 30 m in july and between 30 and 60 m depth in october fig 2 a b the inflowing river water entered the bay in a bottom layer and partially at the water surface where it mixed with the tgr backwater the magnitudes of the flow velocities at the river mouth were larger in july when the water level was 20 m lower than in october in the bay current velocities varied between 0 0 001 m s detection limit and 0 09 m s except for the bottom layer while it was approximately 0 2 m s towards the yangtze river flow velocity in the inflowing river was visually estimated as approximately 3m s in july after rain and 1m s in october electrical conductivity of the xxr inflow was considerably lower than that in tgr site cjxx during both surveys and can be considered as a tracer for flow paths and mixing fig 2 a b in july the average conductivity was 368 μs cm at cjxx and that of the inflowing water from the tributary upstream was 280 μs cm inflowing river water with lower conductivity only flowed in the bottom layer towards the yangtze river the other parts of xxb were occupied by water with higher conductivity in october electrical conductivity was 340 μs cm at cjxx and 275 μs cm at the inflow tgr backwater with higher conductivity flowed from the river mouth into xxr and occupied the entire bay except the bottom 10 m layer where inflowing river water was transported towards tgr water temperature differed only slightly between cjxx 24 40 c and the inflow 22 97 c in july but varied between 22 84 c and 33 24 c in october fig 2 c there was a pronounced vertical temperature stratification in the bay in july with water temperature higher than 26 c in the top 5m a thermocline with a sharp drop in temperature at 10 m depth and relatively constant temperature below the upstream inflow was characterized by a 5 m thick layer at the bottom with a temperature around 23 5 c in october water temperature at cjxx was more than 10 c warmer 22 27 c than that at the inflow 11 04 c in xxb the temperature ranged from 17 20 c to 22 65 c under these conditions the water temperature distribution in xxb was similar to that of electrical conductivity indicating the bidirectional density currents formed by the two different water sources from yangtze river and from the inflowing river respectively vertical temperature stratification was less pronounced in october fig 2 d the distribution of do differed from those of temperature and electrical conductivity fig 2 e f in july do ranged from 5 3 to 20 6 mg l 62 267 saturation with the highest value measured at the water surface at site xx09 where many algae were observed with chlorophyll concentration up to 40 μg l in october do was less variable and ranged from 6 8 to 8 8 mg l 76 101 saturation with an average of 7 4 mg l 84 saturation in the bay 3 2 nitrous oxide concentrations the longitudinal and vertical distributions of dissolved n2o in xxb showed distinct features in july and october and persistent patterns during the five individual surveys conducted in october fig 3 in july the concentrations in xxb ranged from 7 9 to 25 6 nmol l corresponding to 118 to 302 saturation in respect to atmospheric equilibrium concentration measured dissolved n2o concentration versus 329 9 ppb in atmosphere equilibrated to dissolved n2o concentration in water at in situ temperature in october it varied in the same range from 9 5 to 24 1 nmol l corresponding to 106 to 231 saturation in july the n2o concentration at the inflow was 14 4 nmol l 166 saturation at cjxx n2o concentration was nearly constant throughout the water column with an average of 8 7 0 09 nmol l 103 saturation indicated well mixed conditions in the yangtze river supplement 1 in the bay the highest n2o concentration 25 6 nmol l was observed in the bottom layer approximately 6 km upstream of the river mouth fig 3 a the lowest concentration was measured in the surface layer at xx09 which can potentially reflect dilution by the rain in the afternoon of jul 23rd in october the n2o concentration at the inflow was 20 2 nmol l 150 saturation and 10 3 0 23 nmol l 108 saturation in the water column at cjxx oct 25th supplement 1 during all surveys conducted between oct 25th to 30th there was a thin 5 m layer at the bottom of xxb with n2o concentration exceeding 20 nmol l above this bottom layer there was a region with markedly lower concentrations 10 11 nmol l throughout most of the water column fig 3 b c sharp intrusions were observed near the river mouth on oct 25th and 28th and in the mid stream of the bay on oct 29th which spread over the entire bay similar distribution patterns were observed in electrical conductivity supplement 2 indicating that these intrusions were formed by exchange flows from tgr which were supported by continuously increasing water level on oct 29th n2o concentrations were gradually decreasing from the bottom to the surface layer fig 3 d whereas a new intrusion was observed on oct 30th fig 3 e pearson correlation tests showed that in october n2o concentrations in the bay were highly negatively correlated to electrical conductivity and water temperature with correlation coefficients of 0 75 0 05 p 0 01 and 0 81 0 07 p 0 01 respectively and weakly correlated to do 0 38 0 14 p 0 01 and chlorophyll 0 46 0 17 p 0 01 electrical conductivity was correlated with water temperature 0 69 0 09 p 0 01 in july n2o concentrations were weakly correlated to water temperature 0 41 p 0 01 do 0 37 p 0 01 and chlorophyll 0 33 p 0 01 while no significant correlation between n2o concentrations and electrical conductivity and a weak negative correlation between electrical conductivity and water temperature 0 36 p 0 01 was observed 3 3 surface concentrations and fluxes in july n2o concentrations in the surface layer ranged from 8 6 to 13 1 nmol l 107 to 167 saturation fig 4 the n2o concentrations were lowest in a central region of xxb around xx03 and xx04 and higher at the river mouth and in the inflow region there are two tributaries near xx05 located up and down stream of the sampling site which may have influenced n2o concentrations in this region in october surface n2o concentrations were higher and ranged from 13 8 to 16 4 nmol l 152 to 180 saturation it was highest in the inflow region and gradually decreased between xx09 and xx06 concentrations at the river mouth were only slightly elevated electrical conductivity was always lower at the upstream end of the bay than that at the river mouth supplement 3 4 water temperature at the end of the bay was lower than at the river mouth in october as expect for cooler water from upstream supplement 4 but it was much warmer in july indicating that strong solar radiation heated the relatively stagnant water in the bay supplement 3 the n2o fluxes estimated from floating chamber ranged from 0 2 μmol m2 h to 1 6 μmol m2 h fig 5 there was no significant difference between the fluxes measured in july and in october the fluxes tended to be higher in tgr cjxx and in the inflow region of the bay xx09 as well as in the central region xx03 and xx04 with an average of 0 9 0 3 μmol m2 h where it was significantly p 0 01 higher than at other sites with an average of 0 5 0 2 μmol m2 h wind speed at 10 m height of the 10 sites in the bay ranged between 1 0 and 3 2 m s gas transfer velocities k calculated from wind speed ranged from 0 3 cm h to 3 9 cm h while k600 ranged from 0 3 cm h to 3 5 cm h there was no significant correlation between n2o fluxes and excess surface water concentrations difference between dissolved and saturation concentrations however the fluxes were highly correlated to the gas exchange velocity k pearson correlation coefficient of 0 56 p 0 05 which indicated that the variability of the fluxes was mainly controlled by variations in k the fluxes were higher at the river mouth cjxx a relatively straight section of the bay xx03 xx04 and at the end of the backwater xx09 indicating geomorphology related controls on wind speed and gas emissions by the river valley 4 discussion 4 1 nitrous oxide distribution nitrous oxide can be produced under oxic conditions by nitrification and under oxygen deficit by denitrification maximum n2o concentrations have been reported in the bottom layers of a stratified lake as a result of denitrification sasaki et al 2011 but more frequently in close proximity to an oxycline where it may be mainly produced by nitrification beaulieu et al 2015 casciotti et al 2018 mengis et al 1997 priscu 1997 priscu et al 2008 trimmer et al 2016 yoshida et al 1989 in xxb we found pronounced vertical concentration gradients of dissolved n2o concentrations with maximal values in the bottom 5 m layer along the riverbed the strong correlations of dissolved n2o concentrations and electrical conductivity and water temperature suggest that there were two distinct water sources tgr backwater and the inflowing river with different electrical conductivity temperature temperature do nutrients and other environmental factors have been shown to influence microbial mediated n2o production beaulieu et al 2014 deemer et al 2011 schreiber et al 2012 the inflowing river had higher n2o concentrations than tgr backwater during both seasons supplement 1 and the flow path of the two water sources controlled the spatial distribution of n2o concentrations in the bay as bidirectional density the inflowing river water flowed along the bottom of xxb while the surface and middle layer of the water column in xxb were primarily affected by the tgr backwater density currents caused by differences in suspended solids salinity or temperature have been studied intensively in estuaries garcía et al 2007 wright and marineau 2019 in xxb the density currents are mainly caused by the temperature difference between the tgr backwater and the inflowing river water and generally show four distinct intrusive patterns throughout an annual cycle holbach et al 2014 ji et al 2010 yang et al 2018a our study revealed that density currents in the tributary bay had a strong effect on the distribution of dissolved n2o concentrations and atmospheric emissions the continuous increase of the tgr water level during both our sampling campaigns promoted the development of intrusive density currents from tgr in the middle and surface layer these two patterns typically persist from may to october when water level and discharge fluctuated strongly and the inflowing river with lower temperature enters along the bottom layer long et al 2019 yang et al 2018b the shorter term temporal variability of dissolved n2o concentrations observed during repeated surveys in october as well as smaller scale spatial variability of concentrations during individual surveys fig 3 might be related to hydrodynamic features bay oscillations long et al 2020 generated by rapid changes in discharge at the three gorges dam 4 2 nitrous oxide concentrations the high negative correlations between n2o concentrations and electrical conductivity and temperature indicated that the inflowing river water carried the high concentration of n2o as a density current below the tgr backwater near the riverbed the inflow mixed with n2o produced in sediments yu et al 2018 and carried the highest n2o concentrations to the yangtze river the n2o concentrations in the inflow and riverbed were approximately 14 25 nmol l in the bay which were comparable with that in agricultural headwater stream in the upper reach of yangtze river 6 29 nmol l tian et al 2019 the water column at cjxx and near surface layer of the bay was predominantly affected by the yangtze river backwater with much lower n2o concentrations 8 6 16 4 nmol l which were comparable to previous studies in tgr region 9 7 16 4 nmol l cheng et al 2019 these observations indicated a lower emission potential per unit area in the bay as compared to the river water temperature may influence n2o concentration by affecting solubility the n2o concentrations and saturations in the upper layers of the whole bay in july were higher than those in october fig 3 which might be caused by the higher temperature leading to the more n2o produced in the river upstream in july the surface water temperature in the bay mean value 28 64 c with n2o 10 9 nmol l mixed with the inflowing river water and atmospheric n2o saturated concentration of 7 4 nmol l was approximately 4 c higher compared to the reservoir cjxx 24 40 c with n2o 8 7 nmol l and atmospheric n2o saturated concentration of 8 3 nmol l the oversaturated n2o concentration of the surface water of the bay increased to 3 5 nmol l compared to 0 4 nmol l at cjxx due to the different supersaturation concentrations the solar radiation caused warming and mixing of backwater and inflowing river water in the bay leading to a 9 fold higher n2o flux for the same gas exchange velocity in most areas of xxb do was higher than 7 mg l saturation 84 which indicated an oxic environment and unfavorable conditions for of n2o consumption by denitrification beaulieu et al 2015 the only enzyme with physiological activity nitrous oxide reductase nos nosz which is able to reduce n2o is sensitive to oxygen ph and sulfide kuypers et al 2018 pauleta et al 2019 to explore the fate of n2o water samples from xx06 site were collected and stored in a laboratory incubator at in situ temperature for seven days there was no significant change in dissolved n2o concentrations during the incubation supplement 5 indicating there was no significant n2o production or consumption hence we believe the high n2o in the bottom layer would be further diluted by the oxic yangtze river water in tgr and eventually emitted to the atmosphere downstream of the tributary mouth cheng et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 4 3 nitrous oxide emission significant n2o emission and supersaturation of dissolved n2o in july and october confirmed that the tgr backwater was a source of n2o to the atmosphere as it had been reported in previous studies cheng et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 the gas flux across the air water interface depends on the gas exchange velocity k and air water concentration gradients the gas exchange velocity k is essentially controlled by turbulent mixing mainly caused by shear stresses at the streambed and wind at the water surface beaulieu et al 2012 the n2o fluxes in xxb 0 2 1 6 μmol m2 h were comparable to the global average flux from lakes and reservoirs 0 9 μmol m2 h deemer et al 2016 xie et al 2018 and much lower than fluxes from headwater and small streams 1 4 6 4 μmol m2 h for stream width smaller than 30 m beaulieu et al 2011 marzadri et al 2017 our findings support the results of marzadri et al 2017 and yao et al 2019 showing a lower emission potential of n2o produced in water column in deep water areas and higher n2o emission in headwater streams where it is mainly produced in the hyporheic zone by analyzing n2o fluxes from different reservoirs liang et al 2019 found that hydraulic load water depth water residence time was significantly negatively related to n2o emission in this study the higher n2o concentrations in the inflowing river water were covered by the tgr backwater with lower n2o concentrations in the bay the bidirectional density current can therefore be expected to reduce n2o emissions from the bay in addition the flow velocity in the bay millimeter to centimeter per second was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the free flowing river upstream decimeter to meter per second which led to a reduction in the gas transfer velocity in consequence the n2o emission potential was further reduced we estimated the total n2o emission from the bay as the product of the supersaturation concentrations of n2o the gas transfer velocity and water surface area the fluxes of n2o during pre dam conditions were estimated by considering the oversaturation concentrations of n2o observed in the inflow and gas exchange velocity estimated from flow velocity suggested by beaulieu et al 2012 k600 32 96v 10 59 v refers to flow velocity m s k600 was converted to k considered the inflow water temperature wanninkhof 2014 the post dam n2o flux was estimated as the average measured n2o flux the surface area of the bay was about one order of magnitude smaller before dam construction estimated using google earth historic images the results showed that even though the water surface area increased tenfold the total n2o emission from the bay was reduced by factor of 0 6 in july while it was 1 5 fold higher in october to this extent the intrusive density currents formed by tgr backwater caused a reduction of n2o emission potential per unit area from the xxb for the total n2o emission from the bay in view of the large variability observed between our two sampling campaigns year round investigation of n2o concentrations and fluxes are needed for the overall situation 5 conclusions a fast response automated gas equilibrator facilitated high resolution mapping of dissolved n2o concentrations in the tgr area and revealed the importance of bidirectional density currents in controlling near surface concentrations and atmospheric emissions nitrous oxide concentrations in the yangtze river mainstream and its tributary bay were supersaturated in respect to the atmosphere in july and october and observed concentrations were comparable to those in other reservoirs in the bay the high n2o concentrations from the inflowing river was found in a 5 m thick bottom layer along the bay while intrusive tgr backwater with lower n2o occupied the upper layer and reduced the atmospheric emission potential the n2o fluxes in the bay were comparable to those in other reservoirs and lower than in streams our observations indicated that the n2o emission potential per unit area of the bay was reduced compared to pre impoundment conditions as the depth at which the intrusive backwaters enter the bay changes seasonally year round investigation of n2o concentrations and fluxes are needed as the dam operation drives

17300,reservoirs are a significant source of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide n2o but there are few data on n2o in the world s largest reservoirs and limited understanding of the factors controlling their emission rates here we analyzed high resolution measurements of dissolved n2o concentrations and fluxes in a typical tributary bay of three gorges reservoir the surface water was oversaturated in n2o during both low and high water level 8 6 16 4 nmol l 107 180 saturation and n2o fluxes varied nearly tenfold 0 2 and 1 6 μmol m2 h dissolved n2o concentrations were characterized by pronounced vertical gradients which were controlled by bidirectional density currents the river water with high concentrations entered the bay as an underflow along the riverbed the upper part of the water column was formed by intrusive backwater of three gorges reservoir having significantly lower n2o concentrations in consequence the n2o emission potential of the impoundment was reduced compared to pre impoundment conditions these results reveal the importance of hydraulic conditions on n2o emission from large reservoirs and suggest that flow regulation can be a potential tool for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from manmade impoundments keywords greenhouse gas dissolved n2o n2o emission bidirectional density currents three gorges reservoir 1 introduction nitrous oxide n2o is an atmospheric trace gas with a 298 fold higher global warming potential as co2 and responsible for 6 of current global warming ipcc 2013 in addition it currently is the most important anthropogenic emission responsible for depletion of stratospheric ozone and is expected to remain the largest contributor throughout the 21st century ravishankara et al 2009 identification and quantification of important anthropogenic and natural sources of n2o require improved understanding of the mechanisms controlling its formation and emission schreiber et al 2012 a growing number of studies indicate that manmade reservoirs are n2o sources beaulieu et al 2010 2015 descloux et al 2017 guérin et al 2008 huttunen et al 2002 liu et al 2017 yang et al 2019 with high emission rates because of their distinctive characteristics from natural aquatic systems deemer et al 2016 maavara et al 2020 current estimates suggest that emissions from river networks are equivalent to 10 of the

analytical technique and could not resolve the spatial and temporal variability of dissolved n2o concentrations cheng et al 2019 le et al 2014 confluence zones of reservoir tributaries with the yangtze river have been identified as hotspots of biogeochemical cycling and pollutant transfer in the tgr area with frequent occurrence of serious algal blooms holbach et al 2014 liu et al 2012

liu et al 2012 yang et al 2018b their effect on greenhouse gas emissions is currently unknown as a typical eutrophic tributary of tgr we measured n2o emission from the xiangxi river we used a novel fast response automated gas equilibrator xiao et al 2020 in combination with a fast response n2o analyzer for high resolution mapping of dissolved n2o concentrations along vertical profiles and at the water surface we related the spatial distribution of n2o concentrations to atmospheric emissions in the tributary and explore the role of density driven exchange flows with tgr the results provide novel insights into n2o concentrations and emission dynamics in large reservoirs which potentially support the development of reservoir operation rules for mitigating n2o release to the atmosphere 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and sampling overview xiangxi river xxr is a typical tributary of the yangtze river covered by the tgr backwater its river mouth is located about 32 km upstream of three gorges dam fig 1 xxr flows through a v shaped valley with steep mountains more than 1000 m high on both sides luo et al 2017 when the tgr is operated at a low water level of 156 m xxr was covered by backwater up to approximately 32 km from the river mouth this area is called xiangxi bay xxb when tgr is operated at the maximum water level of 175 m the backwater extends to approximately 40 km in xxr field investigations were carried out on july 23rd 25th and october 25th 31th 2019 ten sampling sites at equal distances of approximately 3 km along the thalweg were established in xxb and designated as xx00 xx09 in succession from the river mouth to the end of the backwater fig 1 additional sampling sites were located at the yangtze river main stream in tgr cjxx and in the free flowing section of xxr upstream of the backwater designated as inflow at the sites xx00 xx09 and at cjxx we measured vertical profiles of dissolved n2o concentration current velocity water temperature electrical conductivity and dissolved oxygen concentration do as well as the flux of n2o across the air water interface for measuring vertical profiles a water pump and sensors were slowly lowered from the water surface to the bottom with approximately 9 measurements per meter of the water column measurement details are described below at the inflow site water samples were collected and sealed underwater near the bank and dissolved n2o concentrations were immediately measured in a field laboratory water temperature at the inflow site was measured continuously by a micro thermometer solo3 t rbr canada because of bad weather conditions heavy rain the sites cjxx and xx00 xx03 were measured on july 24th and the remaining sites and the inflow site were measured on jul 25th in october measurements at all sites were completed on single days and repeated surveys were conducted on oct 25th and from 27th to 30th respectively nitrous oxide concentration at the inflow site was measured on october 31th due to technical failure we lost measurements of water characteristics from oct 27th hence also the n2o concentration data of that day were excluded from the results in order to obtain two dimensional distributions of the measured parameters in the bay the profile measurements xx00 xx09 were interpolated by the natural neighbor method using the surfer software surfer 15 golden software usa on jul 23rd and oct 26th we additionally mapped the spatial distribution of n2o concentration and temperature at the water surface 0 5 m depth at high resolution continuous measurements were conducted while cruising with the boat in zigzag courses from cjxx to xx09 fig 1 the sampling locations were recorded by gps surface concentration mapping resulted in more than 104 individual measurements of n2o concentration each day and approximately 2600 thinned data to match gps records were used to interpolate the measurements over the entire bay surface by kriging to explore the fate of dissolved n2o in water triplicate water samples from the middle layer at site xx06 were collected and sealed in pvc water bags 10 l tuban china the samples were collected without gas bubbles and stored in a laboratory incubator at in situ water temperature dissolved n2o concentrations were measured for seven days 2 2 measurements and analyses current velocity was measured by an acoustic doppler velocimeter adv vector nortek as norway attached to an anchored rope and held for 30 seconds every 2 meters water temperature electrical conductivity specific conductivity corrected for temperature dependence do turbidity and chlorophyll were measured at depth intervals of 1 m using a multiprobe exo2 ysi usa fluxes of n2o across the air water interface were measured using a floating chamber attached to a n2o analyzer n2om1 916 lgr canada the chamber had a height of 24 cm and 25 cm diameter with a small fan 1 5 v on the top inside chamber edges were submerged approximately 1 cm below the water surface fluxes were obtained by the slopes of the observed n2o concentrations in the chamber over at least 5 min when the slopes were approximately linear r2 0 9 during each flux measurement wind speed was measured on the boat with a portable anemometer ygy qxy yigu china the measurements were conducted at 2 m height and adjusted to a standard measurement height of 10 m u10 according to amorocho and devries 1980 the gas transfer velocity k of n2o was calculated using the wanninkhof 2014 formulation eq 1 and normalized to a schmidt number sc of 600 k600 following liss and merlivat 1986 eq 2 the temperature dependent schmidt number of n2o was calculated according to wanninkhof 2014 eq 3 where t is temperature in c 1 k 0 251 10 10 2 sc 660 0 5 2 k 600 k 600 sc 2 3 3 s c n 2 o 2141 2 152 56 t 5 8963 t 2 0 12411 t 3 0 0010655 t 4 dissolved n2o concentrations in water were measured by coupling the gas analyzer n2om1 916 lgr canada to a fast response gas equilibrator as described in xiao et al 2020 the equilibrator is briefly described as follows sample water was constantly pumped at a rate of 250 ml min to a 50 ml unit and mixed with small bubbles of dinitrogen gas which was released through an air stone the two flows kept exchanging gas along a 2 m long coiled tubing tygon inner diameter 4 mm subsequently the gas was separated from the sample water and analyzed by the n2o analyzer n2o concentration in the dinitrogen gas was measured as a background concentration before the measurement of each site and subtracted from all measurements the sampled n2o mole fraction was converted to dissolved concentration in the sample water using a device specific calibration curve which accounted for partial equilibration in the device xiao et al 2020 and temperature dependent solubility weiss price 1980 the saturation concentration in water at given temperature was estimated using a global average atmospheric n2o concentration of 329 ppb wmo 2018 3 results 3 1 water characteristics the two seasonal surveys covered periods of low water and high water level in tgr during summer 151 to 153 5 m above sea level between jul 23rd and 25th and fall 173 4 m to 174 7 m between oct 25th and 30th the latter survey coincided with the start of the highest water level 175 m operating stage of tgr during both surveys the flow from the yangtze river intruded into the xxr as an interflow the intrusion depth varied between 10 and 30 m in july and between 30 and 60 m depth in october fig 2 a b the inflowing river water entered the bay in a bottom layer and partially at the water surface where it mixed with the tgr backwater the magnitudes of the flow velocities at the river mouth were larger in july when the water level was 20 m lower than in october in the bay current velocities varied between 0 0 001 m s detection limit and 0 09 m s except for the bottom layer while it was approximately 0 2 m s towards the yangtze river flow velocity in the inflowing river was visually estimated as approximately 3m s in july after rain and 1m s in october electrical conductivity of the xxr inflow was considerably lower than that in tgr site cjxx during both surveys and can be considered as a tracer for flow paths and mixing fig 2 a b in july the average conductivity was 368 μs cm at cjxx and that of the inflowing water from the tributary upstream was 280 μs cm inflowing river water with lower conductivity only flowed in the bottom layer towards the yangtze river the other parts of xxb were occupied by water with higher conductivity in october electrical conductivity was 340 μs cm at cjxx and 275 μs cm at the inflow tgr backwater with higher conductivity flowed from the river mouth into xxr and occupied the entire bay except the bottom 10 m layer where inflowing river water was transported towards tgr water temperature differed only slightly between cjxx 24 40 c and the inflow 22 97 c in july but varied between 22 84 c and 33 24 c in october fig 2 c there was a pronounced vertical temperature stratification in the bay in july with water temperature higher than 26 c in the top 5m a thermocline with a sharp drop in temperature at 10 m depth and relatively constant temperature below the upstream inflow was characterized by a 5 m thick layer at the bottom with a temperature around 23 5 c in october water temperature at cjxx was more than 10 c warmer 22 27 c than that at the inflow 11 04 c in xxb the temperature ranged from 17 20 c to 22 65 c under these conditions the water temperature distribution in xxb was similar to that of electrical conductivity indicating the bidirectional density currents formed by the two different water sources from yangtze river and from the inflowing river respectively vertical temperature stratification was less pronounced in october fig 2 d the distribution of do differed from those of temperature and electrical conductivity fig 2 e f in july do ranged from 5 3 to 20 6 mg l 62 267 saturation with the highest value measured at the water surface at site xx09 where many algae were observed with chlorophyll concentration up to 40 μg l in october do was less variable and ranged from 6 8 to 8 8 mg l 76 101 saturation with an average of 7 4 mg l 84 saturation in the bay 3 2 nitrous oxide concentrations the longitudinal and vertical distributions of dissolved n2o in xxb showed distinct features in july and october and persistent patterns during the five individual surveys conducted in october fig 3 in july the concentrations in xxb ranged from 7 9 to 25 6 nmol l corresponding to 118 to 302 saturation in respect to atmospheric equilibrium concentration measured dissolved n2o concentration versus 329 9 ppb in atmosphere equilibrated to dissolved n2o concentration in water at in situ temperature in october it varied in the same range from 9 5 to 24 1 nmol l corresponding to 106 to 231 saturation in july the n2o concentration at the inflow was 14 4 nmol l 166 saturation at cjxx n2o concentration was nearly constant throughout the water column with an average of 8 7 0 09 nmol l 103 saturation indicated well mixed conditions in the yangtze river supplement 1 in the bay the highest n2o concentration 25 6 nmol l was observed in the bottom layer approximately 6 km upstream of the river mouth fig 3 a the lowest concentration was measured in the surface layer at xx09 which can potentially reflect dilution by the rain in the afternoon of jul 23rd in october the n2o concentration at the inflow was 20 2 nmol l 150 saturation and 10 3 0 23 nmol l 108 saturation in the water column at cjxx oct 25th supplement 1 during all surveys conducted between oct 25th to 30th there was a thin 5 m layer at the bottom of xxb with n2o concentration exceeding 20 nmol l above this bottom layer there was a region with markedly lower concentrations 10 11 nmol l throughout most of the water column fig 3 b c sharp intrusions were observed near the river mouth on oct 25th and 28th and in the mid stream of the bay on oct 29th which spread over the entire bay similar distribution patterns were observed in electrical conductivity supplement 2 indicating that these intrusions were formed by exchange flows from tgr which were supported by continuously increasing water level on oct 29th n2o concentrations were gradually decreasing from the bottom to the surface layer fig 3 d whereas a new intrusion was observed on oct 30th fig 3 e pearson correlation tests showed that in october n2o concentrations in the bay were highly negatively correlated to electrical conductivity and water temperature with correlation coefficients of 0 75 0 05 p 0 01 and 0 81 0 07 p 0 01 respectively and weakly correlated to do 0 38 0 14 p 0 01 and chlorophyll 0 46 0 17 p 0 01 electrical conductivity was correlated with water temperature 0 69 0 09 p 0 01 in july n2o concentrations were weakly correlated to water temperature 0 41 p 0 01 do 0 37 p 0 01 and chlorophyll 0 33 p 0 01 while no significant correlation between n2o concentrations and electrical conductivity and a weak negative correlation between electrical conductivity and water temperature 0 36 p 0 01 was observed 3 3 surface concentrations and fluxes in july n2o concentrations in the surface layer ranged from 8 6 to 13 1 nmol l 107 to 167 saturation fig 4 the n2o concentrations were lowest in a central region of xxb around xx03 and xx04 and higher at the river mouth and in the inflow region there are two tributaries near xx05 located up and down stream of the sampling site which may have influenced n2o concentrations in this region in october surface n2o concentrations were higher and ranged from 13 8 to 16 4 nmol l 152 to 180 saturation it was highest in the inflow region and gradually decreased between xx09 and xx06 concentrations at the river mouth were only slightly elevated electrical conductivity was always lower at the upstream end of the bay than that at the river mouth supplement 3 4 water temperature at the end of the bay was lower than at the river mouth in october as expect for cooler water from upstream supplement 4 but it was much warmer in july indicating that strong solar radiation heated the relatively stagnant water in the bay supplement 3 the n2o fluxes estimated from floating chamber ranged from 0 2 μmol m2 h to 1 6 μmol m2 h fig 5 there was no significant difference between the fluxes measured in july and in october the fluxes tended to be higher in tgr cjxx and in the inflow region of the bay xx09 as well as in the central region xx03 and xx04 with an average of 0 9 0 3 μmol m2 h where it was significantly p 0 01 higher than at other sites with an average of 0 5 0 2 μmol m2 h wind speed at 10 m height of the 10 sites in the bay ranged between 1 0 and 3 2 m s gas transfer velocities k calculated from wind speed ranged from 0 3 cm h to 3 9 cm h while k600 ranged from 0 3 cm h to 3 5 cm h there was no significant correlation between n2o fluxes and excess surface water concentrations difference between dissolved and saturation concentrations however the fluxes were highly correlated to the gas exchange velocity k pearson correlation coefficient of 0 56 p 0 05 which indicated that the variability of the fluxes was mainly controlled by variations in k the fluxes were higher at the river mouth cjxx a relatively straight section of the bay xx03 xx04 and at the end of the backwater xx09 indicating geomorphology related controls on wind speed and gas emissions by the river valley 4 discussion 4 1 nitrous oxide distribution nitrous oxide can be produced under oxic conditions by nitrification and under oxygen deficit by denitrification maximum n2o concentrations have been reported in the bottom layers of a stratified lake as a result of denitrification sasaki et al 2011 but more frequently in close proximity to an oxycline where it may be mainly produced by nitrification beaulieu et al 2015 casciotti et al 2018 mengis et al 1997 priscu 1997 priscu et al 2008 trimmer et al 2016 yoshida et al 1989 in xxb we found pronounced vertical concentration gradients of dissolved n2o concentrations with maximal values in the bottom 5 m layer along the riverbed the strong correlations of dissolved n2o concentrations and electrical conductivity and water temperature suggest that there were two distinct water sources tgr backwater and the inflowing river with different electrical conductivity temperature temperature do nutrients and other environmental factors have been shown to influence microbial mediated n2o production beaulieu et al 2014 deemer et al 2011 schreiber et al 2012 the inflowing river had higher n2o concentrations than tgr backwater during both seasons supplement 1 and the flow path of the two water sources controlled the spatial distribution of n2o concentrations in the bay as bidirectional density the inflowing river water flowed along the bottom of xxb while the surface and middle layer of the water column in xxb were primarily affected by the tgr backwater density currents caused by differences in suspended solids salinity or temperature have been studied intensively in estuaries garcía et al 2007 wright and marineau 2019 in xxb the density currents are mainly caused by the temperature difference between the tgr backwater and the inflowing river water and generally show four distinct intrusive patterns throughout an annual cycle holbach et al 2014 ji et al 2010 yang et al 2018a our study revealed that density currents in the tributary bay had a strong effect on the distribution of dissolved n2o concentrations and atmospheric emissions the continuous increase of the tgr water level during both our sampling campaigns promoted the development of intrusive density currents from tgr in the middle and surface layer these two patterns typically persist from may to october when water level and discharge fluctuated strongly and the inflowing river with lower temperature enters along the bottom layer long et al 2019 yang et al 2018b the shorter term temporal variability of dissolved n2o concentrations observed during repeated surveys in october as well as smaller scale spatial variability of concentrations during individual surveys fig 3 might be related to hydrodynamic features bay oscillations long et al 2020 generated by rapid changes in discharge at the three gorges dam 4 2 nitrous oxide concentrations the high negative correlations between n2o concentrations and electrical conductivity and temperature indicated that the inflowing river water carried the high concentration of n2o as a density current below the tgr backwater near the riverbed the inflow mixed with n2o produced in sediments yu et al 2018 and carried the highest n2o concentrations to the yangtze river the n2o concentrations in the inflow and riverbed were approximately 14 25 nmol l in the bay which were comparable with that in agricultural headwater stream in the upper reach of yangtze river 6 29 nmol l tian et al 2019 the water column at cjxx and near surface layer of the bay was predominantly affected by the yangtze river backwater with much lower n2o concentrations 8 6 16 4 nmol l which were comparable to previous studies in tgr region 9 7 16 4 nmol l cheng et al 2019 these observations indicated a lower emission potential per unit area in the bay as compared to the river water temperature may influence n2o concentration by affecting solubility the n2o concentrations and saturations in the upper layers of the whole bay in july were higher than those in october fig 3 which might be caused by the higher temperature leading to the more n2o produced in the river upstream in july the surface water temperature in the bay mean value 28 64 c with n2o 10 9 nmol l mixed with the inflowing river water and atmospheric n2o saturated concentration of 7 4 nmol l was approximately 4 c higher compared to the reservoir cjxx 24 40 c with n2o 8 7 nmol l and atmospheric n2o saturated concentration of 8 3 nmol l the oversaturated n2o concentration of the surface water of the bay increased to 3 5 nmol l compared to 0 4 nmol l at cjxx due to the different supersaturation concentrations the solar radiation caused warming and mixing of backwater and inflowing river water in the bay leading to a 9 fold higher n2o flux for the same gas exchange velocity in most areas of xxb do was higher than 7 mg l saturation 84 which indicated an oxic environment and unfavorable conditions for of n2o consumption by denitrification beaulieu et al 2015 the only enzyme with physiological activity nitrous oxide reductase nos nosz which is able to reduce n2o is sensitive to oxygen ph and sulfide kuypers et al 2018 pauleta et al 2019 to explore the fate of n2o water samples from xx06 site were collected and stored in a laboratory incubator at in situ temperature for seven days there was no significant change in dissolved n2o concentrations during the incubation supplement 5 indicating there was no significant n2o production or consumption hence we believe the high n2o in the bottom layer would be further diluted by the oxic yangtze river water in tgr and eventually emitted to the atmosphere downstream of the tributary mouth cheng et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 4 3 nitrous oxide emission significant n2o emission and supersaturation of dissolved n2o in july and october confirmed that the tgr backwater was a source of n2o to the atmosphere as it had been reported in previous studies cheng et al 2019 zhao et al 2013 the gas flux across the air water interface depends on the gas exchange velocity k and air water concentration gradients the gas exchange velocity k is essentially controlled by turbulent mixing mainly caused by shear stresses at the streambed and wind at the water surface beaulieu et al 2012 the n2o fluxes in xxb 0 2 1 6 μmol m2 h were comparable to the global average flux from lakes and reservoirs 0 9 μmol m2 h deemer et al 2016 xie et al 2018 and much lower than fluxes from headwater and small streams 1 4 6 4 μmol m2 h for stream width smaller than 30 m beaulieu et al 2011 marzadri et al 2017 our findings support the results of marzadri et al 2017 and yao et al 2019 showing a lower emission potential of n2o produced in water column in deep water areas and higher n2o emission in headwater streams where it is mainly produced in the hyporheic zone by analyzing n2o fluxes from different reservoirs liang et al 2019 found that hydraulic load water depth water residence time was significantly negatively related to n2o emission in this study the higher n2o concentrations in the inflowing river water were covered by the tgr backwater with lower n2o concentrations in the bay the bidirectional density current can therefore be expected to reduce n2o emissions from the bay in addition the flow velocity in the bay millimeter to centimeter per second was one to two orders of magnitude lower than that of the free flowing river upstream decimeter to meter per second which led to a reduction in the gas transfer velocity in consequence the n2o emission potential was further reduced we estimated the total n2o emission from the bay as the product of the supersaturation concentrations of n2o the gas transfer velocity and water surface area the fluxes of n2o during pre dam conditions were estimated by considering the oversaturation concentrations of n2o observed in the inflow and gas exchange velocity estimated from flow velocity suggested by beaulieu et al 2012 k600 32 96v 10 59 v refers to flow velocity m s k600 was converted to k considered the inflow water temperature wanninkhof 2014 the post dam n2o flux was estimated as the average measured n2o flux the surface area of the bay was about one order of magnitude smaller before dam construction estimated using google earth historic images the results showed that even though the water surface area increased tenfold the total n2o emission from the bay was reduced by factor of 0 6 in july while it was 1 5 fold higher in october to this extent the intrusive density currents formed by tgr backwater caused a reduction of n2o emission potential per unit area from the xxb for the total n2o emission from the bay in view of the large variability observed between our two sampling campaigns year round investigation of n2o concentrations and fluxes are needed for the overall situation 5 conclusions a fast response automated gas equilibrator facilitated high resolution mapping of dissolved n2o concentrations in the tgr area and revealed the importance of bidirectional density currents in controlling near surface concentrations and atmospheric emissions nitrous oxide concentrations in the yangtze river mainstream and its tributary bay were supersaturated in respect to the atmosphere in july and october and observed concentrations were comparable to those in other reservoirs in the bay the high n2o concentrations from the inflowing river was found in a 5 m thick bottom layer along the bay while intrusive tgr backwater with lower n2o occupied the upper layer and reduced the atmospheric emission potential the n2o fluxes in the bay were comparable to those in other reservoirs and lower than in streams our observations indicated that the n2o emission potential per unit area of the bay was reduced compared to pre impoundment conditions as the depth at which the intrusive backwaters enter the bay changes seasonally year round investigation of n2o concentrations and fluxes are needed as the dam operation drives the backwater hydrological regime it could be an achievable option to reduce n2o emission from its tributaries by suitable operation of the three gorges dam declaration of competing interest we

17301,bisphenol a bpa is a common industrial chemical with significant adverse impacts on biological systems as an environmental contaminant uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 is a well established technology for bpa treatment in water while uv sodium percarbonate uv spc is an emerging technology with unclear biological impacts of treated effluent therefore in this study the toxicity evaluation of bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 and uv spc was preformed and compared based on transformation products tps profile quantitative structure activity relationship qsar escherichia coli e coli toxicity assays and metabolomic analysis tps with hydroxylation double ring split and single ring cleavage were generated from bpa during the treatments with both technologies but tps with quinonation were specifically detected in uv h2o2 treated solution at the uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 qsar prediction based on tps profile excluding benzoquinone tps suggested that uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments of bpa may increase matrix toxicity due to the formation of multi hydroxylated tps however decreased bioaccumulation potential of all tps may mitigate the increase of toxicity by reducing the chance of tps to reach the concentration of toxicity threshold in vivo assays with e coli showed inhibited cell growth arrested cell cycle and increased cell death in bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 at the uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 metabolomic analysis indicated that bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 at uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 impacted e coli metabolism differently than other solutions with unique inhibition on glycerolipid metabolism moreover bpa interfered in various metabolic pathways including alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and lysine degradation which were mitigated after the treatments uv spc showed advantage over uv h2o2 of attenuated impact on butanoate metabolism with uv irradiation this study has generated valuable data for better understanding of biological impacts of bpa and its solutions treated with uv h2o2 or uv spc thus providing insights for their application prospect for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords transformation products qsar bioassays metabolomics metabolic pathways 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is a well known member of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs which compete against endogenous estrogens for receptors resulting in endocrine disorders li et al 2015 the interactions between bpa and endocrine receptors can cause reproductive developmental hepatotoxic neurologic immunotoxic metabolic mutagenic and carcinogenic impacts on human beings and wildlife michałowicz 2014 for example meeker et al 2010 have observed a strong relation between male infertility and bpa concentrations 0 4 36 4 μg l 1 in their urine samples hassan et al 2012 have demonstrated that bpa could induce hepatic damage by reducing the expression of antioxidant gene moreover many studies have pointed out that embryos and young individuals were more susceptible to bpa exposure for instance offsprings of bpa exposed pregnant mice were born with metabolic disorders such as glucose intolerance and small insulin secretion liu et al 2013 bpa exposed 50 μg kg 1 day 1 female mice gave birth to offsprings that were more likely to be infected by influenza a virus roy et al 2012 prenatal exposure of cd 1 mice to bpa at the doses of 25 μg kg 1 day 1 and 250 μg kg 1 day 1 caused manifested early estrous cyclicity and reproductive aging in their offsprings markey et al 2003 recently medical studies have cautiously suggested that there may be a connection between bpa exposure and an increased risk of obesity diabetes and heart diseases bodin et al 2013 melzer et al 2010 trasande et al 2012 in industry bpa is an essential chemical of high production volume it is primarily used as a feedstock to produce polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins that are countlessly applied in food packaging coating and electronics staples et al 1998 comprehensive studies confirm that bpa can gradually migrate from bpa containing products to the environment in such scenario biological exposure to bpa can occur unconsciously through ingestion dust inhalation and dermal contact geens et al 2012 moreover usepa 2010 has reported that more than one million pounds of bpa every year was released into the environment through direct discharge from manufacturing facilities release during processing and handling and migration of unreacted monomer from products consequently bpa has been frequently detected in the environment aquatic system one of the largest environmental systems has seen bpa contamination primarily in effluent from wastewater treatment plants and effluent from landfill sites kang et al 2007 michałowicz 2014 fürhacker et al 2000 found that effluent from paper industry was a major industrial route of bpa contamination with concentration up to 72 μg l 1 urase and miyashita 2003 reported that the concentration of bpa ranged from 26 to 8400 μg l 1 in the leachates from several municipal landfill sites in japan therefore the biocoenosis a closely integrated community comprised of different organisms in a desiganted area in the receiving water around the discharge of the effluent is supposed to be under direct exposure however very limited ecotoxicity studies have been performed on the biological impacts and the potential hazards of discharged water on biocoenosis in the receiving aquatic environment uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are a group of technologies that have recently been applied for water and wastewater treatment of contaminants of emerging concern like bpa salimi et al 2017 uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 is a relatively established uv aop in practice however liquid h2o2 poses a safety hazard concern from fast decomposition and explosion during transportation and storage wu et al 2010 special facilities are required and associated practitioners need to be well trained before handling liquid h2o2 these requirements induce extra cost thus limiting the application of liquid h2o2 in practice recent efforts have been directed towards relieving these concerns by substituting liquid h2o2 with sodium percarbonate spc babaei and ghanbari 2016 gao et al 2020 sindelar et al 2014 spc is a solid form of h2o2 that has been widely used as a source of anhydrous h2o2 in organic synthesis once dissolved in water spc can be easily turned into mildly alkaline h2o2 moreover spc is shock inert cheap and has long storage time the price for every metric ton of h2o2 is 300 350 as spc or 1000 1200 as liquid h2o2 gao et al 2020 the liquid h2o2 can be kept for about 3 years if unopened and is good for only 1 to 6 months after opening while the shelf life of sealed spc is indefinite and unsealed spc remains stable in a dry environment according to the product specifications and practice in labs therefore spc is an ideal alternative to liquid h2o2 for practical uv aops replacement of h2o2 in uv h2o2 with spc leads to the emerging uv aop of uv spc a few studies have confirmed the effectiveness of uv spc for water and wastewater treatment babaei and ghanbari 2016 for example systematically investigated uv spc application for chemical oxygen demand removal from petrochemical wastewater sindelar et al 2014 compared uv spc with uv h2o2 and uv sodium perborate for natural organic matter removal from everglades water samples our previous work gao et al 2020 also demonstrated an efficient removal of bpa from reused water and wastewater thus uv spc is an emerging technology that is promising for water and wastewater treatment a major issue faced by uv aops is the possible generation of transformation products tps with similar or increased toxicity as compared to their parent compounds wang et al 2018 a case exemplifying this concern is the use of hydroxyl radical or uv light for removal of phenolic compounds resulting in the formation of toxic α β unsaturated enedials and oxoenals which can cause protein damage through reactions with lysine and cysteine moieties prasse et al 2018 therefore mere disappearance of the parent compound does not equate to the elimination of potential biological toxicity and ecological risk of treated water such disappearance measurement is also inadequate to evaluate the effectiveness of applied technology for water and wastewater treatment instead a comprehensive toxicity assessment of treated water is necessary to understand the actual degradation and detoxification potential of the treatment especially before the implementation of newly developed technology like uv spc by this far the generation of tps from bpa and the possible pathways of bpa degradation by uv aops have been investigated by many studies but the toxicity of treated mixture or formed tps is still unclear especially at biomolecule or metabolic levels the goal of this study was to evaluate the detoxification potential of uv spc and uv h2o2 treatments for bpa and to understand the biological impacts of their effluent on aquatic microflora in the receiving water escherichia coli e coli was chosen as the model microorganism of aquatic microflora chemical measurements in silico ecotoxicity prediction and in vivo assays were employed for this purpose to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating the toxicity reduction potential of bpa solutions treated with uv spc and its biological impactson the chosen species of microflora in water i e e coli this study generates valuable toxicologic and metabonomic data that is useful for risk assessment and management of the practice of uv

manufacturer and examined using flow cytometer beckman coulter gallios usa 2 5 software analysis in silico biological toxicity evaluation for bpa and its tps was performed with three freely available

14 1 and r studio were used to perform metabolomic analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation products profile uv activation of h2o2 and spc generates different reactive radicals different reactive radicals degrade bpa via different mechanisms to generate different tps gao et al 2020 as tps are typically the cause of resultant toxicity and different tps reflect different toxicity potentials therefore the potential toxicity of bpa solutions treated with uv spc and uv h2o2 was studied through comparative tps analysis to ensure the consistency and robust comparative tps analysis the concentration of parent compound was kept low and constant in different treatments throughout the study however this strategy may inevitably miss the detection of some of the low abundance tps as they may not reach the detection limit of the instrument employed in this case bpa and 11 tps were identified at different time intervals table 1 since chemical standards for many of the detected tps are not available commercially tps profile was discussed only based on the evolution of each tp instead of cross tps moreover most tps appeared at only one time interval in the examined range the continuously appearing tps three out of twelve i e bpa tp b and tp c either decreased or kept stable with the increase of time fig s1 which would not account for the increased toxicity or new types of toxicity as observed in this study therefore all discussion on toxicity in this article was simplified to and based on the detected categories of tps in uv spc only single hydroxylated tp b was detected at early stage d8 followed by the generation of double hydroxylated tp c single ring tp f and ring cleavage tps h i at the increased uv dose d16 the detection of only tp b in d8 demonstrates that uv spc transformation of bpa was initiated by single hydroxylation the consecutive appearance of tp b and tp c during reaction indicates that multi hydroxylation of bpa occurred in sequence the delayed occurrence of tps f h and i confirms that ring split and cleavage resulted from persistent oxidation in uv h2o2 hydroxylated tps b c and ring cleavage tps j l appeared first whereas benzoquinone tps c d and single ring tp g dominated later previously ring cleavage was thought to be realized through oxidation of catechol ring blue arrow in fig 1 dence et al 1980 gao et al 2020 rayne et al 2009 however in this study benzoquinone tps appeared after the formation of ring cleavage tps and all ring cleavage tps were carboxylic compounds this suggests that phenolic ring was more likely to cleave from resorcinol ring at its junction with alkyl chain site 1 in fig 1 red arrow among these tps the potential toxophores are phenolic ring benzoquinone ring and carboxyl group phenolic ring can bind to dna single or double strands resulting in dna damage or cleavage ahmad et al 2000 it also can cause secondary structural change in proteins konno et al 1998 and membrane damage schweigert et al 2001 in presence of peroxidase h2o2 phenolic ring can be oxidized into phenoxyl radicals elevating ros level inducing oxidative stress sakihama et al 2002 and cell apoptosis yang et al 1998 at the biological system scale estrogen receptors can accommodate a wide variety of ligands with the only requirement of the presence of phenolic ring in their structure anstead et al 1997 therefore compounds with phenolic ring are likely to have estrogen like bioactivities and potentially cause perturbation on intrinsic endocrine regulation moreover phenolic ring was reported to have binding affinity for aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr which induced the expression activity of cytochrome p450 enzymes cyps which metabolically activated pro carcinogens into carcinogens kohn et al 2001 benzoquinone ring is one of the oxidized forms of phenolic ring therefore it possesses similar biological activities as phenolic ring such as carcinogenicity ros elevation and cell apoptosis wang et al 2006 moreover many studies dwivedy et al 1992 monks and lau 1992 ross 2000 sollmann 1949 indicate that compounds with benzoquinone ring display higher toxicity than phenolic compounds for example due to the high structural similarity between benzoquinone ring and nucleobases compounds with benzoquinone ring can form dna adducts more readily to express higher genotoxicity dwivedy et al 1992 the main biological impacts of carboxyl group are acute irritation to mucous membranes and epithelium protein coagulation and narcosis jones et al 2011 leung and paustenbach 1990 organic acids can diffuse across membrane into cytoplasm to disrupt plasma ph and anion pool poole and halestrap 1993 the increased internal acidity will break integrity of purine bases choi et al 2000 and denature essential enzymes roe et al 2002 3 2 model predicted toxicity as most tps are not available for performing lab based assays qsar analysis is employed to predict the toxicity of generated tps after bpa treatments with uv h2o2 and uv spc three qsar models ecosar test and errba irfmn were employed to perform in silico toxicity analysis for the parent compound bpa and tps ecosar generated acute and chronic toxicity prediction for fish daphnid and green algae test provided prediction of bioaccumulation effect developmental toxicity mutagenicity and acute toxicity for fathead minnow daphnia magna tetrahymena pyriformis and oral rat when biological species were overlapped the value of strongest toxicity was chosen since the prediction of these models is based on the definite chemical structure of query compound the toxicity of tps with uncertain substituent positions was calculated for all the possible isomers table s2 as shown in table 2 tps with structure similar to bpa query no 2 10 in general have similar or lower values of median lethal concentration lc50 median effect concentration ec50 median inhibition growth concentration igc50 and median lethal dose ld50 when compared to bpa as the lower value indicates higher toxicity the formation of hydroxylated tps may increase the acute toxicity of treated solutions this may be because the unencumbered phenolic rings of these tps are the binding sites to nuclear receptors which regulate the biological processes like transcription and hormone secretion kester et al 2000 thus increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring increases the binding activity of these tps moreover the increase in hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring increases the solubility of tps and thus their bioavailability bhalla et al 2016 for example bhalla and coworkers observed an increased toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls after hydroxylation of phenolic ring bhalla et al 2016 however except oral rat the predicted values of single ring tps query no 16 19 and ring cleavage tps query no 20 25 were much higher than that of bpa which indicates their decreased toxicity apparently one possible reason for the decrease of toxicity could be the loss of one or both phenolic toxophores if the loss of phenolic toxophore is caused by the cleavage of phenolic ring it will downgrade functional toxicity to molecular cellular level toxicity for example after phenolic ring cleavage endocrine disruption caused by phenolic group was transformed to non specific narcosis caused by naphthenic acid moieties the latter was less fatal to higher organism frank et al 2009 for rat the toxicity of single ring tps and ring cleavage tps was increased which consists with the finding of an et al 2002 that the alkylated phenolic compounds had stronger uterotropic effect than bpa yet the molecular mechanism for such difference remains unknown in terms of benzoquinone tps there is no prediction available due to the lack of training data but as mentioned in tps profile studies have implied that the toxicity of benzoquinone compounds is orders of magnitude higher than those of phenolic compounds therefore quinonation is undesirable during bpa treatment the chronic toxicity to fish and daphnid is similar to their acute toxicity but the chronic toxicity to green algae is opposite to its acute toxicity in terms of hydroxylated tps table 3 this may be because green algae is a group of unicellular organisms which do not have biological system hierarchy the toxicity of these tps on green algae is mainly imposed as molecular level toxicity such as protein denaturation or narcosis pillinger et al 1994 system disorder has time continuity so it exhibits the same impact as acute toxicity on vital activity over longer time scale however molecular dysfunction can be recovered by repair program or molecule replenishment gibson et al 1990 some algae such as ochromonas danica can even metabolize phenolic compounds semple et al 1999 therefore the chronic toxicity of the given tps to unicellular organisms can be different from higher organisms comprehensive indices of toxicity table 4 show that bpa and tps are generally biological development toxic and estrogen receptor binding active this relates to the remaining of phenolic ring tps and benzoquinone tps see discussion in section on transformation products profile however bpa and most tps are mutagenicity negative query compound no 16 17 are mutagenic because olefinic moieties can be bioactivated into electrophilic reactive metabolites that have high affinity to proteins or dna zhang and elfarra 2017 in addition all bioaccumulation factors of tps are significantly smaller than that of bpa in this case although the generation of some tps is likely to increase certain types of toxicity the occurrence of toxic incidents can be reduced because the decreased bioaccumulation reduces the chance for these tps to reach their effective concentrations within living organisms in other words from the perspective of bioaccumulation uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments of bpa are effective in alleviating the harmful impacts of bpa on environmental organisms it is worth mentioning that query compounds 2 6 and 21 have shown reduced toxicity in most examined assays therefore if certain treatment technologies can specifically transform bpa into query compounds 2 6 or 21 the overall toxicity of bpa can be significantly relieved according to the tps profile careful control of uv dose during uv spc treatment can realize uniform transformation of bpa into query compound no 2 thus dose controlled uv spc can be useful to tackle bpa contamination in emergency conditions based on qsar analysis and tps profile d8 has the lowest toxicity where low toxic tp b is the only detected tp c16 possesses the highest toxicity due to the generation of high toxic tps hydroxylated tps and benzoquinone tps the toxicity of c8 or d16 is relatively higher than bpa due to the generation of tp c and d16 is subject to potential mutagenicity with the formation of tp f taken together such analysis theoretically predicts possible toxicity but it is inadequate to ascertain the real toxicity of treated solutions therefore cytotoxicity analysis using e coli was conducted as supplementary assays 3 3 cytotoxicity assays with e coli cytotoxicity assays including cell growth ros cell cycle and cell apoptosis were carried out to investigate the actual toxicity of bpa and its solutions treated with uv h2o2 or uv spc at uv doses of 0 mj cm 2 735 mj cm 2 and 1470 mj cm 2 e coli was chosen as the model organism for these assays for a dual rationale a it is a simple to use and effectively interpret cellular model for predicting the biological impacts on living beings particularly given the enormous database on its metabolism metabolic networks biomolecules and other cellular intracellular landscape b it is a representative species of gram negative bacteria prevalent in aquatic microflora and can model microflora ecotoxicity due to the incomplete knowledge of identities of all tps in each tested solution and the unavailability of individual tps toxicity was examined using the whole reaction mixture quenched reaction solutions were added into culture medium the observed cytotoxicity of examined mixtures was generally in consistence with the qsar predictions cell growth curves depicted in fig 2 a show that direct exposure to bpa did not cause obvious inhibition in cell proliferation although residual oxidants were experimentally proved to be appropriately quenched by the addition of na2so3 slight delay in cell growth in the presence of quenched oxidants was observed in combination with the increased expression of metabolites responsible for oxidative stress fig 4 as discussed in section on metabolites profile such delay may have been caused by residual trace amounts of oxidants that could not be detected experimentally in bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 at a uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 significant inhibition on cell growth was observed other treatments did not cause observable impact on cell growth in addition to oxidant stress this suggests that benzoquinone tps are highly cytotoxic because benzoquinone tps were uniquely accumulated at uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 during bpa treatment by uv h2o2 this is consistent with the observed proliferation inhibition activity of 1 4 benzoquinone on ahh 1 cells sun et al 2017 as read from cell growth curves active proliferation occurs around 2 5 h thus a cultivation time of 2 5 h was adopted for the following tests ros is important in cell signalling and homeostasis when exposed to detrimental environment cell produces more ros as a result of protective response however excessive ros will significantly threaten cell viability or even lead to cell death devasagayam et al 2004 when compared to control group a an increase in ros level measured in terms of mean fluorescence intensity mfi was observed in b1 fig 2b this suggests that bpa exposure can induce cell stress response however the mfi of the rest of the groups plummeted to quite a low value which is unusual because the presence of environmental oxidants such as h2o2 is expected to typically elevate ros level in cells poljšak et al 2011 sen et al 2003 since the mfi of these groups was even lower than that of control group it most probably resulted from the cell death due to prolonged oxidative stress that is the trace amount of oxidants residued in the mixture in turn caused strong cellular oxidative stress leading to cell death a similar cell behaviour was also observed in cell growth assay where normal cell growth was retarded or inhibited in these groups cell cycle perturbation as an important indicator of biological toxicity of xenobiotic compounds was carefully examined in this part of the study typically a full cell cycle progresses through four stages gap 1 g1 dna synthesis s gap 2 g2 and mitosis m if xenobiotic compounds cause dna damage cell cycle will be arrested at g1 s check point if such damage is repairable the repair and synthesis program of dna will be initiated if not damaged cell will end up with apoptosis results in fig 2c show that exposure to parent bpa and bpa tps differentially alter cell cycle progression compared to the control group b1 b2 b3 c16 and d16 showed significantly expanded proportions of cells in stage s whereas the proportions of cells in stage g2 were shrunk this means most cells in these groups encountered irreversible and irreparable damage of dna so that dna replication could not be completed successfully this also indicated genotoxicity of bpa residual oxidants phenolic olefins tp f and benzoquinones tps d e unlike the above treatment groups the cell proportions in stages s and g2 in c8 and d8 were slightly changed this suggested that dna synthesis was less interfered and repairable demonstrating a reduced genotoxicity of c8 and d8 apoptosis is a highly programmed cell death process that occurs when the cell loses its function one trigger of cell apoptosis is irreversible cell damage after exposure to adverse environment for example when irreparable dna damage occurs cell apoptosis is activated to remove disabled cell and avoid incorrect gene transcription however cell death may be caused by non apoptotic mechanisms such as necrosis and thus the proportion of apoptotic cells represents only a part of the overall cell death in the treatment for instance the proportion of apoptotic cells in groups other than a and b1 is relatively low but it does not necessarily represent the decreased toxicity of these groups because a great proportion of cells were killed due to the oxidant action of residual h2o2 or spc leaving relatively a small number of cells alive thus the cells undergoing apoptosis apoptotic cells among these live cells account for small proportion of the entire cell population examined therefore apoptotic and necrotic cells as a whole named nonviable cells in this section were used as an indicator of integrated biotoxicity of the tested solutions as shown in fig 2d the proportion of nonviable cells in b1 was larger than that in control a which confirms the cytotoxicity of bpa considerable proportion of necrotic cells was observed in b2 b3 c8 d8 c16 and d16 this confirmed that the xenobiotic oxidants introduced cell damage in addition to bpa and tps resulting in further cell deaths in the cell population moreover the proportion of nonviable cells in these groups are larger than b1 which means the combined toxicity of the treated solution due to tps and oxidants is higher than that due to the parent solution bpa alone in addition among these groups relatively small proportion of nonviable cells in d8 and large proportion of nonviable cells in c16 suggest the relatively low toxicity of d8 and high toxicity of c16 the trend of proportion of nonviable cells is basically in consistent with the cell proliferation inhibition pattern in the cell growth assay 3 4 metabolites profile metabolites are a group of small molecules generated at different stages of cell metabolism alteration of metabolites is another index that can reflect intracellular responses to the environmental stimuli and is more sensitive than phenotype as toxicity differences among the treated samples were not quite distinctively reflected from the phenotype assays cellular metabolites generated in response to different test solutions were profiled and identified using gc ms to better understand the difference in biological response to bpa solutions treated with uv h2o2 and uv spc the metabolites profile is presented as a heat map in fig s2 where a total of 63 metabolites in 48 samples were detected including sugars lipids amines amino acids nucleotides and fatty acids these metabolites are related to carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism nucleotide metabolism lipid metabolism energy metabolism gene information translation metabolism of cofactors and vitamins metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites many of them agree with the results of proteomics analysis in a previously reported study wang et al 2020 the principal component analysis pca and partial least squares regression discriminant analysis pls da were performed to study the similarities and differences of metabolites between different groups results 56 2 r2x for pca 56 1 r2x for pls da showed that a and b1 b2 and b3 and c16 have distinct characteristic information but c8 d8 and d16 would rather stay homogeneous in metabolite profile specifically based on pca analysis fig 3 a the groups could be clustered as follows c16 into phase i b2 and b3 in phase ii a and b1 into phase iii and c8 d8 and d16 into phase iv this indicates that bpa does not cause significant changes to metabolite profile but the oxidants no matter h2o2 or spc can interfere cell metabolism uv oxidant treatments of bpa especially uv h2o2 treatment of bpa for 16 min altered cell metabolism in ways divergent from bpa alone and oxidant alone in fig 3 b supervised discriminant analysis of pls da further discriminated a from b1 and b2 from b3 this demonstrates that bpa does have an impact on microbial metabolism though not significant h2o2 and spc stresses on e coli metabolism are also nuanced however pls da analysis still cannot separate c8 d8 and d16 from one another which confirms the similarity of metabolic impact of c8 d8 and d16 in addition it is worth mentioning that non degraded bpa samples b1 b2 b3 and degraded bpa samples c8 c16 d8 d16 are completely separated along x axis in both outcomes this demonstrated that regardless of the technologies employed bpa treatments significantly altered its influence on e coli metabolism and the biological activities of tps were significantly different from bpa the normalized fold changes in metabolite abundance between control and differently treated bpa solutions were presented in fig 4 direct exposure to bpa caused 2 metabolites l alanine and mannose 6 phosphate upregulated and 31 metabolites downregulated such dominant downregulation suggests that bpa exposure exerts inhibitory impact on cell metabolism in the solution with bpa and quenched h2o2 the number of upregulated metabolites was increased to 19 while the number of downregulated metabolites was decreased to 23 replacing h2o2 with spc had similar impacts on cell metabolism with 19 upregulated metabolites and 20 downregulated metabolites they were extensively fluctuated metabolites in s1 and s4 ranges which were similarly regulated in all groups involving oxidants in fig 4 this indicates that these newly fluctuated metabolites are responsible for antioxidant status of the cell considering the only difference between b1 and b2 b3 is the presence of oxidants and quencher such observation implies that oxidants may have not been fully quenched although the presence of residual oxidants has not been detected experimentally these xenobiotic oxidants may have induced active biological interactions unlike the passive responses to bpa exposure in the cells which may have initiated a series of active metabolic regulation events to tackle oxidant stimulations and bpa exposure moreover applying uv h2o2 for bpa degradation for 8 min induced upregulation of 12 metabolites and downregulation of 25 metabolites uv spc treatment of bpa for 8 min had 12 metabolites upregulated and 30 metabolites downregulated prolonged treatment of bpa resulted in 13 upregulated and 29 downregulated metabolites with uv h2o2 as against 15 upregulated and 25 downregulated metabolites with uv spc in these conditions the metabolites in s3 range which were upregulated in bpa exposure were downregulated and the metabolites in s2 range started to change this suggests that metabolites in s3 are bpa specific while metabolites in s2 related to tps stress after uv oxidant treatments n n dimethylglycine was dramatically increased such variation can help cell counteract oxidative stress and improve cell viability because n n dimethylglycine acts as a scavenger of ros by forming perhydrate crystals kapustin et al 2014 the external addition of n n dimethylglycine has been approved to improve bovine embryos development in h2o2 environment takahashi et al 2016 it agrees with the fact that uv activation of oxidants can generate stronger oxidizing agents than parent oxidants miklos et al 2018 3 5 metabolic impacts besides phenotypic end points toxic effects could be reflected on cellular metabolism metabolic pathway is the bridge linking the toxicity of tps and corresponding biological responses identifying significantly impacted metabolic pathways simp and their networking is important for better understanding how tps impact metabolism causing the resultant toxic effects the results of pathway analysis using metaboanalyst 4 0 were presented in table s3 where 4 4 3 3 5 6 and 3 metabolic pathways were significantly impacted p 0 1 impact factor 0 1 in b1 b2 b3 c8 d8 c16 and d16 respectively the interconnection among the pathways was depicted in fig 5 the metabolites discussed here were limited to differentially expressed metabolites in comparison with metabolites in designated reference groups alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and lysine degradation are top two simp in b1 i e direct exposure to bpa they are also common simp in all examined groups where bpa was present therefore aspartate and glutamate metabolism and lysine degradation are characteristic pathways of cell response to bpa exposure in aspartate and glutamate metabolism the generation of l glutamate was decreased and singh and srivastava 1982 have reported a relationship between l glutamate and inorganic nitrogen utilization via glutamate dehydrogenase the yield of l alanine an inhibitor of glutamine synthesis was significantly increased in b1 therefore bpa exposure could inhibit bio assimilation of inorganic nitrogen moreover l alanine is also a component of cell wall peptidoglycan the accumulation of l alanine after bpa exposure indicates that biosynthesis of cell wall was disrupted and cellular defense capability was reduced alterations in amino acids expression and membrane permeability have been reported during bpa degradation by bacillus thuringiensis li et al 2018 in lysine degradation the yield of glutarate and succinate were decreased signifying the inhibition of lysine degradation which could slow down cell proliferation fornazier et al 2003 moreover pentose phosphate pathway was inhibited which could reduce energy and material supply for cell anabolism kruger and von schaewen 2003 starch and sucrose metabolism were decreased suggesting carbohydrate metabolism was hindered and energy supply was reduced compared to b1 butanoate metabolism and citrate cycle tca cycle were two different simps in b2 and tca cycle was the only different simp in b3 therefore h2o2 stress on cell metabolism is mainly reflected on butanoate metabolism and tca cycle while spc only interferes tca cycle l glutamate decarboxylation along with arginine decarboxylation and glucose repression are three mechanisms to maintain cellular acid base homeostasis in e coli castanie cornet et al 1999 the increase of l glutamate in b2 could promote l glutamate decarboxylation in butanoate metabolism and thus increasing cellular resistance to acidic ph moreover citric acid chemistry is the predominant mechanism underlying biological ph yuk and marshall 2005 the increase of citrate in tca indicates the increase of cytoplasmic acidity therefore h2o2 exposure could increase cytoplasmic acidity causing cellular acid stress responses moreover butanoate metabolism and tca cycle are important pathways of cellular energy metabolism the decrease of succinate in both pathways could cause the reduction of cellular energy supply in addition the perturbation of butanoate metabolism will inevitably impact butanoate transformation guilloteau et al 2010 have reported that butanoate could arrest cell growth at the g1 stage of the cell cycle this is consistent with the observed result of increased proportion of cells at g1 stage in cell cycle assay arginine biosynthesis is the only different simp in c8 in comparison with b1 and b2 the simultaneous accumulation of l aspartate and l glutamate in this simp indicates the increased biosynthesis of arginine whose decarboxylation is the cellular response to acid environment castanie cornet et al 1999 this matches the fact that acidic tps were formed in bpa solution after uv h2o2 for 8 min moreover l aspartate and l glutamate are important nitrogen donors during synthesis of various amino acids and nucleobases reitzer 2004 arginine is a precursor of many macromolecules morris 2006 their enhancement is a sign of restored material transformations in e coli notably when comparing d8 with b3 spc impact on tca cycle was removed with uv irradiation moreover bpa impacts on pentose phosphate pathway and starch and sucrose metabolism were eliminated and no new simp was introduced it agrees with the result in transformation products profile where less toxic product of tp b was the exclusive tp in d8 this suggests that detoxification of bpa with the least biological impacts was realized by uv spc treatment of bpa for 8 min glycerolipid metabolism in c16 is the unique simp across all examined groups which is in consistent with the specialty of c16 as demonstrated in pca and pls da analysis in glycerolipid metabolism pathway glycerol and glycerate were downregulated so the production of glycerolipids is supposed to be reduced accordingly because glycerolipids are major building blocks of membranes van meer et al 2008 the reduction of glycerolipids generation renders potential of membrane damage this matches the membrane effect of benzoquinone tps joseph et al 2000 which were uniquely detected in c16 as in d16 simps in c8 and c16 started to appear suggesting that a prolonged uv spc treatment for bpa will create similar impacts on cell metabolism as uv h2o2 interestingly tca cycle impacted by spc in b3 is not impacted in d8 and d16 where uv spc was applied however butanoate metabolism impacted by h2o2 in b2 is still impacted in uv h2o2 condition i e c8 and c16 this hints that spc stress on cell metabolism could be mitigated by uv irradiation thus uv spc treatment of bpa has the advantage of small oxidative stress on cell as compared to uv h2o2 in general bpa exposure impacted alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and lysine degradation such impact has potential to frail cells with reduced nutrient utility energy supplement and protein synthesis addition of h2o2 could disrupt butanoate metabolism and citrate cycle resulting in cytosol acidity and butanoate related disorders due to the alkaline component in spc butanoate metabolism in spc was mitigated rendering it with the advantage of less disturbance of ph homeostat citrate cycle impacted by spc could be eliminated with uv irradiation uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments of bpa could restore cell rigor but treatment with large uv dose introduced the potential of membrane damage by the generation of benzoquinone tps 4 conclusions this study systemically investigated the potential toxicity changes before and after bpa treatments with uv h2o2 and uv spc profiling of tps showed that chemical transformation of bpa by both technologies went through hydroxylation double ring splitting benzene ring cleavage and quinonation which corelated with uv dose qsar analysis predicted decreased toxicity of bpa catechol increased toxicity of multi hydroxylated tps and decreased bioaccumulation of all detected tps uv spc treatment could realize the ultimate detoxification of 2 μm bpa at the uv dose of 735 mj cm 2 when bpa catechol was exclusively formed however cell growth inhibition cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis increase were observed in e coli assays with the uv h2o2 treated solution containing benzoquinone tps metabolomic analysis indicated the benzoquinone tps could uniquely impact glycerolipid metabolism therefore benzoquinone analogues are the crucial tps responsible for increased toxicity of bpa tps metabolic pathway analysis showed bpa exposure interfered with alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and lysine degradation both uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments could mitigate bpa metabolic impacts although n n dimethylglycine scavenging reaction was triggered by the addition of oxidants uv spc is superior to uv h2o2 in avoiding the perturbance in

17301,bisphenol a bpa is a common industrial chemical with significant adverse impacts on biological systems as an environmental contaminant uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 is a well established technology for bpa treatment in water while uv sodium percarbonate uv spc is an emerging technology with unclear biological impacts of treated effluent therefore in this study the toxicity evaluation of bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 and uv spc was preformed and compared based on transformation products tps profile quantitative structure activity relationship qsar escherichia coli e coli toxicity assays and metabolomic analysis tps with hydroxylation double ring split and single ring cleavage were generated from bpa during the treatments with both technologies but tps with quinonation were specifically detected in uv h2o2 treated solution at the uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 qsar prediction based on tps profile excluding benzoquinone tps suggested that uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments of bpa may increase matrix toxicity due to the formation of multi hydroxylated tps however decreased bioaccumulation potential of all tps may mitigate the increase of toxicity by reducing the chance of tps to reach the concentration of toxicity threshold in vivo assays with e coli showed inhibited cell growth arrested cell cycle and increased cell death in bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 at the uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 metabolomic analysis indicated that bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 at uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 impacted e coli metabolism differently than other solutions with unique inhibition on glycerolipid metabolism moreover bpa interfered in various metabolic pathways including alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and lysine degradation which were mitigated after the treatments uv spc showed advantage over uv h2o2 of attenuated impact on butanoate metabolism with uv irradiation this study has generated valuable data for better understanding of biological impacts of bpa and its solutions treated with uv h2o2 or uv spc thus providing insights for their application prospect for water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords transformation products qsar bioassays metabolomics metabolic pathways 1 introduction bisphenol a bpa is a well known member of endocrine disrupting chemicals edcs which compete against endogenous estrogens for receptors resulting in endocrine disorders li et al 2015 the interactions between bpa and endocrine receptors can cause reproductive developmental hepatotoxic neurologic immunotoxic metabolic mutagenic and carcinogenic impacts on human beings and wildlife michałowicz 2014 for example meeker et al 2010 have observed a strong relation between male infertility and bpa concentrations 0 4 36 4 μg l 1 in their urine samples hassan et al 2012 have demonstrated that bpa could induce hepatic damage by reducing the expression of antioxidant gene moreover many studies have pointed out that embryos and young individuals were more susceptible to bpa exposure for instance offsprings of bpa exposed pregnant mice were born with metabolic disorders such as glucose intolerance and small insulin secretion liu et al 2013 bpa exposed 50 μg kg 1 day 1 female mice gave birth to offsprings that were more likely to be infected by influenza a virus roy et al 2012 prenatal exposure of cd 1 mice to bpa at the doses of 25 μg kg 1 day 1 and 250 μg kg 1 day 1 caused manifested early estrous cyclicity and reproductive aging in their offsprings markey et al 2003 recently medical studies have cautiously suggested that there may be a connection between bpa exposure and an increased risk of obesity diabetes and heart diseases bodin et al 2013 melzer et al 2010 trasande et al 2012 in industry bpa is an essential chemical of high production volume it is primarily used as a feedstock to produce polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins that are countlessly applied in food packaging coating and electronics staples et al 1998 comprehensive studies confirm that bpa can gradually migrate from bpa containing products to the environment in such scenario biological exposure to bpa can occur unconsciously through ingestion dust inhalation and dermal contact geens et al 2012 moreover usepa 2010 has reported that more than one million pounds of bpa every year was released into the environment through direct discharge from manufacturing facilities release during processing and handling and migration of unreacted monomer from products consequently bpa has been frequently detected in the environment aquatic system one of the largest environmental systems has seen bpa contamination primarily in effluent from wastewater treatment plants and effluent from landfill sites kang et al 2007 michałowicz 2014 fürhacker et al 2000 found that effluent from paper industry was a major industrial route of bpa contamination with concentration up to 72 μg l 1 urase and miyashita 2003 reported that the concentration of bpa ranged from 26 to 8400 μg l 1 in the leachates from several municipal landfill sites in japan therefore the biocoenosis a closely integrated community comprised of different organisms in a desiganted area in the receiving water around the discharge of the effluent is supposed to be under direct exposure however very limited ecotoxicity studies have been performed on the biological impacts and the potential hazards of discharged water on biocoenosis in the receiving aquatic environment uv based advanced oxidation processes uv aops are a group of technologies that have recently been applied for water and wastewater treatment of contaminants of emerging concern like bpa salimi et al 2017 uv hydrogen peroxide uv h2o2 is a relatively established uv aop in practice however liquid h2o2 poses a safety hazard concern from fast decomposition and explosion during transportation and storage wu et al 2010 special facilities are required and associated practitioners need to be well trained before handling liquid h2o2 these requirements induce extra cost thus limiting the application of liquid h2o2 in practice recent efforts have been directed towards relieving these concerns by substituting liquid h2o2 with sodium percarbonate spc babaei and ghanbari 2016 gao et al 2020 sindelar et al 2014 spc is a solid form of h2o2 that has been widely used as a source of anhydrous h2o2 in organic synthesis once dissolved in water spc can be easily turned into mildly alkaline h2o2 moreover spc is shock inert cheap and has long storage time the price for every metric ton of h2o2 is 300 350 as spc or 1000 1200 as liquid h2o2 gao et al 2020 the liquid h2o2 can be kept for about 3 years if unopened and is good for only 1 to 6 months after opening while the shelf life of sealed spc is indefinite and unsealed spc remains stable in a dry environment according to the product specifications and practice in labs therefore spc is an ideal alternative to liquid h2o2 for practical uv aops replacement of h2o2 in uv h2o2 with spc leads to the emerging uv aop of uv spc a few studies have confirmed the effectiveness of uv spc for water and wastewater treatment babaei and ghanbari 2016 for example systematically investigated uv spc application for chemical oxygen demand removal from petrochemical wastewater sindelar et al 2014 compared uv spc with uv h2o2 and uv sodium perborate for natural organic matter removal from everglades water samples our previous work gao et al 2020 also demonstrated an efficient removal of bpa from reused water and wastewater thus uv spc is an emerging technology that is promising for water and wastewater treatment a major issue faced by uv aops is the possible generation of transformation products tps with similar or increased toxicity as compared to their parent compounds wang et al 2018 a case exemplifying this concern is the use of hydroxyl radical or uv light for removal of phenolic compounds resulting in the formation of toxic α β unsaturated enedials and oxoenals which can cause protein damage through reactions with lysine and cysteine moieties prasse et al 2018 therefore mere disappearance of the parent compound does not equate to the elimination of potential biological toxicity and ecological risk of treated water such disappearance measurement is also inadequate to evaluate the effectiveness of applied technology for water and wastewater treatment instead a comprehensive toxicity assessment of treated water is necessary to understand the actual degradation and detoxification potential of the treatment especially before the implementation of newly developed technology like uv spc by this far the generation of tps from bpa and the possible pathways of bpa degradation by uv aops have been investigated by many studies but the toxicity of treated mixture or formed tps is still unclear especially at biomolecule or metabolic levels the goal of this study was to evaluate the detoxification potential of uv spc and uv h2o2 treatments for bpa and to understand the biological impacts of their effluent on aquatic microflora in the receiving water escherichia coli e coli was chosen as the model microorganism of aquatic microflora chemical measurements in silico ecotoxicity prediction and in vivo assays were employed for this purpose to the best of our knowledge this is the first study investigating the toxicity reduction potential of bpa solutions treated with uv spc and its biological impactson the chosen species of microflora in water i e e coli this study generates valuable toxicologic and metabonomic data that is useful for risk assessment and management of the practice of uv spc the results of this study also provide meaningful insights for the application of uv spc for water and wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 material chemicals used in the degradation

14 1 and r studio were used to perform metabolomic analysis 3 results and discussion 3 1 transformation products profile uv activation of h2o2 and spc generates different reactive radicals different reactive radicals degrade bpa via different mechanisms to generate different tps gao et al 2020 as tps are typically the cause of resultant toxicity and different tps reflect different toxicity potentials therefore the potential toxicity of bpa solutions treated with uv spc and uv h2o2 was studied through comparative tps analysis to ensure the consistency and robust comparative tps analysis the concentration of parent compound was kept low and constant in different treatments throughout the study however this strategy may inevitably miss the detection of some of the low abundance tps as they may not reach the detection limit of the instrument employed in this case bpa and 11 tps were identified at different time intervals table 1 since chemical standards for many of the detected tps are not available commercially tps profile was discussed only based on the evolution of each tp instead of cross tps moreover most tps appeared at only one time interval in the examined range the continuously appearing tps three out of twelve i e bpa tp b and tp c either decreased or kept stable with the increase of time fig s1 which would not account for the increased toxicity or new types of toxicity as observed in this study therefore all discussion on toxicity in this article was simplified to and based on the detected categories of tps in uv spc only single hydroxylated tp b was detected at early stage d8 followed by the generation of double hydroxylated tp c single ring tp f and ring cleavage tps h i at the increased uv dose d16 the detection of only tp b in d8 demonstrates that uv spc transformation of bpa was initiated by single hydroxylation the consecutive appearance of tp b and tp c during reaction indicates that multi hydroxylation of bpa occurred in sequence the delayed occurrence of tps f h and i confirms that ring split and cleavage resulted from persistent oxidation in uv h2o2 hydroxylated tps b c and ring cleavage tps j l appeared first whereas benzoquinone tps c d and single ring tp g dominated later previously ring cleavage was thought to be realized through oxidation of catechol ring blue arrow in fig 1 dence et al 1980 gao et al 2020 rayne et al 2009 however in this study benzoquinone tps appeared after the formation of ring cleavage tps and all ring cleavage tps were carboxylic compounds this suggests that phenolic ring was more likely to cleave from resorcinol ring at its junction with alkyl chain site 1 in fig 1 red arrow among these tps the potential toxophores are phenolic ring benzoquinone ring and carboxyl group phenolic ring can bind to dna single or double strands resulting in dna damage or cleavage ahmad et al 2000 it also can cause secondary structural change in proteins konno et al 1998 and membrane damage schweigert et al 2001 in presence of peroxidase h2o2 phenolic ring can be oxidized into phenoxyl radicals elevating ros level inducing oxidative stress sakihama et al 2002 and cell apoptosis yang et al 1998 at the biological system scale estrogen receptors can accommodate a wide variety of ligands with the only requirement of the presence of phenolic ring in their structure anstead et al 1997 therefore compounds with phenolic ring are likely to have estrogen like bioactivities and potentially cause perturbation on intrinsic endocrine regulation moreover phenolic ring was reported to have binding affinity for aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr which induced the expression activity of cytochrome p450 enzymes cyps which metabolically activated pro carcinogens into carcinogens kohn et al 2001 benzoquinone ring is one of the oxidized forms of phenolic ring therefore it possesses similar biological activities as phenolic ring such as carcinogenicity ros elevation and cell apoptosis wang et al 2006 moreover many studies dwivedy et al 1992 monks and lau 1992 ross 2000 sollmann 1949 indicate that compounds with benzoquinone ring display higher toxicity than phenolic compounds for example due to the high structural similarity between benzoquinone ring and nucleobases compounds with benzoquinone ring can form dna adducts more readily to express higher genotoxicity dwivedy et al 1992 the main biological impacts of carboxyl group are acute irritation to mucous membranes and epithelium protein coagulation and narcosis jones et al 2011 leung and paustenbach 1990 organic acids can diffuse across membrane into cytoplasm to disrupt plasma ph and anion pool poole and halestrap 1993 the increased internal acidity will break integrity of purine bases choi et al 2000 and denature essential enzymes roe et al 2002 3 2 model predicted toxicity as most tps are not available for performing lab based assays qsar analysis is employed to predict the toxicity of generated tps after bpa treatments with uv h2o2 and uv spc three qsar models ecosar test and errba irfmn were employed to perform in silico toxicity analysis for the parent compound bpa and tps ecosar generated acute and chronic toxicity prediction for fish daphnid and green algae test provided prediction of bioaccumulation effect developmental toxicity mutagenicity and acute toxicity for fathead minnow daphnia magna tetrahymena pyriformis and oral rat when biological species were overlapped the value of strongest toxicity was chosen since the prediction of these models is based on the definite chemical structure of query compound the toxicity of tps with uncertain substituent positions was calculated for all the possible isomers table s2 as shown in table 2 tps with structure similar to bpa query no 2 10 in general have similar or lower values of median lethal concentration lc50 median effect concentration ec50 median inhibition growth concentration igc50 and median lethal dose ld50 when compared to bpa as the lower value indicates higher toxicity the formation of hydroxylated tps may increase the acute toxicity of treated solutions this may be because the unencumbered phenolic rings of these tps are the binding sites to nuclear receptors which regulate the biological processes like transcription and hormone secretion kester et al 2000 thus increase in the number of hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring increases the binding activity of these tps moreover the increase in hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring increases the solubility of tps and thus their bioavailability bhalla et al 2016 for example bhalla and coworkers observed an increased toxicity of polychlorinated biphenyls after hydroxylation of phenolic ring bhalla et al 2016 however except oral rat the predicted values of single ring tps query no 16 19 and ring cleavage tps query no 20 25 were much higher than that of bpa which indicates their decreased toxicity apparently one possible reason for the decrease of toxicity could be the loss of one or both phenolic toxophores if the loss of phenolic toxophore is caused by the cleavage of phenolic ring it will downgrade functional toxicity to molecular cellular level toxicity for example after phenolic ring cleavage endocrine disruption caused by phenolic group was transformed to non specific narcosis caused by naphthenic acid moieties the latter was less fatal to higher organism frank et al 2009 for rat the toxicity of single ring tps and ring cleavage tps was increased which consists with the finding of an et al 2002 that the alkylated phenolic compounds had stronger uterotropic effect than bpa yet the molecular mechanism for such difference remains unknown in terms of benzoquinone tps there is no prediction available due to the lack of training data but as mentioned in tps profile studies have implied that the toxicity of benzoquinone compounds is orders of magnitude higher than those of phenolic compounds therefore quinonation is undesirable during bpa treatment the chronic toxicity to fish and daphnid is similar to their acute toxicity but the chronic toxicity to green algae is opposite to its acute toxicity in terms of hydroxylated tps table 3 this may be because green algae is a group of unicellular organisms which do not have biological system hierarchy the toxicity of these tps on green algae is mainly imposed as molecular level toxicity such as protein denaturation or narcosis pillinger et al 1994 system disorder has time continuity so it exhibits the same impact as acute toxicity on vital activity over longer time scale however molecular dysfunction can be recovered by repair program or molecule replenishment gibson et al 1990 some algae such as ochromonas danica can even metabolize phenolic compounds semple et al 1999 therefore the chronic toxicity of the given tps to unicellular organisms can be different from higher organisms comprehensive indices of toxicity table 4 show that bpa and tps are generally biological development toxic and estrogen receptor binding active this relates to the remaining of phenolic ring tps and benzoquinone tps see discussion in section on transformation products profile however bpa and most tps are mutagenicity negative query compound no 16 17 are mutagenic because olefinic moieties can be bioactivated into electrophilic reactive metabolites that have high affinity to proteins or dna zhang and elfarra 2017 in addition all bioaccumulation factors of tps are significantly smaller than that of bpa in this case although the generation of some tps is likely to increase certain types of toxicity the occurrence of toxic incidents can be reduced because the decreased bioaccumulation reduces the chance for these tps to reach their effective concentrations within living organisms in other words from the perspective of bioaccumulation uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments of bpa are effective in alleviating the harmful impacts of bpa on environmental organisms it is worth mentioning that query compounds 2 6 and 21 have shown reduced toxicity in most examined assays therefore if certain treatment technologies can specifically transform bpa into query compounds 2 6 or 21 the overall toxicity of bpa can be significantly relieved according to the tps profile careful control of uv dose during uv spc treatment can realize uniform transformation of bpa into query compound no 2 thus dose controlled uv spc can be useful to tackle bpa contamination in emergency conditions based on qsar analysis and tps profile d8 has the lowest toxicity where low toxic tp b is the only detected tp c16 possesses the highest toxicity due to the generation of high toxic tps hydroxylated tps and benzoquinone tps the toxicity of c8 or d16 is relatively higher than bpa due to the generation of tp c and d16 is subject to potential mutagenicity with the formation of tp f taken together such analysis theoretically predicts possible toxicity but it is inadequate to ascertain the real toxicity of treated solutions therefore cytotoxicity analysis using e coli was conducted as supplementary assays 3 3 cytotoxicity assays with e coli cytotoxicity assays including cell growth ros cell cycle and cell apoptosis were carried out to investigate the actual toxicity of bpa and its solutions treated with uv h2o2 or uv spc at uv doses of 0 mj cm 2 735 mj cm 2 and 1470 mj cm 2 e coli was chosen as the model organism for these assays for a dual rationale a it is a simple to use and effectively interpret cellular model for predicting the biological impacts on living beings particularly given the enormous database on its metabolism metabolic networks biomolecules and other cellular intracellular landscape b it is a representative species of gram negative bacteria prevalent in aquatic microflora and can model microflora ecotoxicity due to the incomplete knowledge of identities of all tps in each tested solution and the unavailability of individual tps toxicity was examined using the whole reaction mixture quenched reaction solutions were added into culture medium the observed cytotoxicity of examined mixtures was generally in consistence with the qsar predictions cell growth curves depicted in fig 2 a show that direct exposure to bpa did not cause obvious inhibition in cell proliferation although residual oxidants were experimentally proved to be appropriately quenched by the addition of na2so3 slight delay in cell growth in the presence of quenched oxidants was observed in combination with the increased expression of metabolites responsible for oxidative stress fig 4 as discussed in section on metabolites profile such delay may have been caused by residual trace amounts of oxidants that could not be detected experimentally in bpa solution treated with uv h2o2 at a uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 significant inhibition on cell growth was observed other treatments did not cause observable impact on cell growth in addition to oxidant stress this suggests that benzoquinone tps are highly cytotoxic because benzoquinone tps were uniquely accumulated at uv dose of 1470 mj cm 2 during bpa treatment by uv h2o2 this is consistent with the observed proliferation inhibition activity of 1 4 benzoquinone on ahh 1 cells sun et al 2017 as read from cell growth curves active proliferation occurs around 2 5 h thus a cultivation time of 2 5 h was adopted for the following tests ros is important in cell signalling and homeostasis when exposed to detrimental environment cell produces more ros as a result of protective response however excessive ros will significantly threaten cell viability or even lead to cell death devasagayam et al 2004 when compared to control group a an increase in ros level measured in terms of mean fluorescence intensity mfi was observed in b1 fig 2b this suggests that bpa exposure can induce cell stress response however the mfi of the rest of the groups plummeted to quite a low value which is unusual because the presence of environmental oxidants such as h2o2 is expected to typically elevate ros level in cells poljšak et al 2011 sen et al 2003 since the mfi of these groups was even lower than that of control group it most probably resulted from the cell death due to prolonged oxidative stress that is the trace amount of oxidants residued in the mixture in turn caused strong cellular oxidative stress leading to cell death a similar cell behaviour was also observed in cell growth assay where normal cell growth was retarded or inhibited in these groups cell cycle perturbation as an important indicator of biological toxicity of xenobiotic compounds was carefully examined in this part of the study typically a full cell cycle progresses through four stages gap 1 g1 dna synthesis s gap 2 g2 and mitosis m if xenobiotic compounds cause dna damage cell cycle will be arrested at g1 s check point if such damage is repairable the repair and synthesis program of dna will be initiated if not damaged cell will end up with apoptosis results in fig 2c show that exposure to parent bpa and bpa tps differentially alter cell cycle progression compared to the control group b1 b2 b3 c16 and d16 showed significantly expanded proportions of cells in stage s whereas the proportions of cells in stage g2 were shrunk this means most cells in these groups encountered irreversible and irreparable damage of dna so that dna replication could not be completed successfully this also indicated genotoxicity of bpa residual oxidants phenolic olefins tp f and benzoquinones tps d e unlike the above treatment groups the cell proportions in stages s and g2 in c8 and d8 were slightly changed this suggested that dna synthesis was less interfered and repairable demonstrating a reduced genotoxicity of c8 and d8 apoptosis is a highly programmed cell death process that occurs when the cell loses its function one trigger of cell apoptosis is irreversible cell damage after exposure to adverse environment for example when irreparable dna damage occurs cell apoptosis is activated to remove disabled cell and avoid incorrect gene transcription however cell death may be caused by non apoptotic mechanisms such as necrosis and thus the proportion of apoptotic cells represents only a part of the overall cell death in the treatment for instance the proportion of apoptotic cells in groups other than a and b1 is relatively low but it does not necessarily represent the decreased toxicity of these groups because a great proportion of cells were killed due to the oxidant action of residual h2o2 or spc leaving relatively a small number of cells alive thus the cells undergoing apoptosis apoptotic cells among these live cells account for small proportion of the entire cell population examined therefore apoptotic and necrotic cells as a whole named nonviable cells in this section were used as an indicator of integrated biotoxicity of the tested solutions as shown in fig 2d the proportion of nonviable cells in b1 was larger than that in control a which confirms the cytotoxicity of bpa considerable proportion of necrotic cells was observed in b2 b3 c8 d8 c16 and d16 this confirmed that the xenobiotic oxidants introduced cell damage in addition to bpa and tps resulting in further cell deaths in the cell population moreover the proportion of nonviable cells in these groups are larger than b1 which means the combined toxicity of the treated solution due to tps and oxidants is higher than that due to the parent solution bpa alone in addition among these groups relatively small proportion of nonviable cells in d8 and large proportion of nonviable cells in c16 suggest the relatively low toxicity of d8 and high toxicity of c16 the trend of proportion of nonviable cells is basically in consistent with the cell proliferation inhibition pattern in the cell growth assay 3 4 metabolites profile metabolites are a group of small molecules generated at different stages of cell metabolism alteration of metabolites is another index that can reflect intracellular responses to the environmental stimuli and is more sensitive than phenotype as toxicity differences among the treated samples were not quite distinctively reflected from the phenotype assays cellular metabolites generated in response to different test solutions were profiled and identified using gc ms to better understand the difference in biological response to bpa solutions treated with uv h2o2 and uv spc the metabolites profile is presented as a heat map in fig s2 where a total of 63 metabolites in 48 samples were detected including sugars lipids amines amino acids nucleotides and fatty acids these metabolites are related to carbohydrate metabolism amino acid metabolism nucleotide metabolism lipid metabolism energy metabolism gene information translation metabolism of cofactors and vitamins metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites many of them agree with the results of proteomics analysis in a previously reported study wang et al 2020 the principal component analysis pca and partial least squares regression discriminant analysis pls da were performed to study the similarities and differences of metabolites between different groups results 56 2 r2x for pca 56 1 r2x for pls da showed that a and b1 b2 and b3 and c16 have distinct characteristic information but c8 d8 and d16 would rather stay homogeneous in metabolite profile specifically based on pca analysis fig 3 a the groups could be clustered as follows c16 into phase i b2 and b3 in phase ii a and b1 into phase iii and c8 d8 and d16 into phase iv this indicates that bpa does not cause significant changes to metabolite profile but the oxidants no matter h2o2 or spc can interfere cell metabolism uv oxidant treatments of bpa especially uv h2o2 treatment of bpa for 16 min altered cell metabolism in ways divergent from bpa alone and oxidant alone in fig 3 b supervised discriminant analysis of pls da further discriminated a from b1 and b2 from b3 this demonstrates that bpa does have an impact on microbial metabolism though not significant h2o2 and spc stresses on e coli metabolism are also nuanced however pls da analysis still cannot separate c8 d8 and d16 from one another which confirms the similarity of metabolic impact of c8 d8 and d16 in addition it is worth mentioning that non degraded bpa samples b1 b2 b3 and degraded bpa samples c8 c16 d8 d16 are completely separated along x axis in both outcomes this demonstrated that regardless of the technologies employed bpa treatments significantly altered its influence on e coli metabolism and the biological activities of tps were significantly different from bpa the normalized fold changes in metabolite abundance between control and differently treated bpa solutions were presented in fig 4 direct exposure to bpa caused 2 metabolites l alanine and mannose 6 phosphate upregulated and 31 metabolites downregulated such dominant downregulation suggests that bpa exposure exerts inhibitory impact on cell metabolism in the solution with bpa and quenched h2o2 the number of upregulated metabolites was increased to 19 while the number of downregulated metabolites was decreased to 23 replacing h2o2 with spc had similar impacts on cell metabolism with 19 upregulated metabolites and 20 downregulated metabolites they were extensively fluctuated metabolites in s1 and s4 ranges which were similarly regulated in all groups involving oxidants in fig 4 this indicates that these newly fluctuated metabolites are responsible for antioxidant status of the cell considering the only difference between b1 and b2 b3 is the presence of oxidants and quencher such observation implies that oxidants may have not been fully quenched although the presence of residual oxidants has not been detected experimentally these xenobiotic oxidants may have induced active biological interactions unlike the passive responses to bpa exposure in the cells which may have initiated a series of active metabolic regulation events to tackle oxidant stimulations and bpa exposure moreover applying uv h2o2 for bpa degradation for 8 min induced upregulation of 12 metabolites and downregulation of 25 metabolites uv spc treatment of bpa for 8 min had 12 metabolites upregulated and 30 metabolites downregulated prolonged treatment of bpa resulted in 13 upregulated and 29 downregulated metabolites with uv h2o2 as against 15 upregulated and 25 downregulated metabolites with uv spc in these conditions the metabolites in s3 range which were upregulated in bpa exposure were downregulated and the metabolites in s2 range started to change this suggests that metabolites in s3 are bpa specific while metabolites in s2 related to tps stress after uv oxidant treatments n n dimethylglycine was dramatically increased such variation can help cell counteract oxidative stress and improve cell viability because n n dimethylglycine acts as a scavenger of ros by forming perhydrate crystals kapustin et al 2014 the external addition of n n dimethylglycine has been approved to improve bovine embryos development in h2o2 environment takahashi et al 2016 it agrees with the fact that uv activation of oxidants can generate stronger oxidizing agents than parent oxidants miklos et al 2018 3 5 metabolic impacts besides phenotypic end points toxic effects could be reflected on cellular metabolism metabolic pathway is the bridge linking the toxicity of tps and corresponding biological responses identifying significantly impacted metabolic pathways simp and their networking is important for better understanding how tps impact metabolism causing the resultant toxic effects the results of pathway analysis using metaboanalyst 4 0 were presented in table s3 where 4 4 3 3 5 6 and 3 metabolic pathways were significantly impacted p 0 1 impact factor 0 1 in b1 b2 b3 c8 d8 c16 and d16 respectively the interconnection among the pathways was depicted in fig 5 the metabolites discussed here were limited to differentially expressed metabolites in comparison with metabolites in designated reference groups alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism and lysine degradation are top two simp in b1 i e direct exposure to bpa they are also common simp in all examined groups where bpa was present therefore aspartate and glutamate metabolism and lysine degradation are characteristic pathways of cell response to bpa exposure in aspartate and glutamate metabolism the generation of l glutamate was decreased and singh and srivastava 1982 have reported a relationship between l glutamate and inorganic nitrogen utilization via glutamate dehydrogenase the yield of l alanine an inhibitor of glutamine synthesis was significantly increased in b1 therefore bpa exposure could inhibit bio assimilation of inorganic nitrogen moreover l alanine is also a component of cell wall peptidoglycan the accumulation of l alanine after bpa exposure indicates that biosynthesis of cell wall was disrupted and cellular defense capability was reduced alterations in amino acids expression and membrane permeability have been reported during bpa degradation by bacillus thuringiensis li et al 2018 in lysine degradation the yield of glutarate and succinate were decreased signifying the inhibition of lysine degradation which could slow down cell proliferation fornazier et al 2003 moreover pentose phosphate pathway was inhibited which could reduce energy and material supply for cell anabolism kruger and von schaewen 2003 starch and sucrose metabolism were decreased suggesting carbohydrate metabolism was hindered and energy supply was reduced compared to b1 butanoate metabolism and citrate cycle tca cycle were two different simps in b2 and tca cycle was the only different simp in b3 therefore h2o2 stress on cell metabolism is mainly reflected on butanoate metabolism and tca cycle while spc only interferes tca cycle l glutamate decarboxylation along with arginine decarboxylation and glucose repression are three mechanisms to maintain cellular acid base homeostasis in e coli castanie cornet et al 1999 the increase of l glutamate in b2 could promote l glutamate decarboxylation in butanoate metabolism and thus increasing cellular resistance to acidic ph moreover citric acid chemistry is the predominant mechanism underlying biological ph yuk and marshall 2005 the increase of citrate in tca indicates the increase of cytoplasmic acidity therefore h2o2 exposure could increase cytoplasmic acidity causing cellular acid stress responses moreover butanoate metabolism and tca cycle are important pathways of cellular energy metabolism the decrease of succinate in both pathways could cause the reduction of cellular energy supply in addition the perturbation of butanoate metabolism will inevitably impact butanoate transformation guilloteau et al 2010 have reported that butanoate could arrest cell growth at the g1 stage of the cell cycle this is consistent with the observed result of increased proportion of cells at g1 stage in cell cycle assay arginine biosynthesis is the only different simp in c8 in comparison with b1 and b2 the simultaneous accumulation of l aspartate and l glutamate in this simp indicates the increased biosynthesis of arginine whose decarboxylation is the cellular response to acid environment castanie cornet et al 1999 this matches the fact that acidic tps were formed in bpa solution after uv h2o2 for 8 min moreover l aspartate and l glutamate are important nitrogen donors during synthesis of various amino acids and nucleobases reitzer 2004 arginine is a precursor of many macromolecules morris 2006 their enhancement is a sign of restored material transformations in e coli notably when comparing d8 with b3 spc impact on tca cycle was removed with uv irradiation moreover bpa impacts on pentose phosphate pathway and starch and sucrose metabolism were eliminated and no new simp was introduced it agrees with the result in transformation products profile where less toxic product of tp b was the exclusive tp in d8 this suggests that detoxification of bpa with the least biological impacts was realized by uv spc treatment of bpa for 8 min glycerolipid metabolism in c16 is the unique simp across all examined groups which is in consistent with the specialty of c16 as demonstrated in pca and pls da analysis in glycerolipid metabolism pathway glycerol and glycerate were downregulated so the production of glycerolipids is supposed to be reduced accordingly because glycerolipids are major building blocks of membranes van meer et al 2008 the reduction of glycerolipids generation renders potential of membrane damage this matches the membrane effect of benzoquinone tps joseph et al 2000 which were uniquely detected in c16 as in d16 simps in c8 and c16 started to appear suggesting that a prolonged uv spc treatment for bpa will create similar impacts on cell metabolism as uv h2o2 interestingly tca cycle impacted by spc in b3 is not impacted in d8 and d16 where uv spc was applied however butanoate metabolism impacted by h2o2 in b2 is still impacted in uv h2o2 condition i e c8 and c16 this hints that spc stress on cell metabolism could be mitigated by uv irradiation thus uv spc treatment of bpa has the advantage of small oxidative stress on cell as compared to uv h2o2 in general bpa exposure impacted alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and lysine degradation such impact has potential to frail cells with reduced nutrient utility energy supplement and protein synthesis addition of h2o2 could disrupt butanoate metabolism and citrate cycle resulting in cytosol acidity and butanoate related disorders due to the alkaline component in spc butanoate metabolism in spc was mitigated rendering it with the advantage of less disturbance of ph homeostat citrate cycle impacted by spc could be eliminated with uv irradiation uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments of bpa could restore cell rigor but treatment with large uv dose introduced the potential of membrane damage by the generation of benzoquinone tps 4 conclusions this study systemically investigated the potential toxicity changes before and after bpa treatments with uv h2o2 and uv spc profiling of tps showed that chemical transformation of bpa by both technologies went through hydroxylation double ring splitting benzene ring cleavage and quinonation which corelated with uv dose qsar analysis predicted decreased toxicity of bpa catechol increased toxicity of multi hydroxylated tps and decreased bioaccumulation of all detected tps uv spc treatment could realize the ultimate detoxification of 2 μm bpa at the uv dose of 735 mj cm 2 when bpa catechol was exclusively formed however cell growth inhibition cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis increase were observed in e coli assays with the uv h2o2 treated solution containing benzoquinone tps metabolomic analysis indicated the benzoquinone tps could uniquely impact glycerolipid metabolism therefore benzoquinone analogues are the crucial tps responsible for increased toxicity of bpa tps metabolic pathway analysis showed bpa exposure interfered with alanine aspartate and glutamate metabolism starch and sucrose metabolism pentose phosphate pathway and lysine degradation both uv h2o2 and uv spc treatments could mitigate bpa metabolic impacts although n n dimethylglycine scavenging reaction was triggered by the addition of oxidants uv spc is superior to uv h2o2 in avoiding the perturbance in butanoate metabolism and citrate cycle declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

17302,the occurrence and removal patterns of 24 antimicrobial agents and antimicrobial resistant determinants namely 6 antibiotic resistance genes args and 2 mobile genetic elements mges and the fecal indicator e coli were investigated in three full scale wastewater treatment plants their waterlines and biosolids lines including secondary treatment based on both granular and activated sludge were sampled monthly throughout one year samples were analyzed by means of lc ms ms qpcr and cell enumeration respectively the influence of rainfall temperature and turbidity on the occurrence and removal of the aforementioned agents was assessed through statistical linear mixed models ten of the antimicrobial agents macrolides fluoroquinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides were commonly found in influent in concentrations of 0 1 2 µg l 1 and the predominant args were ermb and sul1 6 4 and 5 9 log10 ml 1 respectively warmer temperatures slightly reduced gene concentrations in influent whilst increasing that of e coli and produced an uneven effect on the antimicrobial concentrations across plants rainfall diluted both e coli 0 25 logs p 0 001 and antimicrobials but not genes the wastewater treatment reduced the absolute abundance of both genes 1 86 logs on average and e coli 2 31 logs on average the antimicrobials agents were also partly removed but 8 of them were still detectable after treatment and 6 accumulated in the biosolids args were also found in biosolids with patterns resembling those of influent no significant differences in the removal of antimicrobials genes and e coli were observed when comparing conventional activated sludge with aerobic granular sludge irrespective of the type of sludge treatment the removal of genes was significantly reduced with increasing hydraulic loads caused by rainfall 0 35 logs per average daily flow p 0 01 and slightly decreased with increasing turbidity 0 02 logs per 1 nephelometric turbidy unit p 0 05 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wwtp args antibiotics granular sludge rainfall temperature 1 introduction the occurrence of anthropogenic antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment seems to be strongly related to fecal pollution karkman et al 2019 human fecal bacteria are transported through sewage networks and wastewater treatment plants wwtps to the environment wwtps primarily designed for nutrient removal have therefore been hypothesized as key vectors in the environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013 the fate of args in wwtps has been assessed in recent years providing a wide range of results in some cases wwtps reduced the absolute concentration of args di cesare et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 while in others the relative and even absolute abundances of args increased after treatment rafraf et al 2016 there is a growing interest in determining which technologies or operational conditions achieve greater args removal however due to the wide diversity of treatment processes it is difficult to obtain general results that are applicable across the variety of wwtp systems and arg types korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 novo and manaia 2010 previously broad sampling efforts to analyze the influent and effluent of more than 60 wwtps in the netherlands helped to determine that the removal of args was significantly smaller when the baseline hydraulic load of the wwtps increased because of rainfall events pallares vega et al 2019 yet even under dry weather conditions process design and operational parameters did not explain the remaining variability this suggests that other factors contributed to the detected differences one factor that may impact the occurrence and removal of args is the presence of antimicrobial and disinfectant residues these compounds are collected in the wastewater along with the feces and might accumulate in the sewage sludge gao et al 2012 göbel et al 2005 antimicrobial and disinfectant residues may enhance the co selection of resistance genes and promote horizontal gene transfer even at subtherapeutic concentrations gullberg et al 2014 in addition fluctuations in other abiotic factors such as temperature might also influence the occurrence and removal of args higher antimicrobial consumption in colder seasons coutu et al 2013 marx et al 2015 might increase the discharge of resistant bacteria and their args into the sewer in addition cold temperatures reduce the efficiency of water treatment johnston et al 2019 and might also reduce the ability to remove args literature addressing the effect of temperature on the occurrence and fate of args during wastewater treatment is however scarce a few studies have focused on quantifying the seasonal variation of args in influent and their removal caucci et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 moreover temperature or seasonality have seldom been addressed in combination with rainfall or flow schages et al 2020 thus there is a need for a comprehensive approach studying the combined effect of these variables on arg patterns furthermore biotic factors such as the accumulation of args in the natural microbiome of the biological treatment deserve attention in the biological treatment the microbial community which converts wastewater compounds is aggregated into flocs activated sludge biofilms or granular sludge such bioaggregates might provide a suitable environment for cell to cell interactions and genetic exchange of mobile genetic elements mge containing args manaia et al 2018 potentially increasing the so called resistome of the sludge diverse sludge types flocculent granules might accumulate args differently derived from their characteristic physical structure and microbial community ultimately the intrinsic sludge resistome may counterbalance a further elimination of args during the wastewater treatment the accumulation of args in the biosolids is also of concern given that sludge is often processed and applied as a fertilizer due to its high content of organic nutrients and phosphorus as such this practice comprises another possible route for the spread of anthropogenic args to the environment rahube et al 2014 generally studies covering the effect of a broad number of variables on args are restricted to few time point measurements although cross sectional studies provide relevant information it is necessary to investigate whether measurements at single time points are valid throughout extended periods such information is needed to determine suitable sampling strategies to answer specific research questions hence the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence and fate of args mges and viable fecal bacteria over one year of operation at three different full scale municipal wwtps located in the netherlands these treatment plants performed biological nutrient removal with three systems based on activated sludge and one system based on aerobic granular sludge besides gene determinants we investigated the presence of selective agents as antimicrobial compounds and disinfectants in both the water and biosolids line analyses were aimed at determining the role of abiotic parameters such as the hydraulic load factor seasonal temperature and the effluent turbidity as a surrogate for effluent tss on the gene removal capacity of wwtps for an extended sampling period of one year and to study the degree of temporal variability 2 material methods 2 1 characteristics of the selected wwtps three dutch wwtps supplementary information figure s1 of different sizes and process design were considered the sampling points are displayed in fig 1 wwtp1 leeuwarden 226 667 p e processes 25 000 m3 d 1 under dry weather conditions the biological nutrient removal activated sludge process is operated on raw wastewater to support the biological phosphate removal iron feii is added to the activated sludge tanks the chemical oxygen demand load cod to the plant consists of 56 household wastewater and 26 industrial wastewater from which half corresponds to a dairy industry the catchment area includes a medium size hospital 650 beds with a load contribution of 1 wwtp2 harnaschpolder den haag 1 260 000 p e is the largest plant in the netherlands it treats an average of 150 000 m3 d 1 84 of the cod load comes from households and 16 from industry the catchment area includes several hospitals totalling 2610 beds the design of this wwtp consists of 8 identical parallel lines each line is composed of primary settling and a biological nutrient removal activated sludge process wwtp3 garmerwolde groningen 340 146 p e treats 71 800 m3 d 1 64 households 14 industry and 1 hospital totalling 1920 beds in two separate treatment lines approximately 50 of the influent is treated in a two stage activated sludge adsorption bioxidation ab process böhnke 1997 the other half of the wastewater is treated by an aerobic granular sludge process nereda the ab system has been described in detail by de graaff et al 2016 the raw influent undergoes two consecutive treatment steps first the organic content is removed in the highly loaded a stage activated sludge process operated at a short solid retention time phosphate is removed in the a stage by the addition of iron fe iii after the intermittent clarifier the second b stage activated sludge process is operated at a long solids retention time to allow nitrification and removal of the remaining biological oxygen demand bod nitrogen removal is limited by the low bod content therefore methanol is added to promote denitrification the parallel aerobic granular sludge line pronk et al 2015 includes a buffer tank to store the influent wastewater for up to 3 h before treatment and two nereda reactors containing aerobic granular sludge the activated sludge is mainly in granular form but also contains a fraction of flocs ali et al 2019 the hrt of this reactor is 6 h in dry weather conditions all removal processes bod denitrification and phosphate removal occur under the alternation of anaerobic feeding and aeration denitrification partly occurs as simultaneous nitrification denitrification and partly by on off aeration phosphate removal is essentially biological with supplemental addition of iron fe iii only taking place during extreme rain weather flow in all three wwtps the surplus sludge is digested in a mesophilic reactor and the digested sludge is subsequently dewatered and incinerated in wwtp1 the digester receives sludge from other industrial physical chemical treatment plants in the area 2 2 collection of samples from the wastewater line and the biosolids line waterline and biosolids line samples were taken every month over one year from april 2017 until march 2018 from the three aforementioned wwtps for the waterline volumes of 1 l of 24 h flow proportional composite samples were collected in sterile plastic bottles vwr nl except for the effluent of the ab line in wwtp3 that lacked an autosampler in that case a grab sample was collected instead all autosamplers for the waterline collection had a refrigeration system to ensure samples were kept cold during the 24 h collection period to account for possible daily variations the waterline samples were collected three days in a row except for wwtp3 for which this was not possible due to technical reasons all waterline samples were filtered for dna and culture based methods within 6 h after collection filters were stored at 20 c upon dna extraction waterline samples were backed up frozen at 20 c for downstream chemical analysis for the biosolids line samples were collected once per month as grab samples in 0 5 l sterile plastic bottles the flocculent biomass samples further referred to as as were collected from the mixed liquors from the activated sludge tanks the aerobic granular sludge samples further referred to as ags were taken from the purge of excess sludge digested sludge samples further referred to as ds were taken as a grab sample from the digested sludge leaving the digestor all samples were stored in cooling boxes and kept cold 4 c during transportation biosolids line samples were serially diluted and filtered for the culture based method within 6 h after collection additionally aliquots were backed up frozen at 20 c until processing for the downstream chemical analysis and dna extraction 2 3 filtration for e coli enumeration monitoring the presence and removal of e coli was used to evaluate whether fecal bacteria and args would follow similar trends e coli was chosen as a surrogate for fecal indicators for the waterline samples were processed as previously described in verburg et al 2019 for the biosolids line 2 g of homogenous sample was re suspended in 20 ml of the saline solution nacl 0 85 w v serial dilutions were performed and filtered as indicated for the waterline after filtration the resulting filters from both the water and the biosolids lines were plated on tryptone bile x glucuronide tbx selective media oxoid thermofisher uk the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c and the cfus were enumerated following iso guidelines iso 89199 2005 12 2 4 dna extraction and qpcr analysis in order to analyze the water and sludge samples for the presence of args and mges samples were pre treated and extracted as follows for the waterline samples volumes of 200 ml of effluent and 25 ml of influent and samples with similar solids content were filtered through 0 22 µm durapore pvdf membranes merck millipore in a millipore sigma filtration system the filters were frozen at 20 c upon extraction the dna extraction for waterline samples was performed using the dneasy kit power water from qiagen nl following the manufacturer s instructions for the biosolids line samples 0 50 g of all types of as 0 05 g of ds and 0 10 g of ags samples were extracted according to the midas field guide to the microbes of activated sludge and anaerobic digesters versions 7 0 as and 1 0 ds ref http www midasfieldguide org with small modifications the bead beating step was performed at 6800 rpm in a precellys homogenizer bertin technologies sas fr which is equivalent to a speed mode of 5 5 in the fastprep homogenizer the final elution was reduced to 100 µl to achieve more concentrated dna extracts after the extraction the dna extracts were diluted 10 or 100 fold to avoid inhibition and ensure the target was within the range of quantification the diluted dna was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the panel of studied genes table 1 included six args sul1 sul2 tetm qnrs ermb and bla ctx m two mges inti1 gene and korb gene the 16s rrna gene acted as a surrogate for total bacteria the reactions were prepared and performed as previously described in pallares vega et al 2019 with small modifications for the korb assay this information is specified in appendix a 2 5 total solids content and antimicrobial and disinfectant compounds in water and biosolids samples the total solids ts content of the sludge samples was determined by standard methods clesceri et al 1998 this information was required to express the results from the microbiological molecular and physicochemical analyses in biosolids as normalized to the total solids ts the determination of antimicrobial and disinfectant residues in waterline and biosolids lines samples was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the analyzed compounds are compiled in table 1 pretreatment and analysis of the waterline samples were performed as described in verburg et al 2019 biosolids sample preparation specifications of the device and run are summarized in appendix b for each sample a surrogate sample spiked with the known concentrations was used to calculate the recovery 2 6 sampling factors and statistical analysis information about abiotic factors during sampling collection was obtained as follows data about daily flow and average annual flows for 2017 and 2018 were obtained from the wwtp operators with this data the hydraulic load factor hlf was calculated this parameter stands for the ratio of the flow i e volume of water treated on the day of sampling divided by the average daily flow derived from the annual flow of each wwtp pallares vega et al 2019 air temperature on the day of sampling was retrieved from https weerstatistieken nl turbidity in effluent samples was analyzed by means of a turbidimeter 2100 n is hach the influence of these factors in the incoming and removal of genes and e coli as well as the role of intermediate steps in the removal of genes were analyzed by linear models and linear mixed models further described in detail in appendix c 3 results discussion 3 1 antimicrobials args and e coli in the influent role of rain dilution and seasonal temperature from the 24 antimicrobials included in this study 10 were detected in the influent of the three wwtps in general in concentrations within the ng l 1 scale supplementary information table s1 overall the values observed in this study were consistent with several other works across different countries felis et al 2020 the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin was the most abundant compound in the influent consistently exceeding the predicted no inhibitory concentrations pnec described by bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 for selection of antimicrobial resistance for this compound 0 064 µg l 1 with maximum levels reaching 1 20 µg l 1 the macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin and the therapeutic group of sulfonamides sulfapyridine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim were also commonly detected in influent and sometimes exceeding their corresponding pnec levels in contrast tetracyclines doxycycline and tetracycline which are the second most consumed antibiotics were prevalent in the influent but below their pnec levels 2 and 1 ug l 1 respectively the quaternary ammonium compounds qacs benzalkonium chloride bac 12 and 14 were also prevalent in the influent especially in wwtp1 with values up to 8 22 µg l 1 these qacs are used as surfactants in cleaning products and disinfectants qac resistance genes are frequently associated with class 1 integrons and other args included in those mges gillings et al 2009 qacs selective pressure might entail the co selection of mges and their associated args possibly the use of disinfectants by a neighbouring dairy industry in the catchment area of wwtp1 contributing to 12 of the influent could explain these higher levels the occurrence of a selected panel of args and mges in the influent of the waterline followed similar trends across the three wwtps supplementary information table s2 from the args selected ermb 6 39 log gene copies ml 1 and sul1 5 85 had the highest average annual concentration values while the β lactamase bla ctx m had the lowest 4 05 the overall arg patterns are in accordance with our previous study of more than 60 dutch wwtps pallares vega et al 2019 and in other recent works di cesare et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 the high concentration of ermb gene in the influent cannot be associated with a direct antibiotic selective pressure within sewage as erythromycin residues were not detected in the influent the high occurrence of ermb might result from its location in lactobacillales which are common in the gut microbiome and therefore predominant taxa in the influent ali et al 2019 cai et al 2014 the high occurrence of sul1 may be explained by its extended use in the past and its association with mge such as integron class 1 their presence could also be maintained by the persistence of sulfonamide antibiotic residues in wastewater baran et al 2011 as for the prevalence of mges both korb standing for incp 1 plasmids and inti1 encoding for the integrase of class 1 integron were ubiquitous in the influent samples moreover inti1 had a significantly higher concentration p 0 01 in the influent of wwtp1 7 04 log gene copies ml 1 when compared to the other two wwtps 6 16 logs on average and above the range measured in our previous study pallares vega et al 2019 these results might be explained through co selection events by the extended use of qacs within the dairy industry facilities further analysis addressing the presence of qac resistance genes and qac intii1 relation would be necessary to confirm such a hypothesis to investigate the role of rainfall on the occurrence of antimicrobials args and e coli in influent both their concentrations and their daily loads per population equivalent pe i e the absolute number of gene copies passing the wwtp per day divided by the population equivalent were studied unlike concentrations the daily load per pe should be constant despite differences in rainfall dilution if freshly discharged human feces were the only source of these compounds therefore using daily loads or daily loads per pe of both genes and e coli for graphical representation and model response should be better suited to detect possible effects of seasonal temperature increased rainfall led as expected to decreased concentrations of e coli 0 25 logs per average daily flow p 0 001 but not to decreased daily loads per pe 0 06 logs per average daily flow p 0 15 fig 2 supplementary information figure s3 and table s3 models 5 7 confirming the dilution effect of e coli upon heavier rainfall in contrast for the studied genes the reduction in concentrations with increased rainfall was less clear the best model did not include hlf as a determinant and there was a significant positive effect of increased rainfall on the genes when the daily loads per pe were used as the response variable 0 42 logs per average daily flow p 0 001 fig 2 supplementary information figure s3 and table s3 models 1 4 an increase of the daily loads per pe of args and mges with increased rainfall might point to an additional source of genes besides freshly discharged feces we hypothesized that such a source could consist of resident antibiotic resistant microbiota in the sewers located for instance within sewer biofilms or sewer sediments auguet et al 2017 these might also have been originally introduced into sewers with fecal microbiota with increasing flow due to rainfall a washout of the sewer microbiota could increase the incoming loads of resistance genes per pe similar to washout of in sewer stocks of e g organic matter gromaire et al 2001 the contrasting behavior of the loads per pe of e coli during rainfall events might indicate a minor accumulation of this organism in the sewer pipes a limited accumulation of e coli o157 h7 and gammaproteobacteria in sewer biofilm has been previously detected auguet et al 2017 however the observed discrepancies between genes and e coli might also be a consequence of a methodology bias unlike qpcr culturable based methods account for neither the dead nor a viable but not culturable fraction of bacteria with respect to seasonal temperature the studied agents in influent antimicrobials genes and e coli showed an inconsistent response fig 2 supplementary information figures s2 s4 and table s3 models 1 7 the antibiotic loads varied per plant with only wwtp2 showing an increase of antibiotic loads at colder temperatures with respect to resistance genes a slight but significant decrease of incoming genes for both concentration and daily loads per pe with increasing temperatures was observed for the set of genes as a whole 0 02 logs per c p 0 05 in contrast increasing temperatures significantly enhanced both concentrations and daily loads per pe of e coli in the influent of all three wwtp the effect was mild as per degree increased 0 03 logs increase per c p 0 001 overall there is limited information regarding seasonal fluctuations in influent of both antimicrobials and args some studies have observed an increase in loads of some antibiotics during winter months coutu et al 2013 marx et al 2015 this has been related to higher consumption of antibiotics used to treat winter related conditions marx et al 2015 which could increase the selective pressure and enhance the occurrence of resistant bacteria and args in the sewage this hypothesis is supported by three studies conducted in german and chinese wwtps in these studies either higher relative abundance of several args caucci et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 or higher absolute concentration of numerous bla genes schages et al 2020 were found in cold seasons in contrast karkman et al 2016 did not observe any difference across seasons after quantifying the relative concentration of a broad set of args in a finnish wwtp differences in antibiotic prescriptions across countries and the degree of seasonality might explain the contradicting observations moreover integrating flow variations of the sampling days into the studies might contribute to explain the uneven results 3 2 removal of resistance determinants and e coli 3 2 1 removal of e coli and gene determinants through conventional water treatment and novel aerobic granular sludge all three wwtps significantly p 0 001 removed the fecal indicator bacteria and the tested genes the removal efficiency varied across wwtps and measured agent fig 3 supplementary information table s3 wwtp1 achieved the best removal for both e coli and genes with an average removal of 2 31 logs for e coli supplementary information figure s5 and 2 logs of tested genes except for korb the other two wwtps performed significantly worse 0 4 logs p 0 001 removing both args and e coli 0 2 0 4 logs p 0 05 supplementary information table s3 models 11 and 12 although within the range of removal previously observed for dutch wwtps pallares vega et al 2019 moreover the patterns for gene removals were in general similar in all three wwtps and are following our previous study the most successfully removed genes were ermb 2 3 logs on average tetm and bla ctx m 2 logs on average bla ctx m was undetectable or unquantifiable in 10 40 of the effluent samples of wwtps 3 and 1 respectively the most resilient args of the panel were those relating to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 with average removals that ranged from 1 to 2 logs the two mges genes inti1 and korb were also more resilient to the treatment with removals in the range of 0 6 1 5 logs on average except for wwtp1 in which inti1 was significantly better removed 2 75 logs p 0 01 therefore although wwtp1 received a more considerable amount of inti1 gene it succeeded in removing it to the same or lower levels than the other two wwtps for the greatest part of the measured genes the wastewater treatment did not exacerbate but rather decreased the relative abundance of the studied args for some of the genes inti1 sul1 or sul2 a non significant change or a slight relative increase was found in some of the wwtps in contrast korb relative abundance increased significantly p 0 001 after the treatment in all three wwtps supplementary information figure s6 these data confirm our previous observations for one time measurements in 60 wwtps for more extended sampling periods a sampling of intermediate steps within the treatment was performed to evaluate the contribution of each treatment step to the removal of both e coli and genes the primary treatment step wwtp2 did not affect the removal of genes and exhibited a moderate but significant effect in removing the fecal indicator 0 11 logs p 0 05 the a stage ab line wwtp3 moderately removed e coli 0 17 logs p 0 05 and genes 0 36 logs p 0 001 therefore the greatest removal of both e coli and the genes occurred in the biological nutrient removal stages activated sludge with short solid retention times and short clarification as in the a stage is likely not sufficient for the removal of pathogens or args lastly we compared the removal efficiencies of two parallel lines ab line based on flocculent sludge and aerobic granular sludge treating the same influent aerobic granular sludge is a modern water treatment technology requiring smaller space and footprint than conventional activated sludge systems pronk et al 2015 aerobic granular sludge is based on bacterial aggregation in granules instead of flocs this configuration comprises a different spatial distribution and bacterial community that could affect the removal of args compared to flocculent sludge the presence of arg in granules has so far only been studied concerning accumulation during the granulation processes in bench scale aerobic granular sludge reactors li et al 2020 however information on the occurrence of args in the sludge fraction of full scale ags installations as compared to conventional sludge is missing after a one year of sampling no significant differences were observed in removing args and mges among the two parallel treatments exceptionally ermb gene was better removed in the ab system than in the aerobic granular sludge system 0 22 logs p 0 01 the removal of e coli was also similar to the ab system figure s5 in line with a recent study addressing the removal of fecal indicators barrios hernández et al 2020 3 2 2 the removal of genes and e coli is compromised by high hydraulic loads and effluent suspended solids but not by seasonal temperature the effect of abiotic parameters hlf turbidity and average temperature on the removal of args mges and e coli was investigated through linear mixed models supplementary information table s3 models 8 10 irrespective of the type of wastewater treatment the removal of both e coli and genes was hampered at high hlf fig 4 the removal capacity was modeled to decrease by 0 53 log cfus p 0 001 and 0 35 log gene copies p 0 01 at double the average daily flow this gene removal rate is in good agreement with that obtained in our previous study 0 38 logs based on single measurements across many plants higher turbidity in the effluent was also correlated with a minor but significant decrease in the removal of e coli 0 01 logs per 1 nephelometric turbidity unit 1 p 0 05 and genes 0 02 logs p 0 05 fig 4 in contrast seasonal changes in the average air temperature on the day of sampling did not alter the removal of e coli nor genes supplementary information figure s7 hence opposite to what was observed for influent variation in flow was the leading cause of variability and the seasonal temperature had no contribution the mechanisms by which the removal capacity of wwtps might be disturbed with the increasing flow have been discussed previously pallares vega et al 2019 in short increasing flow causes wastewater to spend a shorter time in the biological treatment and sedimentation steps the lack of effect of seasonal temperature in the removal capacity might appear unexpected since fluctuations in seasonal temperature are known to significantly shape the bacterial community composition within the activated sludge griffin and wells 2017 and alter the treatment performance i e by nitrification failure during winter johnston et al 2019 surprisingly the impact of seasonal temperature on args and e coli removal during full scale wastewater treatment is seldom reported and therefore remains poorly understood from the available studies no statistical differences can be found regarding the seasonal occurrence of e coli in full scale wwtps effluents lépesová et al 2019 osińska et al 2020 moreover barrios hernandez et al 2020 described no effect of seasonal temperature on the removal of e coli seasonal peaks of absolute args in effluent have been previously reported in winter and spring harnisz et al 2020 or summer jiao et al 2018 in this study seasonal fluctuations in absolute effluent concentrations moderately higher with lower temperatures were observed only in wwtp2 supplementary information figure s8 despite this trend our results indicate that changes in the seasonal temperature did not influence the removal rates in any of the wwtps supplementary information figure s7 in contrast jiao et al 2018 reported a better removal of args during summer however in jiao s study the effect of temperature cannot be detached from that of flow dynamics highly significant according to our results because information about the flow was not included the degree in which temperature or flow influence the removal efficiency of the treatment might vary across countries with different temperature and precipitation regimes thus additional studies in other locations accounting for both flow and temperature might be needed to understand further the role of temperature and flow in the removal of resistance determinants and e coli 3 2 3 fate of antimicrobials and disinfectants during wastewater treatment the fate of the different antimicrobials and disinfectant residues during wastewater treatment depended on the compounds studied fig 5 and s8 some compounds were found both in effluent and biosolids azithromycin ciprofloxacin sulfapyridine while others were present either in the effluent samples sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim clarithromycin or in the biosolids line as the tetracyclines tetracycline and doxycycline and the disinfectants bac12 and bac14 last although erythromycin was not detected in any of the influent samples it was sometimes present in ags and ds from wwtp3 all types of treatments including that based on granular sludge figure s9 reduced to a similar extent the antimicrobial concentrations 2 10 fold depending on the compound specifics of the concentrations in each wwtp s effluents are gathered in supplementary information table s1 despite the partial decrease eight of the tested antimicrobials were still detectable in some of the effluent samples although only ciprofloxacin and azithromycin were above the pnec levels most of those compounds have not been commonly detected either in the upstream or downstream surface waters of the wwtps discharge points sabri et al 2018 verburg et al 2019 hence despite wwtps discharging antimicrobials into the receiving waterbodies the residues are diluted and or sorbed to sediment reducing their concentrations in the water stream below the limits of detection the compounds that sorbed to the biosolids line were found in both ds and as although with higher concentrations in the ds samples than in the as samples likely derived from the difference in the solids content of each type of sample ciprofloxacin was again the most common antibiotic residue 2 4 mg kg 1ts ofloxacin while barely detected in influent was often detected in the biosolids line but in lower quantities than ciprofloxacin in agreement with previous studies in europe lindberg et al 2005 radjenović et al 2009 in general the concentration of tetracyclines and sulfapyridine followed the trends observed elsewhere göbel et al 2005 lindberg et al 2005 shafrir and avisar 2012 tetracyclines were often detected in values ranging between 0 1 1 2 mg kg 1ts for both as and ds samples which is around 5 to 40 µg kg 1 of fresh digested sludge for tetracycline and doxycycline respectively concentrations of 15 µg l 1 of tetracycline 150 times below the minimum inhibitory concentrations have shown to enhance the growth of tet resistant bacteria gullberg et al 2014 and to stimulate horizontal gene transfer events in vitro jutkina et al 2016 although the bioavailability of these residues in the biosolids may reduce such an effect besides the aforementioned antimicrobial residues the two disinfectants tested were also highly sorbed onto sludge concentrations ranged between 1 14 mg kg 1 ts in cas like as samples and 3 23 mg kg 1 ts in ds samples the highest levels were reported for the as in the a stage of wwtp3 with up to 49 and 101 mg kg 1 ts for bac12 and bac14 respectively supplementary information figure s9 and table s4 these concentrations meet with literature reports martínez carballo et al 2007 and reflect the important accumulation of these compounds in the sludge a high occurrence of bacs has been shown to hamper methanogenesis in anaerobic digesters zhang et al 2015 moreover field amendments of bacs rich biosolids could result in the accumulation of these compounds especially in clay soils which could potentially lead to the selection of qac genes and co selection of args mulder et al 2018 3 2 4 the occurrence of resistance determinants in biosolids mirrored those in the influent the occurrence of the args in the biosolids line of the three wwtps reflected the patterns observed in the influent supplementary information figure s10 the highest concentrations were found for ermb and sul1 with 9 4 9 9 log copies g 1ts respectively fig 6 on the lower rank were once again qnrs and bla ctxm which often laid below the limit of detection or quantification up to 86 of some of the ds and ags samples contrarily a recent study analyzing a broad range of args suggested no contribution of influent args to the recycled activated sludge resistome which was richer in abundance but poorer in diversity when compared to the influent quintela baluja et al 2019 since mixed liquors and not sedimented sludge were used in our study a higher resemblance to influent args patterns can be expected our data also demonstrate a high occurrence of mge elements in the biosolid line particularly in the as systems where the korb gene was found in similar ranges than the integrase inti1 gene in contrast inti1 was 1 2 log more abundant than korb in influent samples the high prevalence of korb in the activated sludge might explain the poor removal of this gene and the subsequent equalization of inti1 and korb levels in the effluent incp 1 plasmids have been detected in biosolids of activated and digested sludge dröge et al 2000 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time incp 1 plasmids have been quantified in activated sludge samples showing a high occurrence which confirm their relevance in studies addressing horizontal gene transfer events in biosolids like systems neither the flow nor the seasonal temperature seemed to homogenously alter the concentration of genes in the cas like activated sludge systems supplementary information table s3 figure s11 even though some trends could be observed across plants with increasing temperatures the effect varied per studied gene i e a decrease of ermb and tetm and an increase of qnrs absolute concentrations overall there was a modest variation of concentrations of arg in biosolids between wwtps roughly 0 5 logs and across the year however the absolute abundance of most of the genes was greater in as than ds the same effect was observed for the e coli concentrations supplementary information figure s5 table s5 lower absolute concentrations of args mges and e coli were also observed among ags in contrast to the as from the b stage which is comparable to a conventional activated sludge system these differences are likely due to normalization per gram of ts which is roughly 10 fold higher in the ds and ags samples compared to as ones when normalized to the 16s rrna supplementary information figure s12 the relative concentration of several of the args and mges in biosolids was similar among the aforementioned pairs as vs ds and ags vs as from the b stage only a slightly lower relative concentration of ermb was observed in ags a lower adhesion of bacteria harboring ermb gene to the granular sludge fraction could explain its poorer removal after ags treatment in comparison with the ab line consistently higher relative concentrations of args in as a stage were observed in comparison to as from b stage and another flocculent as from wwtp1 and wwtp2 and ags figure s12 this difference could be due to the operational conditions of a stage where the solids retention time is significantly shorter 0 3 days than that used for b stage 23 days and another conventional flocculent as systems 15 20 days or ags 30 days barrios hernández et al 2020 de graaff et al 2016 shorter solids retention time most likely limits the natural decay of incoming antibiotic resistant bacteria by out competition of indigenous sludge microbiota and protozoa predation a persistent higher concentration of tetm gene after the anaerobic digestion was observed when compared with as samples for both absolute and relative abundances figure s12 this suggests that the anaerobic treatment might select for bacteria harboring this gene as aforementioned the concentrations of tetracycline residues in digested sludge might also contribute to the selection of tet genes although similar effects were not found for quinolone resistance a slight enrichment of the relative abundance after anaerobic digestion was also observed for ermb figure s9 these findings are in accordance with the results of ma et al 2011 in bench scale mesophilic digesters where they even observed an increase in the absolute abundance of erm genes and some of the tested tet genes in contrast inti1 and sul genes decreased in both relative and absolute abundance an increase of several args including erm tet and sul genes was also observed in two full scale anaerobic digestors in china tong et al 2019 while in another full scale study in the us the relative abundance of three tet genes varied depending on the sampling dates ghosh et al 2009 digested sludge is used in some countries as fertilizer for crops the impact of pathogens and args from sludge amendments in soil is still under debate rahube et al 2014 rutgersson et al 2020 in the netherlands digested sludge undergoes incineration however there is a growing interest in nutrient recovery from this byproduct therefore increasing the knowledge of possible hazards in the handling and downstream processing of digested sludge is important 3 3 depicting sampling strategies if the results obtained in this studied are compared with those of our previous work sampling multiple wwtps but on a single occasion the former managed to capture similar variability in args occurrence and removal as in repeated sampling across one year supplementary information figure s13 thus shorter sampling efforts might be enough to evaluate the removal abilities of a wwtp if the objective is to evaluate variability in performance and address possible solutions rainy and dry periods might be more interesting to assess than seasons in the absence of molecular methodology or the need for rapid results the use of bacterial surrogates to evaluate the fate of args might be necessary correlation analysis pearson s correlations highlighted that e coli should not be used to evaluate the variation in incoming concentrations of args but could be considered as a surrogate to evaluate the removal of specific args such as blactx m ermb and tetm supplementary information figures s14 s16 commonly associated to enterobacteriaceae and lactobacillae these taxa follow e coli removal patterns during wastewater treatment barrios hernández et al 2020 ferreira da silva et al 2007 ottoson et al 2006 4 conclusions a one year sampling campaign of three full scale wwtps highlighted that warmer seasonal temperature marginally decreased the concentrations of resistance genes in the influent but increased those of e coli however seasonal temperature variation had an impaired effect on concentrations of antimicrobials in the influent instead rainfall played a major role by diluting the concentrations of antimicrobials as well as fecal indicators such as e coli but not of resistance genes rainfall increasing the typical hydraulic load of each wwtps significantly reduced the efficiency of wastewater treatment removal of genes and e coli in agreement with previous findings across the netherlands increasing effluent s turbidity was also related to slightly poorer removal in addition we concluded that the occurrence of resistant determinants in the biosolids line followed the occurrence patterns in the influent and that incp 1 plasmids are highly abundant in biosolids finally full scale activated sludge and granular sludge technologies displayed comparable performance in the ability to remove antimicrobials resistant determinants and the fecal indicator e coli declaration of

appendix b sample preparation for antimicrobials and disinfectants measurements in biosolids for the sludge line samples aliquots stored at 20 c were defrosted overnight at 5 c ags samples were homogenized by bead beating at 4500 rpm for 30 s in the precellys homogenizer bertin technologies sas fr with the help of 4 mm glass beads merk nl as and ds samples were homogenized by vigorous manual agitation a total of 0 15 g of homogenized ags and 0 75 g of homogenized as or ds were used for the analysis the conditioning of the sludge matrix was achieved by mixing the sample with 1 5 ml of buffer ammonium formate formic acid 50 50 v v ph 2 to this mix the following was added 0 1 ml of an internal standard with isotopically labeled compounds table b3 1 5 ml of modifier consisting of in 100 ml 50 ml of oxalic acid at 1 mol l 1 15 ml of ammonia at 5 mol l 1 5 ml of formic acid at 99 v v and 35 ml of ultrapure deionized water 3 ml of methanol at 99 v v and 1 ml of organic modifier acetonitrile methanol 50 50 v v 1 formic acid in order to calculate the recovery of each compound in each sample a parallel vial was prepared including 0 4 ml of a standard containing a mix of all the tested compounds for both samples and recovery surrogates the volume was completed up to 15 ml with ultrapure deionized water the mix was vortexed for 30 min at speed 8 1700 rpm and subjected to sonication for 15 min in a bath sonicator bandelin electronic de the vials were centrifuged at 3475 x g for 10 min and the supernatants used directly for analysis by lc ms ms all samples were injected

1 mm column with 1 8 µm particle size detailed information about the mobile phases and data analyses can be found in tables b1 b2 b3 b4 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of the method were determined for each compound as the lowest detectable amount of compound with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively the recovery rates for each compound in each sample were calculated from the spiked samples the samples values were then recalculated by multiplying each result by the corresponding recovery only if this was among 50 150 when the recovery value was below or above the aforementioned threshold the sample was excluded for the disinfectant residues bac12 and bac14 the recoveries were not applied as the concentrations already present in the samples were 10 30 times higher than the spiked concentrations thus the results displayed are the concentration in the sample without further recalculations appendix c statistical analysis the statistical analysis linear models and mixed models were conducted in r 3 6 5 r core team 2018 and rstudio http www rstudio com with the packages stats lmer and lmertest bates et al 2016 kuznetsova et al 2017 only for the statistical analysis the final effluent samples having blactx m values below the loq were replaced by the loq value 6 out of 36 values all other genes were above the loq in all samples before the removal was calculated for the comparison analysis of single gene occurrences in influent or the comparison of single genes and e coli removal performance across all three wwtps or across the two parallel lines of wwtp3 and its final effluent an analysis of the variance was used when normality was met followed by tukey post hoc analysis the comparisons were made using the log concentrations of genes ml 1 or the log transformed removal values respectively if the distribution did not meet the normality the group comparison was performed with non parametric test kruskal wallis the influence of abiotic factors in the incoming and removal of antimicrobials genes and e coli as well as the role of intermediate steps in the removal of genes were analyzed by linear models and linear mixed models the summary of the models is displayed in table c1 and the construction of the models is described below to evaluate the contribution of either the overall treatment or the intermediate steps primary treatment in wwtp2 or a stage in the ab line of wwtp3 to the removal of genes determinants and e coli linear mixed models were used with observations clustered by sampling time point the log transformed concentrations log10 of gene copies of args mges and e coli log10 cfu counts per ml from each sample type were used as the response variable the explanatory variables tested in the mixed model were sample type fixed term representing the location of the sample within the wwtp and the gene type only in the gene models wwtp and sample code month as independent random terms random intercept modelled the latter allowed the model to account for paired measurements from the same month of influent in and final effluent fe primary treatment pt or a stage ast the result of these models are coefficients describing the gene reduction per location and differences in gene concentrations per wwtp across all resistance genes or e coli and sampling time point for single plants similar linear mixed models or linear models as for e coli were also used to investigate the influence of additional explanatory factors sampling parameters on the removal of either args and mges or e coli cfu counts in this case the response variable was the removal value calculated as the log10 of the ratio of the concentration of genes or cfu counts in the influent versus the final effluent the explanatory variables fixed terms were the wwtp the average temperature the turbidity as a surrogate for tss presence in effluent and the hydraulic load factor hlf the random terms were the gene type only in the gene model and the sample code month that allowed grouping all the genes from the same wwtp and sampling time point for e coli only one explained variable cfu counts was available and thus neither gene type nor sample code month random terms were applicable the inclusion of wwtp as fixed term lead to singular fit problem thus for e coli a linear model was used instead the role of explanatory factors for the concentrations of resistance genes and e coli in influent was also investigated through linear mixed models the response variable was the log10 transformed influent concentration per ml of either args and mges gene copies or cfu counts in addition the load pe or absolute daily amount of resistance genes and cfu per population equivalent was used as a response variable the load was obtained from multiplying influent concentrations with the flow on the measurement day thereby correcting for increased treatment volumes last the load was normalized per population equivalent pe load pe where 1 pe stands for 150 g of total oxygen demand and used as a response variable log10 transformed the average atmospheric temperature and hlf from the day of sampling were used as the fixed term explanatory variables again gene type only in the gene models and sample code month were used as the random terms whilst hlf and temperature were used as fixed effects the same explanatory factors were also modelled against the concentration of genes in the biosolids by using a similar approach than for the influent models but with the log10 transformed concentration of genes args and mges or cfus per g of ts as a response variable due to high percentage of missing values qnrs and bla ctx m genes were not included in the model finally a linear mixed model was used to address the effect of both temperature and hlf in the incoming concentrations of antimicrobials commonly found in influent azithromycin clarithromycin ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole sulpyridine trimethoprim doxycycline tetracycline and clindamycin missing values were replaced by lod 2 of each compound the response variable was the concentration of antimicrobial in µg l 1 and the explanatory variables were the hlf and temperature in the fixed terms and antimicrobial type to group for each type of antibiotic and sample code month in the random terms to account for samples from the same location and sampling time point after analysis the model was considered to not being well fitted according to the optical inspection of residuals and thus results of this model are not further included in the results and discussion section in the linear mixed models with several explanatory variables the relevance of the explanatory variables was determined through stepwise backward model reduction and the quality of the models was assessed by visual inspection of the normality of the residuals the datasets used in this study are available in mendeley data repository doi 10 17632

17302,the occurrence and removal patterns of 24 antimicrobial agents and antimicrobial resistant determinants namely 6 antibiotic resistance genes args and 2 mobile genetic elements mges and the fecal indicator e coli were investigated in three full scale wastewater treatment plants their waterlines and biosolids lines including secondary treatment based on both granular and activated sludge were sampled monthly throughout one year samples were analyzed by means of lc ms ms qpcr and cell enumeration respectively the influence of rainfall temperature and turbidity on the occurrence and removal of the aforementioned agents was assessed through statistical linear mixed models ten of the antimicrobial agents macrolides fluoroquinolones tetracyclines and sulfonamides were commonly found in influent in concentrations of 0 1 2 µg l 1 and the predominant args were ermb and sul1 6 4 and 5 9 log10 ml 1 respectively warmer temperatures slightly reduced gene concentrations in influent whilst increasing that of e coli and produced an uneven effect on the antimicrobial concentrations across plants rainfall diluted both e coli 0 25 logs p 0 001 and antimicrobials but not genes the wastewater treatment reduced the absolute abundance of both genes 1 86 logs on average and e coli 2 31 logs on average the antimicrobials agents were also partly removed but 8 of them were still detectable after treatment and 6 accumulated in the biosolids args were also found in biosolids with patterns resembling those of influent no significant differences in the removal of antimicrobials genes and e coli were observed when comparing conventional activated sludge with aerobic granular sludge irrespective of the type of sludge treatment the removal of genes was significantly reduced with increasing hydraulic loads caused by rainfall 0 35 logs per average daily flow p 0 01 and slightly decreased with increasing turbidity 0 02 logs per 1 nephelometric turbidy unit p 0 05 graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords wwtp args antibiotics granular sludge rainfall temperature 1 introduction the occurrence of anthropogenic antibiotic resistance genes args in the environment seems to be strongly related to fecal pollution karkman et al 2019 human fecal bacteria are transported through sewage networks and wastewater treatment plants wwtps to the environment wwtps primarily designed for nutrient removal have therefore been hypothesized as key vectors in the environmental dissemination of antibiotic resistance rizzo et al 2013 the fate of args in wwtps has been assessed in recent years providing a wide range of results in some cases wwtps reduced the absolute concentration of args di cesare et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 while in others the relative and even absolute abundances of args increased after treatment rafraf et al 2016 there is a growing interest in determining which technologies or operational conditions achieve greater args removal however due to the wide diversity of treatment processes it is difficult to obtain general results that are applicable across the variety of wwtp systems and arg types korzeniewska and harnisz 2018 novo and manaia 2010 previously broad sampling efforts to analyze the influent and effluent of more than 60 wwtps in the netherlands helped to determine that the removal of args was significantly smaller when the baseline hydraulic load of the wwtps increased because of rainfall events pallares vega et al 2019 yet even under dry weather conditions process design and operational parameters did not explain the remaining variability this suggests that other factors contributed to the detected differences one factor that may impact the occurrence and removal of args is the presence of antimicrobial and disinfectant residues these compounds are collected in the wastewater along with the feces and might accumulate in the sewage sludge gao et al 2012 göbel et al 2005 antimicrobial and disinfectant residues may enhance the co selection of resistance genes and promote horizontal gene transfer even at subtherapeutic concentrations gullberg et al 2014 in addition fluctuations in other abiotic factors such as temperature might also influence the occurrence and removal of args higher antimicrobial consumption in colder seasons coutu et al 2013 marx et al 2015 might increase the discharge of resistant bacteria and their args into the sewer in addition cold temperatures reduce the efficiency of water treatment johnston et al 2019 and might also reduce the ability to remove args literature addressing the effect of temperature on the occurrence and fate of args during wastewater treatment is however scarce a few studies have focused on quantifying the seasonal variation of args in influent and their removal caucci et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 moreover temperature or seasonality have seldom been addressed in combination with rainfall or flow schages et al 2020 thus there is a need for a comprehensive approach studying the combined effect of these variables on arg patterns furthermore biotic factors such as the accumulation of args in the natural microbiome of the biological treatment deserve attention in the biological treatment the microbial community which converts wastewater compounds is aggregated into flocs activated sludge biofilms or granular sludge such bioaggregates might provide a suitable environment for cell to cell interactions and genetic exchange of mobile genetic elements mge containing args manaia et al 2018 potentially increasing the so called resistome of the sludge diverse sludge types flocculent granules might accumulate args differently derived from their characteristic physical structure and microbial community ultimately the intrinsic sludge resistome may counterbalance a further elimination of args during the wastewater treatment the accumulation of args in the biosolids is also of concern given that sludge is often processed and applied as a fertilizer due to its high content of organic nutrients and phosphorus as such this practice comprises another possible route for the spread of anthropogenic args to the environment rahube et al 2014 generally studies covering the effect of a broad number of variables on args are restricted to few time point measurements although cross sectional studies provide relevant information it is necessary to investigate whether measurements at single time points are valid throughout extended periods such information is needed to determine suitable sampling strategies to answer specific research questions hence the aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence and fate of args mges and viable fecal bacteria over one year of operation at three different full scale municipal wwtps located in the netherlands these treatment plants performed biological nutrient removal with three systems based on activated sludge and one system based on aerobic granular sludge besides gene determinants we investigated the presence of selective agents as antimicrobial compounds and disinfectants in both the water and biosolids line analyses were aimed at determining the role of abiotic parameters such as the hydraulic load factor seasonal temperature and the effluent turbidity as a surrogate for effluent tss on the gene removal capacity of wwtps for an extended sampling period of one year and to study the degree of temporal variability 2 material methods 2 1 characteristics of the selected wwtps three dutch wwtps supplementary information figure s1 of different sizes and process design were considered the sampling points are displayed in fig 1 wwtp1 leeuwarden 226 667 p e processes 25 000 m3 d 1 under dry weather conditions the biological nutrient removal activated sludge process is operated on raw wastewater to support the biological phosphate removal iron feii is added to the activated sludge tanks the chemical oxygen demand load cod to the plant consists of 56 household wastewater and 26 industrial wastewater from which half corresponds to a dairy industry the catchment area includes a medium size hospital 650 beds with a load contribution of 1 wwtp2 harnaschpolder den haag 1 260 000 p e is the largest plant in the netherlands it treats an average of 150 000 m3 d 1 84 of the cod load comes from households and 16 from industry the catchment area includes several hospitals totalling 2610 beds the design of this wwtp consists of 8 identical parallel lines each line is composed of primary settling and a biological nutrient removal activated sludge process wwtp3 garmerwolde groningen 340 146 p e treats 71 800 m3 d 1 64 households 14 industry and 1 hospital totalling 1920 beds in two separate treatment lines approximately 50 of the influent is treated in a two stage activated sludge adsorption bioxidation ab process böhnke 1997 the other half of the wastewater is treated by an aerobic granular sludge process nereda the ab system has been described in detail by de graaff et al 2016 the raw influent undergoes two consecutive treatment steps first the organic content is removed in the highly loaded a stage activated sludge process operated at a short solid retention time phosphate is removed in the a stage by the addition of iron fe iii after the intermittent clarifier the second b stage activated sludge process is operated at a long solids retention time to allow nitrification and removal of the remaining biological oxygen demand bod nitrogen removal is limited by the low bod content therefore methanol is added to promote denitrification the parallel aerobic granular sludge line pronk et al 2015 includes a buffer tank to store the influent wastewater for up to 3 h before treatment and two nereda reactors containing aerobic granular sludge the activated sludge is mainly in granular form but also contains a fraction of flocs ali et al 2019 the hrt of this reactor is 6 h in dry weather conditions all removal processes bod denitrification and phosphate removal occur under the alternation of anaerobic feeding and aeration denitrification partly occurs as simultaneous nitrification denitrification and partly by on off aeration phosphate removal is essentially biological with supplemental addition of iron fe iii only taking place during extreme rain weather flow in all three wwtps the surplus sludge is digested in a mesophilic reactor and the digested sludge is subsequently dewatered and incinerated in wwtp1 the digester receives sludge from other industrial physical chemical treatment plants in the area 2 2 collection of samples from the wastewater line and the biosolids line waterline and biosolids line samples were taken every month over one year from april 2017 until march 2018 from the three aforementioned wwtps for the waterline volumes of 1 l of 24 h flow proportional composite samples were collected in sterile plastic bottles vwr nl except for the effluent of the ab line in wwtp3 that lacked an autosampler in that case a grab sample was collected instead all autosamplers for the waterline collection had a refrigeration system to ensure samples were kept cold during the 24 h collection period to account for possible daily variations the waterline samples were collected three days in a row except for wwtp3 for which this was not possible due to technical reasons all waterline samples were filtered for dna and culture based methods within 6 h after collection filters were stored at 20 c upon dna extraction waterline samples were backed up frozen at 20 c for downstream chemical analysis for the biosolids line samples were collected once per month as grab samples in 0 5 l sterile plastic bottles the flocculent biomass samples further referred to as as were collected from the mixed liquors from the activated sludge tanks the aerobic granular sludge samples further referred to as ags were taken from the purge of excess sludge digested sludge samples further referred to as ds were taken as a grab sample from the digested sludge leaving the digestor all samples were stored in cooling boxes and kept cold 4 c during transportation biosolids line samples were serially diluted and filtered for the culture based method within 6 h after collection additionally aliquots were backed up frozen at 20 c until processing for the downstream chemical analysis and dna extraction 2 3 filtration for e coli enumeration monitoring the presence and removal of e coli was used to evaluate whether fecal bacteria and args would follow similar trends e coli was chosen as a surrogate for fecal indicators for the waterline samples were processed as previously described in verburg et al 2019 for the biosolids line 2 g of homogenous sample was re suspended in 20 ml of the saline solution nacl 0 85 w v serial dilutions were performed and filtered as indicated for the waterline after filtration the resulting filters from both the water and the biosolids lines were plated on tryptone bile x glucuronide tbx selective media oxoid thermofisher uk the plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 c and the cfus were enumerated following iso guidelines iso 89199 2005 12 2 4 dna extraction and qpcr analysis in order to analyze the water and sludge samples for the presence of args and mges samples were pre treated and extracted as follows for the waterline samples volumes of 200 ml of effluent and 25 ml of influent and samples with similar solids content were filtered through 0 22 µm durapore pvdf membranes merck millipore in a millipore sigma filtration system the filters were frozen at 20 c upon extraction the dna extraction for waterline samples was performed using the dneasy kit power water from qiagen nl following the manufacturer s instructions for the biosolids line samples 0 50 g of all types of as 0 05 g of ds and 0 10 g of ags samples were extracted according to the midas field guide to the microbes of activated sludge and anaerobic digesters versions 7 0 as and 1 0 ds ref http www midasfieldguide org with small modifications the bead beating step was performed at 6800 rpm in a precellys homogenizer bertin technologies sas fr which is equivalent to a speed mode of 5 5 in the fastprep homogenizer the final elution was reduced to 100 µl to achieve more concentrated dna extracts after the extraction the dna extracts were diluted 10 or 100 fold to avoid inhibition and ensure the target was within the range of quantification the diluted dna was analyzed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction qpcr the panel of studied genes table 1 included six args sul1 sul2 tetm qnrs ermb and bla ctx m two mges inti1 gene and korb gene the 16s rrna gene acted as a surrogate for total bacteria the reactions were prepared and performed as previously described in pallares vega et al 2019 with small modifications for the korb assay this information is specified in appendix a 2 5 total solids content and antimicrobial and disinfectant compounds in water and biosolids samples the total solids ts content of the sludge samples was determined by standard methods clesceri et al 1998 this information was required to express the results from the microbiological molecular and physicochemical analyses in biosolids as normalized to the total solids ts the determination of antimicrobial and disinfectant residues in waterline and biosolids lines samples was performed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the analyzed compounds are compiled in table 1 pretreatment and analysis of the waterline samples were performed as described in verburg et al 2019 biosolids sample preparation specifications of the device and run are summarized in appendix b for each sample a surrogate sample spiked with the known concentrations was used to calculate the recovery 2 6 sampling factors and statistical analysis information about abiotic factors during sampling collection was obtained as follows data about daily flow and average annual flows for 2017 and 2018 were obtained from the wwtp operators with this data the hydraulic load factor hlf was calculated this parameter stands for the ratio of the flow i e volume of water treated on the day of sampling divided by the average daily flow derived from the annual flow of each wwtp pallares vega et al 2019 air temperature on the day of sampling was retrieved from https weerstatistieken nl turbidity in effluent samples was analyzed by means of a turbidimeter 2100 n is hach the influence of these factors in the incoming and removal of genes and e coli as well as the role of intermediate steps in the removal of genes were analyzed by linear models and linear mixed models further described in detail in appendix c 3 results discussion 3 1 antimicrobials args and e coli in the influent role of rain dilution and seasonal temperature from the 24 antimicrobials included in this study 10 were detected in the influent of the three wwtps in general in concentrations within the ng l 1 scale supplementary information table s1 overall the values observed in this study were consistent with several other works across different countries felis et al 2020 the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin was the most abundant compound in the influent consistently exceeding the predicted no inhibitory concentrations pnec described by bengtsson palme and larsson 2016 for selection of antimicrobial resistance for this compound 0 064 µg l 1 with maximum levels reaching 1 20 µg l 1 the macrolides azithromycin and clarithromycin and the therapeutic group of sulfonamides sulfapyridine sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim were also commonly detected in influent and sometimes exceeding their corresponding pnec levels in contrast tetracyclines doxycycline and tetracycline which are the second most consumed antibiotics were prevalent in the influent but below their pnec levels 2 and 1 ug l 1 respectively the quaternary ammonium compounds qacs benzalkonium chloride bac 12 and 14 were also prevalent in the influent especially in wwtp1 with values up to 8 22 µg l 1 these qacs are used as surfactants in cleaning products and disinfectants qac resistance genes are frequently associated with class 1 integrons and other args included in those mges gillings et al 2009 qacs selective pressure might entail the co selection of mges and their associated args possibly the use of disinfectants by a neighbouring dairy industry in the catchment area of wwtp1 contributing to 12 of the influent could explain these higher levels the occurrence of a selected panel of args and mges in the influent of the waterline followed similar trends across the three wwtps supplementary information table s2 from the args selected ermb 6 39 log gene copies ml 1 and sul1 5 85 had the highest average annual concentration values while the β lactamase bla ctx m had the lowest 4 05 the overall arg patterns are in accordance with our previous study of more than 60 dutch wwtps pallares vega et al 2019 and in other recent works di cesare et al 2016 rodriguez mozaz et al 2015 the high concentration of ermb gene in the influent cannot be associated with a direct antibiotic selective pressure within sewage as erythromycin residues were not detected in the influent the high occurrence of ermb might result from its location in lactobacillales which are common in the gut microbiome and therefore predominant taxa in the influent ali et al 2019 cai et al 2014 the high occurrence of sul1 may be explained by its extended use in the past and its association with mge such as integron class 1 their presence could also be maintained by the persistence of sulfonamide antibiotic residues in wastewater baran et al 2011 as for the prevalence of mges both korb standing for incp 1 plasmids and inti1 encoding for the integrase of class 1 integron were ubiquitous in the influent samples moreover inti1 had a significantly higher concentration p 0 01 in the influent of wwtp1 7 04 log gene copies ml 1 when compared to the other two wwtps 6 16 logs on average and above the range measured in our previous study pallares vega et al 2019 these results might be explained through co selection events by the extended use of qacs within the dairy industry facilities further analysis addressing the presence of qac resistance genes and qac intii1 relation would be necessary to confirm such a hypothesis to investigate the role of rainfall on the occurrence of antimicrobials args and e coli in influent both their concentrations and their daily loads per population equivalent pe i e the absolute number of gene copies passing the wwtp per day divided by the population equivalent were studied unlike concentrations the daily load per pe should be constant despite differences in rainfall dilution if freshly discharged human feces were the only source of these compounds therefore using daily loads or daily loads per pe of both genes and e coli for graphical representation and model response should be better suited to detect possible effects of seasonal temperature increased rainfall led as expected to decreased concentrations of e coli 0 25 logs per average daily flow p 0 001 but not to decreased daily loads per pe 0 06 logs per average daily flow p 0 15 fig 2 supplementary information figure s3 and table s3 models 5 7 confirming the dilution effect of e coli upon heavier rainfall in contrast for the studied genes the reduction in concentrations with increased rainfall was less clear the best model did not include hlf as a determinant and there was a significant positive effect of increased rainfall on the genes when the daily loads per pe were used as the response variable 0 42 logs per average daily flow p 0 001 fig 2 supplementary information figure s3 and table s3 models 1 4 an increase of the daily loads per pe of args and mges with increased rainfall might point to an additional source of genes besides freshly discharged feces we hypothesized that such a source could consist of resident antibiotic resistant microbiota in the sewers located for instance within sewer biofilms or sewer sediments auguet et al 2017 these might also have been originally introduced into sewers with fecal microbiota with increasing flow due to rainfall a washout of the sewer microbiota could increase the incoming loads of resistance genes per pe similar to washout of in sewer stocks of e g organic matter gromaire et al 2001 the contrasting behavior of the loads per pe of e coli during rainfall events might indicate a minor accumulation of this organism in the sewer pipes a limited accumulation of e coli o157 h7 and gammaproteobacteria in sewer biofilm has been previously detected auguet et al 2017 however the observed discrepancies between genes and e coli might also be a consequence of a methodology bias unlike qpcr culturable based methods account for neither the dead nor a viable but not culturable fraction of bacteria with respect to seasonal temperature the studied agents in influent antimicrobials genes and e coli showed an inconsistent response fig 2 supplementary information figures s2 s4 and table s3 models 1 7 the antibiotic loads varied per plant with only wwtp2 showing an increase of antibiotic loads at colder temperatures with respect to resistance genes a slight but significant decrease of incoming genes for both concentration and daily loads per pe with increasing temperatures was observed for the set of genes as a whole 0 02 logs per c p 0 05 in contrast increasing temperatures significantly enhanced both concentrations and daily loads per pe of e coli in the influent of all three wwtp the effect was mild as per degree increased 0 03 logs increase per c p 0 001 overall there is limited information regarding seasonal fluctuations in influent of both antimicrobials and args some studies have observed an increase in loads of some antibiotics during winter months coutu et al 2013 marx et al 2015 this has been related to higher consumption of antibiotics used to treat winter related conditions marx et al 2015 which could increase the selective pressure and enhance the occurrence of resistant bacteria and args in the sewage this hypothesis is supported by three studies conducted in german and chinese wwtps in these studies either higher relative abundance of several args caucci et al 2016 jiao et al 2018 or higher absolute concentration of numerous bla genes schages et al 2020 were found in cold seasons in contrast karkman et al 2016 did not observe any difference across seasons after quantifying the relative concentration of a broad set of args in a finnish wwtp differences in antibiotic prescriptions across countries and the degree of seasonality might explain the contradicting observations moreover integrating flow variations of the sampling days into the studies might contribute to explain the uneven results 3 2 removal of resistance determinants and e coli 3 2 1 removal of e coli and gene determinants through conventional water treatment and novel aerobic granular sludge all three wwtps significantly p 0 001 removed the fecal indicator bacteria and the tested genes the removal efficiency varied across wwtps and measured agent fig 3 supplementary information table s3 wwtp1 achieved the best removal for both e coli and genes with an average removal of 2 31 logs for e coli supplementary information figure s5 and 2 logs of tested genes except for korb the other two wwtps performed significantly worse 0 4 logs p 0 001 removing both args and e coli 0 2 0 4 logs p 0 05 supplementary information table s3 models 11 and 12 although within the range of removal previously observed for dutch wwtps pallares vega et al 2019 moreover the patterns for gene removals were in general similar in all three wwtps and are following our previous study the most successfully removed genes were ermb 2 3 logs on average tetm and bla ctx m 2 logs on average bla ctx m was undetectable or unquantifiable in 10 40 of the effluent samples of wwtps 3 and 1 respectively the most resilient args of the panel were those relating to sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 with average removals that ranged from 1 to 2 logs the two mges genes inti1 and korb were also more resilient to the treatment with removals in the range of 0 6 1 5 logs on average except for wwtp1 in which inti1 was significantly better removed 2 75 logs p 0 01 therefore although wwtp1 received a more considerable amount of inti1 gene it succeeded in removing it to the same or lower levels than the other two wwtps for the greatest part of the measured genes the wastewater treatment did not exacerbate but rather decreased the relative abundance of the studied args for some of the genes inti1 sul1 or sul2 a non significant change or a slight relative increase was found in some of the wwtps in contrast korb relative abundance increased significantly p 0 001 after the treatment in all three wwtps supplementary information figure s6 these data confirm our previous observations for one time measurements in 60 wwtps for more extended sampling periods a sampling of intermediate steps within the treatment was performed to evaluate the contribution of each treatment step to the removal of both e coli and genes the primary treatment step wwtp2 did not affect the removal of genes and exhibited a moderate but significant effect in removing the fecal indicator 0 11 logs p 0 05 the a stage ab line wwtp3 moderately removed e coli 0 17 logs p 0 05 and genes 0 36 logs p 0 001 therefore the greatest removal of both e coli and the genes occurred in the biological nutrient removal stages activated sludge with short solid retention times and short clarification as in the a stage is likely not sufficient for the removal of pathogens or args lastly we compared the removal efficiencies of two parallel lines ab line based on flocculent sludge and aerobic granular sludge treating the same influent aerobic granular sludge is a modern water treatment technology requiring smaller space and footprint than conventional activated sludge systems pronk et al 2015 aerobic granular sludge is based on bacterial aggregation in granules instead of flocs this configuration comprises a different spatial distribution and bacterial community that could affect the removal of args compared to flocculent sludge the presence of arg in granules has so far only been studied concerning accumulation during the granulation processes in bench scale aerobic granular sludge reactors li et al 2020 however information on the occurrence of args in the sludge fraction of full scale ags installations as compared to conventional sludge is missing after a one year of sampling no significant differences were observed in removing args and mges among the two parallel treatments exceptionally ermb gene was better removed in the ab system than in the aerobic granular sludge system 0 22 logs p 0 01 the removal of e coli was also similar to the ab system figure s5 in line with a recent study addressing the removal of fecal indicators barrios hernández et al 2020 3 2 2 the removal of genes and e coli is compromised by high hydraulic loads and effluent suspended solids but not by seasonal temperature the effect of abiotic parameters hlf turbidity and average temperature on the removal of args mges and e coli was investigated through linear mixed models supplementary information table s3 models 8 10 irrespective of the type of wastewater treatment the removal of both e coli and genes was hampered at high hlf fig 4 the removal capacity was modeled to decrease by 0 53 log cfus p 0 001 and 0 35 log gene copies p 0 01 at double the average daily flow this gene removal rate is in good agreement with that obtained in our previous study 0 38 logs based on single measurements across many plants higher turbidity in the effluent was also correlated with a minor but significant decrease in the removal of e coli 0 01 logs per 1 nephelometric turbidity unit 1 p 0 05 and genes 0 02 logs p 0 05 fig 4 in contrast seasonal changes in the average air temperature on the day of sampling did not alter the removal of e coli nor genes supplementary information figure s7 hence opposite to what was observed for influent variation in flow was the leading cause of variability and the seasonal temperature had no contribution the mechanisms by which the removal capacity of wwtps might be disturbed with the increasing flow have been discussed previously pallares vega et al 2019 in short increasing flow causes wastewater to spend a shorter time in the biological treatment and sedimentation steps the lack of effect of seasonal temperature in the removal capacity might appear unexpected since fluctuations in seasonal temperature are known to significantly shape the bacterial community composition within the activated sludge griffin and wells 2017 and alter the treatment performance i e by nitrification failure during winter johnston et al 2019 surprisingly the impact of seasonal temperature on args and e coli removal during full scale wastewater treatment is seldom reported and therefore remains poorly understood from the available studies no statistical differences can be found regarding the seasonal occurrence of e coli in full scale wwtps effluents lépesová et al 2019 osińska et al 2020 moreover barrios hernandez et al 2020 described no effect of seasonal temperature on the removal of e coli seasonal peaks of absolute args in effluent have been previously reported in winter and spring harnisz et al 2020 or summer jiao et al 2018 in this study seasonal fluctuations in absolute effluent concentrations moderately higher with lower temperatures were observed only in wwtp2 supplementary information figure s8 despite this trend our results indicate that changes in the seasonal temperature did not influence the removal rates in any of the wwtps supplementary information figure s7 in contrast jiao et al 2018 reported a better removal of args during summer however in jiao s study the effect of temperature cannot be detached from that of flow dynamics highly significant according to our results because information about the flow was not included the degree in which temperature or flow influence the removal efficiency of the treatment might vary across countries with different temperature and precipitation regimes thus additional studies in other locations accounting for both flow and temperature might be needed to understand further the role of temperature and flow in the removal of resistance determinants and e coli 3 2 3 fate of antimicrobials and disinfectants during wastewater treatment the fate of the different antimicrobials and disinfectant residues during wastewater treatment depended on the compounds studied fig 5 and s8 some compounds were found both in effluent and biosolids azithromycin ciprofloxacin sulfapyridine while others were present either in the effluent samples sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim clarithromycin or in the biosolids line as the tetracyclines tetracycline and doxycycline and the disinfectants bac12 and bac14 last although erythromycin was not detected in any of the influent samples it was sometimes present in ags and ds from wwtp3 all types of treatments including that based on granular sludge figure s9 reduced to a similar extent the antimicrobial concentrations 2 10 fold depending on the compound specifics of the concentrations in each wwtp s effluents are gathered in supplementary information table s1 despite the partial decrease eight of the tested antimicrobials were still detectable in some of the effluent samples although only ciprofloxacin and azithromycin were above the pnec levels most of those compounds have not been commonly detected either in the upstream or downstream surface waters of the wwtps discharge points sabri et al 2018 verburg et al 2019 hence despite wwtps discharging antimicrobials into the receiving waterbodies the residues are diluted and or sorbed to sediment reducing their concentrations in the water stream below the limits of detection the compounds that sorbed to the biosolids line were found in both ds and as although with higher concentrations in the ds samples than in the as samples likely derived from the difference in the solids content of each type of sample ciprofloxacin was again the most common antibiotic residue 2 4 mg kg 1ts ofloxacin while barely detected in influent was often detected in the biosolids line but in lower quantities than ciprofloxacin in agreement with previous studies in europe lindberg et al 2005 radjenović et al 2009 in general the concentration of tetracyclines and sulfapyridine followed the trends observed elsewhere göbel et al 2005 lindberg et al 2005 shafrir and avisar 2012 tetracyclines were often detected in values ranging between 0 1 1 2 mg kg 1ts for both as and ds samples which is around 5 to 40 µg kg 1 of fresh digested sludge for tetracycline and doxycycline respectively concentrations of 15 µg l 1 of tetracycline 150 times below the minimum inhibitory concentrations have shown to enhance the growth of tet resistant bacteria gullberg et al 2014 and to stimulate horizontal gene transfer events in vitro jutkina et al 2016 although the bioavailability of these residues in the biosolids may reduce such an effect besides the aforementioned antimicrobial residues the two disinfectants tested were also highly sorbed onto sludge concentrations ranged between 1 14 mg kg 1 ts in cas like as samples and 3 23 mg kg 1 ts in ds samples the highest levels were reported for the as in the a stage of wwtp3 with up to 49 and 101 mg kg 1 ts for bac12 and bac14 respectively supplementary information figure s9 and table s4 these concentrations meet with literature reports martínez carballo et al 2007 and reflect the important accumulation of these compounds in the sludge a high occurrence of bacs has been shown to hamper methanogenesis in anaerobic digesters zhang et al 2015 moreover field amendments of bacs rich biosolids could result in the accumulation of these compounds especially in clay soils which could potentially lead to the selection of qac genes and co selection of args mulder et al 2018 3 2 4 the occurrence of resistance determinants in biosolids mirrored those in the influent the occurrence of the args in the biosolids line of the three wwtps reflected the patterns observed in the influent supplementary information figure s10 the highest concentrations were found for ermb and sul1 with 9 4 9 9 log copies g 1ts respectively fig 6 on the lower rank were once again qnrs and bla ctxm which often laid below the limit of detection or quantification up to 86 of some of the ds and ags samples contrarily a recent study analyzing a broad range of args suggested no contribution of influent args to the recycled activated sludge resistome which was richer in abundance but poorer in diversity when compared to the influent quintela baluja et al 2019 since mixed liquors and not sedimented sludge were used in our study a higher resemblance to influent args patterns can be expected our data also demonstrate a high occurrence of mge elements in the biosolid line particularly in the as systems where the korb gene was found in similar ranges than the integrase inti1 gene in contrast inti1 was 1 2 log more abundant than korb in influent samples the high prevalence of korb in the activated sludge might explain the poor removal of this gene and the subsequent equalization of inti1 and korb levels in the effluent incp 1 plasmids have been detected in biosolids of activated and digested sludge dröge et al 2000 however to the best of our knowledge this is the first time incp 1 plasmids have been quantified in activated sludge samples showing a high occurrence which confirm their relevance in studies addressing horizontal gene transfer events in biosolids like systems neither the flow nor the seasonal temperature seemed to homogenously alter the concentration of genes in the cas like activated sludge systems supplementary information table s3 figure s11 even though some trends could be observed across plants with increasing temperatures the effect varied per studied gene i e a decrease of ermb and tetm and an increase of qnrs absolute concentrations overall there was a modest variation of concentrations of arg in biosolids between wwtps roughly 0 5 logs and across the year however the absolute abundance of most of the genes was greater in as than ds the same effect was observed for the e coli concentrations supplementary information figure s5 table s5 lower absolute concentrations of args mges and e coli were also observed among ags in contrast to the as from the b stage which is comparable to a conventional activated sludge system these differences are likely due to normalization per gram of ts which is roughly 10 fold higher in the ds and ags samples compared to as ones when normalized to the 16s rrna supplementary information figure s12 the relative concentration of several of the args and mges in biosolids was similar among the aforementioned pairs as vs ds and ags vs as from the b stage only a slightly lower relative concentration of ermb was observed in ags a lower adhesion of bacteria harboring ermb gene to the granular sludge fraction could explain its poorer removal after ags treatment in comparison with the ab line consistently higher relative concentrations of args in as a stage were observed in comparison to as from b stage and another flocculent as from wwtp1 and wwtp2 and ags figure s12 this difference could be due to the operational conditions of a stage where the solids retention time is significantly shorter 0 3 days than that used for b stage 23 days and another conventional flocculent as systems 15 20 days or ags 30 days barrios hernández et al 2020 de graaff et al 2016 shorter solids retention time most likely limits the natural decay of incoming antibiotic resistant bacteria by out competition of indigenous sludge microbiota and protozoa predation a persistent higher concentration of tetm gene after the anaerobic digestion was observed when compared with as samples for both absolute and relative abundances figure s12 this suggests that the anaerobic treatment might select for bacteria harboring this gene as aforementioned the concentrations of tetracycline residues in digested sludge might also contribute to the selection of tet genes although similar effects were not found for quinolone resistance a slight enrichment of the relative abundance after anaerobic digestion was also observed for ermb figure s9 these findings are in accordance with the results of ma et al 2011 in bench scale mesophilic digesters where they even observed an increase in the absolute abundance of erm genes and some of the tested tet genes in contrast inti1 and sul genes decreased in both relative and absolute abundance an increase of several args including erm tet and sul genes was also observed in two full scale anaerobic digestors in china tong et al 2019 while in another full scale study in the us the relative abundance of three tet genes varied depending on the sampling dates ghosh et al 2009 digested sludge is used in some countries as fertilizer for crops the impact of pathogens and args from sludge amendments in soil is still under debate rahube et al 2014 rutgersson et al 2020 in the netherlands digested sludge undergoes incineration however there is a growing interest in nutrient recovery from this byproduct therefore increasing the knowledge of possible hazards in the handling and downstream processing of digested sludge is important 3 3 depicting sampling strategies if the results obtained in this studied are compared with those of our previous work sampling multiple wwtps but on a single occasion the former managed to capture similar variability in args occurrence and removal as in repeated sampling across one year supplementary information figure s13 thus shorter sampling efforts might be enough to evaluate the removal abilities of a wwtp if the objective is to evaluate variability in performance and address possible solutions rainy and dry periods might be more interesting to assess than seasons in the absence of molecular methodology or the need for rapid results the use of bacterial surrogates to evaluate the fate of args might be necessary correlation analysis pearson s correlations highlighted that e coli should not be used to evaluate the variation in incoming concentrations of args but could be considered as a surrogate to evaluate the removal of specific args such as blactx m ermb and tetm supplementary information figures s14 s16 commonly associated to enterobacteriaceae and lactobacillae these taxa follow e coli removal patterns during wastewater treatment barrios hernández et al 2020 ferreira da silva et al 2007 ottoson et al 2006 4 conclusions a one year sampling campaign of three full scale wwtps highlighted that warmer seasonal temperature marginally decreased the concentrations of resistance genes in the influent but increased those of e coli however seasonal temperature variation had an impaired effect on concentrations of antimicrobials in the influent instead rainfall played a major role by diluting the concentrations of antimicrobials as well as fecal indicators such as e coli but not of resistance genes rainfall increasing the typical hydraulic load of each wwtps significantly reduced the efficiency of wastewater treatment removal of genes and e coli in agreement with previous findings across the netherlands increasing effluent s turbidity was also related to slightly poorer removal in addition we concluded that the occurrence of resistant determinants in the biosolids line followed the occurrence patterns in the influent and that incp 1 plasmids are highly abundant in biosolids finally full scale

1 mm column with 1 8 µm particle size detailed information about the mobile phases and data analyses can be found in tables b1 b2 b3 b4 the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of the method were determined for each compound as the lowest detectable amount of compound with a signal to noise ratio of 3 and 10 respectively the recovery rates for each compound in each sample were calculated from the spiked samples the samples values were then recalculated by multiplying each result by the corresponding recovery only if this was among 50 150 when the recovery value was below or above the aforementioned threshold the sample was excluded for the disinfectant residues bac12 and bac14 the recoveries were not applied as the concentrations already present in the samples were 10 30

linear models and mixed models were conducted in r 3 6 5 r core team 2018 and rstudio http www rstudio com with the packages stats lmer and lmertest bates et al 2016 kuznetsova et al 2017 only for the statistical analysis the final effluent samples having blactx m values below the loq were replaced by the loq value 6 out of 36 values all other genes were above the loq in all samples before the removal was calculated for the comparison analysis of single gene occurrences in influent or the comparison of single genes and e coli removal performance across all three wwtps or across the two parallel lines of wwtp3 and its final effluent an analysis of the variance was used when normality was met followed by tukey post hoc analysis the comparisons were made using the log concentrations of genes ml 1 or the log transformed removal values respectively if the distribution did not meet the normality the group comparison was performed with non parametric test kruskal wallis the influence of abiotic factors in the incoming and removal of antimicrobials genes and e coli as well as the role of intermediate steps in the removal of genes were analyzed by linear models and linear mixed models the summary of the models is displayed in table c1 and the construction of the models is described below to evaluate the contribution of either the overall treatment or the intermediate steps primary treatment in wwtp2 or a stage in the ab line of wwtp3 to the removal of genes determinants and e coli linear mixed models were used with observations clustered by sampling time point the log transformed concentrations log10 of gene copies of args mges and e coli log10 cfu counts per ml from each sample type were used as the response variable the explanatory variables tested in the mixed model were sample type fixed term representing the location of the sample within the wwtp and the gene type only in the gene models wwtp and sample code month as independent random terms random intercept modelled the latter allowed the model to account for paired measurements from the same month of influent in and final effluent fe primary treatment pt or a stage ast the result of these models are coefficients describing the gene reduction per location and differences in gene concentrations per wwtp across all resistance genes or e coli and sampling time point for single plants similar linear mixed models or linear models as for e coli were also used to investigate the influence of additional explanatory factors sampling parameters on the removal of either args and mges or e coli cfu counts in this case the response variable was the removal value calculated as the log10 of the ratio of the concentration of genes or cfu counts in the influent versus the final effluent the explanatory variables fixed terms were the wwtp the average temperature the turbidity as a surrogate for tss presence in effluent and the hydraulic load factor hlf the random terms were the gene type only in the gene model and the sample code month that allowed grouping all the genes from the same wwtp and sampling time point for e coli only one explained variable cfu counts was available and thus neither gene type nor sample code month random terms were applicable the inclusion of wwtp as fixed term lead to singular fit problem thus for e coli a linear model was used instead the role of explanatory factors for the concentrations of resistance genes and e coli in influent was also investigated through linear mixed models the response variable was the log10 transformed influent concentration per ml of either args and mges gene copies or cfu counts in addition the load pe or absolute daily amount of resistance genes and cfu per population equivalent was used as a response variable the load was obtained from multiplying influent concentrations with the flow on the measurement day thereby correcting for increased treatment volumes last the load was normalized per population equivalent pe load pe where 1 pe stands for 150 g of total oxygen demand and used as a response variable log10 transformed the average atmospheric temperature and hlf from the day of sampling were used as the fixed term explanatory variables again gene type only in the gene models and sample code month were used as the random terms whilst hlf and temperature were used as fixed effects the same explanatory factors were also modelled against the concentration of genes in the biosolids by using a similar approach than for the influent models but with the log10 transformed concentration of genes args and mges or cfus per g of ts as a response variable due to high percentage of missing values qnrs and bla ctx m genes were not included in the model finally a linear mixed model was used to address the effect of both temperature and hlf in the incoming concentrations of antimicrobials commonly found in influent azithromycin clarithromycin ciprofloxacin sulfamethoxazole sulpyridine trimethoprim doxycycline tetracycline and clindamycin missing values were replaced by lod 2 of each compound the response variable was the concentration of antimicrobial in µg l 1 and the explanatory variables were the hlf and temperature in the fixed terms and antimicrobial type to group for each type of antibiotic and sample code month in the random terms to account for samples from the same location and sampling time point after analysis the model was considered to not being well fitted according to the optical inspection of residuals and thus results of this model are not further included in the results and discussion section in the linear mixed models with several explanatory variables the relevance of the explanatory variables was determined through stepwise backward model reduction and the quality of the models was assessed by visual inspection of the normality of the residuals the datasets used in this study are available in mendeley data repository doi 10 17632

17303,supercritical co2 sco2 displaces water from wastewater alum and papermill sludge the sco2 appears to enter the sludge matrix through viscous fingering through the entrained water because the water removed far exceeds the solubility of water in sco2 it must be displaced by the sco2 rather than dissolved out adding a small amount of soap to the sludge converts some of the bound water into free water which can then be displaced by sco2 application of the sco2 in multiple stages greatly enhances dewatering as compared to a single stage process approximately 70 70 and 85 of the initial water can be removed from alum wastewater and paper sludges respectively through a five stage process staged application of sco2 doubles the efficiency of water removal over a single stage process of the same duration it is proposed that when the sco2 entrained in the sludge is decompressed between stages some of the water is explosively displaced by the expanding co2 graphical abstrract image

from the finding that the water concentration in sco2 is about three times higher than its solubility limit this work is a part of a series of sco2 applications sponsored by the office of fossil energy at the us department of energy the direct fired oxy fuel combustion for sco2 power cycles is a project in development a by product of the power cycle is high purity sco2 that can be used in other applications such as enhanced oil recovery from depleted fields asme 2017 this paper explores another opportunity where sco2 from power plants and other sources can be potentially used to dewater alum wastewater and paper sludges 2 materials and methods alum sludge ph 6 55 was obtained from the opeleika al water treatment facility wastewater sludge was collected from the opelika al waste water treatment plant and paper sludge was provided by the westrock mill at mahrt al the paper sludge was a 7 3 mix of fibrous biological sludge and was treated with nalco optimer 7196 polymer at 7 4 kg dry tonne the solids contents mc of the alum wastewater and paper sludges were 4 7 and 36 respectively the alum and wastewater sludges were brought to a solids content of about 15 20 by drying at 104 c this range of solids corresponds to the typical water content of commercially dewatered sludge the paper sludge was belt pressed at the mill and was used as received the soap used was ajax dishwashing soap 10 solids a commercial soap was used to demonstrate the versatility of the process fundamental studies of surfactants with well characterized properties have already been reported huang et al 2002 samples 4 8 g were extracted with sco2 with an oco labs super c unit as described earlier banerjee et al 2021 co2 is a supercritical fluid above its critical point of 31 1 c and 7 39 mpa sludge was placed in the extraction chamber and then exposed to sco2 at various combinations of pressure temperature and time the sco2 wood mass ratio was obtained by calculating the volume of dry sludge from its specific gravity the solids specific gravities of the alum wastewater and paper sludges were taken as 2 66 awab et al 2012 1 64 hartman et al 2007 and 1 4 mavroulidou et al 2019 engineeringtoolbox 2009 respectively the corresponding volume was subtracted from the reactor volume of 120 ml the remaining reactor volume was occupied by sco2 whose density and mass were determined from the equation of state of span and wagner 1996 the results were insensitive to sludge density because the sludge volume was about tenfold lower than that of sco2 the moisture content of each sample before and after sco2 extraction was determined after drying overnight at 104 c all measurements were made at least in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 alum sludge wet alum sludge makes up to 5 of the total quantity of processed water kluczka et al 2017 common dewatering strategies include the use of drying lagoons or beds in plants where space is limited centrifuges or belt presses are often employed turner et al 2019 this sludge is notoriously difficult to dewater as the water is predominantly bound and resists displacement wu et al 1998 typical solids contents after gravity dewatering and centrifugation are about 7 and 23 respectively wu et al 1997 higher solids are desirable for reducing landfilling costs and for re use of the sludge zhao et al 2015 dassanayake et al 2015 the effect of pressure on the degree of dewatering at 20 and 60 minute exposure periods is illustrated in fig 1 as the mole fraction concentration of water in the spent sco2 xwater sco2 vs pressure the solubility limit of water in sco2 is shown as the red curve as expected longer exposure increases the amount of water removed at high pressure 24 mpa xwater sco2 is lower than the solubility limit and the water is likely dissolved out by the sco2 however the values above the solubility curve shown in red in fig 1 exceed the solubility limit which must mean that a part of the water must be displaced out by sco2 this type of behavior has been noted earlier for coal banerjee et al 2021 and wood aggarwal et al 2019 varying temperature between 60 and 85 c at 20 mpa had only a minor effect on the water expelled from sludge the results varied by only 20 this behavior corresponds to our earlier work with coal banerjee et al 2021 and wood aggarwal et al 2019 where a similar insensitivity was observed a possible mechanism for the displacement that involves viscous fingering berg and ott 2012 follows from our previous work on coal when two liquids are in contact in a porous matrix instability can occur if the viscosities of the two liquids are different as in the present case with sco2 and water a small perturbation at the interface gradually grows because it reduces the local hydraulic resistance because the displacing liquid sco2 is more mobile than water elongated co2 profiles fingers are created in the water body homsy the phenomenon is also known as saffman taylor instability the width of the finger is governed by the competition between viscous and capillary forces viscous forces tend to narrow the finger whereas capillary forces tend to widen it chevalier et al 2006 the process derives from d arcy s law which for one dimensional steady flow can be written as dp dx μ u k δ ρ g where p x µ u k and ρ represent pressure length viscosity velocity permeability and specific gravity respectively homsy 1987 it follows that δ p p sco 2 p water μ water μ sco 2 u k δ x consider the displacement of water by sco2 an immiscible liquid of much lower viscosity if δp is positive then a small change in δp will amplify to a much larger change in δx because µwater µsco2 10 the degree of fingering depends on pore size and gradient rabbani et al 2018 the root cause is that the less viscous fluid sco2 has greater mobility which can displace some of the water because sco2 viscosity decreases with decreasing pressure heidaryan et al 2011 µwater µsco2 will be greater at lower pressure and lead to an increase in δx in other words decreasing pressure will promote water displacement as observed in fig 1 3 2 wastewater sludge the annual tonnage produced in the us approximates 13 mt y on a dry basis seiple et al 2017 so dewatering costs are considerable the effect of pressure on the degree of dewatering at 20 and 60 minute exposure periods is illustrated in fig 2 the values in fig 2 are all higher than the water solubility curve of sco2 which contrasts with the situation in fig 1 correspondingly much more water is removed from the wastewater sludge as shown in fig 2 than that from alum sludge in fig 1 probably because the higher free water content of wastewater sludge enables better displacement dewatering 3 3 paper sludge us production of pulp and paper sludge exceeds a million tons per year sima et al 2018 the nature of the sludge is quite variable e g recycle sludge has a high ash content whereas pulp mill sludge is mainly fibrous a belt pressed pulp mill sludge from a linerboard mill was used in this study this sludge was a combination of 70 primary mainly fiber and 30 biosludge the concentration of water in co2 both dissolved and suspended for paper sludge after extraction at 70 c for 20 minutes at 10 34 mpa is compared to corresponding values for the other sludges in table 1 much more water is expressed from the paper sludge because it is less gelatinous and therefore more structured which facilitates the release of water the bound water content of paper sludge is also much lower 3 4 effect of soap on dewatering huang et al 2002 studied the effect of cationic and anionic surfactants on dewatering alum sludge both additives increased the rate of dewatering and decreased the bound water content however more water was inexplicably retained in the sludge cake so the surfactants had an adverse effect on the pressed cake solids huang et al 2002 proposed that the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the solids and displaced the bound water the decrease in bound water must lead to an increase in free water which in our case could then be potentially displaced by sco2 as discussed above a commercial soap formulation was used to demonstrate the versatility of the process and to minimize cost in cost benefit calculations the presence of soap increased xwater co2 to 0 071 0 01 which corresponds to a decrease in wet basis moisture content from 85 to 78 the value was independent of the amount of soap added at 0 7 2 of sludge solids which implies that a lower soap level could have sufficed also in contrast to the results in figs 1 and 2 20 and 60 minute exposure provided the same value of xwater co2 an illustration of the sco2 treated alum sludge with and without soap is provided in fig 3 the surface of the soap treated sludge is less reflective in keeping with its lower moisture content it seems likely that the bound to free water conversion proposed by huang also occurs with commercial soap but while the free water generated in huang s experiments could not be pressed out the sco2 displaces the water quite easily it is likely that the soap attaches to the alum surface and displaces water 3 5 effect of staged dewatering from a practical standpoint the decrease in moisture content in the results described above from about 85 to about 78 is not large enough to justify commercial interest however a major increase in the degree of dewatering can be achieved by conducting the extraction in stages in a typical experiment an extraction was conducted at 70 c and at 10 3 mpa for 20 minutes extractions were then carried out under the same conditions for up to four subsequent stages with the sco2 being decompressed and released between stages for example for a two stage process the sludge was extracted for 20 minutes the sco2 was vented and the sludge was re extracted with fresh sco2 for another 20 minutes the total amount of water removed after each stage is illustrated for all three sludges in fig 4 the three curves in fig 4 are similar in shape which suggests that the same mechanism of water removal applies to all three sludges which are very different in nature hence differences in pore size do not appear to be important as expected based on the tendency of the sludge to hold water the paper sludge dewatered the most and alum sludge the least the water removed in the middle stages is higher than that released in the first stage or in later stages for example for wastewater sludge the first stage removes 10 8 of the total water whereas 25 of the water is expelled between stages 2 and 3 only 7 5 of the water is released at the final stage the other sludges exhibit similar behavior staged dewatering almost doubles the amount of water removed vis à vis a single stage process the amount of water removed from alum sludge in a single stage 60 minute process is 30 of the initial water content the corresponding value for a three stage process with 20 minutes per stage is 58 we propose the following mechanism during the first stage the sco2 only penetrates the sludge cake to a small extent consequently only the water in the outer layer of sludge is displaced through a combination of dissolution and viscous fingering as discussed above the void volume of the sludge increases as a result of the initial displacement the sco2 in stages 2 and 3 is able to penetrate deeper into the sludge matrix and some of the water is blown out during decompression this phenomenon is analogous to impulse drying where a pulse of pressurized steam can expel water in liquid form from wet paper larsson and orloff 2006 and sludge banerjee et al 1998 mats here the mat of paper or sludge is passed through a nip with a heated top roll the water at the roll mat interface evaporates to steam and the resulting pressure forces some of the entrained water out of the mat in liquid form thereby conserving the energy of evaporation multiple nips can also be used and additional water is expressed at each nip banerjee 2001 which is analogous to the behavior observed here for multi stage dewatering where water removal in the two final stages is lower the likely reason in both cases is that the free water content of the sludge decreases at each stage during impulse drying of paper a pressure of 8 mpa is generated in the sheet larsson and orloff 2006 for sludge the peak pressure was 10 mpa banerjee 2001 which is similar to the pressures reported in figs 1 and 2 hence there is a close analogy between the impulse and sco2 processes where water is expressed because of internal pressure build up in the sludge body the explosive nature of the process is evident in the impulse application where delamination of the sludge is clearly visible the effect of soap and multi stage dewatering is not additive the amount of water removed after the second stage is the same with or without soap because the effect of multi stage dewatering is large enough to make the benefit of soap less pronounced support for explosive dewatering during sco2 decompression is found in figs 1 and 2 where the 60 minute curves are steeper than their corresponding 20 minute counterparts the sco2 moves further into the water contained in the sludge over 60 minutes than it does over 20 minutes because the volume displaced is proportional to the cube of the effective radius the water released over 60 minutes is disproportionately higher than that over 20 minutes a possible scheme for dewatering sludge is illustrated in fig 5 in the first stage the sludge is contacted with sco2 for a specified period the pressure is released and the water separated from the expanded co2 the co2 is recovered chilled compressed and returned to the extractor for the second stage reuse of the co2 reduces both capital and operational costs 3 6 cost benefits drawbacks of sco2 dewatering are that it must be operated in a batch continuous mode and that it is relatively slow compared to conventional thermal processes its use must therefore be justified by compensating energy savings for applications where the co2 must be purchased it will need to be recycled through the sludge as shown in fig 5 the recovery rate from such recycling is over 95 however there are several applications where pure co2 is vented as waste e g from lime kilns in paper mills corn ethanol plants and from sco2 power cycles as noted in section 1 a significant credit is the avoided co2 emissions that would result from thermal drying with natural gas the cost of dewatering can also be potentially offset by the calorific value of the dried sludge which corresponds to that of brown coal römer 1991 studies on increasing throughput are currently underway 4 conclusions our major conclusions are as follows sco2 displaces water from alum wastewater and paper sludges soap increases the amount of water displaced by converting some of the bound water into free water however the benefit is smaller than that obtained with multi stage dewatering multistage sco2 dewatering where the sco2 is depressurized and released between stages greatly increases the degree of dewatering with 70 of the initial water being released over five stages it is proposed that the expanding co2 blows out the water during decompression declaration of competing interest none

other applications such as enhanced oil recovery from depleted fields asme 2017 this paper explores another opportunity where sco2 from power plants and other sources can be potentially used to dewater alum wastewater and paper sludges 2 materials and methods alum sludge ph 6 55 was obtained from the opeleika al water treatment facility wastewater sludge was collected from the opelika al waste water treatment plant and paper sludge was provided by the westrock mill at mahrt al the paper sludge was a 7 3 mix of fibrous biological sludge and was treated with nalco optimer 7196 polymer at 7 4 kg dry tonne the solids contents mc of the alum wastewater and paper sludges were 4 7 and 36 respectively the alum and wastewater sludges were brought to a solids content of about 15 20 by drying at 104 c this range of solids corresponds to the typical water content of commercially dewatered sludge the paper sludge was belt pressed at the mill and was used as received the soap used was ajax dishwashing soap 10 solids a commercial soap was used to demonstrate the versatility of the process fundamental studies of surfactants with well characterized properties have already been reported huang et al 2002 samples 4 8 g were extracted with sco2 with an oco labs super c unit as described earlier banerjee et al 2021 co2 is a supercritical fluid above its critical point of 31 1 c and 7 39 mpa sludge was placed in the extraction chamber and then exposed to sco2 at various combinations of pressure temperature and time the sco2 wood mass ratio was obtained by calculating the volume of dry sludge from its specific gravity the solids specific gravities of the alum wastewater and paper sludges were taken as 2 66 awab et al 2012 1 64 hartman et al 2007 and 1 4 mavroulidou et al 2019 engineeringtoolbox 2009 respectively the corresponding volume was subtracted from the reactor volume of 120 ml the remaining reactor volume was occupied by sco2 whose density and mass were determined from the equation of state of span and wagner 1996 the results were insensitive to sludge density because the sludge volume was about tenfold lower than that of sco2 the moisture content of each sample before and after sco2 extraction was determined after drying overnight at 104 c all measurements were made at least in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 alum sludge wet alum sludge makes up to 5 of the total quantity of processed water kluczka et al 2017 common dewatering strategies include the use of drying lagoons or beds in plants where space is limited centrifuges or belt presses are often employed turner et al 2019 this sludge is notoriously difficult to dewater as the water is predominantly bound and resists displacement wu et al 1998 typical solids contents after gravity dewatering and centrifugation are about 7 and 23 respectively wu et al 1997 higher solids are desirable for reducing landfilling costs and for re use of the sludge zhao et al 2015 dassanayake et al 2015 the effect of pressure on the degree of dewatering at 20 and 60 minute exposure periods is illustrated in fig 1 as the mole fraction concentration of water in the spent sco2 xwater sco2 vs pressure the solubility limit of water in sco2 is shown as the red curve as expected longer exposure increases the amount of water removed at high pressure 24 mpa xwater sco2 is lower than the solubility limit and the water is likely dissolved out by the sco2 however the values above the solubility curve shown in red in fig 1 exceed the solubility limit which must mean that a part of the water must be displaced out by sco2 this type of behavior has been noted earlier for coal banerjee et al 2021 and wood aggarwal et al 2019 varying temperature between 60 and 85 c at 20 mpa had only a minor effect on the water expelled from sludge the results varied by only 20 this behavior corresponds to our earlier work with coal banerjee et al 2021 and wood aggarwal et al 2019 where a similar insensitivity was observed a possible mechanism for the displacement that involves viscous fingering berg and ott 2012 follows from our previous work on coal when two liquids are in contact in a porous matrix instability can occur if the viscosities of the two liquids are different as in the present case with sco2 and water a small perturbation at the interface gradually grows because it reduces the local hydraulic resistance because the displacing liquid sco2 is more mobile than water elongated co2 profiles fingers are created in the water body homsy the phenomenon is also known as saffman taylor instability the width of the finger is governed by the competition between viscous and capillary forces viscous forces tend to narrow the finger whereas capillary forces tend to widen it chevalier et al 2006 the process derives from d arcy s law which for one dimensional steady flow can be written as dp dx μ u k δ ρ g where p x µ u k and ρ represent pressure length viscosity velocity permeability and specific gravity respectively homsy 1987 it follows that δ p p sco 2 p water μ water μ sco 2 u k δ x consider the displacement of water by sco2 an immiscible liquid of much lower viscosity if δp is positive then a small change in δp will amplify to a much larger change in δx because µwater µsco2 10 the degree of fingering depends on pore size and gradient rabbani et al 2018 the root cause is that the less viscous fluid sco2 has greater mobility which can displace some of the water because sco2 viscosity decreases with decreasing pressure heidaryan et al 2011 µwater µsco2 will be greater at lower pressure and lead to an increase in δx in other words decreasing pressure will promote water displacement as observed in fig 1 3 2 wastewater sludge the annual tonnage produced in the us approximates 13 mt y on a dry basis seiple et al 2017 so dewatering costs are considerable the effect of pressure on the degree of dewatering at 20 and 60 minute exposure periods is illustrated in fig 2 the values in fig 2 are all higher than the water solubility curve of sco2 which contrasts with the situation in fig 1 correspondingly much more water is removed from the wastewater sludge as shown in fig 2 than that from alum sludge in fig 1 probably because the higher free water content of wastewater sludge enables better displacement dewatering 3 3 paper sludge us production of pulp and paper sludge exceeds a million tons per year sima et al 2018 the nature of the sludge is quite variable e g recycle sludge has a high ash content whereas pulp mill sludge is mainly fibrous a belt pressed pulp mill sludge from a linerboard mill was used in this study this sludge was a combination of 70 primary mainly fiber and 30 biosludge the concentration of water in co2 both dissolved and suspended for paper sludge after extraction at 70 c for 20 minutes at 10 34 mpa is compared to corresponding values for the other sludges in table 1 much more water is expressed from the paper sludge because it is less gelatinous and therefore more structured which facilitates the release of water the bound water content of paper sludge is also much lower 3 4 effect of soap on dewatering huang et al 2002 studied the effect of cationic and anionic surfactants on dewatering alum sludge both additives increased the rate of dewatering and decreased the bound water content however more water was inexplicably retained in the sludge cake so the surfactants had an adverse effect on the pressed cake solids huang et al 2002 proposed that the surfactant adsorbed on the surface of the solids and displaced the bound water the decrease in bound water must lead to an increase in free water which in our case could then be potentially displaced by sco2 as discussed above a commercial soap formulation was used to demonstrate the versatility of the process and to minimize cost in cost benefit calculations the presence of soap increased xwater co2 to 0 071 0 01 which corresponds to a decrease in wet basis moisture content from 85 to 78 the value was independent of the amount of soap added at 0 7 2 of sludge solids which implies that a lower soap level could have sufficed also in contrast to the results in figs 1 and 2 20 and 60 minute exposure provided the same value of xwater co2 an illustration of the sco2 treated alum sludge with and without soap is provided in fig 3 the surface of the soap treated sludge is less reflective in keeping with its lower moisture content it seems likely that the bound to free water conversion proposed by huang also occurs with commercial soap but while the free water generated in huang s experiments could not be pressed out the sco2 displaces the water quite easily it is likely that the soap attaches to the alum surface and displaces water 3 5 effect of staged dewatering from a practical standpoint the decrease in moisture content in the results described above from about 85 to about 78 is not large enough to justify commercial interest however a major increase in the degree of dewatering can be achieved by conducting the extraction in stages in a typical experiment an extraction was conducted at 70 c and at 10 3 mpa for 20 minutes extractions were then carried out under the same conditions for up to four subsequent stages with the sco2 being decompressed and released between stages for example for a two stage process the sludge was extracted for 20 minutes the sco2 was vented and the sludge was re extracted with fresh sco2 for another 20 minutes the total amount of water removed after each stage is illustrated for all three sludges in fig 4 the three curves in fig 4 are similar in shape which suggests that the same mechanism of water removal applies to all three sludges which are very different in nature hence differences in pore size do not appear to be important as expected based on the tendency of the sludge to hold water the paper sludge dewatered the most and alum sludge the least the water removed in the middle stages is higher than that released in the first stage or in later stages for example for wastewater sludge the first stage removes 10 8 of the total water whereas 25 of the water is expelled between stages 2 and 3 only 7 5 of the water is released at the final stage the other sludges exhibit similar behavior staged dewatering almost doubles the amount of water removed vis à vis a single stage process the amount of water removed from alum sludge in a single stage 60 minute process is 30 of the initial water content the corresponding value for a three stage process with 20 minutes per stage is 58 we propose the following mechanism during the first stage the sco2 only penetrates the sludge cake to a small extent consequently only the water in the outer layer of sludge is displaced through a combination of dissolution and viscous fingering as discussed above the void volume of the sludge increases as a result of the initial displacement the sco2 in stages 2 and 3 is able to penetrate deeper into the sludge matrix and some of the water is blown out during decompression this phenomenon is analogous to impulse drying where a pulse of pressurized steam can expel water in liquid form from wet paper larsson and orloff 2006 and sludge banerjee et al 1998 mats here the mat of paper or sludge is passed through a nip with a heated top roll the water at the roll mat interface evaporates to steam and the resulting pressure forces some of the entrained water out of the mat in liquid form thereby conserving the energy of evaporation multiple nips can also be used and additional water is expressed at each nip banerjee 2001 which is analogous to the behavior observed here for multi stage dewatering where water removal in the two final stages is lower the likely reason in both cases is that the free water content of the sludge decreases at each stage during impulse drying of paper a pressure of 8 mpa is generated in the sheet larsson and orloff 2006 for sludge the peak pressure was 10 mpa banerjee 2001 which is similar to the pressures reported in figs 1 and 2 hence there is a close analogy between the impulse and sco2 processes where water is expressed because of internal pressure build up in the sludge body the explosive nature of the process is evident in the impulse application where delamination of the sludge is clearly visible the effect of soap and multi stage dewatering is not additive the amount of water removed after the second stage is the same with or without soap because the effect of multi stage dewatering is large enough to make the benefit of soap less pronounced support for explosive dewatering during sco2 decompression is found in figs 1 and 2 where the 60 minute curves are steeper than their corresponding 20 minute counterparts the sco2 moves further into the water contained in the sludge over 60 minutes than it does over 20 minutes because the volume displaced is proportional to the cube of the effective radius the water released over 60 minutes is disproportionately higher than that over 20 minutes a possible scheme for dewatering sludge is illustrated in fig 5 in the first stage the sludge is contacted with sco2 for a specified period the pressure is released and the water separated from the expanded co2 the co2 is recovered chilled compressed and returned to the extractor for the second stage reuse of the co2 reduces both capital and operational costs 3 6 cost benefits drawbacks of sco2 dewatering are that it must be operated in a batch continuous mode and that it is relatively slow compared to conventional thermal processes its use must therefore be justified by compensating energy savings for applications where the co2 must be purchased it will need to be recycled through the sludge as shown in fig 5 the recovery rate from such recycling is over 95 however there are several applications where pure co2 is vented as waste e g from lime kilns in paper mills corn ethanol plants and from sco2 power cycles as noted in section 1 a significant credit is the avoided co2 emissions that would result from thermal drying with natural gas the cost of dewatering can also be potentially offset by the calorific value of the dried sludge which corresponds to that of brown coal römer 1991 studies on increasing throughput are currently underway 4 conclusions our major conclusions are as follows sco2 displaces water from alum wastewater and paper sludges soap increases the amount of water displaced by converting some of the bound water into free water however the benefit is smaller than that obtained with multi stage dewatering multistage sco2 dewatering where the sco2 is depressurized and released between stages greatly increases the degree of dewatering with 70 of the initial water being released over five stages it is proposed that the expanding co2 blows out the water during decompression declaration of competing interest none

17304,a one year study was carried out in león spain in order to characterize physically and chemically the precipitation with the aim of studying the scavenging process of atmospheric pollutants scavenging ratio and removal coefficients were calculated through physical parameters of raindrops obtained by disdrometer data and through chemical properties of aerosols finally linear models for the prediction of the chemical composition of rainwater and the efficiency of the removal effect were established in general the rainwater was dominated by nh4 so4 2 no3 in all seasons higher ion concentrations and conductivity and lowest ph were observed in summer due to the low volume of rain in winter the high values of na and cl in the rainwater showed the contribution from marine sources while in summer the high concentrations of ca2 mg2 so4 2 nh4 and no3 reflected the contribution from both crustal and anthropogenic sources the linear models revealed that the amount of dissolved organic carbon and of the water soluble ions in rain samples ca2 so4 2 no3 increases with the volume swept by the falling drops insoluble carbon fraction has a negative dependence with the volume swept and positive with the diameter of the raindrop removal coefficients are affected by the concentration in the air of each species before precipitation the duration of the event and the time elapsed between two precipitation events graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords aerosol disdrometer linear model removal coefficients precipitation 1 introduction over years several authors have highlighted the negative impact of air pollutants on human health and the environment bernstein et al 2004 kampa and castanas 2008 ren jian et al 2012 especially in megacities lelieveld et al 2015 mage et al 1996 naddafi et al 2012 atmospheric wet deposition plays a crucial role in mitigating these negative effects as it acts directly on the removal and transport of different pollutants and soluble gases from the atmosphere to the earth s surface keresztesi et al 2017 seinfeld and pandis 2016 through two main processes in cloud and below cloud scavenging below cloud scavenging depends on the characteristics of rainfall raindrop size distribution and rainfall rate and on the local regional concentration of the particles and gases in the atmosphere and in cloud processes involve both the condensation of water vapor onto aerosols and the incorporation of gases by reactions in the aqueous phase celle jeanton et al 2009 xu et al 2017 the study of the chemical properties of rainwater and of the concentration and composition of the aerosol provides useful information on the emissions of pollutants since it helps to identify the possible sources that contribute to rainwater chemistry local and regional dispersion of pollutants and their impact on the ecosystem martins et al 2019 sanets and chuduk 2005 zhang et al 2007 the composition of rainwater depends on several factors such as the local and long range emissions sources geography and meteorological conditions alastuey et al 1999 calvo et al 2012 jain et al 2019 knote et al 2015 mori et al 2014 the scavenging process of different species is affected by the intensity and volume of precipitation calvo et al 2012 custódio et al 2014 luan et al 2019 pan and wang 2015 uchiyama et al 2017 however there are many other parameters involved in this process such as concentration size distribution and composition of atmospheric aerosol and raindrop size distribution blanco alegre et al 2019 2018 fredericks and saylor 2019 zikova and zdimal 2016 in recent years several authors have proposed different models to explain the removal process of aerosols by rain for example olszowski and ziembik 2018 presented a linear model for the reduction of pm10 mass concentrations which includes the type of precipitation and the water vapor content in air moreover roy et al 2019 proposed a linear model to predict the aerosol scavenging based on the influence of rain rate and duration in previous studies carried out in león spain the influence of the physical characteristics of precipitation on the total concentration of particles castro et al 2010 and on the removal of black carbon blanco alegre et al 2019 have already been reported however studies integrating the chemical properties of aerosol and precipitation and the physical properties of precipitation are scarce underestimating the potential synergies between them studies involving the physical chemical parameters of precipitation can provide valuable information to deepen the understanding of the process of aerosol removal by rainfall the hypothesis that supports our study is that the scavenging of aerosols is a function of the chemical properties of the aerosol and the physical characteristics of rain in order to verify such hypothesis a one year sampling campaign of aerosols and precipitation was carried out in león nw spain with the aim of i studying the chemical and physical characteristics of precipitation and identifying the main weather types associated with them ii studying the influence of the aerosol chemical composition and the physical characteristics of precipitation on the removal processes through the scavenging ratio and removal coefficients and iii establishing several linear models to explain the removal process of the different chemical species in the air from the physical properties of rainwater and aerosol chemical composition 2 experimental 2 1 sampling site the sampling

raindrop size spectrum was obtained with a laser disdrometer laser precipitation monitor lpm of thies clima which registered drops between 0 125 and 8 mm in 22 drop size ranges on a 1 minute basis fernández raga et al 2009 the lpm was operational throughout the entire campaign thus when a precipitation event occurred the raindrop characteristics were recorded during the entire event the lpm was placed 3 m far from the rain collector and close to the aerosol samplers all of them on the same terrace of the faculty of veterinary sciences of the university of león as a consequence the characteristics of rainwater are supposed to be similar at all installed sampling equipment from the data provided by the lpm the following rainfall variables were obtained precipitation intensity

ratio between the same elements but considering the concentrations in the seawater or crustal material keene et al 1986 zhang et al 2007 in order to determine the best seawater tracer the mg2 na ratio

µg m 3 of the same species in the aerosol samples during the precipitation event ρair and ρw are the densities of air 1 29 109 μg m 3 and water 106 mg l 1 respectively at 20 c and 1 atm following blanco alegre et al 2019 cugerone et al 2018 for the determination of w the following considerations were taken into account a only events in which the rainfall duration covered more than 15 of the 24 hours of sampling were considered corresponding to an approximate period of half the mean duration of rain events b rain events with a variation in wind speed greater than 2 m s 1 were excluded from the sample c because aerosol samples were collected at 24 h intervals it is assumed that the rainwater samples are representative of this sampling period 2 2 9 removal coefficients removal coefficients δcrel were calculated as follows 7 δ c r e l δ c c 1 100 c 2 c 1 c 1 100 where c 2 and c 1 are the concentration of the studied species after and before the precipitation event respectively consequently a negative δcrel indicates effective scavenging besides the considerations above mentioned for w determination δcrel was calculated as follows a two types of precipitation events were considered i a 24 h event when the precipitation period covered more than 15 of the 24 hours of sampling and ii a full event taking the precipitation event as the consecutive rain days and considering that the event ended when there was a minimum of 48 hours without precipitation after collection of the last rainwater sample b aerosol concentrations before and after the precipitation event were obtained as a mean value calculated from the concentrations 2 days before and 2 days after the event respectively 3 results 3 1 characterization of precipitation during the sampling period a total of 485 mm of precipitation distributed in 118 days was registered in león this value is very close to the annual average precipitation reported in león by the aemet of 515 mm april was the month with more precipitation days 18 days and more accumulated precipitation 112 4 mm followed by february and may fig 2 a besides july august and september were the months with less rain days the lowest accumulated precipitation of the entire campaign 3 7 mm was registered in july the mean precipitation intensity taking into account the individual precipitation events was 0 8 mm h 1 in both spring and autumn 1 7 mm h 1 in summer and 0 7 mm h 1 in winter the longest precipitation episodes were recorded in spring with a mean duration of 7 5 days and a maximum duration of 15 days between 09

related to the mineral fraction showed the highest concentrations in summer with 0 9 0 7 0 3 0 2 0 4 0 2 and 0 4 0 4 µg m 3 of si fe ca and al respectively probably due to the high incidence of saharan dust intrusions on the iberian peninsula during this season moreover the lowest concentrations of these elements were recorded in spring 0 3 0 3 0 14 0 08 0 16 0 11 0 13 0 11 µg m 3 respectively in addition na and cl species related to sea salt aerosols showed the highest concentrations in winter and the lowest in summer with average values between 0 17 and 0 3 µg m 3 for na and between 0 07 and 0 5 µg m 3 for cl the highest sulfate values were observed in summer 1 6 0 9 µg m 3 mainly due to so2 oxidation under high insolation conditions galindo et al 2008 seinfeld and pandis 2016 ammonium concentrations in pm10 were similar in all seasons with mean values of 0 5 0 3 µg m 3 in summer 0 6 0 5 µg m 3 in autumn and spring and of 0 7 0 8 µg m 3 in winter furthermore the highest nitrate concentrations were recorded in winter 1 3 1 5 µg m 3 produced by the thermal stability of ammonium nitrate querol et al 2004 more information and a discussion on the chemical

no3 and nh4 r 0 9 p 0 01 and the source contribution indicate that nitrate and sulfate have a common origin mainly anthropogenic 92 3 and 99 8 respectively table s1 these elements related to secondary aerosol showed their highest concentrations during the an cn and ne weather types above 30 µeq l 1 for so4 2 48 µeq l 1 for no3 and 70 µeq l 1 for nh4 all of them with a northern flow component the highest vwm na and cl concentrations were reached in winter with 11 72 0 11 and 14 61 0 12 µeq l 1 respectively table 2 both the enrichment factor of 1 2 table s1 and the significant correlation between these two ions r 0 91 p 0 01 reflect the common marine origin the highest vwm values of these sea salt related elements were recorded during the cs cn an and sw weather types fig 3 a and 3b reaching concentrations between 25 and 43 µeq l 1 for na and between 27 and 58 µeq l 1 for cl high k ca2 and mg2 concentrations were registered in summer 5 21 35 and 7 6 µeq l 1 while the lowest concentrations were recorded in spring table 2 the highest volumetric concentrations of crustal related elements ca2 and mg2 were observed in an cs and ne weather types with vwm values ranging between 17 and 101 µeq l 1 for ca2 and between 12 and 16 µeq l 1 for mg2 moreover the lowest vwm values were recorded mainly in the hybrid cyclonic types cne and csw fig 3b 3 3 2 carbonaceous fraction the organic carbonaceous fraction can be scavenged by wet deposition in two forms soluble doc and insoluble wioc fractions the contribution from doc to the total organic fraction ranged between 71 and 82 with the lowest contribution obtained in summer and the highest in winter however in summer and autumn the doc values were higher table 2 doc values were higher for ne ce and cne weather types fig 3c reaching concentrations up to 8 mg l 1 there was a significant correlation between wiec and wioc during winter and spring and the highest wioc concentrations were obtained for cw and an weather types while the highest wiec were observed for cw cn and an weather types fig 3c 3 4 acidic contribution the individual ph values of rainwater ranged between 4 2 and 7 2 fig 4 a the vwm ph of the entire campaign was 5 87 0 02 while the mean annual conductivity was 27 0 0 2 µs cm 1 reflecting the low influence on precipitation of emissions from large industries and other local sources the lowest conductivity 2 77 µs cm 1 in 103 ml and highest ph value 7 20 in 38 ml were observed in may 2016 and february 2017 fig 4b respectively after several days of continuous rain the highest conductivity 164 9 µs cm 1 in 27 ml and lowest ph 4 23 in 304 ml were registered during forest fire events that took place in portugal between june and august 2016 emissions from biomass burning generate on the one hand an acidification of rainwater due to the presence of acidic organic species dicarboxylic acids and related compounds such as the glycolic lactic hydroxybutyric and levulinic acids and on the other hand an increase in conductivity caused by the increase in the concentration of inorganic ions soluble in water such as so4 2 no3 and nh4 oduber et al 2020 the highest neutralization factor was obtained by nh4 with 0 8 0 5 while the lowest nf was found for mg2 with 0 09 0 09 table s2 3 5 scavenging ratios the scavenging ratios w provide valuable information on the relationship between the concentration of the pollutants in rainwater and their concentrations in air the scavenging ratios were higher in summer than in other seasons except for na k so4 2 and ec table 3 ions related to marine and crustal sources na mg2 cl and ca2 displayed high w values indicating that they could be scavenged more efficiently than ions mainly bound to the fine fraction such as the anthropogenic ions no3 so4 2 and nh4 and k which showed lower w values however nh4 exhibited one of the highest scavenging ratios in spring and summer 3 6 removal coefficients the removal coefficient δcrel allow us to infer information about the removal mechanism in the air through the evolution of the concentration of pollutants before and after a precipitation event principal component analysis pca was performed by applying a matrix of varimax rotated components to the studied species in the aerosol samples three main groups were extracted explaining more than 88 5 of the accumulated variance tables s4 and s5 according to their common origin a al si ca ti fe mg mn and k as crustal elements explaining more than 53 of the variance b nh4 so4 2 no3 as secondary aerosol 18 of the variance and c na and cl as marine elements 16 of the variance episodes of high aerosol emissions dust intrusion biomass combustion and sulfate episodes causing an extreme increase in concentrations during the precipitation event were excluded from the database for the calculation of removal coefficients since they are not representative for this study in general the removal coefficients of almost all studied species presented negative values fig 5 indicating that precipitation helps to reduce the concentrations of all these species in the atmosphere when comparing the monthly removal coefficient of the 24 h events with those of the full events fig 5a and 5b it was observed that scavenging was more efficient when the precipitation event is longer increasing the δcrel by 82 on average the effect of the precipitation intensity and duration on the removal coefficient is shown in fig 6 in general intensities between 0 5 and 0 8 mm h 1 showed an increase in the removal coefficient for long time periods 20 hours of rain intensities higher than 0 9 mm h 1 exhibited maxima δc at short periods of time between 4 and 6 hours 3 7 linear predictive models for rain scavenging and for chemical properties of

in rainwater and the high levels of these secondary species during the an cn and ne weather types may be due to the presence of two major companies a thermal power plant and a cement factory about 30 km north of león fig 1 a pmf source apportionment carried out in a previous paper oduber et al 2021 showed the main natural and anthropogenic sources in león during the same study period this study evidenced the influence of the emissions from the cement factory and the thermal power plant in león city furthermore data from a local air quality station in la robla http servicios jcyl es esco cargarfrmdatoshistoricos action showed high so2 concentrations when compared with those in the city this can be due to the presence of both factories in addition from the point of view of medium and long range transport of pollutants northeast is the direction where the air masses from industrial areas in spain and europe come from the high ca2 and mg2 concentrations in summer reflected the contribution from dust intrusion events which arrived at the peninsula during warmer months confirmed by the enrichment factor table s1 furthermore the highest potassium concentration observed also in summer is probably due to the frequent forest fires and african dust events in the iberian peninsula that could rise the k values vicente et al 2013 the weather types associated with the highest volumetric concentrations of ca2 and mg2 an cs and ne were previously related to a high contribution of mineral aerosols and aged sea salt enriched with crustal related elements during transport to león oduber et al 2021 moreover the lowest vwm values observed for all the species can be due to the significant dispersion of the contaminants in the cyclonic circulations and large periods of continuous precipitation regarding the carbonaceous fraction less than 30 km ne of the city of león there is a large vegetation density fig 1 which contributes a large amount of biogenic material and may be responsible for the increase in concentrations of dissolved organic carbon oduber et al 2019b observed for ne ce and cne weather types moreover the weather types cw and an exhibited a high concentration of wioc and wiec because the air masses coming from the north and west of león probably incorporate carbonaceous species from anthropogenic sources during their trajectory to the city furthermore the weather type cn showed a high influence of road traffic emissions oduber et al 2021 contributing to wiec concentrations the significant correlation between wiec and wioc during winter and spring r 0 7 p 0 01 may indicate a common origin traffic and fossil fuel primary emissions favez et al 2008 theodosi et al 2010 in addition there is a significant correlation between doc and the main crustal elements in summer and spring r 0 5 p 0 05 in these seasons the air masses coming mainly from the south travel through large areas of forest until they reach león therefore the concentration of dissolved organic carbon could be partly related to the transport of biogenic material from the south of the iberia peninsula thus the correlation observed between doc and crustal elements is probably due to the transport of this material together with the biogenic components oduber et al 2020 furthermore the highest photochemical activity in these seasons could also contribute to the oxidation of volatile organic compounds vocs into soluble organic particles between summer and spring there is also a high incidence of wildfires in the iberian peninsula alonso blanco et al 2012 alves et al 2011 vicente et al 2013 2012 which can emit large amounts of water soluble organic compounds alves et al 2011 causing an increase in doc concentrations in autumn and winter the domestic heating systems constitute an important source of doc siudek et al 2015 although in winter the concentration of oc in pm10 was higher than in autumn the concentration of doc was lower it is probably due to the larger volume of total precipitation recorded in winter table 2 furthermore in autumn doc concentrations could also be affected by the presence of forest fires and by agricultural stubble burning not common in winter 4 2 acidic contribution the kruskal wallis test applied to the ph values obtained for the individual rainwater samples showed significant differences between ph values of spring rainwater samples and those of summer and autumn winter and spring are rainy seasons in león which helps to clean the atmosphere consequently an increase in the ph and a decrease in the conductivity of the rainwater can be observed when compared to other seasons a reduction of the conductivity values due to the abundant rainfall was also observed by zhang et al 2007 in rainwater samples from southern china indicating the dilution effect on the atmospheric pollution the results obtained for the neutralization factor suggested that the crustal components neutralized a small fraction of the available acid in the precipitation and that ammonia plays an important role in the neutralization of the rainwater mainly in winter ca2 showed statistically significant differences between the nf values of summer and the rest of the seasons confirming the neutralizing effect of this crustal component when the dust contribution is greater the high nf of na in winter 0 7 0 8 could partly justify the high ph values observed in this season 4 3 scavenging ratios and removal coefficients table 3 shows that in general scavenging ratios were higher in summer than in other seasons except for na k so4 2 and ec in león convective phenomena are frequent in summer which generally cause short and intense precipitation events fernández raga et al 2017 kulshrestha et al 2003 2009 studied the relation between the aerosol size and duration of precipitation in below scavenging processes reporting that scavenging ratios increase with the increase of the precipitation intensity for species present in fine particles such as nh4 k and no3 moreover the soil derived coarse particles are also effectively scavenged due to the inertial impaction by raindrops through the rain columns the scavenging ratio also depends on the particle sizes as in this work encinas et al 2004 and jaffrezo and colin 1988 reported high w values for ions related to marine and crustal sources na mg2 cl and ca2 and lower w values for ions related to fine particles therefore the scavenging process is more efficient in coarse particles however the opposite result observed for nh4 in spring and summer may be due to other processes the composition of the rainwater is determined by the scavenging process of both gases and particles thus the scavenging ratios can be overestimated for some species such as cl no3 so4 2 and nh4 due to the incorporation to the rain droplets of the gases hno3 hcl so2 and nh3 especially in spring and summer when the formation of secondary aerosols is favored by the photochemical reactions kasper giebl et al 1999 reported that no3 values in rainwater are predominantly due to gas phase scavenging of hno3 88 96 while nh4 in rainwater is formed between 49 and 79 by particulate nh4 regarding removal coefficients fig 5 the negative values observed for almost all studied species indicated that precipitation helps to clean the atmosphere the increase in removal coefficients for full events compared to 24 hour events shows that the removal process is more efficient when the precipitation event is longer olszowski 2014 reported that rainfalls with six hours of duration are 3 5 times more effective than similar intensity rainfalls with half an hour of duration in removing pm10 the effect of the intensity and duration of precipitation on the removal coefficient fig 6 indicates that the scavenging process is more efficient with long and continuous periods of precipitation at intensities between 0 5 and 0 8 mm h 1 while at high intensities the scavenging process is efficient at short periods of time olszowski 2014 observed that rains with intensities greater than 4 mm h 1 are approximately 35 more effective in removing pm from the air than precipitations with intensities lower than 0 5 mm h 1 suggesting that pm10 concentrations increase much faster after a light rain event similar results were also reported by castro et al 2010 in a study carried out in león spain in spring 2005 when it was observed that with intensities over 3 2 mm h 1 there was an intense washout and the number of both small and large particles decreased significantly however low rain intensities 0 5 mm h 1 showed high removal coefficients in a period between 7 and 9 hours except for crustal related elements and an increase of δc in long periods for the elements related to secondary aerosols these results as well as those reported by kulshrestha et al 2009 suggest that short duration and high intensity rain events effectively remove coarse mode particles such as particles from crustal and marine sources probably by a process of below cloud scavenging while rain of low intensity but with longer duration is more effective in removing fine particles 4 4 linear predictive models linear models for predicting the rain scavenging and for chemical properties of rainwater were constructed as explained in section 3 7 they can be seen in table 4 showing that the amount of doc and water soluble ions in rain samples ca2 so4 2 no3 increases with the volume swept by the falling drops probably due to the high solubility in water of these compounds in other words a high volume of precipitation or a large number of drops favors the elimination of these species a negative dependence between v swept and wiec was observed while the wioc is dependent of the raindrop diameter and the time between two precipitation events scavenging of insoluble species can be more affected by the inertial impact of the raindrops through the columns of rain this behavior was also described by blanco alegre et al 2019 who deduced a multi linear model to estimate the black carbon scavenging by rain in general the removal coefficient and the decrease in the concentration of pm10 oc ec crustal marine and secondary related aerosols after a precipitation event is affected by the concentration of each species before the event the negative coefficient in all cases shows that the higher the concentration before the precipitation event the more efficient the elimination process the δc of the 24 hour events showed positive coefficients for the time elapsed between two consecutive precipitation events while the δc for full events displayed a negative dependence with the percentage of time with precipitation during the sampling period therefore the scavenging of pollutants is more efficient with prolonged and continuous precipitation events these results are consistent with those observed by castro et al 2010 in the study carried out in león spain in the spring of 2005 they observed that with rain intensities lower than 0 6 mm h 1 the time it took for the number of particles to regain values similar to the initial number before the precipitation event was about 2 h the model for the scavenging ratio w was significant only for no3 depending on the time between two rain events and their concentration in the aerosol before the rain event this is consistent with the inverse relationship of w and cair eq 6 it is important to realize that these models only depend on the physical properties of the rain and the chemical characteristics of the aerosol as a consequence they can probably be applied in any region as they do not depend on regional conditions such as weather or local features 5 conclusions a one year sampling campaign was carried out between march 2016 and march 2017 in order to characterize the below cloud scavenging process and establish linear models showing the influence of the physical parameters of raindrops and the chemical properties of aerosols on the removal of atmospheric pollutants a total of 363 mm of precipitation were recorded during the entire sampling period april being the month with more rain days and more accumulated rainwater and july the month with fewer days and less accumulated rainfall the chemistry of the rainwater provided evidence on the contribution mainly from anthropogenic sources through the high values of nh4 so4 2 and no3 in winter the high values of na and cl in the rainwater composition manifiested the input of sea salt these species arrived in león with the air masses from the atlantic and are associated with cs cn an and sw weather types this source could also explain the high values of ph in the precipitation sampled in winter season moreover summer precipitation is characterized by high concentrations of elements from crustal and anthropogenic sources mainly related to air masses from north africa and an cs and ne weather types the mean ph and conductivity of the rainwater were 5 87 and 27 0 µs cm 1 respectively indicating the low influence of large industries and other local anthropogenic sources in león the carbonaceous fraction was dominated by doc showing the lowest values in summer and the highest in winter in summer the dissolved organic carbon concentrations could be connected to the transport of biogenic material from the south of the iberian peninsula and secondary organic carbon production while in winter they could be linked to traffic and fossil fuel primary emissions scavenging ratios show that i the soil derived coarse particles are effectively removed with the increase of the precipitation intensities ii for fine particles this process is more effective with long and continuous rainfall iii for ammonium they increase due to the incorporation of nh4 in gas phase to the drop regarding the removal coefficients the increase observed for full events versus 24 hour events indicate that the removal process is more efficient when the precipitation event is longer rainfall intensity also affects the efficiency of the scavenging process at low intensities the scavenging is favored by long and continuous rains while at intensities above 0 9 mm h 1 scavenging efficiency is favored when the rain duration is between 4 and 6 hours linear models for the prediction of the chemical composition of rainwater scavenging ratio and removal coefficients were constructed the results showed that only the amount of the water soluble ions in rainwater ca2 so4 2 no3 increases with the volume swept by the drops while the concentration of water insoluble organic and elemental carbon is affected by raindrop diameter and swept volume respectively the removal coefficients δc are affected by the air concentration of each species before precipitation by the duration of the precipitation event and by the elapsed time between two events the results confirm the influence of physicochemical properties of the rain and the chemical properties of aerosols in the elimination of atmospheric pollutants this work represents a further step in the study of the mechanisms of elimination of air pollutants proving that simple models can allow a first approach in the calculation of the removal efficiency of pollutants by rain in a region considering not only the chemical

17304,a one year study was carried out in león spain in order to characterize physically and chemically the precipitation with the aim of studying the scavenging process of atmospheric pollutants scavenging ratio and removal coefficients were calculated through physical parameters of raindrops obtained by disdrometer data and through chemical properties of aerosols finally linear models for the prediction of the chemical composition of rainwater and the efficiency of the removal effect were established in general the rainwater was dominated by nh4 so4 2 no3 in all seasons higher ion concentrations and conductivity and lowest ph were observed in summer due to the low volume of rain in winter the high values of na and cl in the rainwater showed the contribution from marine sources while in summer the high concentrations of ca2 mg2 so4 2 nh4 and no3 reflected the contribution from both crustal and anthropogenic sources the linear models revealed that the amount of dissolved organic carbon and of the water soluble ions in rain samples ca2 so4 2 no3 increases with the volume swept by the falling drops insoluble carbon fraction has a negative dependence with the volume swept and positive with the diameter of the raindrop removal coefficients are affected by the concentration in the air of each species before precipitation the duration of the event and the time

authors have highlighted the negative impact of air pollutants on human health and the environment bernstein et al 2004 kampa and castanas 2008 ren jian et al 2012 especially in megacities lelieveld et al 2015 mage et al 1996 naddafi et al 2012 atmospheric wet deposition plays a crucial role in mitigating these negative effects as it acts directly on the removal and transport of different pollutants and soluble gases from the atmosphere to the earth s surface keresztesi et al 2017 seinfeld and pandis 2016 through two main processes in cloud and below cloud scavenging below cloud scavenging depends on the characteristics of rainfall raindrop size distribution and rainfall rate and on the local regional concentration of the particles and gases in the atmosphere and in cloud processes involve both the condensation of water vapor onto aerosols and the incorporation of gases by reactions in the aqueous phase celle jeanton et al 2009 xu et al 2017 the study of the chemical properties of rainwater and of the concentration and composition of the aerosol provides useful information on the emissions of pollutants since it helps to identify the possible sources that contribute to rainwater chemistry local and regional dispersion of pollutants and their impact on the ecosystem martins et al 2019 sanets and chuduk 2005 zhang et al 2007 the composition of rainwater depends on several factors such as the local and long range emissions sources geography and meteorological conditions alastuey et al 1999 calvo et al 2012 jain et al 2019 knote et al 2015 mori et al 2014 the scavenging process of different species is affected by the intensity and volume of precipitation calvo et al 2012 custódio et al 2014 luan et al 2019 pan and wang 2015 uchiyama et al 2017 however there are many other parameters involved in this process such as concentration size distribution and composition of atmospheric aerosol and raindrop size distribution blanco alegre et al 2019 2018 fredericks and saylor 2019 zikova and zdimal 2016 in recent years several authors have proposed different models to explain the removal process of aerosols by rain for example olszowski and ziembik 2018 presented a linear model for the reduction of pm10 mass concentrations which includes the type of precipitation and the water vapor content in air moreover roy et al 2019 proposed a linear model to predict the aerosol scavenging based on the influence of rain rate and duration in previous studies carried out in león spain the influence of the physical characteristics of precipitation on the total concentration of particles castro et al 2010 and on the removal of black carbon blanco alegre et al 2019 have already been reported however studies integrating the chemical properties of aerosol and precipitation and the physical properties of precipitation are scarce underestimating the potential synergies between them studies involving the physical chemical parameters of precipitation can provide valuable information to deepen the understanding of the process of aerosol removal by rainfall the hypothesis that supports our study is that the scavenging of aerosols is a function of the chemical properties of the aerosol and the physical characteristics of rain in order to verify such hypothesis a one year sampling campaign of aerosols and precipitation was carried out in león nw spain with the aim of i studying the chemical and physical characteristics of precipitation and identifying the main weather types associated with them ii studying the influence of the aerosol chemical composition and the physical characteristics of precipitation on the removal processes through the scavenging ratio and removal coefficients and iii establishing several linear models to explain the removal process of the different chemical species in the air from the physical properties of rainwater and aerosol chemical composition 2 experimental 2 1 sampling site the sampling

the sampling point the origin of air masses during the study period was estimated by the hysplit model draxler and rolph 2012 rolph et al 2017 stein et al 2015 through the determination of 3 day back trajectories at 500 1500 and 3000 m during the sampling period a total of 74 rainwater samples and a total of 739 pm10 samples 369 quartz filters and 370 teflon filters were collected the filters and rainwater samples were collected every 24 h starting at 1200 utc every day the sampling of pm10 was carried out using a low volume sampler tecora echopm equipped with 47 mm diameter teflon filters and using a high volume sampler cav mb equipped with 150 mm diameter quartz filters pm10 mass was determined by gravimetry using an electronic semi microbalance mettler toledo xpe105dr rainwater samples were collected in glass bottles using a wet only precipitation sampler eigenbrodt uns 130 e conductivity and ph of precipitation samples were determined immediately after collection then the water samples were filtered through a 15 mm diameter quartz filters in order to separate the insoluble and soluble fractions 2 2 2 pm10 and rainwater analysis a thermo optical technique was used for the determination of organic and elemental carbon oc and ec of quartz filters of pm10 and for the determination of water insoluble organic and elemental carbon wioc and wiec of the insoluble rainwater fraction following the methodology described by alves et al 2015 custódio et al 2014 and pio et al 2011 teflon filters were used for the analysis of water soluble inorganic ions by ionic chromatography and for the determination of major trace elements using the pixe technique particle induced x ray emission lucarelli et al 2015 following the methodology described by oduber et al 2019a the soluble fractions of rainwater samples were separated into two fractions one of them was used for the determination of dissolved organic carbon doc content this analysis was carried out by combustion and infrared detection in a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc vcph the other fraction was filtered through a 13 mm polyvinyl difluoride pvdf syringe filter with 0 2 µm pore size whatmantm and used for the determination of the water soluble inorganic ions by ionic chromatography the chromatographic analysis was performed in a thermo scientific dionextm ics 5000 equipment provided with an ionpac cs16 column 4 250 mm and an ionpac as11 column 4 250 mm for the analysis of cations li na k ca2 mg2 nh4 and anions f cl so4 2 no3 no2 respectively 2 2 3 disdrometer the raindrop size spectrum was obtained with a laser disdrometer laser precipitation monitor lpm of thies clima which registered drops between 0 125 and 8 mm in 22 drop size ranges on a 1 minute basis fernández raga et al 2009 the lpm was operational throughout the entire campaign thus when a precipitation event occurred the raindrop characteristics were recorded during the entire event the lpm was placed 3 m far from the rain collector and close to the aerosol samplers all of them on the same terrace of the faculty of veterinary sciences of the university of león as a consequence the characteristics of rainwater are supposed to be similar at all installed sampling equipment from the data provided by the lpm the following rainfall variables were obtained precipitation intensity accumulated precipitation number of drops volume swept by falling drops mean and standard deviation of raindrop sizes 2 2 4 circulation weather types in order to study the relationship between the

ratio between the same elements but considering the concentrations in the seawater or crustal material keene et al 1986 zhang et al 2007 in order to determine the best seawater tracer the mg2 na ratio was evaluated a ratio higher than 0 227 indicates a crustal mg2 influence and a lower ratio suggests a crustal na origin jordan et al 2003 in this study the mean mg2 na ratio was 0 713 and according to this result sodium was used as seawater reference element following zhang et al 2007 calcium was used as crustal reference since it is a typical lithophylic element representative of the soil composition besides the source contribution of seawater and crustal was obtained as follows zhang et al 2007 4 s e a w a t e r f r a c t i o n 100 c x c n a s e a w a t e r c x c n a s a m p l e 5 c r

balasubramanian 2008 kasper giebl et al 1999 6 w c r a i n c a i r ρ a i r ρ w where crain is the concentration in mg l 1 of each studied species in rainwater samples and cair is the concentration in µg m 3 of the same species in the aerosol samples during the precipitation event ρair and ρw are the densities of air 1 29 109 μg m 3 and water 106 mg l 1 respectively at 20 c and 1 atm following blanco alegre et al 2019 cugerone et al 2018 for the determination of w the following considerations were taken into account a only events in which the rainfall duration covered more than 15 of the 24 hours of sampling were considered corresponding to an approximate period of half the mean duration of rain events b rain events with a variation in wind speed greater than 2 m s 1 were excluded from the sample c because aerosol samples were collected at 24 h intervals it is assumed that the rainwater samples are representative of this sampling period 2 2 9 removal coefficients removal coefficients δcrel were calculated as follows 7 δ c r e l δ c c 1 100 c 2 c 1 c 1 100 where c 2 and c 1 are the concentration of the studied species after and before the precipitation event respectively consequently a negative δcrel indicates effective scavenging besides the considerations above mentioned for w determination δcrel was calculated as follows a two types of precipitation events were considered i a 24 h event when the precipitation period covered more than 15 of the 24 hours of sampling and ii a full event taking the precipitation event as the consecutive rain days and considering that the event ended when there was a minimum of 48 hours without precipitation after collection of the last rainwater sample b aerosol concentrations before and after the precipitation event were obtained as a mean value calculated from the concentrations 2 days before and 2 days after the event respectively 3 results 3 1 characterization of precipitation during the sampling period a total of 485 mm of precipitation distributed in 118 days was registered in león this value is very close to the annual average precipitation reported in león by the aemet of 515 mm april was the month with more precipitation days 18 days and more accumulated precipitation 112 4 mm followed by february and may fig 2 a besides july august and september were the months with less rain days the lowest accumulated precipitation of the entire campaign 3 7 mm was registered in july the mean precipitation intensity taking into account the individual precipitation events was 0 8 mm h 1 in both spring and autumn 1 7 mm h 1 in summer and 0 7 mm h 1 in winter the longest precipitation episodes were recorded in spring with a mean duration of 7 5 days and a maximum duration of 15 days between 09 and 24 april 2016 although it only rained during 35 of the time period the most frequent weather type during the rainy days was the cyclonic type c with 21 days 19 of the total followed by westerly types sw and w both with 10 days 9 each of the total fig 2b the weather types with more accumulated precipitation were cyclonic c with 149 mm westerly w with 68 mm and northwesterly cyclonic cnw with 62 mm regarding the average daily precipitation volume the type cnw showed the highest value with 15 6 mm day 1 followed by c with 7 1 mm day 1 and w with 6 8 mm day 1 3 2 aerosol chemical composition during the sampling campaign carbonaceous constituents oc ec represented the highest pm10 mass fraction in all seasons with an average annual percentage of 13 3 winter showed the highest carbonaceous fraction with a mean oc and ec concentrations of 2 7 1 5 µg m 3 and 0 9 0 5 µg m 3 respectively while spring showed the lowest concentrations with 1 9 1 0 and 0 7 0 3 µg m 3 respectively the elements related to the mineral fraction showed the highest concentrations in summer with 0 9 0 7 0 3 0 2 0 4 0 2 and 0 4 0 4 µg m 3 of si fe ca and al respectively probably due to the high incidence of saharan dust intrusions on the iberian peninsula during this season moreover the lowest concentrations of these elements were recorded in spring 0 3 0 3 0 14 0 08 0 16 0 11 0 13 0 11 µg m 3 respectively in addition na and cl species related to sea salt aerosols showed the highest concentrations in winter and the lowest in summer with average values between 0 17 and 0 3 µg m 3 for na and between 0 07 and 0 5 µg m 3 for cl the highest sulfate values were observed in summer 1 6 0 9 µg m 3 mainly due to so2 oxidation under high insolation conditions galindo et al 2008 seinfeld and pandis 2016 ammonium concentrations in pm10 were similar in all seasons with mean values of 0 5 0 3 µg m 3 in summer 0 6 0 5 µg m 3 in autumn and spring and of 0 7 0 8 µg m 3 in winter furthermore the highest nitrate concentrations were recorded in winter 1 3 1 5 µg m 3 produced by the thermal stability of ammonium nitrate querol et al 2004 more information and a discussion on the chemical composition of aerosols during this sampling campaign can be found in oduber et al 2021 3 3 rainwater chemical composition 3 3 1 inorganic ions during the sampling period 74 rain samples distributed in 31 precipitation events were analyzed table 2 the season with more samples was winter with 25 rainwater samples in 23 precipitation events although the season with more volume collected was spring the season with less rainwater samples was summer with 6 the inorganic content of rainwater table 2 reveals a predominance of nh4 followed by so4 2 and no3 the statistical correlation between so4 2 no3 and nh4 r 0 9 p 0 01 and the source contribution indicate that nitrate and sulfate have a common origin mainly anthropogenic 92 3 and 99 8 respectively table s1 these elements related to secondary aerosol showed their highest concentrations during the an cn and ne weather types above 30 µeq l 1 for so4 2 48 µeq l 1 for no3 and 70 µeq l 1 for nh4 all of them with a northern flow component the highest vwm na and cl concentrations were reached in winter with 11 72 0 11 and 14 61 0 12 µeq l 1 respectively table 2 both the enrichment factor of 1 2 table s1 and the significant correlation between these two ions r 0 91 p 0 01 reflect the common marine origin the highest vwm values of these sea salt related elements were recorded during the cs cn an and sw weather types fig 3 a and 3b reaching concentrations between 25 and 43 µeq l 1 for na and between 27 and 58 µeq l 1 for cl high k ca2 and mg2 concentrations were registered in summer 5 21 35 and 7 6 µeq l 1 while the lowest concentrations were recorded in spring table 2 the highest volumetric concentrations of crustal related elements ca2 and mg2 were observed in an cs and ne weather types with vwm values ranging between 17 and 101 µeq l 1 for ca2 and between 12 and 16 µeq l 1 for mg2 moreover the lowest vwm values were recorded mainly in the hybrid cyclonic types cne and csw fig 3b 3 3 2 carbonaceous fraction the organic carbonaceous fraction can be scavenged by wet deposition in two forms soluble doc and insoluble wioc fractions the contribution from doc to the total organic fraction ranged between 71 and 82 with the lowest contribution obtained in summer and the highest in winter however in summer and autumn the doc values were higher table 2 doc values were higher for ne ce and cne weather types fig 3c reaching concentrations up to 8 mg l 1 there was a significant correlation between wiec and wioc during winter and spring and the highest wioc concentrations were obtained for cw and an weather types while the highest wiec were observed for cw cn and an weather types fig 3c 3 4 acidic contribution the individual ph values of rainwater ranged between 4 2 and 7 2 fig 4 a the vwm ph of the entire campaign was 5 87 0 02 while the mean annual conductivity was 27 0 0 2 µs cm 1 reflecting the low influence on precipitation of emissions from large industries and other local sources the lowest conductivity 2 77 µs cm 1 in 103 ml and highest ph value 7 20 in 38 ml were observed in may 2016 and february 2017 fig 4b respectively after several days of continuous rain the highest conductivity 164 9 µs cm 1 in 27 ml and lowest ph 4 23 in 304 ml were registered during forest fire events that took place in portugal between june and august 2016 emissions from biomass burning generate on the one hand an acidification of rainwater due to the presence of acidic organic species dicarboxylic acids and related compounds such as the glycolic lactic hydroxybutyric and levulinic acids and on the other hand an increase in conductivity caused by the increase in the concentration of inorganic ions soluble in water such as so4 2 no3 and nh4 oduber et al 2020 the highest neutralization factor was obtained by nh4 with 0 8 0 5 while the lowest nf was found for mg2 with 0 09 0 09 table s2 3 5 scavenging ratios the scavenging ratios w provide valuable information on the relationship between the concentration of the pollutants in rainwater and their concentrations in air the scavenging ratios were higher in summer than in other seasons except for na k so4 2 and ec table 3 ions related to marine and crustal sources na mg2 cl and ca2 displayed high w values indicating that they could be scavenged more efficiently than ions mainly bound to the fine fraction such as the anthropogenic ions no3 so4 2 and nh4 and k which showed lower w values however nh4 exhibited one of the highest scavenging ratios in spring and summer 3 6 removal coefficients the removal coefficient δcrel allow us to infer information about the removal mechanism in the air through the evolution of the concentration of pollutants before and after a precipitation event principal component analysis pca was performed by applying a matrix of varimax rotated components to the studied species in the aerosol samples three main groups were extracted explaining more than 88 5 of the accumulated variance tables s4 and s5 according to their common origin a al si ca ti fe mg mn and k as crustal elements explaining more than 53 of the variance b nh4 so4 2 no3 as secondary aerosol 18 of the variance and c na and cl as marine elements 16 of the variance episodes of high aerosol emissions dust intrusion biomass combustion and sulfate episodes causing an extreme increase in concentrations during the precipitation event were excluded from the database for the calculation of removal coefficients since they are not representative for this study in general the removal coefficients of almost all studied species presented negative values fig 5 indicating that precipitation helps to reduce the concentrations of all these species in the atmosphere when comparing the monthly removal coefficient of the 24 h events with those of the full events fig 5a and 5b it was observed that scavenging was more efficient when the precipitation event is longer increasing the δcrel by 82 on average the effect of the precipitation intensity and duration on the removal coefficient is shown in fig 6 in general intensities between 0 5 and 0 8 mm h 1 showed an increase in the removal coefficient for long time periods 20 hours of rain intensities higher than 0 9 mm h 1 exhibited maxima δc at short periods of time between 4 and 6 hours 3 7 linear predictive models for rain scavenging and for chemical properties of

the building of the model nevertheless table 4 only shows the dependent and independent variables and the statistically significant coefficients p 0 05 used to construct the multi linear models the significant values obtained show that the measured and predicted data are related to each other and consequently the created model can be applicable the multi linear models shown in table 4 were

model gives the coefficients α ij of each independent variable i i 1 to 6 and the intercept βj 4 discussion 4 1 rainwater chemical composition and weather types the predominance of nh4 so4 2 and no3 in rainwater and the high levels of these secondary species during the an cn and ne weather types may be due to the presence of two major companies a thermal power plant and a cement factory about 30 km north of león fig 1 a pmf source apportionment carried out in a previous paper oduber et al 2021 showed the main natural and anthropogenic sources in león during the same study period this study evidenced the influence of the emissions from the cement factory and the thermal power plant in león city furthermore data from a local air quality station in la robla http servicios jcyl es esco cargarfrmdatoshistoricos action showed high so2 concentrations when compared with those in the city this can be due to the presence of both factories in addition from the point of view of medium and long range transport of pollutants northeast is the direction where the air masses from industrial areas in spain and europe come from the high ca2 and mg2 concentrations in summer reflected the contribution from dust intrusion events which arrived at the peninsula during warmer months confirmed by the enrichment factor table s1 furthermore the highest potassium concentration observed also in summer is probably due to the frequent forest fires and african dust events in the iberian peninsula that could rise the k values vicente et al 2013 the weather types associated with the highest volumetric concentrations of ca2 and mg2 an cs and ne were previously related to a high contribution of mineral aerosols and aged sea salt enriched with crustal related elements during transport to león oduber et al 2021 moreover the lowest vwm values observed for all the species can be due to the significant dispersion of the contaminants in the cyclonic circulations and large periods of continuous precipitation regarding the carbonaceous fraction less than 30 km ne of the city of león there is a large vegetation density fig 1 which contributes a large amount of biogenic material and may be responsible for the increase in concentrations of dissolved organic carbon oduber et al 2019b observed for ne ce and cne weather types moreover the weather types cw and an exhibited a high concentration of wioc and wiec because the air masses coming from the north and west of león probably incorporate carbonaceous species from anthropogenic sources during their trajectory to the city furthermore the weather type cn showed a high influence of road traffic emissions oduber et al 2021 contributing to wiec concentrations the significant correlation between wiec and wioc during winter and spring r 0 7 p 0 01 may indicate a common origin traffic and fossil fuel primary emissions favez et al 2008 theodosi et al 2010 in addition there is a significant correlation between doc and the main crustal elements in summer and spring r 0 5 p 0 05 in these seasons the air masses coming mainly from the south travel through large areas of forest until they reach león therefore the concentration of dissolved organic carbon could be partly related to the transport of biogenic material from the south of the iberia peninsula thus the correlation observed between doc and crustal elements is probably due to the transport of this material together with the biogenic components oduber et al 2020 furthermore the highest photochemical activity in these seasons could also contribute to the oxidation of volatile organic compounds vocs into soluble organic particles between summer and spring there is also a high incidence of wildfires in the iberian peninsula alonso blanco et al 2012 alves et al 2011 vicente et al 2013 2012 which can emit large amounts of water soluble organic compounds alves et al 2011 causing an increase in doc concentrations in autumn and winter the domestic heating systems constitute an important source of doc siudek et al 2015 although in winter the concentration of oc in pm10 was higher than in autumn the concentration of doc was lower it is probably due to the larger volume of total precipitation recorded in winter table 2 furthermore in autumn doc concentrations could also be affected by the presence of forest fires and by agricultural stubble burning not common in winter 4 2 acidic contribution the kruskal wallis test applied to the ph values obtained for the individual rainwater samples showed significant differences between ph values of spring rainwater samples and those of summer and autumn winter and spring are rainy seasons in león which helps to clean the atmosphere consequently an increase in the ph and a decrease in the conductivity of the rainwater can be observed when compared to other seasons a reduction of the conductivity values due to the abundant rainfall was also observed by zhang et al 2007 in rainwater samples from southern china indicating the dilution effect on the atmospheric pollution the results obtained for the neutralization factor suggested that the crustal components neutralized a small fraction of the available acid in the precipitation and that ammonia plays an important role in the neutralization of the rainwater mainly in winter ca2 showed statistically significant differences between the nf values of summer and the rest of the seasons confirming the neutralizing effect of this crustal component when the dust contribution is greater the high nf of na in winter 0 7 0 8 could partly justify the high ph values observed in this season 4 3 scavenging ratios and removal coefficients table 3 shows that in general scavenging ratios were higher in summer than in other seasons except for na k so4 2 and ec in león convective phenomena are frequent in summer which generally cause short and intense precipitation events fernández raga et al 2017 kulshrestha et al 2003 2009 studied the relation between the aerosol size and duration of precipitation in below scavenging processes reporting that scavenging ratios increase with the increase of the precipitation intensity for species present in fine particles such as nh4 k and no3 moreover the soil derived coarse particles are also effectively scavenged due to the inertial impaction by raindrops through the rain columns the scavenging ratio also depends on the particle sizes as in this work encinas et al 2004 and jaffrezo and colin 1988 reported high w values for ions related to marine and crustal sources na mg2 cl and ca2 and lower w values for ions related to fine particles therefore the scavenging process is more efficient in coarse particles however the opposite result observed for nh4 in spring and summer may be due to other processes the composition of the rainwater is determined by the scavenging process of both gases and particles thus the scavenging ratios can be overestimated for some species such as cl no3 so4 2 and nh4 due to the incorporation to the rain droplets of the gases hno3 hcl so2 and nh3 especially in spring and summer when the formation of secondary aerosols is favored by the photochemical reactions kasper giebl et al 1999 reported that no3 values in rainwater are predominantly due to gas phase scavenging of hno3 88 96 while nh4 in rainwater is formed between 49 and 79 by particulate nh4 regarding removal coefficients fig 5 the negative values observed for almost all studied species indicated that precipitation helps to clean the atmosphere the increase in removal coefficients for full events compared to 24 hour events shows that the removal process is more efficient when the precipitation event is longer olszowski 2014 reported that rainfalls with six hours of duration are 3 5 times more effective than similar intensity rainfalls with half an hour of duration in removing pm10 the effect of the intensity and duration of precipitation on the removal coefficient fig 6 indicates that the scavenging process is more efficient with long and continuous periods of precipitation at intensities between 0 5 and 0 8 mm h 1 while at high intensities the scavenging process is efficient at short periods of time olszowski 2014 observed that rains with intensities greater than 4 mm h 1 are approximately 35 more effective in removing pm from the air than precipitations with intensities lower than 0 5 mm h 1 suggesting that pm10 concentrations increase much faster after a light rain event similar results were also reported by castro et al 2010 in a study carried out in león spain in spring 2005 when it was observed that with intensities over 3 2 mm h 1 there was an intense washout and the number of both small and large particles decreased significantly however low rain intensities 0 5 mm h 1 showed high removal coefficients in a period between 7 and 9 hours except for crustal related elements and an increase of δc in long periods for the elements related to secondary aerosols these results as well as those reported by kulshrestha et al 2009 suggest that short duration and high intensity rain events effectively remove coarse mode particles such as particles from crustal and marine sources probably by a process of below cloud scavenging while rain of low intensity but with longer duration is more effective in removing fine particles 4 4 linear predictive models linear models for predicting the rain scavenging and for chemical properties of rainwater were constructed as explained in section 3 7 they can be seen in table 4 showing that the amount of doc and water soluble ions in rain samples ca2 so4 2 no3 increases with the volume swept by the falling drops probably due to the high solubility in water of these compounds in other words a high volume of precipitation or a large number of drops favors the elimination of these species a negative dependence between v swept and wiec was observed while the wioc is dependent of the raindrop diameter and the time between two precipitation events scavenging of insoluble species can be more affected by the inertial impact of the raindrops through the columns of rain this behavior was also described by blanco alegre et al 2019 who deduced a multi linear model to estimate the black carbon scavenging by rain in general the removal coefficient and the decrease in the concentration of pm10 oc ec crustal marine and secondary related aerosols after a precipitation event is affected by the concentration of each species before the event the negative coefficient in all cases shows that the higher the concentration before the precipitation event the more efficient the elimination process the δc of the 24 hour events showed positive coefficients for the time elapsed between two consecutive precipitation events while the δc for full events displayed a negative dependence with the percentage of time with precipitation during the sampling period therefore the scavenging of pollutants is more efficient with prolonged and continuous precipitation events these results are consistent with those observed by castro et al 2010 in the study carried out in león spain in the spring of 2005 they observed that with rain intensities lower than 0 6 mm h 1 the time it took for the number of particles to regain values similar to the initial number before the precipitation event was about 2 h the model for the scavenging ratio w was significant only for no3 depending on the time between two rain events and their concentration in the aerosol before the rain event this is consistent with the inverse relationship of w and cair eq 6 it is important to realize that these models only depend on the physical properties of the rain and the chemical characteristics of the aerosol as a consequence they can probably be applied in any region as they do not depend on regional conditions such as weather or local features 5 conclusions a one year sampling campaign was carried out between march 2016 and march 2017 in order to characterize the below cloud scavenging process and establish linear models showing the influence of the physical parameters of raindrops and the chemical properties of aerosols on the removal of atmospheric pollutants a total of 363 mm of precipitation were recorded during the entire sampling period april being the month with more rain days and more accumulated rainwater and july the month with fewer days and less accumulated rainfall the chemistry of the rainwater provided evidence on the contribution mainly from anthropogenic sources through the high values of nh4 so4 2 and no3 in winter the high values of na and cl in the rainwater composition manifiested the input of sea salt these species arrived in león with the air masses from the atlantic and are associated with cs cn an and sw weather types this source could also explain the high values of ph in the precipitation sampled in winter season moreover summer precipitation is characterized by high concentrations of elements from crustal and anthropogenic sources mainly related to air masses from north africa and an cs and ne weather types the mean ph and conductivity of the rainwater were 5 87 and 27 0 µs cm 1 respectively indicating the low influence of large industries and other local anthropogenic sources in león the carbonaceous fraction was dominated by doc showing the lowest values in summer and the highest in winter in summer the dissolved organic carbon concentrations could be connected to the transport of biogenic material from the south of the iberian peninsula and secondary organic carbon production while in winter they could be linked to traffic and fossil fuel primary emissions scavenging ratios show that i the soil derived coarse particles are effectively removed with the increase of the precipitation intensities ii for fine particles this process is more effective with long and continuous rainfall iii for ammonium they increase due to the incorporation of nh4 in gas phase to the drop regarding the removal coefficients the increase observed for full events versus 24 hour events indicate that the removal process is more efficient when the precipitation event is longer rainfall intensity also affects the efficiency of the scavenging process at low intensities the scavenging is favored by long and continuous rains while at intensities above 0 9 mm h 1 scavenging efficiency is favored when the rain duration is between 4 and 6 hours linear models for the prediction of the chemical composition of rainwater scavenging ratio and removal coefficients were constructed the results showed that only the amount of the water soluble ions in rainwater ca2 so4 2 no3 increases with the volume swept by the drops while the concentration of water insoluble organic and elemental carbon is affected by raindrop diameter and swept volume respectively the removal coefficients δc are affected by the air concentration of each species before precipitation by the duration of the precipitation event and by the elapsed time between two events the results confirm the influence of physicochemical properties of the rain and the chemical properties of aerosols in the elimination of atmospheric pollutants this work represents a further step in the study of the mechanisms of elimination of air pollutants proving that simple models can allow a first approach in the calculation of the removal efficiency of pollutants by rain in a region considering not only the chemical
