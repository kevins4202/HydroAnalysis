3300,karst water is an extremely important resource and can respond to precipitation events quickly due to the high rock exposure rate shallow and uneven soil layers and various crack sizes the impacts of this special rock soil structure type on hydrological processes are difficult to quantify mainlybecause the karst subsurface structure is very complex in this study lysimeters representing four rock soil structures with two rock exposure rates 50 and 80 and two soil thicknesses 5 cm and 20 cm were constructed at the puding karst ecosystem research station chinese academy of sciences the following results were obtained by observing the evaporation and leakage from september 2019 to august 2020 1 over a year the evaporation of the 80 rock exposure lysimeter was approximately 8 less than that of the 50 rock exposure lysimeter while the two lysimeters with different soil thicknesses had only a 2 difference in evaporation 2 the surface evaporation of different rock exposure rates varies greatly after different rainfall intensities however there was no significant change in surface evaporation between different soil thicknesses after rainfall of different intensities 3 generally with the increase in the rock exposure rate the infiltration coefficient nonlinearly increased the leakage coefficients for cracks of different sizes and different soil thicknesses were approximately 0 67 and 0 57 respectively 4 the amount of leakage and the time to reach the peak flow varied greatly among different rock soil structures and were also affected by the antecedent rainfall thus rock exposure has a great impact on surface evaporation after rainfall and the influence of cracks on subsurface hydrological processes was greater than that of soil thickness these findings can provide a scientific reference for water use and management practices in karst areas keywords rock soil structure evaporation leakage rainfall intensity lysimeter 1 introduction karst is widely distributed in the world accounting for approximately 12 of the land area hartmann et al 2014 approximately 20 25 of the world s water resources mainly depend on karst groundwater stevanovic 2018 providing water for nearly 25 of the world s population hartmann et al 2014 andreo 2012 due to the extremely complex surface cover conditions of karst the spatial differences in crack size rock exposure rate and soil thickness are obvious fig 1 and there are great differences in surface and subsurface hydrological processes in epikarst zones with different rock soil structures zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 fu et al 2007 ford and williams 2007 in karst areas when rain falls on the ground it quickly flows underground and collects in the discharge area resulting in a relative shortage of available water for surface vegetation luo et al 2014 as well as droughts and floods occurring frequently in laeuna nie et al 2012 the study of surface water evaporation and groundwater hydrological processes can reveal the regional water dynamics and transformation law guide drought and waterlogging prevention measures and direct the utilization and management of karst water resources generally the change in rock soil structure is considered to be an important factor causing the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture shen et al 2019 and such nonsoil components can be included in the soil profile to form a hydrological model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum ford and williams 2007 at the same time the geological structure and geomorphology of the surface can affect the surface hydrological processes seneviratne et al 2010 hamilton and ford 2002 previous studies have suggested that rock fragments resting on the soil surface or partly incorporated in the topsoil affect water leakage rock flow surface runoff and evaporation poesen and lavee 1994 an increase in the rock exposure rate can reduce the soil water demand per unit space reduce surface evaporation and increase water leakage at the rock soil interface zhao et al 2020 in addition simulation calculations have shown that the catchment exposure rate increased and decreased by 20 and that the evaporation decreased and increased by 13 1 and 11 2 respectively zhang et al 2013b although the above mentioned studies have shown that the rock exposure rate affects the surface evaporation process there are many factors affecting evaporation in a basin and it is difficult to accurately measure evaporation so it is difficult to explore the effects of different rock exposure rates and soil thickness on surface evaporation alone in the natural environment therefore more quantitative information to clarify the impact of rock soil structure on surface hydrological processes can make an effective contribution to further understanding the surface evaporation process of karst environment ferreira et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 poesen and lavee 1994 at the same time highly exposed rock cracks and thin soil layers all of which may have a significant impact on the process of infiltration and groundwater recharge sohrt et al 2014 result in rapid water infiltration into the deep subsurface goldscheider et al 2020 hao et al 2012 butscher and huggenberger 2009 one study observed a positive correlation between the stone coverage area and infiltration coefficient of soil wilcox et al 1988 moreover both soil thickness and rock porosity lead to the complexity of groundwater movement features bakalowicz 2005 jones et al 2000 this also shows that the rock soil structure has a great impact on the underground hydrological processes in addition rainfall intensity is also another important factor other studies divided runoff into fast flow and diffuse flow by using a principal regression curve and demonstrated the relationship between rainfall intensity and flow velocity with 5 times faster velocities for quick recharge flow than diffuse flow poulain et al 2018 and stream water was generated when rainfall intensity reached 10 15 mm h in a certain basin wang et al 2020a the above studies have pointed out that cracks soil thickness and rainfall intensity affect the subsurface hydrological processes however due to the change in meteorological conditions and the difference in geological conditions the hydrological processes of the surface and subsurface areas of karst change every year massei et al 2007 and there are many factors affecting the hydrological processes of the basin therefore how to quantify the influence of rock soil structure on the leakage coefficient and dynamic hydrological processes under different rainfall characteristics still needs to be studied in depth wang et al 2020a sohrt et al 2014 poesen and lavee 1994 it provides useful information for acknowledge of karst hydrological behaviours some previous studies have investigated the differences in evapotranspiration among different land use types by establishing a simulation test site hu et al 2018 the dynamic response of groundwater to hydrological factors has also been studied by simulating a karst aquifer system ding et al 2020 however the different structures of rock and soil can form various microenvironments on the surface and the subsurface structure is complex these factors makes the hydrological processes more complicated making it difficult to research its impact on the surface and groundwater hydrological processes in a natural watershed in view of the above ideas of simulation research we established four lysimeters with different rock soil structures according to the rock soil ratio 1 1 and 1 4 and soil thicknesses 5 cm and 20 cm and surface evaporation and subsurface leakage were monitored from september 2019 to august 2020 the present study aimed to quantitatively study 1 the influences of the rock soil structure on surface evaporation and groundwater hydrological processes and 2 the surface and subsurface hydrological responses of different rock soil structures after different rainfall intensities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lysimeters were located at the puding karst ecosystem research station chinese academy of sciences 26 14 26 15 n 105 42 105 43 e in puding county guizhou province southwest china there the annual average temperature is 15 1 c 33 c to 5 c the annual average sunshine hours are 1 165 h the annual average frost free period is 301 days the annual average humidity is 78 and the multiyear average precipitation is 1 315 mm 1 769 mm to 758 mm which is mainly concentrated in the rainy season may to october accounting for more than 80 of the total annual rainfall zhao et al 2010 2 2 lysimeter there were four lysimeters for simulating the water cycle in the epikarst zone with different rock soil structures fig 2 each lysimeter is 50 cm apart and is located in the outdoor natural environment the tanks were made of welded carbon steel with a thickness of 8 mm and a volume of 2 m 2 m 2 m to maintain stability the tank was placed on the weighing platform and supported by the weighing sensor which was placed on the foundation bed and the accuracy of the weighing system was 400 g there was a round outlet with a diameter of 15 mm at the bottom of each tank which was kept permanently open the leakage water directly flowed into the leakage bucket which was directly weighed by the weighing sensor the volume of the leakage bucket was 10 l and an automatic electronic valve was installed at the bottom when the total leakage was more than 3 kg the leakage bucket drained automatically and the accuracy of the leakage weighing system was 40 g it can be seen from the rock soil structure in the left figure fig 1 that the rock exposure rate is high and the crack size is different to facilitate the calculation of the rock exposure rate and crack size stones with regular shapes are used to fill the lysimeters in this study moreover the soil thickness in the dolomite area is shallow fig 1 and the exposure rate of the bedrock is low the method of direct soil covering is adopted in this study at the same time on the basis of long term field investigation and summarizing previous research wu et al 2021 high rock exposure rates of 50 and 80 and soil thicknesses of 5 cm and 20 cm are selected for comparative research to explore the impact of rock soil structures on surface evaporation and underground leakage previous studies have shown that the surface runoff yield in karst areas is less than 5 peng and wang 2012 chen et al 2020 therefore the collection and observation of surface runoff are not considered in this study the lysimeter of tank b1 was filled as follows a layer of 10 cm thick limestone gravel with particles approximately 0 5 cm in diameter formed by an inverted layer was placed at the bottom of tank b1 regular stones 2 15 cm 50 cm 47 cm were placed to reach a height of 90 cm fig 3 a and the gaps between the blocks were filled with rock powder to form the bedrock the upper part was composed of regular stones 1 50 cm 30 cm 15 cm and lime soil with a height of 100 cm in which the soil comes from lime soil in cracks in the natural environment therefore the surface rock exposure rate of b1 is 50 and the width of the cracks is 15 cm fig 3b the bottom treatment of tank b2 was the same as that of tank b1 but the difference in the rock soil structure was that the cracks included in the upper part were 5 cm wide and the surface rock exposure rate was 80 the bottom of tank t1 was filled with dolomite gravel that had passed through a 2 cm sieve with a height of 180 cm and a porosity of 0 4 fig 3c and the topsoil collected from the lime soil on a dolomite mountain was laid on top to form a layer with a thickness of 20 cm fig 3d the difference between tank t2 and tank t1 was that the thickness of the topsoil in tank t2 was 5 cm the soil physical properties and the rock chemical properties are shown in table 1 and table 2 2 3 data collection and calculation the construction of the lysimeters was completed in may 2018 and the development of the weighing sensor system was completed in august after one year the data of a whole hydrological year from september 2019 to august 2020 were used to capture the influences of rock soil structure on hydrological processes during this study period there was no vegetation on the surface and when any grass that grew was pulled out in time evaporation e leakage q and the aquifer infiltration coefficient α are important parameters for the evaluation of hydrological processes in this study evaporation was calculated as follows 1 e p q δ w 2 e p q w t w t 1 the aquifer infiltration coefficient α was calculated as follows 3 α q p where p is precipitation in mm q is the leakage which is directly measured by the leakage system and converted into the water level in mm and wt and wt 1 are the total weight of the tank at t hour and t 1 h respectively and unit area depth in mm the unit of e is mm among them q and w are directly measured by the weighing system and p is obtained by the rain gauge of the meteorological station when there is rainfall e can be calculated from the measured p and the changes in q and w when there is no rainfall e can be calculated from the difference between the change in w and q in addition meteorological parameters such as precipitation p air temperature t relative humidity rh net radiation rn and wind speed ws were obtained directly from the weather station approximately 100 m from the lysimeters at a frequency of once an hour 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss software ver 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between evaporation and meteorological factors of four lysimeters in rainy season and dry season the significant differences were evaluated at the p less than 0 05 and the very significant differences were evaluated at the p less than 0 01 the relationship between rainfall and leakage was analyzed by linear regression graphic plotting of curves was conducted with origin 9 2 origin lab northampton ma usa the schematic diagram of different rock soil structures was drawn with the autocad 2007 autodesk california usa software 3 results 3 1 meteorological factors the daily dynamic characteristics of the evaporation and meteorological factors p t rh ws and rn of the four rock soil structures are presented in fig 4 precipitation has obvious seasonal variation and is mainly concentrated from may to october accounting for 89 of the annual precipitation the temperature shows a trend of low in the dry season mean 11 c and high in the rainy season mean 21 8 c and the maximum and minimum daily average temperatures are 28 7 c and 3 c respectively with an annual average temperature of 16 4 c the fluctuation range of relative humidity is 45 100 and the annual average relative humidity is 80 the average wind speed from january to april is 1 9 m s and the average wind speed in other months is 1 4 m s the difference in rn between the dry season and rainy season is large and the average net radiation is 3 7 mj m2 in the dry season and 8 06 mj m2 in the rainy season due to the influence of uncontrollable factors power failure instrument failure etc the weighing system could not weigh the system resulting in the loss of data for several days in may june and july but it does not affect the analysis of the pattern of change in annual evaporation the surface evaporation of the four rock soil structures is generally low in the dry season following the seasonal variation trends of rainfall temperature and net radiation 3 2 evaporation process 3 2 1 changes in monthly evaporation the variations in monthly evaporation with rainfall in each of the four tanks are shown in fig 5 the surface evaporations of different rock soil structures are greatly affected by rainfall and have a good corresponding relationship with the seasonal variation in rainfall throughout the year evaporation in the rainy season accounts for approximately 70 of the total evaporation the annual evaporation of b1 b2 t1 and t2 are 390 mm 361 mm 498 mm and 486 mm respectively the evaporation in b1 is only 30 mm more than that in b2 the difference between t1 and t2 is very small the evaporation without rock exposure is higher than that with rock exposure which is approximately 100 120 mm year 1 however in the rainy season the evaporation without rock exposure is significantly higher than that with rock exposure up to approximately 10 27 mm month 1 in the dry season the surface evaporation results of the four simulation fields are similar and the highest is only 5 mm month 1 therefore the influence of the rock exposure rate on surface evaporation is mainly reflected in the rainy season it can be seen from fig 5 that the surface evaporation increased in january because the rainfall increased significantly in january resulting in an increase in surface evaporable water however the evaporation in october is higher than that in september which is related to the rainfall distribution combined with the daily rainfall in fig 4 it can be seen that the rainfall in september is concentrated in the first 10 days with strong surface evaporation in the early stage and weak surface evaporation in the later stage the total amount of rainfall in october is small but the distribution is discrete so the surface evaporation in the whole month will be higher the turning point of evaporation in june july and august is also related to rainfall and rainfall distribution at the same time the missing 6 day data in june have a certain error in the statistics of monthly evaporation therefore the total amount and distribution of rainfall can also affect surface evaporation however a few of vegetation on the surface of the lysimeter may not be removed in time during the study period which may affect the evapotranspiration 3 2 2 evaporation after different rainfall intensities the variation in surface evaporation after different rainfall intensities is presented in fig 6 there are significant differences in evaporation between b1 and b2 during heavy rainfall light rainfall and no rainfall periods after heavy rainfall which is a total rainfall in 12 h of more than 15 mm the surface evaporation of b2 is significantly higher than that of b1 with an average surface evaporation rate of 0 06 mm h and a maximum surface evaporation rate of 0 3 mm h however after light rainfall which is a total rainfall in 12 h of less than 15 mm the surface evaporation of b1 and b2 increases or decreases in a fluctuating manner but there is little difference overall nevertheless in the no rainfall periods the surface evaporation of b1 is initially slightly higher than that of b2 with an average value of 0 07 mm h however after different rainfall intensity events the surface evaporation of t1 and t2 shows the same change rule and no significant difference and thus does not change with the change in rainfall intensity therefore the surface evaporation after different rainfall intensities is significantly affected by the rock exposure rate but not by the soil thickness fig 6 this may be related to the water stored on the bare rock surface and the water evaporation on the rock surface is also part of the surface evaporation the silt and sand contents in soils with different thicknesses are 48 4 and 45 6 respectively the water holding capacity of soil is poor and the surface area affected by evaporation is the same so there is no significant difference in evaporation 3 3 leakage process 3 3 1 the leakage and infiltration coefficient table 3 shows that the total leakages of the four lysimeters during the observation period are between 790 mm and 917 mm and 96 of the leakage is concentrated in the rainy season among them the total leakage of b1 is only 10 mm higher than that of b2 and the difference in the infiltration coefficient is approximately 1 however due to the difference in rainfall in each month the leakage of b1 and b2 is obviously different especially in january and april the leakage of b2 is significantly higher than that of b1 because rainwater mainly infiltrates along the rock soil interface and the area of the rock soil interface of b2 is greater than that of b1 at the same time because some water can be retained in the soil and pores of different rock soil structures which will lead to leakage lag resulting in the sum of evaporation and leakage being higher than rainfall the total amount of leakage in t1 is only 17 mm lower than that in t2 and the difference in the infiltration coefficient is approximately 2 but the difference between the two is small relative to the difference in rainfall however there is a large difference in the amount of leakage between structures with cracks b1 b2 and without cracks t1 t2 which is approximately 100 mm and the difference in the infiltration coefficient is up to 10 therefore in the case of the same rainfall the leakage is affected by the rock soil structure and thus varies among the lysimeters indicating that the hydrological processes are affected by the rock soil structure 3 3 2 leakage after different rainfall intensities the dynamic characteristics of leakage at each lysimeter are shown in fig 7 the time series analysis of runoff during rainfall shows that when the continuous rainfall is more than 10 mm h the leakage of the epikarst zone increases significantly there were two observation periods of note september 6 10 2019 june 15 25 2020 in the first observation period there were two continuous heavy rainfall events with total precipitations of 63 8 mm and 108 2 mm and maximum rainfall intensities of 15 mm h and 14 8 mm h respectively the peak times of the leakage in the structure with cracks b1 b2 are significantly faster than those of the structure without cracks t1 t2 in the period fig 8 additionally the peak flows of the structure with cracks are higher however in the second observation period there was one heavy rainfall event and three moderate rainfall events with rainfalls of 13 8 mm and 60 4 mm and 23 6 mm and 20 4 mm respectively and the maximum rainfall intensities were 11 6 mm h and 31 4 mm h and 16 4 mm h and 6 2 mm h respectively at this stage the time when the leakage of the four lysimeters reaches the peak value is quite different but the peak flow of the lysimeters with different crack sizes b1 b2 is also higher than that of the structures with different soil thicknesses t1 t2 the reasons for the above differences among different rock soil structures may be mainly affected by the total amount of rainfall rainfall intensity and rainfall in the early stage the two rainfall events in the first period are higher than the two rainfall events with the same maximum rainfall intensity in the second period and their peak leakage is greater when the rainfall intensity increases the rainwater will rapidly infiltrate through the preferential flow fissure flow and soil saturated infiltration formed at the rock soil interface therefore for the two rainfall events with the same total rainfall in the two periods the greater the rainfall intensity is the greater the leakage and the faster the time to reach the peak in the second period the maximum rainfall intensity of 16 4 mm h is smaller than that of 6 2 mm h which is related to whether there is rainfall in the early stage however under the same rainfall conditions the leakage process between different rock soil structures were also different which also shows that the rainfall intensity and rock soil structure have a great impact on the hydrological process 4 discussion 4 1 effect of environmental factors on evaporation many previous studies have analysed the effects of environmental factors on evapotranspiration for example in the temperate climate of oklahoma usa relative humidity and temperature have the greatest impacts on evapotranspiration coleman and decoursey 1976 under the arid and semiarid climate of cultivated land in iran the main controlling factor of evapotranspiration is solar radiation nouri et al 2017 in the various geomorphic landscapes in the yangtze river basin relative humidity has the greatest impact on evapotranspiration followed by shortwave radiation temperature and wind speed gong et al 2006 in australian woodlands precipitation is a key factor affecting evapotranspiration zeppel et al 2008 the spatial variation in surface evapotranspiration in china is mainly dominated by annual total net radiation average annual precipitation and average temperature zheng et al 2016 in karst areas temperature precipitation and photosynthetic effective radiation have a greater impact on evapotranspiration while wind speed and relative humidity have less of an impact zhang et al 2018 through the pearson correlation analysis table 4 this study shows that in the dry season the net radiation shows a very significant positive correlation while the relative humidity shows a very significant negative correlation in the rainy season except for the rock soil structure with a rock exposure rate of 80 other rock soil structures have a very significant positive correlation with temperature wind speed and net radiation generally wind speed and relative humidity promote evaporation lenters et al 2005 as rainwater directly supplies soil water it affects surface evaporation in the dry season due to the lower rainfall and the higher the relative humidity is the smaller the surface evaporation however in the rainy season the greater the rainfall is the higher the temperature wind speed and net radiation resulting in a higher surface evaporation intensity however the rock soil structure with an 80 rock exposure rate may be affected by many cracks rapid rainwater and evaporation of rock moisture resulting in a significant relationship between evaporation and wind speed and net radiation 4 2 response of surface evaporation to rainfall events in the same environment because there are no plants in the bare land surface evaporation is mainly affected by the surface environment the lower the rock exposure is the larger the soil surface area under evaporation and the higher the evaporation however for the completely covered cases the annual evaporation of t1 is only 12 mm higher than that of t2 because of the water holding capacity of the soil evaporation mainly occurs at the surface and the thicker soil has a higher water supply capacity a model has been used to calculate that soil evaporation decreases by 13 1 when the rock exposure rate of the basin increases by 20 and that the soil evaporation increases by 11 2 when the rock exposure rate of the basin decreases by 20 zhang et al 2013b notably precipitation has a significant promoting effect on evapotranspiration the transpiration of plants increases significantly after rain p greater than 20 mm day 1 zeppel et al 2008 and the rocks on the surface of the soil affect rainfall interception and surface evaporation poesen and lavee 1994 we find that there is a significant difference in evaporation between the experimental sites with different rock exposure rates after different intensities of rainfall events in contrast there is little difference in evaporation between the simulated fields with different soil thicknesses this may be because after a heavy rainfall event the rock is sufficiently wet part of the rainwater is stored as rock moisture rempea and dietrich 2018 or some rainwater from a depression on the rock surface and the specific heat capacity of rock is lower than that of soil these factors lead to the evaporation of the rock surface being stronger than that of the soil for a short time after the rainfall event when the evaporation of the rock surface is dominant the higher the exposure rate of the rock is the greater the evaporation however after a light rainfall event the difference in evaporation between the soil and rock surfaces is small during a long period of no rainfall evaporation is mainly from the soil thus evaporation is greater for a lower rock exposure rate when there is no exposed rock evaporation is only controlled by the soil so after any rain the difference in evaporation between the structures with different soil thicknesses has little difference therefore the rock exposure rate significantly affects the surface evaporation after any intensity of rainfall while the soil thickness has little effect on the surface evaporation 4 3 influence of the rock soil structure on the infiltration coefficient the infiltration coefficient of the epikarst zone is controlled by the rock soil structure however the infiltration coefficient is different under different rainfall intensities the initial water filling degree of the crack structure in the epikarst zone greatly affects the rainfall infiltration thus affecting the storage capacity of the epikarst zone zou et al 2005 a previous study pointed out that the infiltration coefficient of a simulation field with a soil thickness of 50 cm is 0 57 while the infiltration coefficient of a simulation field with a rock exposure rate of 100 is 0 9 zeng et al 2017 according to the results of this study table 3 the infiltration coefficient is less than 0 6 in the case of no exposed rock more than 0 6 in the case with some exposed rock and 0 9 in the case of 100 rock exposure zeng et al 2017 with the increase in the rock exposure rate the infiltration coefficient nonlinearly increases which may be mainly related to surface evaporation when there is no exposed rock due to the interception and conservation of soil water the surface evaporates a large amount of water resulting in a small infiltration coefficient when there are exposed rocks and cracks part of the rainwater flows into the ground quickly and the amount of surface water that evaporates is small which leads to an increase in the infiltration coefficient when the rock exposure rate is 100 rainfall flows into the ground rapidly the evaporation of rock moisture is the main part and the evaporated water is about 10 a possible explanation for this trend is that the increase in rock exposure gradually decreases the soil quantity and soil moisture storage capacity per unit of space and increases the water leakage at the soil rock interface zhao et al 2020 however the relative change in the rock exposure rate and soil thickness has little influence on the infiltration coefficient for example when the soil thickness increases from 5 cm to 50 cm or the rock exposure rate increases from 50 to 80 the difference in the infiltration coefficient is small this may be related to the local rainfall characteristics because approximately 90 of the precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season the thin soil and the existence of cracks lead to the rapid infiltration of rainfall jiang et al 2020 auler and smart 2003 so the influence of the relative change in the rock soil ratio and soil layer thickness is different over a short time but the difference is not obvious on the interannual scale 4 4 hydrological responses of subsurface leakage to rainfall events the relationship between the daily rainfall and the daily leakage fig 9 shows that the relationship between daily leakage and daily rainfall in the rainy season is the same as that in the whole year however in rainfall events there are obvious differences between the rainy season and dry season and the leakage of epikarst with cracks is obviously high water can flow rapidly along the rock and redistribute in the epikarst zone because of the cracks present fu et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a many studies of natural watersheds show that rainfall intensity has a significant influence on the peak value and duration of spring discharge but the effect of the epikarst zone on the peak discharge is small ding et al 2020 moreover if the total amount of discontinuous rainfall is more than 6 mm and the rainfall intensity is more than 0 8 mm h a spring will cause the corresponding occurrence unless there is a recent rainstorm to wet the soil winston and criss 2004 the flow will also be affected by antecedent rainfall fu et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a b from the relationship between rainfall and leakage in the dry season it can be seen that when the rainfall is less than 15 mm h the leakage of the four rock soil structures does not increase significantly which is mainly due to the soil drought and the rainwater is stored in the soil or rock pores resulting in the reduction of leakage however when the rainfall is 0 8 mm h and 9 2 mm h the leakage of structures with rock exposure rate of 80 is 4 06 mm h and 1 59 mm h respectively which is higher than that of structures with rock exposure rate of 50 that is caused by the rapid infiltration of rainwater along the crack and the delay effect under a certain rainfall intensity 4 5 implications karst areas are usually characterized by high biodiversity and great heterogeneity in ecological patterns and hydrological processes clements et al 2006 the topsoil in karst areas is thin and epikarst zones with fractures are the key to vegetation transpiration and water storage and transportation zhang et al 2013b continuous monitoring on an hourly scale in this study reveals the impact of the rock soil structure on surface and subsurface hydrological processes especially the hydrological response characteristics after different rainfall intensities on the one hand the research results provide a reference basis for using a model to estimate surface water evaporation in different regions owing to evaporation from rock may be an important part of surface evaporation evaporation from rock should be considered in sprinkler irrigation measures in rock exposed areas rational planning of irrigation facilities and water conservation on the other hand for areas with cracks and thin soil the groundwater hydrological response is fast thus it should be considered in the design and construction of small water cellar in the high level depressions in karst areas according to local conditions and irrigate sporadic cultivated land in the dry season reasonable drainage measures such as ditches and trenches should be established in low lying areas to reduce waterlogging disasters in rainy season the research results can provide not only a scientific reference for water use and management such as ecological restoration drought prevention and drainage in karst areas with different rock exposure rates soil layer thicknesses and rainfall intensities but also valuable information for the later study of the hydrological processes between rock and soil plant atmosphere continuum spac systems in karst areas however bedrock can also affect surface vegetation praeg et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 and the hydrological processes influenced by rock soil plant atmosphere interactions are worthy of further exploration in addition this study was based on the simulated experimental and has obtained some understanding but there are still some limitations for example the top fine soil will migrate penetrate into the dolomitic particles in subsequent rain events and when there is a variation in partialpressureof co2 values the dissolution of carbonates in an evaporation prevailing environment tends to dissolve the carbonates and precipitates in the pore spaces what is the influence of these processes on the permeability and porosity of the simulated experimental which needs to be further explored moreover a variety of research methods should be combined to conduct comparative research and verification of natural catchments and simulated experimental in the future 5 conclusions evaporation is mainly affected by net radiation and relative humidity in the dry season while in the rainy season it is mainly affected by temperature wind speed and net radiation when the rock exposure rate at the lysimeter increased from 50 to 80 the surface evaporation was reduced by approximately 8 while the difference in evaporation between the two structures with different soil thicknesses was only 2 the evaporation of rock moisture may be a part of surface evaporation which affects the surface evaporation after different rainfall intensities while the evaporation from surfaces without exposed rocks has no significant difference after different rainfall intensities cracks and soil thickness have little effect on the leakage coefficient but the leakage coefficient with or without cracks is quite different the leakage of the epikarst zone is significantly affected by rainfall intensity but the rock soil structure will also affect the leakage and the time to reach the peak flow and is affected by the antecedent rainfall these findings can provide a scientific reference for water use and management practices such as ecological restoration drought prevention and drainage in karst areas and valuable information for the later study of the hydrological processes between rock and soil plant atmosphere continuum spac systems in karst areas credit

3300,karst water is an extremely important resource and can respond to precipitation events quickly due to the high rock exposure rate shallow and uneven soil layers and various crack sizes the impacts of this special rock soil structure type on hydrological processes are difficult to quantify mainlybecause the karst subsurface structure is very complex in this study lysimeters representing four rock soil structures with two rock exposure rates 50 and 80 and two soil thicknesses 5 cm and 20 cm were constructed at the puding karst ecosystem research station chinese academy of sciences the following results were obtained by observing the evaporation and leakage from september 2019 to august 2020 1 over a year the evaporation of the 80 rock exposure lysimeter was approximately 8 less than that of the 50 rock exposure lysimeter while the two lysimeters with different soil thicknesses had only a 2 difference in evaporation 2 the surface evaporation of different rock exposure rates varies greatly after different rainfall intensities however there was no significant change in surface evaporation between different soil thicknesses after rainfall of different intensities 3 generally with the increase in the rock exposure rate the infiltration coefficient nonlinearly increased the leakage coefficients for cracks of different sizes and different soil thicknesses were approximately 0 67 and 0 57 respectively 4 the amount of leakage and the time to reach the peak flow varied greatly among different rock soil structures and were also affected by the antecedent rainfall thus rock exposure has a great impact on surface evaporation after rainfall and the influence of cracks on subsurface hydrological processes was greater than that of soil thickness these findings can provide a scientific reference for water use and management practices in karst areas keywords rock soil structure evaporation leakage rainfall intensity lysimeter 1 introduction karst is widely distributed in the world accounting for approximately 12 of the land area hartmann et al 2014 approximately 20 25 of the world s water resources mainly depend on karst groundwater stevanovic 2018 providing water for nearly 25 of the world s population hartmann et al 2014 andreo 2012 due to the extremely complex surface cover conditions of karst the spatial differences in crack size rock exposure rate and soil thickness are obvious fig 1 and there are great differences in surface and subsurface hydrological processes in epikarst zones with different rock soil structures zhang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 fu et al 2007 ford and williams 2007 in karst areas when rain falls on the ground it quickly flows underground and collects in the discharge area resulting in a relative shortage of available water for surface vegetation luo et al 2014 as well as droughts and floods occurring frequently in laeuna nie et al 2012 the study of surface water evaporation and groundwater hydrological processes can reveal the regional water dynamics and transformation law guide drought and waterlogging prevention measures and direct the utilization and management of karst water resources generally the change in rock soil structure is considered to be an important factor causing the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture shen et al 2019 and such nonsoil components can be included in the soil profile to form a hydrological model of the soil plant atmosphere continuum ford and williams 2007 at the same time the geological structure and geomorphology of the surface can affect the surface hydrological processes seneviratne et al 2010 hamilton and ford 2002 previous studies have suggested that rock fragments resting on the soil surface or partly incorporated in the topsoil affect water leakage rock flow surface runoff and evaporation poesen and lavee 1994 an increase in the rock exposure rate can reduce the soil water demand per unit space reduce surface evaporation and increase water leakage at the rock soil interface zhao et al 2020 in addition simulation calculations have shown that the catchment exposure rate increased and decreased by 20 and that the evaporation decreased and increased by 13 1 and 11 2 respectively zhang et al 2013b although the above mentioned studies have shown that the rock exposure rate affects the surface evaporation process there are many factors affecting evaporation in a basin and it is difficult to accurately measure evaporation so it is difficult to explore the effects of different rock exposure rates and soil thickness on surface evaporation alone in the natural environment therefore more quantitative information to clarify the impact of rock soil structure on surface hydrological processes can make an effective contribution to further understanding the surface evaporation process of karst environment ferreira et al 2021 zhao et al 2018 poesen and lavee 1994 at the same time highly exposed rock cracks and thin soil layers all of which may have a significant impact on the process of infiltration and groundwater recharge sohrt et al 2014 result in rapid water infiltration into the deep subsurface goldscheider et al 2020 hao et al 2012 butscher and huggenberger 2009 one study observed a positive correlation between the stone coverage area and infiltration coefficient of soil wilcox et al 1988 moreover both soil thickness and rock porosity lead to the complexity of groundwater movement features bakalowicz 2005 jones et al 2000 this also shows that the rock soil structure has a great impact on the underground hydrological processes in addition rainfall intensity is also another important factor other studies divided runoff into fast flow and diffuse flow by using a principal regression curve and demonstrated the relationship between rainfall intensity and flow velocity with 5 times faster velocities for quick recharge flow than diffuse flow poulain et al 2018 and stream water was generated when rainfall intensity reached 10 15 mm h in a certain basin wang et al 2020a the above studies have pointed out that cracks soil thickness and rainfall intensity affect the subsurface hydrological processes however due to the change in meteorological conditions and the difference in geological conditions the hydrological processes of the surface and subsurface areas of karst change every year massei et al 2007 and there are many factors affecting the hydrological processes of the basin therefore how to quantify the influence of rock soil structure on the leakage coefficient and dynamic hydrological processes under different rainfall characteristics still needs to be studied in depth wang et al 2020a sohrt et al 2014 poesen and lavee 1994 it provides useful information for acknowledge of karst hydrological behaviours some previous studies have investigated the differences in evapotranspiration among different land use types by establishing a simulation test site hu et al 2018 the dynamic response of groundwater to hydrological factors has also been studied by simulating a karst aquifer system ding et al 2020 however the different structures of rock and soil can form various microenvironments on the surface and the subsurface structure is complex these factors makes the hydrological processes more complicated making it difficult to research its impact on the surface and groundwater hydrological processes in a natural watershed in view of the above ideas of simulation research we established four lysimeters with different rock soil structures according to the rock soil ratio 1 1 and 1 4 and soil thicknesses 5 cm and 20 cm and surface evaporation and subsurface leakage were monitored from september 2019 to august 2020 the present study aimed to quantitatively study 1 the influences of the rock soil structure on surface evaporation and groundwater hydrological processes and 2 the surface and subsurface hydrological responses of different rock soil structures after different rainfall intensities 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lysimeters were located at the puding karst ecosystem research station chinese academy of sciences 26 14 26 15 n 105 42 105 43 e in puding county guizhou province southwest china there the annual average temperature is 15 1 c 33 c to 5 c the annual average sunshine hours are 1 165 h the annual average frost free period is 301 days the annual average humidity is 78 and the multiyear average precipitation is 1 315 mm 1 769 mm to 758 mm which is mainly concentrated in the rainy season may to october accounting for more than 80 of the total annual rainfall zhao et al 2010 2 2 lysimeter there were four lysimeters for simulating the water cycle in the epikarst zone with different rock soil structures fig 2 each lysimeter is 50 cm apart and is located in the outdoor natural environment the tanks were made of welded carbon steel with a thickness of 8 mm and a volume of 2 m 2 m 2 m to maintain stability the tank was placed on the weighing platform and supported by the weighing sensor which was placed on the foundation bed and the accuracy of the weighing system was 400 g there was a round outlet with a diameter of 15 mm at the bottom of each tank which was kept permanently open the leakage water directly flowed into the leakage bucket which was directly weighed by the weighing sensor the volume of the leakage bucket was 10 l and an automatic electronic valve was installed at the bottom when the total leakage was more than 3 kg the leakage bucket drained automatically and the accuracy of the leakage weighing system was 40 g it can be seen from the rock soil structure in the left figure fig 1 that the rock exposure rate is high and the crack size is different to facilitate the calculation of the rock exposure rate and crack size stones with regular shapes are used to fill the lysimeters in this study moreover the soil thickness in the dolomite area is shallow fig 1 and the exposure rate of the bedrock is low the method of direct soil covering is adopted in this study at the same time on the basis of long term field investigation and summarizing previous research wu et al 2021 high rock exposure rates of 50 and 80 and soil thicknesses of 5 cm and 20 cm are selected for comparative research to explore the impact of rock soil structures on surface evaporation and underground leakage previous studies have shown that the surface runoff yield in karst areas is less than 5 peng and wang 2012 chen et al 2020 therefore the collection and observation of surface runoff are not considered in this study the lysimeter of tank b1 was filled as follows a layer of 10 cm thick limestone gravel with particles approximately 0 5 cm in diameter formed by an inverted layer was placed at the bottom of tank b1 regular stones 2 15 cm 50 cm 47 cm were placed to reach a height of 90 cm fig 3 a and the gaps between the blocks were filled with rock powder to form the bedrock the upper part was composed of regular stones 1 50 cm 30 cm 15 cm and lime soil with a height of 100 cm in which the soil comes from lime soil in cracks in the natural environment therefore the surface rock exposure rate of b1 is 50 and the width of the cracks is 15 cm fig 3b the bottom treatment of tank b2 was the same as that of tank b1 but the difference in the rock soil structure was that the cracks included in the upper part were 5 cm wide and the surface rock exposure rate was 80 the bottom of tank t1 was filled with dolomite gravel that had passed through a 2 cm sieve with a height of 180 cm and a porosity of 0 4 fig 3c and the topsoil collected from the lime soil on a dolomite mountain was laid on top to form a layer with a thickness of 20 cm fig 3d the difference between tank t2 and tank t1 was that the thickness of the topsoil in tank t2 was 5 cm the soil physical properties and the rock chemical properties are shown in table 1 and table 2 2 3 data collection and calculation the construction of the lysimeters was completed in may 2018 and the development of the weighing sensor system was completed in august after one year the data of a whole hydrological year from september 2019 to august 2020 were used to capture the influences of rock soil structure on hydrological processes during this study period there was no vegetation on the surface and when any grass that grew was pulled out in time evaporation e leakage q and the aquifer infiltration coefficient α are important parameters for the evaluation of hydrological processes in this study evaporation was calculated as follows 1 e p q δ w 2 e p q w t w t 1 the aquifer infiltration coefficient α was calculated as follows 3 α q p where p is precipitation in mm q is the leakage which is directly measured by the leakage system and converted into the water level in mm and wt and wt 1 are the total weight of the tank at t hour and t 1 h respectively and unit area depth in mm the unit of e is mm among them q and w are directly measured by the weighing system and p is obtained by the rain gauge of the meteorological station when there is rainfall e can be calculated from the measured p and the changes in q and w when there is no rainfall e can be calculated from the difference between the change in w and q in addition meteorological parameters such as precipitation p air temperature t relative humidity rh net radiation rn and wind speed ws were obtained directly from the weather station approximately 100 m from the lysimeters at a frequency of once an hour 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analysis was conducted using spss software ver 19 0 spss inc chicago il usa pearson correlation analysis was used to explore the correlation between evaporation and meteorological factors of four lysimeters in rainy season and dry season the significant differences were evaluated at the p less than 0 05 and the very significant differences were evaluated at the p less than 0 01 the relationship between rainfall and leakage was analyzed by linear regression graphic plotting of curves was conducted with origin 9 2 origin lab northampton ma usa the schematic diagram of different rock soil structures was drawn with the autocad 2007 autodesk california usa software 3 results 3 1 meteorological factors the daily dynamic characteristics of the evaporation and meteorological factors p t rh ws and rn of the four rock soil structures are presented in fig 4 precipitation has obvious seasonal variation and is mainly concentrated from may to october accounting for 89 of the annual precipitation the temperature shows a trend of low in the dry season mean 11 c and high in the rainy season mean 21 8 c and the maximum and minimum daily average temperatures are 28 7 c and 3 c respectively with an annual average temperature of 16 4 c the fluctuation range of relative humidity is 45 100 and the annual average relative humidity is 80 the average wind speed from january to april is 1 9 m s and the average wind speed in other months is 1 4 m s the difference in rn between the dry season and rainy season is large and the average net radiation is 3 7 mj m2 in the dry season and 8 06 mj m2 in the rainy season due to the influence of uncontrollable factors power failure instrument failure etc the weighing system could not weigh the system resulting in the loss of data for several days in may june and july but it does not affect the analysis of the pattern of change in annual evaporation the surface evaporation of the four rock soil structures is generally low in the dry season following the seasonal variation trends of rainfall temperature and net radiation 3 2 evaporation process 3 2 1 changes in monthly evaporation the variations in monthly evaporation with rainfall in each of the four tanks are shown in fig 5 the surface evaporations of different rock soil structures are greatly affected by rainfall and have a good corresponding relationship with the seasonal variation in rainfall throughout the year evaporation in the rainy season accounts for approximately 70 of the total evaporation the annual evaporation of b1 b2 t1 and t2 are 390 mm 361 mm 498 mm and 486 mm respectively the evaporation in b1 is only 30 mm more than that in b2 the difference between t1 and t2 is very small the evaporation without rock exposure is higher than that with rock exposure which is approximately 100 120 mm year 1 however in the rainy season the evaporation without rock exposure is significantly higher than that with rock exposure up to approximately 10 27 mm month 1 in the dry season the surface evaporation results of the four simulation fields are similar and the highest is only 5 mm month 1 therefore the influence of the rock exposure rate on surface evaporation is mainly reflected in the rainy season it can be seen from fig 5 that the surface evaporation increased in january because the rainfall increased significantly in january resulting in an increase in surface evaporable water however the evaporation in october is higher than that in september which is related to the rainfall distribution combined with the daily rainfall in fig 4 it can be seen that the rainfall in september is concentrated in the first 10 days with strong surface evaporation in the early stage and weak surface evaporation in the later stage the total amount of rainfall in october is small but the distribution is discrete so the surface evaporation in the whole month will be higher the turning point of evaporation in june july and august is also related to rainfall and rainfall distribution at the same time the missing 6 day data in june have a certain error in the statistics of monthly evaporation therefore the total amount and distribution of rainfall can also affect surface evaporation however a few of vegetation on the surface of the lysimeter may not be removed in time during the study period which may affect the evapotranspiration 3 2 2 evaporation after different rainfall intensities the variation in surface evaporation after different rainfall intensities is presented in fig 6 there are significant differences in evaporation between b1 and b2 during heavy rainfall light rainfall and no rainfall periods after heavy rainfall which is a total rainfall in 12 h of more than 15 mm the surface evaporation of b2 is significantly higher than that of b1 with an average surface evaporation rate of 0 06 mm h and a maximum surface evaporation rate of 0 3 mm h however after light rainfall which is a total rainfall in 12 h of less than 15 mm the surface evaporation of b1 and b2 increases or decreases in a fluctuating manner but there is little difference overall nevertheless in the no rainfall periods the surface evaporation of b1 is initially slightly higher than that of b2 with an average value of 0 07 mm h however after different rainfall intensity events the surface evaporation of t1 and t2 shows the same change rule and no significant difference and thus does not change with the change in rainfall intensity therefore the surface evaporation after different rainfall intensities is significantly affected by the rock exposure rate but not by the soil thickness fig 6 this may be related to the water stored on the bare rock surface and the water evaporation on the rock surface is also part of the surface evaporation the silt and sand contents in soils with different thicknesses are 48 4 and 45 6 respectively the water holding capacity of soil is poor and the surface area affected by evaporation is the same so there is no significant difference in evaporation 3 3 leakage process 3 3 1 the leakage and infiltration coefficient table 3 shows that the total leakages of the four lysimeters during the observation period are between 790 mm and 917 mm and 96 of the leakage is concentrated in the rainy season among them the total leakage of b1 is only 10 mm higher than that of b2 and the difference in the infiltration coefficient is approximately 1 however due to the difference in rainfall in each month the leakage of b1 and b2 is obviously different especially in january and april the leakage of b2 is significantly higher than that of b1 because rainwater mainly infiltrates along the rock soil interface and the area of the rock soil interface of b2 is greater than that of b1 at the same time because some water can be retained in the soil and pores of different rock soil structures which will lead to leakage lag resulting in the sum of evaporation and leakage being higher than rainfall the total amount of leakage in t1 is only 17 mm lower than that in t2 and the difference in the infiltration coefficient is approximately 2 but the difference between the two is small relative to the difference in rainfall however there is a large difference in the amount of leakage between structures with cracks b1 b2 and without cracks t1 t2 which is approximately 100 mm and the difference in the infiltration coefficient is up to 10 therefore in the case of the same rainfall the leakage is affected by the rock soil structure and thus varies among the lysimeters indicating that the hydrological processes are affected by the rock soil structure 3 3 2 leakage after different rainfall intensities the dynamic characteristics of leakage at each lysimeter are shown in fig 7 the time series analysis of runoff during rainfall shows that when the continuous rainfall is more than 10 mm h the leakage of the epikarst zone increases significantly there were two observation periods of note september 6 10 2019 june 15 25 2020 in the first observation period there were two continuous heavy rainfall events with total precipitations of 63 8 mm and 108 2 mm and maximum rainfall intensities of 15 mm h and 14 8 mm h respectively the peak times of the leakage in the structure with cracks b1 b2 are significantly faster than those of the structure without cracks t1 t2 in the period fig 8 additionally the peak flows of the structure with cracks are higher however in the second observation period there was one heavy rainfall event and three moderate rainfall events with rainfalls of 13 8 mm and 60 4 mm and 23 6 mm and 20 4 mm respectively and the maximum rainfall intensities were 11 6 mm h and 31 4 mm h and 16 4 mm h and 6 2 mm h respectively at this stage the time when the leakage of the four lysimeters reaches the peak value is quite different but the peak flow of the lysimeters with different crack sizes b1 b2 is also higher than that of the structures with different soil thicknesses t1 t2 the reasons for the above differences among different rock soil structures may be mainly affected by the total amount of rainfall rainfall intensity and rainfall in the early stage the two rainfall events in the first period are higher than the two rainfall events with the same maximum rainfall intensity in the second period and their peak leakage is greater when the rainfall intensity increases the rainwater will rapidly infiltrate through the preferential flow fissure flow and soil saturated infiltration formed at the rock soil interface therefore for the two rainfall events with the same total rainfall in the two periods the greater the rainfall intensity is the greater the leakage and the faster the time to reach the peak in the second period the maximum rainfall intensity of 16 4 mm h is smaller than that of 6 2 mm h which is related to whether there is rainfall in the early stage however under the same rainfall conditions the leakage process between different rock soil structures were also different which also shows that the rainfall intensity and rock soil structure have a great impact on the hydrological process 4 discussion 4 1 effect of environmental factors on evaporation many previous studies have analysed the effects of environmental factors on evapotranspiration for example in the temperate climate of oklahoma usa relative humidity and temperature have the greatest impacts on evapotranspiration coleman and decoursey 1976 under the arid and semiarid climate of cultivated land in iran the main controlling factor of evapotranspiration is solar radiation nouri et al 2017 in the various geomorphic landscapes in the yangtze river basin relative humidity has the greatest impact on evapotranspiration followed by shortwave radiation temperature and wind speed gong et al 2006 in australian woodlands precipitation is a key factor affecting evapotranspiration zeppel et al 2008 the spatial variation in surface evapotranspiration in china is mainly dominated by annual total net radiation average annual precipitation and average temperature zheng et al 2016 in karst areas temperature precipitation and photosynthetic effective radiation have a greater impact on evapotranspiration while wind speed and relative humidity have less of an impact zhang et al 2018 through the pearson correlation analysis table 4 this study shows that in the dry season the net radiation shows a very significant positive correlation while the relative humidity shows a very significant negative correlation in the rainy season except for the rock soil structure with a rock exposure rate of 80 other rock soil structures have a very significant positive correlation with temperature wind speed and net radiation generally wind speed and relative humidity promote evaporation lenters et al 2005 as rainwater directly supplies soil water it affects surface evaporation in the dry season due to the lower rainfall and the higher the relative humidity is the smaller the surface evaporation however in the rainy season the greater the rainfall is the higher the temperature wind speed and net radiation resulting in a higher surface evaporation intensity however the rock soil structure with an 80 rock exposure rate may be affected by many cracks rapid rainwater and evaporation of rock moisture resulting in a significant relationship between evaporation and wind speed and net radiation 4 2 response of surface evaporation to rainfall events in the same environment because there are no plants in the bare land surface evaporation is mainly affected by the surface environment the lower the rock exposure is the larger the soil surface area under evaporation and the higher the evaporation however for the completely covered cases the annual evaporation of t1 is only 12 mm higher than that of t2 because of the water holding capacity of the soil evaporation mainly occurs at the surface and the thicker soil has a higher water supply capacity a model has been used to calculate that soil evaporation decreases by 13 1 when the rock exposure rate of the basin increases by 20 and that the soil evaporation increases by 11 2 when the rock exposure rate of the basin decreases by 20 zhang et al 2013b notably precipitation has a significant promoting effect on evapotranspiration the transpiration of plants increases significantly after rain p greater than 20 mm day 1 zeppel et al 2008 and the rocks on the surface of the soil affect rainfall interception and surface evaporation poesen and lavee 1994 we find that there is a significant difference in evaporation between the experimental sites with different rock exposure rates after different intensities of rainfall events in contrast there is little difference in evaporation between the simulated fields with different soil thicknesses this may be because after a heavy rainfall event the rock is sufficiently wet part of the rainwater is stored as rock moisture rempea and dietrich 2018 or some rainwater from a depression on the rock surface and the specific heat capacity of rock is lower than that of soil these factors lead to the evaporation of the rock surface being stronger than that of the soil for a short time after the rainfall event when the evaporation of the rock surface is dominant the higher the exposure rate of the rock is the greater the evaporation however after a light rainfall event the difference in evaporation between the soil and rock surfaces is small during a long period of no rainfall evaporation is mainly from the soil thus evaporation is greater for a lower rock exposure rate when there is no exposed rock evaporation is only controlled by the soil so after any rain the difference in evaporation between the structures with different soil thicknesses has little difference therefore the rock exposure rate significantly affects the surface evaporation after any intensity of rainfall while the soil thickness has little effect on the surface evaporation 4 3 influence of the rock soil structure on the infiltration coefficient the infiltration coefficient of the epikarst zone is controlled by the rock soil structure however the infiltration coefficient is different under different rainfall intensities the initial water filling degree of the crack structure in the epikarst zone greatly affects the rainfall infiltration thus affecting the storage capacity of the epikarst zone zou et al 2005 a previous study pointed out that the infiltration coefficient of a simulation field with a soil thickness of 50 cm is 0 57 while the infiltration coefficient of a simulation field with a rock exposure rate of 100 is 0 9 zeng et al 2017 according to the results of this study table 3 the infiltration coefficient is less than 0 6 in the case of no exposed rock more than 0 6 in the case with some exposed rock and 0 9 in the case of 100 rock exposure zeng et al 2017 with the increase in the rock exposure rate the infiltration coefficient nonlinearly increases which may be mainly related to surface evaporation when there is no exposed rock due to the interception and conservation of soil water the surface evaporates a large amount of water resulting in a small infiltration coefficient when there are exposed rocks and cracks part of the rainwater flows into the ground quickly and the amount of surface water that evaporates is small which leads to an increase in the infiltration coefficient when the rock exposure rate is 100 rainfall flows into the ground rapidly the evaporation of rock moisture is the main part and the evaporated water is about 10 a possible explanation for this trend is that the increase in rock exposure gradually decreases the soil quantity and soil moisture storage capacity per unit of space and increases the water leakage at the soil rock interface zhao et al 2020 however the relative change in the rock exposure rate and soil thickness has little influence on the infiltration coefficient for example when the soil thickness increases from 5 cm to 50 cm or the rock exposure rate increases from 50 to 80 the difference in the infiltration coefficient is small this may be related to the local rainfall characteristics because approximately 90 of the precipitation is concentrated in the rainy season the thin soil and the existence of cracks lead to the rapid infiltration of rainfall jiang et al 2020 auler and smart 2003 so the influence of the relative change in the rock soil ratio and soil layer thickness is different over a short time but the difference is not obvious on the interannual scale 4 4 hydrological responses of subsurface leakage to rainfall events the relationship between the daily rainfall and the daily leakage fig 9 shows that the relationship between daily leakage and daily rainfall in the rainy season is the same as that in the whole year however in rainfall events there are obvious differences between the rainy season and dry season and the leakage of epikarst with cracks is obviously high water can flow rapidly along the rock and redistribute in the epikarst zone because of the cracks present fu et al 2015 zhang et al 2013a many studies of natural watersheds show that rainfall intensity has a significant influence on the peak value and duration of spring discharge but the effect of the epikarst zone on the peak discharge is small ding et al 2020 moreover if the total amount of discontinuous rainfall is more than 6 mm and the rainfall intensity is more than 0 8 mm h a spring will cause the corresponding occurrence unless there is a recent rainstorm to wet the soil winston and criss 2004 the flow will also be affected by antecedent rainfall fu et al 2015 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2020a b from the relationship between rainfall and leakage in the dry season it can be seen that when the rainfall is less than 15 mm h the leakage of the four rock soil structures does not increase significantly which is mainly due to the soil drought and the rainwater is stored in the soil or rock pores resulting in the reduction of leakage however when the rainfall is 0 8 mm h and 9 2 mm h the leakage of structures with rock exposure rate of 80 is 4 06 mm h and 1 59 mm h respectively which is higher than that of structures with rock exposure rate of 50 that is caused by the rapid infiltration of rainwater along the crack and the delay effect under a certain rainfall intensity 4 5 implications karst areas are usually characterized by high biodiversity and great heterogeneity in ecological patterns and hydrological processes clements et al 2006 the topsoil in karst areas is thin and epikarst zones with fractures are the key to vegetation transpiration and water storage and transportation zhang et al 2013b continuous monitoring on an hourly scale in this study reveals the impact of the rock soil structure on surface and subsurface hydrological processes especially the hydrological response characteristics after different rainfall intensities on the one hand the research results provide a reference basis for using a model to estimate surface water evaporation in different regions owing to evaporation from rock may be an important part of surface evaporation evaporation from rock should be considered in sprinkler irrigation measures in rock exposed areas rational planning of irrigation facilities and water conservation on the other hand for areas with cracks and thin soil the groundwater hydrological response is fast thus it should be considered in the design and construction of small water cellar in the high level depressions in karst areas according to local conditions and irrigate sporadic cultivated land in the dry season reasonable drainage measures such as ditches and trenches should be established in low lying areas to reduce waterlogging disasters in rainy season the research results can provide not only a scientific reference for water use and management such as ecological restoration drought prevention and drainage in karst areas with different rock exposure rates soil layer thicknesses and rainfall intensities but also valuable information for the later study of the hydrological processes between rock and soil plant atmosphere continuum spac systems in karst areas however bedrock can also affect surface vegetation praeg et al 2017 jiang et al 2020 and the hydrological processes influenced by rock soil plant atmosphere interactions are worthy of further exploration in addition this study was based on the simulated experimental and has obtained some understanding but there are still some limitations for example the top fine soil will migrate penetrate into the dolomitic particles in subsequent rain events and when there is a variation in partialpressureof co2 values the dissolution of carbonates in an evaporation prevailing environment tends to dissolve the carbonates and precipitates in the pore spaces what is the influence of these processes on the permeability and porosity of the simulated experimental which needs to be further explored moreover a variety of research methods should be combined to conduct comparative research and verification of natural catchments and simulated experimental in the future 5 conclusions evaporation is mainly affected by net radiation and relative humidity in the dry season while in the rainy season it is mainly affected by temperature wind speed and net radiation when the rock exposure rate at the lysimeter increased from 50 to 80 the surface evaporation was reduced by approximately 8 while the difference in evaporation between the two structures with different soil thicknesses was only 2 the evaporation of rock moisture may be a part of surface evaporation which affects the surface evaporation after different rainfall intensities while the evaporation from surfaces without exposed rocks has no significant difference after different rainfall intensities cracks and soil thickness have little effect on the leakage coefficient but the leakage coefficient with or without cracks is quite different the leakage of the epikarst zone is significantly affected by rainfall intensity but the rock soil structure will also affect the leakage and the time to reach the peak flow and is affected by the antecedent rainfall these findings can provide a scientific reference for water use and management practices such as ecological restoration drought prevention and drainage in karst areas and valuable information for the later study of the hydrological processes between rock and soil plant atmosphere continuum spac systems in karst areas credit

3301,the construction of cascade dams has led to a lack of longitudinal connectivity in rivers fragmentation of habitats slowing of the spread of biota and loss of biodiversity here we examined the zooplankton functional diversity in a typical river with cascade dams and compared the differences between the upstream and downstream parts of the river during the dry and wet seasons the findings were as follows 1 during the dry season the nutrient load in the lower reaches of the river increased and the water quality deteriorated while the conditions during the wet season did not change significantly 2 during the dry season the functional beta diversity of downstream zooplankton caused by cascade dams was significantly p 0 05 lower than that upstream but this phenomenon was not prominent during the wet season 3 during the dry season environmental factors and dam numbers significantly affected the functional diversity of zooplankton and the number of dams directly impacted the formation of the distribution pattern of zooplankton functional traits these findings highlight the effects of the hydrological regulation of cascade dams in different seasons on the functional diversity of zooplankton and suggest that 1 water retention times and pollution source inputs should be reduced during the dry season 2 dedicated biological channels should be established to reduce the harm caused by clustered pollution to zooplankton and 3 thermal pollution and strong scouring caused by large scale flood discharge simultaneously should be avoided during the rainy season zooplankton functional diversity is sensitive to dam hydrological regulation and we advise it be included as a critical indicator during ecosystem assessment in the dam management process along with additional biological indicators are recommended keywords water quality functional β diversity river ecosystem reservoir management huaihe river basin 1 introduction to meet human needs for hydropower

pressure from fragmentation and loss of river connectivity constraining their capacity to flow unimpeded affecting many fundamental processes and functions characteristic of healthy rivers dudgeon et al 2006 and leading to the rapid decline of biodiversity and essential ecosystem services the construction dams is one measure used to successfully use water resources gleick 2000 jenkins and boulton 2003 postel 2000 but dams also represent a common disaster faced by freshwater biota havel et al 2005 oliveira et al 2018 thorp et al 1994 the dam interrupts the continuity of the river controlled water flow and release of cold water ahmad et al 2021 and the sediment flux imposed by the dam may change the habitat quality downstream of the dam changing the downstream community structure and food web composition sabo et al 2018 unlike individual dams cascade dams typically exhibit cumulative effects on the stream network within a river basin or larger region leading to river fragmentation hydrologic variation and sediment siltation zhang et al 2020 consequently the decreased water self purification ability may threaten water quality and increase the risk of pollution in reservoirs many studies have shown that the operation of cascade dams changes the hydrology of the river and affects the floodplain system resulting in decreased habitat heterogeneity and increased species homogenization agostinho et al 2016 bozelli et al 2015 thomaz et al 2007 therefore the management of dams in different seasons has a particularly prominent impact on freshwater ecosystems for example lin et al 2021 examined the impact of reservoir management on algal biodiversity and found that water regulation of the reservoir in different seasons changed the nitrogen phosphorus concentration ratio resulting in the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and changes in the diversity of phytoplankton souza et al 2021 reported that because of the seasonal management of the reservoir flood discharge in the wet season significantly enhances the levels of connectivity between aquatic habitats reducing overall environmental heterogeneity and consequently zooplankton β diversity however during the dry season the storage of the reservoir increases environmental and biological heterogeneity zooplankton are highly sensitive to the environment and the operation of dams may change their fate dams influence thermal regimes by altering the water volume and discharge and via the height selective release of water from thermally stratified reservoirs possibly affecting zooplankton community structure because of species specific thermal growth optima rose et al 2019 in particular during the wet season because of the demand for flood discharge the discharge of a large amount of cold water has a higher impact on downstream organisms sabo et al 2017 a reservoir changes the distribution of dissolved oxygen do during storage or release cada et al 1983 zhang et al 2014 the variability of the zooplankton community may be sensitive to low concentration hypoxia because zooplankton need do for respiration and metabolism and the thermally stratified water body in the reservoir is more prone to oxygen deficiency doubek et al 2019 because of the management of the reservoir changes in water flow including spill and release may alter the suspended sediment load and water column turbidity different zooplankton respond differently to suspended solids ss and depending on the intensity of sediment resuspension sr ss can stimulate the transition of zooplankton from large to small nurminen et al 2010 high concentrations of ss e g 50 mg dw l 1 can strongly decrease the feeding of the cladocerans daphnia and ceriodaphnia hart 1988 compared with large bodied zooplankton such as daphnia spp some small cladocerans copepods and rotifers have higher tolerance to sr chen and chen 2017 at the same time because they have no swimming ability or weak swimming ability and cannot travel long distances morgan et al 2017 the residence time of water may also affect the abundance and composition of zooplankton communities in the reservoir and downstream dickerson et al 2010 thus investigating zooplankton facilitates the exploration of differences in the upstream and downstream regions caused by dam construction however managers have focused more on the water quality and water resource status during dam management while ignoring biological feedback on management measures to date few relevant management departments have included biological factors and even zooplankton in the evaluation system scholars have performed many studies based on the relative importance of spatial and environmental processes in changes in species composition among dam habitat patches zhao et al 2017 wan et al 2018 however this traditional and effective approach ignores the ecological similarities and differences among species barnett et al 2007 visconti et al 2018 functional based approaches have increasingly been used to assess aquatic ecosystems as an alternative to traditional taxonomy based approaches visconti et al 2018 functional diversity is the key predictor of ecosystem function and has gradually become a crucial aspect of biodiversity studies in addition to species diversity and genetic diversity traits can be quantitatively compared and their variations in a multidimensional trait space can be interpreted ecologically cardoso et al 2017 such as changes in environmental conditions the driving effect of the environment on biological functional diversity has been widely verified dunck et al 2016 pease et al 2012 schratzberger et al 2007 in this study we used the zooplankton community as a biological model to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of water quality and functional diversity of zooplankton under the influence of seasonal hydrological regulation of cascade dams this study aimed to 1 explore the effects of hydrological regulation on water quality in different seasons 2 discuss whether the hydrological regulation of cascade dams in different seasons leads to differences in the functional diversity of zooplankton between the upper and lower reaches of rivers and 3 explore how variations in water quality and the number of dams shape the pattern of zooplankton functional diversity in river ecosystems during different seasons and provide suggestions for dam construction and management from the perspective of community ecology 2 methods 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin is located in the eastern part of china between the yangtze river and yellow river basins the ru river ganjiang river and li river are tributaries of the huaihe river the ru river and ganjiang river have southern and northern sources respectively and ultimately flow into the li river fig 1 the entire river network is approximately 300 km long and the drainage area is approximately 10 000 km2 the study area is located in the transition zone from the temperate to the north subtropical zone it has a mild continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the annual average temperature is 14 9 10 c precipitation is abundant and annual precipitation is approximately 1000 mm the average rainfall in the wet season in the study area was 153 1 32 mm and the water flow reaches 387 31 m3 s while the average rainfall in the dry season was 59 1 11 mm and the water flow was 39 m3 s source data from https www hrc gov cn therefore to prevent the occurrence of floods the government has built 9 dams in the area to regulate the amount of water 2 2 sampling and analyses in august 2010 and march 2013 we established 25 sampling sites in the study area to understand the impact of damming on the species diversity of the river network fig 1 no dams are located upstream of the study area and multiple dams are located downstream to compare the functional diversity of zooplankton in the upstream and downstream and consider the possible differences in the community structure of different tributaries we divided the study area into four functional areas fig 1 upstream of the river is divided into three parts group 1 group 2 group 3 and the downstream cascade dam area is a separate group group 4 at each sampling site large quantities of zooplankton were collected by performing multiple tows from 0 5 m above the bottom to the water surface and each tow was conducted with a 0 064 mm nylon mesh net zooplankton samples from each tow were transferred into a 100 ml sample bottle and a formaldehyde solution with a volume fraction of 4 to 5 was added for fixation the fixed sample was allowed to stand in the room for 48 h and then the supernatant was removed and concentrated to 30 ml during identification the precipitated samples were mixed and the zooplankton species were identified using a 1 ml counting plate under an optical microscope at 100 400 magnification additionally zooplankton trait data such as body length and toe number were measured regarding the functional categorization of zooplankton species we used ten functional traits mean body length number of toes predatory escape response food type habitat size habitat depth trophic type breeding season number of ovaries and tail claws yes or no we selected these traits because they describe both the response of an organism to environmental conditions and its influence on ecosystem processes braghin et al 2018 the classification of trait categories was based primarily on previous studies of zooplankton by scholars barnett et al 2007 braghin et al 2018 kuczyńska kippen et al 2020 vogt et al 2013 the details of the relevant functional traits are shown in table s2 2 3 environmental factors we collected information on habitat characteristics water physical and chemical properties and geographic location near the sample site water samples were collected along with zooplankton at the same sites we measured the water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec total suspended solids tss turbidity ntu and other related data on site using a portable water quality analyser horiba u 52 we also collected one mixed water sample 1 l which was used to measure the nutrients in the water including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and phosphate po4 3 an asymmetric eigenvector map aem model was used to simulate the directional spatial process of river flow and zooplankton dispersion with water flow the weight of the number of dams between sites was used as the spatial structure factor weights were calculated as weight 1 n ntotal where n represents the number of dams among two sampling sites and ntotal is the total number of dams found in the river network zhao et al 2017 2 4 statistical analysis to quantify the functional diversity of the zooplankton at each sampling site we calculated the functional richness fric fric represents the amount of functional space filled by the community functional evenness feve feve describes the evenness of abundance distribution in a functional trait space and rao s quadratic entropy rao s q rao s q is the weighted mean distance in multidimensional trait space of individual species to the weighted centroid of all species where weights correspond to the relative abundances of the species in r v 3 6 2 https www r project org using the fd package botta dukát 2005 laliberté and legendre 2010 villéger et al 2008 we used the gower distance modified by pavoine et al 2009 to calculate the indices where habitat feeding type and trophic group are binary traits and body size is a quantitative trait we used the gower function in the bat package to calculate the gower distance between species a community often comprises multiple species because of the small size and high density of zooplankton in the environment observing each trait would be challenging making it difficult to quantify the relative contribution of each trait in the community by combining the relative abundance of species with the population based trait measurement in the database the cwm of each trait was obtained to realize the expression of zooplankton functional traits in each sample lavorel et al 2008 using the cwm of traits to reflect the relationship between biological functional diversity and the environment is considered an effective strategy craven et al 2018 lavorel et al 2008 we used canonical correlation analysis cca to determine the relationship between zooplankton functional traits and environment and cca was conducted using the vegan package in r aggregated boosted tree abt analysis was performed to quantify the effect of environmental indicators on the functional diversity index using the gbmplus package with 500 trees for boosting in r v 3 https www r project org software beta diversity is the spatial variation in species composition whittaker 1960 in this study the smaller the beta diversity value the more similar is the functional composition of the community diniz et al 2021 a reduction in β diversity is considered related to the loss of important or even unique ecosystem traits decomposing overall beta diversity βsor into turnover βsim related to species loss and nestedness resultant βsne related to species replacement components can help understand the processes underlying the variation in assemblages in space and time baselga 2010 to quantify the functional diversity differences at each sampling site we calculated β functional diversity using the functional beta multi computes multiple site functional dissimilarities and functional beta pair computes pairwise functional dissimilarities functions from the betapart package in r to determine the impact of the dams on the spatial pattern of zooplankton functional diversity we used a null model approach comparisons between observed values and randomly generated values for each group were performed using the standardized effect size ses agostinho et al 2016 we calculated the environmental bary curtis distance between sites and established a curve based on the number of dam water quality dissimilarities to evaluate the effect of cascade dams on water quality to reveal the relative role of environmental and spatial factors on zooplankton functional diversity we used variation partitioning to calculate the proportion of traits cwm and βsor explained by environmental variables env spatial factors aem dis and spatially structured environmental aem dam effects in river and each season to evaluate the zooplankton trait filtering process of the dams we used generalized boosted regression model gbm analyses to predict zooplankton traits and the possibility of differentiation auc 0 732 sensitivity 75 the model was built using the gbm packages in r 3 results 3 1 effects of dams on water quality in different seasons we compared the water quality of this basin during the dry and wet seasons and found that the changes in the concentration nutrient in the water were significantly different fig 2 a f fig s1 during the dry season the contents of tn tp and nh3 n in the water bodies downstream of the cascade dams were significantly higher than those upstream of the dam by contrast the content of these nutrients during the wet season was significantly lower than during the dry season during the wet season the spatial distribution of these nutrient concentrations was more uniform and no significant difference was found between the upstream and downstream regions of the dams we constructed a curve based on the number of dam water quality dissimilarities to determine whether the cascade dams caused the differentiation of upstream and downstream water quality the increased number of dams between sites increased the water quality dissimilarities between sites during the dry season fig 2g but no significantl significance was found during the wet season fig 2h 3 2 effects of environmental and spatial factors on functional diversity indices a total of 72 zooplankton species from 34 genera and 18 families were identified across the 25 sampling sites we compared the functional diversity index fric feve rao s q of each observation site during the dry and wet seasons figs s2 and s3 and found that the fric of species from the upstream to the downstream region of the basin showed an increasing trend while the fric during the dry season was significantly higher than that during the wet season the feve of zooplankton decreased from upstream to downstream during the wet season p 0 021 but increased slightly during the dry season but was not significant fig s3 rao s q during the wet season was significantly higher than that during the dry season p 0 05 and increased from upstream to downstream fig s3 however rao s q demonstrated the opposite during the dry season showing a decreasing trend fig s3 p 0 007 during the dry season total nitrogen tn and water temperature t were the main factors affecting fric tn and total phosphorus tp were the main factors affecting feve and dissolved oxygen do and temperature were the key factors affecting rao s q fig 3 a during the wet season water temperature and tp were the critical factors affecting fric current velocity and ph were the key factors affecting feve and tn was an essential factor affecting the change of rao s q fig 3a the correlation analysis of environmental factors and functional diversity indices was shown in fig s4 to assess the impact of environmental and spatial processes on the functional diversity of zooplankton we used variation partitioning analysis to analyse the contribution rate of environmental factors env and dams aem dam to the functional diversity of zooplankton the environmental factors and aem dam explained 80 29 of the functional diversity change trend of the zooplankton during the dry season fig 3b the explanation of the functional richness of zooplankton by environmental factors 41 6 and aem dam 37 2 did not significantly differ during the wet season fig 3c the individual explanatory rate of environmental factors 38 0 for functional diversity only was significantly higher than that of aem dam 7 7 and their common explanatory rate was 5 3 3 effects of cascade dams on the functional beta diversity of zooplankton in different seasons during the dry season the functional β diversity βsor between group 4 and the other three groups was significantly higher than that among groups 1 2 and 3 individually table s2 in which the functional nestedness βsne was significantly higher than the functional turnover βsim however no statistically significant difference was found in pairwise β diversity between the upstream and downstream regions of cascade dams during the wet season the multiple site β diversity of each group fig 4 revealed that the difference between the groups upstream of cascade dams during the dry season was not statistically significant but the β diversity values of downstream group 4 βsor 0 16 βsne 0 11 βsim 0 049 were significantly p 0 05 lower than those of the upstream group indicating that the functional traits of zooplankton in group 4 were more similar comparisons between the observed values of functional β diversity and those generated by the null models indicated that the βsor was lower for group 4 than the expected values ses 2 60 ses 1 98 indicating the possibility of smaller random components during the wet season βsor and βsne of group 4 βsor 0 64 βsne 0 23 were significantly higher than those of group 1 βsor 0 20 βsne 0 12 group 2 βsor 0 26 βsne 0 18 and group 3 βsor 0 59 βsne 0 40 we constructed a curve based on the number of dam functional dissimilarities βsor to determine the impact of the number of dams between stations on beta diversity the increase in the number of dams between sites increased the functional dissimilarities of zooplankton between sites during the dry season fig 5 a but no statistical significance was found during the wet season fig 5b we used variation partitioning analysis to analyse the relationship between spatial factors based on the number of dams aem dam and geographical distance aem dis and zooplankton functional β diversity aem dam and aem dis explained 68 30 of the differences in zooplankton functional dissimilarities during the dry season fig 5c aem dam accounted for 63 9 of the variation while aem dis accounted for only 1 7 the difference was that during the wet season fig 5d the explanation rate of aem dam for functional dissimilarities was very low 4 7 the explanation rate of aem dis was 49 1 significantly higher than that of aem dam 3 4 effects of environmental factors on functional traits canonical correlation analysis cca revealed the correlation between the environment and zooplankton functional traits fig 6 we used the community weighted mean cwm of each trait to quantify the relative importance of each trait in each sample the findings were as follows 1 nutrients were the main factor responsible for the spatial distribution of different functional traits during the dry season 2 some species that feed on plants and organic debris were more likely to survive in areas with high nutrients 3 the current velocity cv do and ph of the river during the wet season were the main factors determining the distribution pattern of zooplankton traits and 4 during the wet season some species with extensive habitat adaptability were more likely to disperse in the river network 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 seasonal effects of cascade dams on water quality and zooplankton functional diversity indices our study found that the nutrients in the water body between dams in the lower reaches of the river increased significantly during the dry season as shown in fig 2a f and s1 the increase in the number of dams between sites increased the water quality dissimilarities between sites during the dry season fig 2g 2h although natural rivers show continuous variations in chemical and physical conditions from the upstream to downstream direction vannote et al 1980 dams can interrupt these environmental gradients particularly the well documented longitudinal gradients in water temperature dissolved oxygen nutrients and substrate types cortes et al 2002 wang et al 2021 a large area of cultivated land industrial land and urban land in the lower reaches of the river and many of pollutants and nutrients may enter the river through infiltration or discharge fig s7 in addition to fixed point source pollution such as cities and factories during the dry season nonpoint source pollution caused by large scale agricultural activities such as ploughing irrigation and fertilization may be a major factor leading to increased of river nutrition at the same time the reduced plant cover increases the input of agricultural runoff caused by soil erosion ding et al 2015 during the dry season dams increase the retention time of water bodies promote the process of biogeochemistry and physical transformation and increase the retention of pollutants in reservoirs through sediment settlement maavara et al 2020 during the wet season with the increase in flood discharge frequency the retention times of nutrients and pollutants decrease with the increased water discharge and high flow velocities pollutants become diluted under the action of water flow the functional richness of zooplankton increased from upstream to downstream of the river in both the dry and wet seasons and the richness in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season fig s3 in the northern hemisphere march to may is a critical breeding period for zooplankton hart 1988 and the storage of water in reservoirs increases the hydraulic residence time to change the river environment reducing turbulence and mixing and providing a good breeding environment for zooplankton increased flow during the wet season due to frequent flooding may reduce zooplankton populations in rivers cortes et al 2002 although the fric appears slightly higher in the lower reaches of the river because of the confluence and push of the river rao s q shows the opposite trend of change fig s3 fric quantifies only the filling of the number of functional traits in the community including rare species and abundant species villéger et al 2008 rao s diversity which is used to indicate functional diversity quantifies the average distance from each species in the community to the weighted centroid of all species baselga 2010 thus some rare species with smaller numbers are ignored however in the ecosystem the change in abundant species in the region often reflects its ecosystem characteristics which is considered a crucial observation object duque et al 2003 during the wet season the opening of the flood discharge channel may lead to the rapid influx of many of zooplankton downstream increasing the difference in traits between species and reducing the functional evenness during the dry season the dispersal limitation of cascade dams causes zooplankton to stay in the downstream reservoir which may undergo strong habitat changes and water quality deterioration additionally some species with unique characteristics were lost and traits with strong adaptability were retained pease et al 2012 for example species with long lengths high resistance to environmental pressure and extensive habitat adaptability are more likely to emerge downstream of cascade dams fig s5 fig s6 our results highlight the direct impact of dams on the functional diversity of zooplankton in river networks during the dry and wet seasons dams are more important to the spatial changes in zooplankton functional diversity in the dry season while environmental factors have significant impacts in both the dry and wet seasons during the dry season low flows turned the river into numerous interconnected pools the strong impact of aem dam on the functional diversity of zooplankton could be attributed to the interruption of the river continuum environmental pattern by the low flows that partially interrupted the upstream downstream connection and limited the passive migration of organisms zhao et al 2017 in both dry and rainy seasons environmental factors are always the key factor leading to the differentiation of zooplankton functional diversity indicating that zooplankton might be sensitive to environmental changes kuczyńska kippen et al 2020 4 2 the seasonal regulation of dams changes the β diversity of the upper and lower reaches of the river during the dry season the paired functional β diversity βsor table s2 of group 4 and upstream three groups was higher in which the functional nestedness βsne was significantly higher than the functional turnover βsim however the species dissimilarity or species loss between the groups is the main factor leading to the increase in βsne baselga 2010 indicating that the species dissimilarity formed under the influence of cascade dams leads to the high functional beta diversity between upstream and downstream numerous studies have demonstrated that dams differentiate upstream and downstream communities zhao et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 wan et al 2018 the multiple site functional β diversity and null model test showed that the downstream region of the dam was significantly lower than the upstream region indicating that the impoundment of cascade dams during the dry season might lead to the homogenization of zooplankton in the downstream region by contrast during the wet season floods did not cause significant differences in β diversity between the upstream and downstream regions during the dry season the long term hydraulic retention and deterioration of water quality fig 2 cause downstream zooplankton to be subjected to strong environmental filtration resulting in an imbalance in the spatial distribution of zooplankton functional traits zhao et al 2017 during the wet season with the increase in flood discharge frequency more zooplankton quickly passed through the barrier to reach the downstream reaches rose et al 2019 thus the functional traits of upstream and downstream zooplankton did not show much difference during the dry season the increased number of dams between sites increases the functional dissimilarities βsor but not significant during the wet season the reason may be that the increase in dispersal barriers such as dams reduces the spatial connectivity between stations preventing some species from using waterways to cross barriers wan et al 2018 this situation may increase the difference in functional traits between the upstream and downstream sites of the river our study also showed that only some species with strong dispersive ability such as calanus sinicus and sinodiaptomus sarsi reach the downstream similar to some reports on macroinvertebrate benthos saulino et al 2017 wang et al 2021 we assessed the effect of dams and spatial distances on the functional beta diversity of zooplankton and found that dams were the key factor affecting the functional beta diversity of zooplankton during the dry season for example in our study aem dams had a higher interpretation rate than aem dis dams indicating that zooplankton are more sensitive to disturbances caused by dams than spatial distances during the dry season during the wet season the dispersal limitation of the river is considered very small and dams have a small contribution rate to the functional beta diversity during the wet season but the effect of spatial distance on functional beta diversity is significantly enhanced 4 3 effects of environmental factors on functional traits we found that nutrients were the key factors driving the structural changes in regional functional traits fig 6 the quality of the habitat environment is a crucial factor in community differentiation davis et al 2015 many scholars believe that the environment has a strong filtration effect on the functionality of aquatic animals and the spatial heterogeneity of the environment often leads to an imbalance in the spatial distribution of the functional traits of species peres neto and legendre 2010 additionally changes in zooplankton communities are linked to the dynamics of predation and primary production rosenberg and resh 1994 wang et al 2021 for example we found that some species that feed on plants and organic debris were more likely to survive in areas with high nutrients while some carnivorous species were more likely to live in low nutrient areas fig 6 our study showed that dams directly impact on the functional diversity of zooplankton thus the hydrological and environmental changes caused by dams might further indirectly affect the distribution pattern of zooplankton functional traits zhao et al 2017 during the dry season because of hydraulic retention cascade dams may lead to the accumulation of pollutants downstream resulting in the further differentiation of the functional traits of zooplankton downstream however during the wet season this differentiation is weakened 4 4 suggestions regarding the management of dams alterations to zooplankton communities which form the base of pelagic food webs that support invertebrates and fishes may also affect aquatic ecosystem dynamics cortes et al 2002 multicriteria decision making technology is a popular and mature method that has been applied to dam management decision making zamarrón mieza et al 2017 however this technology focuses more on the evaluation of water quality environmental impact assessment water resource management and rarely incorporates biodiversity indicators into the evaluation system ali and maryam 2014 yi et al 2005 we found that the functional diversity of zooplankton can sensitively reflect the changes in the dam habitat and we recommend that this index be incorporated into the relevant evaluation system nutrients and water temperature are critical factors affecting the functional diversity index of zooplankton thus pollution source control and improved flood discharge methods of reservoirs help protect zooplankton for example the adverse effects of zooplankton can be improved by improving the dam management mechanism the use of spillways should be increased particularly during the dry season when surface water released downstream more closely resembles natural thermal regimes than water released from a bottom level outlet michie et al 2020 for the large amount of drainage required during the wet season we recommend designing multistage outlets to mitigate heat pollution when dams are built in the future for older dams we recommend appropriate engineering modifications such as trunnions and thermal curtains to reduce the impact of water temperature on the ecosystem by diverting surface waters to the bottom level outlet gray et al 2019 michie et al 2020 these measures also reduce the risk of high suspended solids and water extraction eutrophication in the downstream water body caused by the input of a large amount of sediment changes in river flow and closure of sluices during dry periods may lead to the long term retention of pollutants and organisms in reservoirs at the same time we suggest reducing the closing time and pollution source input during the dry season maintaining proper ecological flow enhancing upstream compensation for downstream water and establishing dedicated biological channels to mitigate the impact of dams credit authorship contribution statement jiachen shen conceptualization formal analysis writing review editing ge qin

3301,the construction of cascade dams has led to a lack of longitudinal connectivity in rivers fragmentation of habitats slowing of the spread of biota and loss of biodiversity here we examined the zooplankton functional diversity in a typical river with cascade dams and compared the differences between the upstream and downstream parts of the river during the dry and wet seasons the findings were as follows 1 during the dry season the nutrient load in the lower reaches of the river increased and the water quality deteriorated while the conditions during the wet season did not change significantly 2 during the dry season the functional beta diversity of downstream zooplankton caused by cascade dams was significantly p 0 05 lower than that upstream but this phenomenon was not prominent during the wet season 3 during the dry season environmental factors and dam numbers significantly affected the functional diversity of zooplankton and the number of dams directly impacted the formation of the distribution pattern of zooplankton functional traits these findings highlight the effects of the hydrological regulation of cascade dams in different seasons on the functional diversity of zooplankton and suggest that 1 water retention times and pollution source inputs should be reduced during the dry season 2 dedicated biological channels should be established to reduce the harm caused by clustered pollution to zooplankton and 3 thermal pollution and strong scouring caused by large scale flood discharge simultaneously should be avoided during the rainy season zooplankton functional diversity is sensitive to dam hydrological regulation and we advise it be included as a critical indicator during ecosystem assessment in the dam management process along with additional biological indicators are recommended keywords water quality functional β diversity river ecosystem reservoir management huaihe river basin 1 introduction to meet human needs for hydropower irrigation and water supply society has constructed an estimated 2 8 million dams with reservoir areas 103 m2 lehner et al 2011 and 3700 hydropower dams 1 mw are under planning or construction zarfl et al 2015 according to grill et al 2019 63 of the world s very long rivers 1 000 km are no longer free flowing representing 41 of the global river volume and dams and reservoirs and their upstream and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to substantial connectivity loss in global river reaches consequently rivers are exposed to sustained pressure from fragmentation and loss of river connectivity constraining their capacity to flow unimpeded affecting many fundamental processes and functions characteristic of healthy rivers dudgeon et al 2006 and leading to the rapid decline of biodiversity and essential ecosystem services the construction dams is one measure used to successfully use water resources gleick 2000 jenkins and boulton 2003 postel 2000 but dams also represent a common disaster faced by freshwater biota havel et al 2005 oliveira et al 2018 thorp et al 1994 the dam interrupts the continuity of the river controlled water flow and release of cold water ahmad et al 2021 and the sediment flux imposed by the dam may change the habitat quality downstream of the dam changing the downstream community structure and food web composition sabo et al 2018 unlike individual dams cascade dams typically exhibit cumulative effects on the stream network within a river basin or larger region leading to river fragmentation hydrologic variation and sediment siltation zhang et al 2020 consequently the decreased water self purification ability may threaten water quality and increase the risk of pollution in reservoirs many studies have shown that the operation of cascade dams changes the hydrology of the river and affects the floodplain system resulting in decreased habitat heterogeneity and increased species homogenization agostinho et al 2016 bozelli et al 2015 thomaz et al 2007 therefore the management of dams in different seasons has a particularly prominent impact on freshwater ecosystems for example lin et al 2021 examined the impact of reservoir management on algal biodiversity and found that water regulation of the reservoir in different seasons changed the nitrogen phosphorus concentration ratio resulting in the seasonal succession of phytoplankton and changes in the diversity of phytoplankton souza et al 2021 reported that because of the seasonal management of the reservoir flood discharge in the wet season significantly enhances the levels of connectivity between aquatic habitats reducing overall environmental heterogeneity and consequently zooplankton β diversity however during the dry season the storage of the reservoir increases environmental and biological heterogeneity zooplankton are highly sensitive to the environment and the operation of dams may change their fate dams influence thermal regimes by altering the water volume and discharge and via the height selective release of water from thermally stratified reservoirs possibly affecting zooplankton community structure because of species specific thermal growth optima rose et al 2019 in particular during the wet season because of the demand for flood discharge the discharge of a large amount of cold water has a higher impact on downstream organisms sabo et al 2017 a reservoir changes the distribution of dissolved oxygen do during storage or release cada et al 1983 zhang et al 2014 the variability of the zooplankton community may be sensitive to low concentration hypoxia because zooplankton need do for respiration and metabolism and the thermally stratified water body in the reservoir is more prone to oxygen deficiency doubek et al 2019 because of the management of the reservoir changes in water flow including spill and release may alter the suspended sediment load and water column turbidity different zooplankton respond differently to suspended solids ss and depending on the intensity of sediment resuspension sr ss can stimulate the transition of zooplankton from large to small nurminen et al 2010 high concentrations of ss e g 50 mg dw l 1 can strongly decrease the feeding of the cladocerans daphnia and ceriodaphnia hart 1988 compared with large bodied zooplankton such as daphnia spp some small cladocerans copepods and rotifers have higher tolerance to sr chen and chen 2017 at the same time because they have no swimming ability or weak swimming ability and cannot travel long distances morgan et al 2017 the residence time of water may also affect the abundance and composition of zooplankton communities in the reservoir and downstream dickerson et al 2010 thus investigating zooplankton facilitates the exploration of differences in the upstream and downstream regions caused by dam construction however managers have focused more on the water quality and water resource status during dam management while ignoring biological feedback on management measures to date few relevant management departments have included biological factors and even zooplankton in the evaluation system scholars have performed many studies based on the relative importance of spatial and environmental processes in changes in species composition among dam habitat patches zhao et al 2017 wan et al 2018 however this traditional and effective approach ignores the ecological similarities and differences among species barnett et al 2007 visconti et al 2018 functional based approaches have increasingly been used to assess aquatic ecosystems as an alternative to traditional taxonomy based approaches visconti et al 2018 functional diversity is the key predictor of ecosystem function and has gradually become a crucial aspect of biodiversity studies in addition to species diversity and genetic diversity traits can be quantitatively compared and their variations in a multidimensional trait space can be interpreted ecologically cardoso et al 2017 such as changes in environmental conditions the driving effect of the environment on biological functional diversity has been widely verified dunck et al 2016 pease et al 2012 schratzberger et al 2007 in this study we used the zooplankton community as a biological model to explore the spatiotemporal characteristics of water quality and functional diversity of zooplankton under the influence of seasonal hydrological regulation of cascade dams this study aimed to 1 explore the effects of hydrological regulation on water quality in different seasons 2 discuss whether the hydrological regulation of cascade dams in different seasons leads to differences in the functional diversity of zooplankton between the upper and lower reaches of rivers and 3 explore how variations in water quality and the number of dams shape the pattern of zooplankton functional diversity in river ecosystems during different seasons and provide suggestions for dam construction and management from the perspective of community ecology 2 methods 2 1 study area the huaihe river basin is located in the eastern part of china between the yangtze river and yellow river basins the ru river ganjiang river and li river are tributaries of the huaihe river the ru river and ganjiang river have southern and northern sources respectively and ultimately flow into the li river fig 1 the entire river network is approximately 300 km long and the drainage area is approximately 10 000 km2 the study area is located in the transition zone from the temperate to the north subtropical zone it has a mild continental monsoon climate with four distinct seasons the annual average temperature is 14 9 10 c precipitation is abundant and annual precipitation is approximately 1000 mm the average rainfall in the wet season in the study area was 153 1 32 mm and the water flow reaches 387 31 m3 s while the average rainfall in the dry season was 59 1 11 mm and the water flow was 39 m3 s source data from https www hrc gov cn therefore to prevent the occurrence of floods the government has built 9 dams in the area to regulate the amount of water 2 2 sampling and analyses in august 2010 and march 2013 we established 25 sampling sites in the study area to understand the impact of damming on the species diversity of the river network fig 1 no dams are located upstream of the study area and multiple dams are located downstream to compare the functional diversity of zooplankton in the upstream and downstream and consider the possible differences in the community structure of different tributaries we divided the study area into four functional areas fig 1 upstream of the river is divided into three parts group 1 group 2 group 3 and the downstream cascade dam area is a separate group group 4 at each sampling site large quantities of zooplankton were collected by performing multiple tows from 0 5 m above the bottom to the water surface and each tow was conducted with a 0 064 mm nylon mesh net zooplankton samples from each tow were transferred into a 100 ml sample bottle and a formaldehyde solution with a volume fraction of 4 to 5 was added for fixation the fixed sample was allowed to stand in the room for 48 h and then the supernatant was removed and concentrated to 30 ml during identification the precipitated samples were mixed and the zooplankton species were identified using a 1 ml counting plate under an optical microscope at 100 400 magnification additionally zooplankton trait data such as body length and toe number were measured regarding the functional categorization of zooplankton species we used ten functional traits mean body length number of toes predatory escape response food type habitat size habitat depth trophic type breeding season number of ovaries and tail claws yes or no we selected these traits because they describe both the response of an organism to environmental conditions and its influence on ecosystem processes braghin et al 2018 the classification of trait categories was based primarily on previous studies of zooplankton by scholars barnett et al 2007 braghin et al 2018 kuczyńska kippen et al 2020 vogt et al 2013 the details of the relevant functional traits are shown in table s2 2 3 environmental factors we collected information on habitat characteristics water physical and chemical properties and geographic location near the sample site water samples were collected along with zooplankton at the same sites we measured the water temperature ph dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec total suspended solids tss turbidity ntu and other related data on site using a portable water quality analyser horiba u 52 we also collected one mixed water sample 1 l which was used to measure the nutrients in the water including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n and phosphate po4 3 an asymmetric eigenvector map aem model was used to simulate the directional spatial process of river flow and zooplankton dispersion with water flow the weight of the number of dams between sites was used as the spatial structure factor weights were calculated as weight 1 n ntotal where n represents the number of dams among two sampling sites and ntotal is the total number of dams found in the river network zhao et al 2017 2 4 statistical analysis to quantify the functional diversity of the zooplankton at each sampling site we calculated the functional richness fric fric represents the amount of functional space filled by the community functional evenness feve feve describes the evenness of abundance distribution in a functional trait space and rao s quadratic entropy rao s q rao s q is the weighted mean distance in multidimensional trait space of individual species to the weighted centroid of all species where weights correspond to the relative abundances of the species in r v 3 6 2 https www r project org using the fd package botta dukát 2005 laliberté and legendre 2010 villéger et al 2008 we used the gower distance modified by pavoine et al 2009 to calculate the indices where habitat feeding type and trophic group are binary traits and body size is a quantitative trait we used the gower function in the bat package to calculate the gower distance between species a community often comprises multiple species because of the small size and high density of zooplankton in the environment observing each trait would be challenging making it difficult to quantify the relative contribution of each trait in the community by combining the relative abundance of species with the population based trait measurement in the database the cwm of each trait was obtained to realize the expression of zooplankton functional traits in each sample lavorel et al 2008 using the cwm of traits to reflect the relationship between biological functional diversity and the environment is considered an effective strategy craven et al 2018 lavorel et al 2008 we used canonical correlation analysis cca to determine the relationship between zooplankton functional traits and environment and cca was conducted using the vegan package in r aggregated boosted tree abt analysis was performed to quantify the effect of environmental indicators on the functional diversity index using the gbmplus package with 500 trees for boosting in r v 3 https www r project org software beta diversity is the spatial variation in species composition whittaker 1960 in this study the smaller the beta diversity value the more similar is the functional composition of the community diniz et al 2021 a reduction in β diversity is considered related to the loss of important or even unique ecosystem traits decomposing overall beta diversity βsor into turnover βsim related to species loss and nestedness resultant βsne related to species replacement components can help understand the processes underlying the variation in assemblages in space and time baselga 2010 to quantify the functional diversity differences at each sampling site we calculated β functional diversity using the functional beta multi computes multiple site functional dissimilarities and functional beta pair computes pairwise functional dissimilarities functions from the betapart package in r to determine the impact of the dams on the spatial pattern of zooplankton functional diversity we used a null model approach comparisons between observed values and randomly generated values for each group were performed using the standardized effect size ses agostinho et al 2016 we calculated the environmental bary curtis distance between sites and established a curve based on the number of dam water quality dissimilarities to evaluate the effect of cascade dams on water quality to reveal the relative role of environmental and spatial factors on zooplankton functional diversity we used variation partitioning to calculate the proportion of traits cwm and βsor explained by environmental variables env spatial factors aem dis and spatially structured environmental aem dam effects in river and each season to evaluate the zooplankton trait filtering process of the dams we used generalized boosted regression model gbm analyses to predict zooplankton traits and the possibility of differentiation auc 0 732 sensitivity 75 the model was built using the gbm packages in r 3 results 3 1 effects of dams on water quality in different seasons we compared the water quality of this basin during the dry and wet seasons and found that the changes in the concentration nutrient in the water were significantly different fig 2 a f fig s1 during the dry season the contents of tn tp and nh3 n in the water bodies downstream of the cascade dams were significantly higher than those upstream of the dam by contrast the content of these nutrients during the wet season was significantly lower than during the dry season during the wet season the spatial distribution of these nutrient concentrations was more uniform and no significant difference was found between the upstream and downstream regions of the dams we constructed a curve based on the number of dam water quality dissimilarities to determine whether the cascade dams caused the differentiation of upstream and downstream water quality the increased number of dams between sites increased the water quality dissimilarities between sites during the dry season fig 2g but no significantl significance was found during the wet season fig 2h 3 2 effects of environmental and spatial factors on functional diversity indices a total of 72 zooplankton species from 34 genera and 18 families were identified across the 25 sampling sites we compared the functional diversity index fric feve rao s q of each observation site during the dry and wet seasons figs s2 and s3 and found that the fric of species from the upstream to the downstream region of the basin showed an increasing trend while the fric during the dry season was significantly higher than that during the wet season the feve of zooplankton decreased from upstream to downstream during the wet season p 0 021 but increased slightly during the dry season but was not significant fig s3 rao s q during the wet season was significantly higher than that during the dry season p 0 05 and increased from upstream to downstream fig s3 however rao s q demonstrated the opposite during the dry season showing a decreasing trend fig s3 p 0 007 during the dry season total nitrogen tn and water temperature t were the main factors affecting fric tn and total phosphorus tp were the main factors affecting feve and dissolved oxygen do and temperature were the key factors affecting rao s q fig 3 a during the wet season water temperature and tp were the critical factors affecting fric current velocity and ph were the key factors affecting feve and tn was an essential factor affecting the change of rao s q fig 3a the correlation analysis of environmental factors and functional diversity indices was shown in fig s4 to assess the impact of environmental and spatial processes on the functional diversity of zooplankton we used variation partitioning analysis to analyse the contribution rate of environmental factors env and dams aem dam to the functional diversity of zooplankton the environmental factors and aem dam explained 80 29 of the functional diversity change trend of the zooplankton during the dry season fig 3b the explanation of the functional richness of zooplankton by environmental factors 41 6 and aem dam 37 2 did not significantly differ during the wet season fig 3c the individual explanatory rate of environmental factors 38 0 for functional diversity only was significantly higher than that of aem dam 7 7 and their common explanatory rate was 5 3 3 effects of cascade dams on the functional beta diversity of zooplankton in different seasons during the dry season the functional β diversity βsor between group 4 and the other three groups was significantly higher than that among groups 1 2 and 3 individually table s2 in which the functional nestedness βsne was significantly higher than the functional turnover βsim however no statistically significant difference was found in pairwise β diversity between the upstream and downstream regions of cascade dams during the wet season the multiple site β diversity of each group fig 4 revealed that the difference between the groups upstream of cascade dams during the dry season was not statistically significant but the β diversity values of downstream group 4 βsor 0 16 βsne 0 11 βsim 0 049 were significantly p 0 05 lower than those of the upstream group indicating that the functional traits of zooplankton in group 4 were more similar comparisons between the observed values of functional β diversity and those generated by the null models indicated that the βsor was lower for group 4 than the expected values ses 2 60 ses 1 98 indicating the possibility of smaller random components during the wet season βsor and βsne of group 4 βsor 0 64 βsne 0 23 were significantly higher than those of group 1 βsor 0 20 βsne 0 12 group 2 βsor 0 26 βsne 0 18 and group 3 βsor 0 59 βsne 0 40 we constructed a curve based on the number of dam functional dissimilarities βsor to determine the impact of the number of dams between stations on beta diversity the increase in the number of dams between sites increased the functional dissimilarities of zooplankton between sites during the dry season fig 5 a but no statistical significance was found during the wet season fig 5b we used variation partitioning analysis to analyse the relationship between spatial factors based on the number of dams aem dam and geographical distance aem dis and zooplankton functional β diversity aem dam and aem dis explained 68 30 of the differences in zooplankton functional dissimilarities during the dry season fig 5c aem dam accounted for 63 9 of the variation while aem dis accounted for only 1 7 the difference was that during the wet season fig 5d the explanation rate of aem dam for functional dissimilarities was very low 4 7 the explanation rate of aem dis was 49 1 significantly higher than that of aem dam 3 4 effects of environmental factors on functional traits canonical correlation analysis cca revealed the correlation between the environment and zooplankton functional traits fig 6 we used the community weighted mean cwm of each trait to quantify the relative importance of each trait in each sample the findings were as follows 1 nutrients were the main factor responsible for the spatial distribution of different functional traits during the dry season 2 some species that feed on plants and organic debris were more likely to survive in areas with high nutrients 3 the current velocity cv do and ph of the river during the wet season were the main factors determining the distribution pattern of zooplankton traits and 4 during the wet season some species with extensive habitat adaptability were more likely to disperse in the river network 4 discussion and conclusion 4 1 seasonal effects of cascade dams on water quality and zooplankton functional diversity indices our study found that the nutrients in the water body between dams in the lower reaches of the river increased significantly during the dry season as shown in fig 2a f and s1 the increase in the number of dams between sites increased the water quality dissimilarities between sites during the dry season fig 2g 2h although natural rivers show continuous variations in chemical and physical conditions from the upstream to downstream direction vannote et al 1980 dams can interrupt these environmental gradients particularly the well documented longitudinal gradients in water temperature dissolved oxygen nutrients and substrate types cortes et al 2002 wang et al 2021 a large area of cultivated land industrial land and urban land in the lower reaches of the river and many of pollutants and nutrients may enter the river through infiltration or discharge fig s7 in addition to fixed point source pollution such as cities and factories during the dry season nonpoint source pollution caused by large scale agricultural activities such as ploughing irrigation and fertilization may be a major factor leading to increased of river nutrition at the same time the reduced plant cover increases the input of agricultural runoff caused by soil erosion ding et al 2015 during the dry season dams increase the retention time of water bodies promote the process of biogeochemistry and physical transformation and increase the retention of pollutants in reservoirs through sediment settlement maavara et al 2020 during the wet season with the increase in flood discharge frequency the retention times of nutrients and pollutants decrease with the increased water discharge and high flow velocities pollutants become diluted under the action of water flow the functional richness of zooplankton increased from upstream to downstream of the river in both the dry and wet seasons and the richness in the dry season was higher than that in the wet season fig s3 in the northern hemisphere march to may is a critical breeding period for zooplankton hart 1988 and the storage of water in reservoirs increases the hydraulic residence time to change the river environment reducing turbulence and mixing and providing a good breeding environment for zooplankton increased flow during the wet season due to frequent flooding may reduce zooplankton populations in rivers cortes et al 2002 although the fric appears slightly higher in the lower reaches of the river because of the confluence and push of the river rao s q shows the opposite trend of change fig s3 fric quantifies only the filling of the number of functional traits in the community including rare species and abundant species villéger et al 2008 rao s diversity which is used to indicate functional diversity quantifies the average distance from each species in the community to the weighted centroid of all species baselga 2010 thus some rare species with smaller numbers are ignored however in the ecosystem the change in abundant species in the region often reflects its ecosystem characteristics which is considered a crucial observation object duque et al 2003 during the wet season the opening of the flood discharge channel may lead to the rapid influx of many of zooplankton downstream increasing the difference in traits between species and reducing the functional evenness during the dry season the dispersal limitation of cascade dams causes zooplankton to stay in the downstream reservoir which may undergo strong habitat changes and water quality deterioration additionally some species with unique characteristics were lost and traits with strong adaptability were retained pease et al 2012 for example species with long lengths high resistance to environmental pressure and extensive habitat adaptability are more likely to emerge downstream of cascade dams fig s5 fig s6 our results highlight the direct impact of dams on the functional diversity of zooplankton in river networks during the dry and wet seasons dams are more important to the spatial changes in zooplankton functional diversity in the dry season while environmental factors have significant impacts in both the dry and wet seasons during the dry season low flows turned the river into numerous interconnected pools the strong impact of aem dam on the functional diversity of zooplankton could be attributed to the interruption of the river continuum environmental pattern by the low flows that partially interrupted the upstream downstream connection and limited the passive migration of organisms zhao et al 2017 in both dry and rainy seasons environmental factors are always the key factor leading to the differentiation of zooplankton functional diversity indicating that zooplankton might be sensitive to environmental changes kuczyńska kippen et al 2020 4 2 the seasonal regulation of dams changes the β diversity of the upper and lower reaches of the river during the dry season the paired functional β diversity βsor table s2 of group 4 and upstream three groups was higher in which the functional nestedness βsne was significantly higher than the functional turnover βsim however the species dissimilarity or species loss between the groups is the main factor leading to the increase in βsne baselga 2010 indicating that the species dissimilarity formed under the influence of cascade dams leads to the high functional beta diversity between upstream and downstream numerous studies have demonstrated that dams differentiate upstream and downstream communities zhao et al 2017 oliveira et al 2018 wan et al 2018 the multiple site functional β diversity and null model test showed that the downstream region of the dam was significantly lower than the upstream region indicating that the impoundment of cascade dams during the dry season might lead to the homogenization of zooplankton in the downstream region by contrast during the wet season floods did not cause significant differences in β diversity between the upstream and downstream regions during the dry season the long term hydraulic retention and deterioration of water quality fig 2 cause downstream zooplankton to be subjected to strong environmental filtration resulting in an imbalance in the spatial distribution of zooplankton functional traits zhao et al 2017 during the wet season with the increase in flood discharge frequency more zooplankton quickly passed through the barrier to reach the downstream reaches rose et al 2019 thus the functional traits of upstream and downstream zooplankton did not show much difference during the dry season the increased number of dams between sites increases the functional dissimilarities βsor but not significant during the wet season the reason may be that the increase in dispersal barriers such as dams reduces the spatial connectivity between stations preventing some species from using waterways to cross barriers wan et al 2018 this situation may increase the difference in functional traits between the upstream and downstream sites of the river our study also showed that only some species with strong dispersive ability such as calanus sinicus and sinodiaptomus sarsi reach the downstream similar to some reports on macroinvertebrate benthos saulino et al 2017 wang et al 2021 we assessed the effect of dams and spatial distances on the functional beta diversity of zooplankton and found that dams were the key factor affecting the functional beta diversity of zooplankton during the dry season for example in our study aem dams had a higher interpretation rate than aem dis dams indicating that zooplankton are more sensitive to disturbances caused by dams than spatial distances during the dry season during the wet season the dispersal limitation of the river is considered very small and dams have a small contribution rate to the functional beta diversity during the wet season but the effect of spatial distance on functional beta diversity is significantly enhanced 4 3 effects of environmental factors on functional traits we found that nutrients were the key factors driving the structural changes in regional functional traits fig 6 the quality of the habitat environment is a crucial factor in community differentiation davis et al 2015 many scholars believe that the environment has a strong filtration effect on the functionality of aquatic animals and the spatial heterogeneity of the environment often leads to an imbalance in the spatial distribution of the functional traits of species peres neto and legendre 2010 additionally changes in zooplankton communities are linked to the dynamics of predation and primary production rosenberg and resh 1994 wang et al 2021 for example we found that some species that feed on plants and organic debris were more likely to survive in areas with high nutrients while some carnivorous species were more likely to live in low nutrient areas fig 6 our study showed that dams directly impact on the functional diversity of zooplankton thus the hydrological and environmental changes caused by dams might further indirectly affect the distribution pattern of zooplankton functional traits zhao et al 2017 during the dry season because of hydraulic retention cascade dams may lead to the accumulation of pollutants downstream resulting in the further differentiation of the functional traits of zooplankton downstream however during the wet season this differentiation is weakened 4 4 suggestions regarding the management of dams alterations to zooplankton communities which form the base of pelagic food webs that support invertebrates and fishes may also affect aquatic ecosystem dynamics cortes et al 2002 multicriteria decision making technology is a popular and mature method that has been applied to dam management decision making zamarrón mieza et al 2017 however this technology focuses more on the evaluation of water quality environmental impact assessment water resource management and rarely incorporates biodiversity indicators into the evaluation system ali and maryam 2014 yi et al 2005 we found that the functional diversity of zooplankton can sensitively reflect the changes in the dam habitat and we recommend that this index be incorporated into the relevant evaluation system nutrients and water temperature are critical factors affecting the functional diversity index of zooplankton thus pollution source control and improved flood discharge methods of reservoirs help protect zooplankton for example the adverse effects of zooplankton can be improved by improving the dam management mechanism the use of spillways should be increased particularly during the dry season when surface water released downstream more closely resembles natural thermal regimes than water released from a bottom level outlet michie et al 2020 for the large amount of drainage required during the wet season we recommend designing multistage outlets to mitigate heat pollution when dams are built in the future for older dams we recommend appropriate engineering modifications such as trunnions and thermal curtains to reduce the impact of water temperature on the ecosystem by diverting surface waters to the bottom level outlet gray et al 2019 michie et al 2020 these measures also reduce the risk of high suspended solids and water extraction eutrophication in the downstream water body caused by the input of a large amount of sediment changes in river flow and closure of sluices during dry periods may lead to the long term retention of pollutants and organisms in reservoirs at the same time we suggest reducing the closing time and pollution source input during the dry season maintaining proper ecological flow enhancing upstream compensation for downstream water and establishing dedicated biological channels to mitigate the impact of dams credit authorship contribution statement jiachen shen conceptualization formal analysis writing review editing ge qin

groundwater circulation is closely related to the earth surface processes of water energy and matter and imposes great influences on the earth critical zone it is still unknown whether a deep groundwater circulation occurs in a syncline structure hydrogeochemical investigations of hot spring cold spring and shallow groundwater were carried out in a syncline basin in rucheng county china the water source circulation depth reaction temperatures and mixing processes were evaluated by water chemistry and thermodynamic methods to reveal the pattern and controlling factors of the deep groundwater circulation results showed that two deep circulation groundwater systems with meteoric origin were developed in the syncline the tangkou system is related with the northwest wing of the syncline the main fault f2 and the rs01 thermal spring the luoquan system is related with the southeast wing the main fault f1 and the rs02 thermal spring the main faults are water blocking faults separating the two systems the mean elevations of recharge areas of the two systems were 1200m and 850m respectively the deep groundwater circulation depths of two systems reached 5 5 0 5 and 3 6 0 3 km respectively within the geothermal reservoirs deep circulating groundwater was heated up to 156 c for rs01 and 108 c for rs02 before arriving at the ground cold shallow groundwater mixed into the deep circulation systems the mixing ratios of deep circulating groundwater were 14 8 at rs01 and 35 6 at rs02 the hco3 ca type deep circulating groundwater was slightly mineralized karst or karst related water carbonate dissolution was the dominant water rock interaction the mixing obviously diluted the deep circulating groundwater but didn t alter its water type in our case the large scale synclinal structure is favorable to deep groundwater circulation which is closely related with the carbonate stratum and faults the depth of the deep groundwater circulation can be determined by recharge area elevation and geothermal reservoir depth which is a simple and effective method keywords deep groundwater circulation syncline fault geothermal springs mixing rucheng 1 introduction deep groundwater circulation is of particular importance to surface processes of the earth deep circulation of groundwater coming from precipitation connects the land surface with deeper subsurface environments transferring water energy and life critical for key processes such as deep mineral weathering and release of nutrients transport and long term storage of anthropogenic contaminants and geothermal energy systems mcintosh and ferguson 2021 deep groundwater can be a primary control on streamflow processes and solute concentrations by mixing with the shallow groundwater in watersheds in the coastal area deep circulating groundwater can be discharged into the sea which has a significant impact on the biogeochemical processes of the marine environment paldor et al 2020 more scientific attention is needed to deepen the understanding of the deep groundwater circulation connection to strata and rocks at great depth is rare and restricted to highly deformed geologic units that produce permeable pathways deep groundwater circulations don t go uniformly through large rock volumes but preferentially follow pathways of high permeability rybach 1997 such as fault cored anticlines and major crustal scale faults systems grasby et al 2016 fault planes or zones and or their intersections commonly form a preferential pathway of a deep groundwater circulation in mountain regions water conducting faults combines with water blocking faults forming deep groundwater circulation paths long et al 2019 source of fracturing tectonic versus volcanic stresses impacts fracture networks and connectivity and controls circulation depth generally deformation of stratum can enhance permeability through natural fracturing however even in highly deformed sedimentary basins anomalous and significant fracture systems are still required to allow a deep groundwater circulation grasby et al 2016 deep groundwater circulation also varies according to geographic environments for example a deep groundwater with a circulation depth about 1900 m was recharged during the last glacial maximum in a carbonate hosted ore deposit southwestern china which is indicated by a very light water isotope composition huang et al 2020 the salinity of deep groundwater systems increases with depth over about five orders of magnitude up to about 330 000 mg l in a small non continental island landmass in north west europe bloomfield et al 2020 a deep groundwater circulation can occur at local scales in headwater drainages less than 9 0 km2 frisbee et al 2017 high rates of meltwater discharge into overpressured subglacial aquifers could produce deep groundwater circulation controlled by the continental scale form of the ice sheet surface rather than the small scale topographic basins boulton et al 1993 in addition to geologic and geographic factors deep groundwater circulation is generally related to geothermal systems intrusion of meteoric water can occur to the brittle ductile transition zone in areas of active tectonic uplift menzies et al 2014 deep circulating groundwater systems with a meteoric origin form active connections between surface and subsurface maximal circulation depths of meteoric waters vary considerably from less than 1 to 5 km across north america mcintosh and ferguson 2021 in the tibetan plateau a high temperature geothermal fluid was estimated to possess a temperature of 310 c and a circulation depth of 6 8 7 8 km pan et al 2021 the ultimate control on circulation depth would be reduced permeability due to decreased rock strength and with that the ability to maintain connected fracture networks manning and ingebritsen 1999 townend and zoback 2000 however there is no conclusive evidence that groundwater circulation would cease due to the low permeability found at depth mcintosh and ferguson 2021 due to the great circulation depth and the geothermal gradient in the crust the deep circulating groundwater can become the geothermal water according to previous studies deep groundwater circulation occurs in geothermal anomaly field grasby et al 2017 long et al 2019 mao et al 2021 and normal area grasby et al 2014 huang et al 2020 in the both situations the hydrochemistry of deep circulating groundwater is generally influenced by geothermal systems mixing with shallow groundwater loss of energy by heat conduction and interaction with gases from mantle crust and atmosphere were considered as the dominant processes that affect deep groundwater circulation systems imbach 1997 geothermal observables and interpretative techniques can reveal the deep groundwater circulation rybach 1997 progress in deep groundwater circulation is limited because these flow paths are hidden from direct observation frisbee et al 2017 besides geological complexities in mountain blocks affect local to regional scale groundwater circulation mcintosh and ferguson 2021 groundwater isotopes combined with chemistry can produce a reliable conceptual model of a groundwater system and have been considered as a useful and economic method to explore groundwater flow cook 2013 zieliński et al 2018 this paper focused on deep groundwater circulation in a synclinal structure of a mountain range every step of the deep groundwater circulation from infiltration to outflow has been reconstructed based on hydrogeochemical and isotopic data taking into account water rock interaction and mixing with the shallow groundwater the purpose of this study was to reveal deep groundwater flow paths and controlling effect of geological structures on the deep groundwater circulation in a synclinal structure this work can deepen the understanding of deep groundwater circulation 2 study area and methods 2 1 physical geography conditions the study

accounting for 68 of annual precipitation the landscape is composed of low mountains and hills in the study area fig 1 the lithology is mainly carbonate rocks and clastic rocks there are two rivers with zheshui river in the north and the oujiang river in the south 2 2 geological conditions in the study area the tangkou thermal spring and the luoquan thermal spring locate in the core of the tianzhuang syncline which is 25 50 ne trending diagonally across the study area with a length of about 30 km fig 2 the axial plane of the syncline is nearly upright the inclination of the two wings is generally 30 50 frequent magmatic activities occurred from triassic to jurassic in the area the intrusive rocks are mainly monzogranite the intense tectonic movements have led to uplift of the bedrock layers in the south of the study area as a result the southwest portion of the syncline rose up the thermal springs are close to the rising section of the syncline and the synclinal axis plane tilts southeast as a result the rock strata in the northwest nw wing of the syncline have a steeper dip of 60 80 the f1 and f2 faults are deep main faults distributed along the strike of the syncline the f1 fault truncates the southeast se wing which dips northwest with an inclination of 42 55 the f2 fault truncates the nw wing which dips southeast with an inclination of 60 75 secondary faults trending 250 290 intersects the syncline and the f1 and f2 faults with inclinations about 80 there are two types of groundwater in the study area the karst water in carbonate aquifer of the syncline is the main groundwater type the pore water occurs in the alluvial and diluvial sediments which cover the surface of the synclinal core the upper layer of the porous aquifer is sandy clay with a thickness of 1 5 m and the lower layer is sandy gravel with a thickness of 1 3 m in the core of syncline luoquan thermal spring is located in the contact zone between limestone and mudstone with limestone in the west and mudstone in the east luoquan thermal spring is artesian with a water head 3 65 m above the ground a flow of 2400 m3 d and a water temperature of 48 c tangkou thermal spring occurs at the foot of a limestone hills tangkou thermal spring has a flow of 380 m3 d and a water temperature of 34 c 2 3 field surveys and measurements field surveys and sampling were conducted in september 2016 rainy season and february 2017 dry season respectively a total of 19 water sampling sites were surveyed fig 2 including 15 shallow groundwater sampling sites ls01 ls15 3 river water sampling sites hs01 hs03 and 2 thermal spring sampling sites rs01 the tangkou thermal spring and rs02 the luoquan thermal spring among the shallow groundwater ls02 ls03 ls06 ls10 ls13 and ls14 represent pore water in the core of the syncline cold pore water below ls04 ls07 ls08 and ls15 stand for the shallow groundwater around the f1 fault ls01 ls05 ls09 ls11 and ls12 are cold karst spring sites cold spring water below compared to the shallow groundwater contained within pore spaces in unconsolidated sediments near the surface the cold spring water commonly circulates more rapidly through the shallow bedrock karst system generally speaking geothermal springs are related with deep groundwater circulation as outputs of flow systems moreover geological structures control the flow of groundwater yuan et al 2011 therefore the sampling sites are located around the geothermal springs in the syncline structure in our case to survey the deep groundwater circulation water table depth was measured before pumping of groundwater temperature electrical conductance ec ph value and oxidation reduction potential eh of water samples were measured in situ horiba u51 water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes into three 50 ml and one 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were filled to overflowing and double capped samples for cation analyses were acidified immediately ph 2 using high purity concentrated h2so4 samples in the 100 ml bottles were used for titration of bicarbonate on the sampling day all other samples were stored cold and dark until analyzed in the laboratory of institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences cations and anions were characterized by an icp oes perkinelmer optime 5300dv and an ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10a

drc e hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research usa lgr lwia 24d the δ 18o and δd values were reported as per mill deviations from the international standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water with the accuracy to 0 2 and 1 0 respectively the saturation index si values of minerals in water samples were calculated using phreeqci ver 2 15 0 for the deep groundwater circulation relating to geothermal systems the cycling depth is considered as the sum of the geothermal reservoir depth and the elevation difference between the recharge area and the thermal spring the depth of the geothermal reservoir can be estimated as follows 1 d t t0 g z0 where d is the geothermal reservoir depth m t is the estimated reservoir equilibrium temperature c t0 is the local average annual temperature c g is the thermal gradient c km and z0 is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m the quartz silica geothermometers and the silica enthalpy warm spring mixing model were compared and employed to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the geothermal reservoirs of the thermal springs

equilibration temperature at depth and s is the silica concentration in mg kg generally the lighter isotopes of water can be attributed to the precipitation from higher altitudes the elevation of the recharge area can be derived using the altitude effect of water isotopes gonfiantini et al 2001 shakya et al 2019 4 a δ δ 0 i a0 where a is the altitude of the recharge area m δ is the water isotope

cai2 proposed by schoeller 1965 and 1967 were widely used to identify specific ion exchange gao et al 2020 houatmia et al 2016 li et al 2013 the indices can be calculated using the following formula 5 c a i 1 cl na k cl 6 c a i 2 cl na k so 4 2 hco 3 co 3 2 no 3 where concentrations of all ions are in meq l the chloro alkaline indices were used to reveal possible ion exchange between water and aquifer matrix materials during the deep groundwater circulation 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical features the groundwater was characterized by close connections with the atmosphere and rapid circulations the shallow groundwater and the thermal spring water were neutral or weakly alkaline with a mean ph of 7 6 the river water was alkaline with an average ph of 8 6 there was no obvious seasonal difference in ph the mean eh of shallow groundwater was 445 mv in summer and 468 mv in winter respectively the thermal spring water and the river water showed the same eh as the shallow groundwater however the ec of waters were different although no obvious seasonal difference was found the ec of cold pore water was the maximum with a mean 420 μs cm while that of shallow groundwater near the f1 fault was the minimum with a mean 43 μs cm the mean ec of the cold spring water was 316 μs cm in the nw wing of the syncline and 168 μs cm in the se wing respectively the mean ec of the thermal spring water was 335 μs cm which is between the ec values of the cold pore water and the cold spring water in the nw wing the ec of river water was relative low with a mean of 205 μs cm tds the total dissolved solids showed a similar variation with ec among waters no more than 300 mg l fig 3 except for the cold groundwater near the f1 fault the hydrochemical type of the waters was hco3 ca fig 4 ca2 and hco3 in the cold spring water of the nw wing of the syncline accounted for 87 of cations and 93 of anions respectively while ca2 and hco3 in the cold spring water of the se wing of the syncline accounted for 76 of cations and 84 of anions respectively for the thermal spring water ca2 and hco3 accounted for 75 of cations and 87 of anions respectively for the cold pore water ca2 and hco3 accounted for 84 of cations and 88 of anions respectively high no3 contents were observed for the cold pore water and the river water in the core of the syncline the thermal spring water had a low no3 content with an average of 1 mg l it is distinct from the other waters that the hydrochemical type of the cold groundwater near the f1 fault was hco3 ca na fig 4 in the study area the groundwater was lightly mineralized karst or karst related water owing to the occurrence of a thick layer of limestone in the syncline 3 2 water isotope compositions we refer to the local meteoric water lines lmwl of changsha and guilin to estimate the lmwl of the study area changsha is located 300 km to the north of the study area while guilin is 350 km to the west the lmwl of changsha was estimated to be δd 8 6δ 18o 18 6 by huang et al 2014 and δd 8 4δ 18o 15 1 by wu et al 2012 respectively according to tu et al 2004 the lmwl of guilin was estimated to be δd 8 4δ 18o 16 3 these local meteoric water lines are similar based on the averages the lmwl of the study area was estimated to be δd 8 5δ 18o 16 7 fig 5 the points are close to the lmwl indicating that all the waters originate from local precipitation the thermal spring water relatively depleted heavy water isotopes with averages of δ 18o 6 7 and δd 40 the river water had a mean isotopic composition of δ 18o 6 3 and δd 38 the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater was more widely distributed than that of the thermal spring water and the river water fig 5 especially δ 18o 6 4 divided the shallow groundwater into the cold pore water and the cold spring water the δ 18o of cold spring water at the both wings of the syncline was lower than 6 4 indicating different water sources the impact of evaporation on the shallow groundwater was indicated by the so called local evaporation line lel which intersects with the lmwl at δ 18o 6 4 and δd 38 5 3 3 trace element contents the contents of fe sr and ba were obviously higher than that of the other trace elements in the waters the cold pore water showed the highest trace element contents while the shallow groundwater near the f1 fault presented the lowest trace element contents for example the average contents of fe sr and ba were 203 μg l 109 μg l and 26 μg l for the cold pore water at the same time they were 13 μg l 30 μg l and 14 μg l for the groundwater near the f1 fault the contents of ag al be bi cd co and in were lower than the detection limit dl of the analytical technique in almost all the samples the thermal spring water had the highest sr content among the waters in particular the average sr content of the thermal spring rs02 was 214 μg l the contents of sr li as and sb were obviously higher in rs02 than those in rs01 the contents of ba li as ga and cs of the thermal spring were also higher than the contents in the shallow groundwater the content of zn in the shallow groundwater and the concentrations of zn and mn in the thermal spring water showed obviously seasonal variations the mean content of zn was 497 μg l in summer and 5 μg l in winter for the thermal spring water especially the content of zn reached 849 μg l for the thermal spring rs01 in summer for the shallow groundwater and the river water the mean content of zn was 104 μg l in summer and 10 μg l in winter 4 discussion 4 1 thermal reservoir temperature and mixture a deep circulating groundwater usually arrives at depth through a regional major fault possibly contacting with geothermal heat source as a result a positive anomaly of water temperature usually occurs at surface when the deep circulating groundwater rises up in our case the water temperatures of the luoquan rs02 and the tangkou rs01 thermal springs were 48 c and 34 c respectively which are obviously positive anomalies of temperature compared to the local mean air temperature of 16 7 c close to annual mean temperature of shallow groundwater furthermore the luoquan thermal spring is artesian suggesting a rising groundwater flow from the deep the two thermal springs were considered as outflow of the deep groundwater circulation in the syncline the geothermal reservoir depth of the thermal spring is one of components of deep groundwater circulation depth to calculate the geothermal reservoir depth the thermal reservoir temperature should be determined first in addition the mixing of the upward geothermal deep groundwater with cold shallow groundwater should be detected the mixing can conceal the original chemical features of deep circulating groundwater the mixing ratio is crucial for recovering of hydrochemistry of deep groundwater and then groundwater source and hydrochemical evolution can be explored the temperature of the deep circulating groundwater is consistent with that of the geothermal reservoir before rising however deep circulating groundwater loses thermal energy to surrounding rock mass during ascent from the geothermal reservoir to the surface such that the measured outlet temperature will not reflect the geothermal reservoir temperature to calculate the subsurface temperature of deep circulating groundwater cation and silica geothermometers were widely used based on hydrochemical measurements of the spring waters the assumption of no mixing with waters is usually made in using the chemical geothermometers cation geothermometers are based on ion exchange reactions with temperature dependent equilibrium constants the na k mg triangle diagram giggenbach 1988 was used to evaluate the equilibrium state of underground water rock interaction the thermal spring waters were classified as the immature water suggesting that the cation geothermometers are not applicable the silica geothermometers are based on the solubility of quartz or chalcedony silica is rapidly acquired by low ph co2 rich water from precipitation as it infiltrates and attacks minerals frisbee et al 2017 the reservoir temperatures of rs01 and rs02 were calculated using the silica geothermometer of verma and santoyo 1997 as 71 1 and 79 6 c respectively they were 70 4 and 78 8 c by the silica geothermometer of fournier 1977 those estimates from the two methods are approximate water ascending from a geothermal reservoir to the surface may cool on the way by mixing with cold shallow groundwater which leads to the underestimation of the equilibration temperature and circulation depth ferguson et al 2009 frisbee et al 2017 the silica enthalpy warm spring mixing model has been developed to estimate the reservoir temperature and the geothermal water component in spring in the silica enthalpy graph fig 6 the point a indicates the enthalpy value and sio2 content of the local cold water and the point b represents the geothermal spring for the thermal springs rs01 and rs02 the local cold springs ls05 and ls12 were set as the point a respectively the straight line determined by the points a and b was extended and the intersection point of the straight line with the silica quartz solubility curve was regarded as the point c the line is called the mixing line the proportion of deep geothermal water in the mixed water was determined by the ratio of the length of ab to ac meanwhile the enthalpy of point c is equivalent to the initial enthalpy of the deep geothermal water according to the relationship among temperature and enthalpy the temperature of the deep circulating groundwater can be inferred for the rs01 the deep geothermal reservoir temperature was estimated as 156 c and the mixing ratio of deep thermal water in the geothermal spring was 14 8 for the rs02 the temperature was 108 c with a ratio of 35 6 compared to the result of the silica geothermometer ignoring of the mixing induces an obvious deviation the boiling process during the ascending of deep circulating groundwater should be also taken into account when the steam loss occurred before the mixing the intersection point of the mixing line and the line corresponding to the boiling temperature is connected with the maximal steam loss line paralleling to the enthalpy axes fig 6 the obtained intersection the point d in the fig 6 provides values of enthalpy of the deep circulating groundwater then the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures of rs01 and rs02 were obtained as 125 c and 105 c respectively the boiling point of water increases with the increase in environmental pressure a deep circulating groundwater can boil during a rapid ascending when the water temperature exceeds the boiling point with the quick decrease of the surrounding rock pressure it has been reported that the steam separation happened for the loma blanca fumarole geothermal fluids with an initial temperature of about 290 c lelli et al 2021 if the deep groundwater slowly ascends it is hard to boil for the medium low temperature geothermal water due to the decrease of temperature induced by the heat conduction during the ascending in our case the highest estimate of the geothermal reservoir temperature is only 156 c at which water wouldn t boil until the pressure of surrounding rocks is less than 6 atm given the heat conduction and the non negligible thickness of the overlying porous aquifer namely a great pressure of surrounding rocks boiling before the mixing with the shallow groundwater is practically impossible in rs01 and rs02 in addition steam separation from ascending thermal fluids often induces changes in the isotope composition of the geothermal water lelli et al 2021 in our case rs01 and rs02 are distributed along the lmwl which doesn t support the boiling and steam separation 4 2 water source and cycling depth the water source and recharge area altitude of the deep circulating groundwater are related with the depth of deep groundwater circulation water isotopes can trace water sources and indicate recharge area altitude of regional groundwater flow the original hydrochemical characteristics of deep circulating groundwater need to be retrieved in advance according to the estimated mixing ratios a conservative mixing assumption is rational in our case given the tds less than 300 mg l loder and reichard 1981 fry 2002 if the deep circulating groundwater and the shallow groundwater well mixed the initial contents of hydrochemical components can be estimated by the end member mixing analysis emma the thermal spring water was considered as the mixture of the nearby cold spring water and the deep circulating groundwater the results of emma revealed the isotopic compositions of the deep circulating groundwater that were close to lmwl and obviously depleted in heavy isotopes fig 5 the deep circulating groundwater is consequently of meteoric origin and recharged by precipitation in high latitude mountain areas in the syncline the elevation decreases from the wings to the core the outcrops of strata formed mountains at the two wings which are considered as the main recharge area for the deep circulating water to verify the hypothesis the elevation of the recharge area was estimated using the altitude effect of water isotopes altitude is considered as the main geographic control on δ 18o in precipitation in southern china with a lapse rate about 0 2 100 m liu et al 2010 the lel intersects the lmwl at δ 18o 6 4 and δd 38 5 which indicates the average isotopic composition of groundwater in the core of the syncline using the emma the δ 18o values of the deep circulating groundwater were estimated at 8 1 and 7 4 for rs01 and rs02 respectively considering an average elevation of 350 m in the core of the syncline the mean elevations of the recharge areas of the deep circulating groundwater were calculated to be 1200 m and 850 m for rs01 and rs02 respectively the synclinal axis plane is inclined to the southeast and the outcrops in the nw wing of the syncline have a steeper dip angle and a higher elevation than the se wing thus the mean elevation of the recharge area of rs01 is much higher than that of rs02 indicating that the recharge area of rs01 should be the nw wing with the se wing as the recharge area of rs02 the f1 and f2 faults distributing along the strike of the syncline are regional deep water blocking faults owing to thecompressive core of syncline as the results of the upward deformation of underlying intrusive rocks those 250 290 trending secondary faults were formed crossing the f1 and f2 faults those faults act as water conducting pathways for the upflow of the deep circulating groundwater deep groundwater circulation exists in mountain regions where water conducting fault and water blocking fault are combined long et al 2019 it is inferred that precipitation infiltrated in the synclinal wings and then flowed into deep along the fracture and conduit of the carbonate stratum until meeting with the f2 and f1 faults respectively where groundwater were heated by the underlying intrusive rocks under the forcing of the topographic gradient the deep thermal water ascended from where the water conducting faults intersect with the water blocking faults before arriving at the land surface the deep circulating groundwater mixed with the cold shallow groundwater then the thermal springs occurred obviously the rs01 thermal spring is related with the nw wing and the f2 fault while the rs02 thermal spring is related with the se wing and the f1 fault the depth of the geothermal reservoir can be estimated according to the equation 1 the local annual average air temperature is 16 5 c in the study area the thickness of the local constant temperature zone is about 20 m in previous studies geothermal gradients g ranging from 24 to 40 c km were employed in the estimation of geothermal reservoir depth mao et al 2021 huang et al 2020 long et al 2019 grasby et al 2017 walsh 2013 it was reported that the g value in south china ranges from 7 82 to 162 5 c km with a mean of 24 1 c km yuan et al 2006 long et al 2019 estimated circulation depths of groundwater using 35 and 40 c km in the reshui geothermal field the study area locates in the south china close to the reshui geothermal field where igneous rocks are exposed and the maximum temperature of the hot spring is as high as 98 c it is rational that g in our study area falls in 24 1 35 0 c km with a very high probability if the probability was 95 the average of g would be 30 c km with a standard deviation of 3 c km based on a normal distribution hypothesis therefore g has 68 probability to fall in the range of 30 3 c km consequently the geothermal reservoir depths of rs01 and rs02 were estimated at 4 7 0 5 km and 3 1 0 3 km respectively the cycling depths of deep groundwater circulation are 5 5 0 5 and 3 6 0 3 km for rs01 and rs02 respectively these deep circulation systems require naturally occurring high permeability pathways that are largely controlled by tectonic features however permeability generally decreases with depth the penetration depth of precipitation derived waters and the bottom of the more active hydrologic cycle is relatively unknown mcintosh and ferguson 2021 recently grasby et al 2016 and 2017 studied the deep circulating groundwater with circulation depths up to 3 8 km in the canadian rocky mountains long et al 2019 estimated the circulation depths of the rucheng hot springs at 3 8 4 3 km in the xinzhou geothermal field a maximal circulation depth of groundwater was estimated to be 4 34 km mao et al 2021 in the tibetan plateau a high temperature geothermal fluid reached a circulation depth of 6 8 7 8 km pan et al 2021 our result of circulation depths falls into the range of previous results in the study area great topographic relief of the syncline and the water conducting water blocking faults played an important role in the great circulation depth 4 3 hydrochemical evolution groundwater chemistry is largely a function of mineral composition the formation through which it flows due to rock water interaction elango and kannan 2007 hydrochemical evolution of the deep circulating groundwater contains the information of flow paths in the study area the groundwater is lightly mineralized karst or karst related water with the hydrochemical type of hco3 ca dominated according to the gibbs plot the chemical components of groundwater are mainly derived from water rock interactions fig 7 however the chemistry of meteoric water poses an important influence on the groundwater in the sites of ls04 ls07 and ls08 furthermore the gaillardet plot reveals that carbonatites silicate rocks and evaporates contribute to the chemistry of groundwater fig 8 according to the calculated solubility indexes the groundwater was saturated with calcite aragonite kaolinite quartz and chalcedony which is consistent with the result of the gaillardet plot carbonatites are recognized as the dominate source for the groundwater chemistry it is rational due to the presence of limestone formations in the syncline the groundwater of ls04 ls07 and ls08 obtained considerable ionic components from evaporates and was of the very low tds sea salt particles in atmosphere from the south china sea and the west pacific ocean can be imported into groundwater by summer monsoon precipitation and contribute to groundwater hydrochemistry in these sites around the f1 fault consequently groundwater around the water blocking f1 fault is considered as recent infiltrating rain water with limited water rock interactions based on hydrochemical features the q type cluster reveals four groups of water samples fig 9 the first group is composed of the cold groundwater near the f1 fault including ls04 ls07 and ls08 which can be the result of differences in ionic sources the second group includes river water samples and cold karst spring ls01 ls05 and ls12 the third group includes the thermal spring samples rs01 and rs02 cold karst springs ls09 ls11 and cold pore water samples ls02 ls03 ls10 and ls14 the deep thermal water mixed with cold shallow pore water before gushing on the ground which is supported by the clustering result the forth group is composed of cold pore water ls06 ls10 ls13 and ls15 the results of the r type cluster and the pearson s r discover the relation among major ions tds and ph fig 10 and table 1 ca2 hco3 and tds are divided into a group exhibiting closest correlations r 0 95 which numerically verifies the limestone source of ca2 and hco3 and their domination in tds no3 is a typical agricultural contaminant in groundwater no3 showed a pearson s r of 0 66 with cl that is obviously greater than the r between no3 and the other major ions the grouping of cl and no3 consequently indicates a dominated agricultural fertilizer source of the two ions mgso4 is a common soil improver used in agriculture among the pearson s r between so4 2 and the other major ions so4 2 presents the highest correlation with mg2 r 0 65 the grouping of mg2 and so4 2 suggests an agricultural contribution na and k show similar natural abundances and chemical properties which results in the high r of 0 81 between them at the same time both na and k show high r with cl moreover na k and cl were also divided into a group in the clustering suggesting a possible source of na and k from agricultural fertilizers cation exchange processes might play a role in groundwater chemistry zaidi et al 2015 when there is an exchange between na or k in groundwater and ca2 or mg2 in the aquifer material both of the chloro alkaline indices cai1 and cai2 are positive however negative values of the indices indicate na k absorbed on the surface of fine grained materials of the aquifers can be replaced by ca2 mg2 in groundwater resulting in an increase in na k in groundwater in the study area these indices mainly show negative values fig 11 nearly a half of groundwater samples presented very low negative values of the indices suggesting an obvious exchange between na and k in the aquifer material and ca2 and mg2 in groundwater the karst water from the two wings of the syncline replenished the aquifer of unconsolidated sediments on which na and k were adsorbed through the reverse ion exchange processes the contents of na and k in the shallow groundwater increased mixing processes imposed great influences on the hydrochemical evolution of the deep circulating groundwater the deep groundwater flowed upward from the geothermal reservoir and mixed with cold groundwater in the unconsolidated sediment aquifer the estimated mixing ratios of the deep groundwater were 14 8 and 35 6 at rs01 and rs02 respectively using the ratios and the average composition of the cold groundwater the chemical composition of the deep circulating groundwater can be inferred the results showed that the water type of the deep circulating groundwater is unchanged after the mixing however the dominant ion contents including ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and sio2 of the deep circulating groundwater greatly decreased on average by 58 in the mixing the tds of deep circulating groundwater therefore inclined from 470 mg l to 205 mg l in rs01 and from 498 mg l to 257 mg l in rs02 the shallow groundwdater flows local paths in the core of the syncline compared to it the deep circulating groundwater experiences regional flow paths which is much longer than that of the shallow groundwater furthermore the temperature of the deep circulating groundwater is much higher than the shallow groundwater as a result the water rock interactions of the deep circulating groundwater would be stronger and contribute more ions than that in the shallow groundwater then the mixing dilutes the deep circulating groundwater owing to the large proportion of the shallow groundwater agricultural no3 is unstable and usually found high contents in shallow groundwater wang et al 2019 for the deep circulating groundwater originated from the steep nw wing of the syncline the contents of no3 and cl were close to zero however the contents of deep circulating groundwater in the se wing were basically the same as that of the shallow groundwater despite the marked difference in tds the difference in the no3 and cl contents between the two deep circulating groundwater flow systems supports the non geological origin of the two ions which is consistent with the previous analysis 4 4 a deep groundwater circulation conceptual model based on the hydrogeochemical analysis we put forward a deep groundwater circulation conceptual model of the study area two deep groundwater circulation systems were developed on the two wings of syncline respectively fig 12 the thermal springs rs01 tangkou and rs02 luoquan were exposed at the synclinal core near the junctions of the two groups of faults the thermal spring water discharges the deep circulating groundwater which is of meteoric origin the recharge area of rs01 is the nw wing of the syncline with a mean elevation of 1200 m while the recharge area of rs02 is the se wing with an average elevation of 850 m due to the great depths of the geothermal reservoirs the total cycling depths of groundwater at rs01 and rs02 reached 5 5 0 5 and 3 6 0 3 km respectively the syncline structure and faults form the geological basis supporting the deep groundwater circulation in our case the synclinal axis plane is inclined to the southeast and then the strata in the nw wing of the syncline have a steeper dip angle and a higher elevation than the se wing at the core of the syncline the f1 and f2 main faults distributed along the strike of the syncline are water blocking main faults owing to thecompression in the core the intersection of 250 290 trending secondary faults with the f1 and f2 faults is the result of upward syncline deformation caused by the uplift of underlying intrusive rocks and forms the upward flow channel for deep groundwater younger mechanical flexing of the syncline then is associated with tension that opens vertical pathways for the deep groundwater flow fractured karst reservoirs often exhibit complex multiscale heterogeneities involving pores fractures and caves whose length scales range from microns to tens or hundreds of meters zhang et al 2022 along the fractures and conduits of the carbonate stratum precipitation infiltrates in the two wings of the syncline and then nearly horizontally flows to the deep where significant flow channeling would occur around the percolation threshold and be dominated by a limited number of preferential pathways zhang et al 2022 the main faults impede the flow and could deflect sub horizontal flow to greater depth where geothermal reservoirs are heated by the underlying intrusive rocks for the rs01 the deep groundwater circulation is related with the nw wing and the f2 main fault and the deep geothermal reservoir temperature is 156 c for the rs02 the deep groundwater flow is related with the se wing and the f1 main fault and the temperature of the geothermal reservoir is 108 c after the heating in the geothermal reservoirs the deep groundwater ascends along the water conducting secondary faults under the forcing of the topographic gradient and neotectonic stress before arriving at the land surface the deep circulating groundwater mixes into the cold shallow groundwater in the unconsolidated sediments of the syncline core the mean mixing ratios of the deep groundwater are 14 8 at rs01 and 35 6 at rs02 finally the water temperatures of rs01 and rs02 are 34 c and 48 c respectively controlling by faults and mixing with shallow groundwater are common phenomena in deep groundwater circulation systems recently finn et al 2022 found that high flux conduits of upward thermal fluids distributed along buried faults in the yellowstone region moreover shallow groundwater mixes with thermal fluids and then emerges at the surface 5 conclusion physical chemical and isotopic investigations of thermal and cold groundwaters reveal two different fault controlled deep circulating groundwater flow systems developed in a synclinal structure with maximal spring temperatures of 34 c rs01 and 48 c rs02 deep circulating groundwater flow paths originate in the limestone strata outcrops widely distributed on the two wings of the syncline infiltrating precipitation in the northwest wing of the syncline flows downward a vertical distance of 5 5 0 5 km and is heated up to 156 c in the geothermal reservoir in the southeast wing infiltrating precipitation flows downward 3 6 0 3 km and is heated up to 108 c due to the topographic gradient forcing the deep circulating groundwater ascends along the intersections of the water blocking main faults and the water conducting secondary faults in the core of the syncline and forms the thermal springs the water of the two different deep circulation systems is mineralized by water rock interactions in the limestone formation of the syncline carbonate dissolution is the dominant water rock interaction consequently the groundwater is slightly mineralized karst or karst related water with the hydrochemical type of hco3 ca dominated the reverse cation exchange process plays a role in the chemistry of the shallow groundwater as a result the contents of na and k in the shallow groundwater increase and the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 decrease during the ascending the deep circulation thermal groundwater interacted with cold shallow groundwater and mixing processes imposed great influences on the chemistry of the deep circulating groundwater the mixing ratios of the deep groundwater were 14 8 at rs01 and 35 6 at rs02 respectively the mixing obviously diluted the deep circulating groundwater but didn t alter its water type generally deep water conducting main faults act as pathways forming the physical base of downward flow of deep groundwater circulation we demonstrate that large scale synclinal structures are also favorable to the formation of deep groundwater circulation furthermore obstructed by water blocking main faults different deep circulating groundwater systems can develop in the two wings of a syncline the upflow of the deep groundwater circulation is related to the intersections of the water blocking main faults and the water conducting secondary faults where the force of topographic gradient and neotectonic stress converge it is considered as the physical base of deep circulating groundwater upflow deep circulating groundwater tends to be influenced by geotherm consequently the depth of the deep groundwater circulation can be determined by the sum of the geothermal reservoir depth and the elevation difference between the recharge area and the thermal spring which is a simple and effective method in addition the determination of original chemical features of deep circulating groundwater is crucial to estimate the recharge elevation and the geothermal reservoir depth credit authorship contribution statement ruiqiang yuan conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft

groundwater circulation is closely related to the earth surface processes of water energy and matter and imposes great influences on the earth critical zone it is still unknown whether a deep groundwater circulation occurs in a syncline structure hydrogeochemical investigations of hot spring cold spring and shallow groundwater were carried out in a syncline basin in rucheng county china the water source circulation depth reaction temperatures and mixing processes were evaluated by water chemistry and thermodynamic methods to reveal the pattern and controlling factors of the deep groundwater circulation results showed that two deep circulation groundwater systems with meteoric origin were developed in the syncline the tangkou system is related with the northwest wing of the syncline the main fault f2 and the rs01 thermal spring the luoquan system is related with the southeast wing the main fault f1 and the rs02 thermal spring the main faults are water blocking faults separating the two systems the mean elevations of recharge areas of the two systems were 1200m and 850m respectively the deep groundwater circulation depths of two systems reached 5 5 0 5 and 3 6 0 3 km respectively within the geothermal reservoirs deep circulating groundwater was heated up to 156 c for rs01 and 108 c for rs02 before arriving at the ground cold shallow groundwater mixed into the deep circulation systems the mixing ratios of deep circulating groundwater were 14 8 at rs01 and 35 6 at rs02 the hco3 ca type deep circulating groundwater was slightly mineralized karst or karst related water carbonate dissolution was the dominant water rock interaction the mixing obviously diluted the deep circulating groundwater but didn t alter its water type in our case the large scale synclinal structure is favorable to deep groundwater circulation which is closely related with the carbonate stratum and faults the depth of the deep groundwater circulation can be determined by recharge area elevation and geothermal reservoir depth which is a simple and effective method keywords deep groundwater circulation syncline fault geothermal springs mixing rucheng 1 introduction deep groundwater circulation is of particular importance to surface processes of the earth deep circulation of groundwater coming from precipitation connects the land surface with deeper subsurface environments transferring water energy and life critical for key processes such as deep mineral weathering and release of nutrients transport and long term storage of anthropogenic contaminants and geothermal energy systems mcintosh and ferguson 2021 deep groundwater can be a primary control on streamflow processes and solute concentrations by mixing with the shallow groundwater in watersheds in the coastal area deep circulating groundwater can be discharged into the sea which has a significant impact on the biogeochemical processes of the marine environment paldor et al 2020 more scientific attention is needed to deepen the understanding of the deep groundwater circulation connection to strata and rocks at great depth is rare and restricted to highly deformed geologic units that produce permeable pathways deep groundwater circulations don t go uniformly through large rock volumes but preferentially follow pathways of high permeability rybach 1997 such as fault cored anticlines and major crustal scale faults systems grasby et al 2016 fault planes or zones and or their intersections commonly form a preferential pathway of a deep groundwater circulation in mountain regions water conducting faults combines with water blocking faults forming deep groundwater circulation paths long et al 2019 source of fracturing tectonic versus volcanic stresses impacts fracture networks and connectivity and controls circulation depth generally deformation of stratum can enhance permeability through natural fracturing however even in highly deformed sedimentary basins anomalous and significant fracture systems are still required to allow a deep groundwater circulation grasby et al 2016 deep groundwater circulation also varies according to geographic environments for example a deep groundwater with a circulation depth about 1900 m was recharged during the last glacial maximum in a carbonate hosted ore deposit southwestern china which is indicated by a very light water isotope composition huang et al 2020 the salinity of deep groundwater systems increases with depth over about five orders of magnitude up to about 330 000 mg l in a small non continental island landmass in north west europe bloomfield et al 2020 a deep groundwater circulation can occur at local scales in headwater drainages less than 9 0 km2 frisbee et al 2017 high rates of meltwater discharge into overpressured subglacial aquifers could produce deep groundwater circulation controlled by the continental scale form of the ice sheet surface rather than the small scale topographic basins boulton et al 1993 in addition to geologic and geographic factors deep groundwater circulation is generally related to geothermal systems intrusion of meteoric water can occur to the brittle ductile transition zone in areas of active tectonic uplift menzies et al 2014 deep circulating groundwater systems with a meteoric origin form active connections between surface and subsurface maximal circulation depths of meteoric waters vary considerably from less than 1 to 5 km across north america mcintosh and ferguson 2021 in the tibetan plateau a high temperature geothermal fluid was estimated to possess a temperature of 310 c and a circulation depth of 6 8 7 8 km pan et al 2021 the ultimate control on circulation depth would be reduced permeability due to decreased rock strength and with that the ability to maintain connected fracture networks manning and ingebritsen 1999 townend and zoback 2000 however there is no conclusive evidence that groundwater circulation would cease due to the low permeability found at depth mcintosh and ferguson 2021 due to the great circulation depth and the geothermal gradient in the crust the deep circulating groundwater can become the geothermal water according to previous studies deep groundwater circulation occurs in geothermal anomaly field grasby et al 2017 long et al 2019 mao et al 2021 and normal area grasby et al 2014 huang et al 2020 in the both situations the hydrochemistry of deep circulating groundwater is generally influenced by geothermal systems mixing with shallow groundwater loss of energy by heat conduction and interaction with gases from mantle crust and atmosphere were considered as the dominant processes that affect deep groundwater circulation systems imbach 1997 geothermal observables and interpretative techniques can reveal the deep groundwater circulation rybach 1997 progress in deep groundwater circulation is limited because these flow paths are hidden from direct observation frisbee et al 2017 besides geological complexities in mountain blocks affect local to regional scale groundwater circulation mcintosh and ferguson 2021 groundwater isotopes combined with chemistry can produce a reliable conceptual model of a groundwater system and have been considered as a useful and economic method to explore groundwater flow cook 2013 zieliński et al 2018 this paper focused on deep groundwater circulation in a synclinal structure of a mountain range every step of the deep groundwater circulation from infiltration to outflow has been reconstructed based on hydrogeochemical and isotopic data taking into account water rock interaction and mixing with the shallow groundwater the purpose of this study was to reveal deep groundwater flow paths and controlling effect of geological structures on the deep groundwater circulation in a synclinal structure this work can deepen the understanding of deep groundwater circulation 2 study area and methods 2 1 physical geography conditions the study area rucheng county is located at the junction of east west trending nanling and north south trending luoxiao mountains with a longitude of 113 e and latitude of 25 n according to the data of the rucheng county meteorological station the average annual temperature is 16 7 c and the average annual precipitation is 1498 mm in the past 30 years precipitation is concentrated in spring and summer accounting for 68 of annual precipitation the landscape is composed of low mountains and hills in the study area fig 1 the lithology is mainly carbonate rocks and clastic rocks there are two rivers with zheshui river in the north and the oujiang river in the south 2 2 geological conditions in the study area the tangkou thermal spring and the luoquan thermal spring locate in the core of the tianzhuang syncline which is 25 50 ne trending diagonally across the study area with a length of about 30 km fig 2 the axial plane of the syncline is nearly upright the inclination of the two wings is generally 30 50 frequent magmatic activities occurred from triassic to jurassic in the area the intrusive rocks are mainly monzogranite the intense tectonic movements have led to uplift of the bedrock layers in the south of the study area as a result the southwest portion of the syncline rose up the thermal springs are close to the rising section of the syncline and the synclinal axis plane tilts southeast as a result the rock strata in the northwest nw wing of the syncline have a steeper dip of 60 80 the f1 and f2 faults are deep main faults distributed along the strike of the syncline the f1 fault truncates the southeast se wing which dips northwest with an inclination of 42 55 the f2 fault truncates the nw wing which dips southeast with an inclination of 60 75 secondary faults trending 250 290 intersects the syncline and the f1 and f2 faults with inclinations about 80 there are two types of groundwater in the study area the karst water in carbonate aquifer of the syncline is the main groundwater type the pore water occurs in the alluvial and diluvial sediments which cover the surface of the synclinal core the upper layer of the porous aquifer is sandy clay with a thickness of 1 5 m and the lower layer is sandy gravel with a thickness of 1 3 m in the core of syncline luoquan thermal spring is located in the contact zone between limestone and mudstone with limestone in the west and mudstone in the east luoquan thermal spring is artesian with a water head 3 65 m above the ground a flow of 2400 m3 d and a water temperature of 48 c tangkou thermal spring occurs at the foot of a limestone hills tangkou thermal spring has a flow of 380 m3 d and a water temperature of 34 c 2 3 field surveys and measurements field surveys and sampling were conducted in september 2016 rainy season and february 2017 dry season respectively a total of 19 water sampling sites were surveyed fig 2 including 15 shallow groundwater sampling sites ls01 ls15 3 river water sampling sites hs01 hs03 and 2 thermal spring sampling sites rs01 the tangkou thermal spring and rs02 the luoquan thermal spring among the shallow groundwater ls02 ls03 ls06 ls10 ls13 and ls14 represent pore water in the core of the syncline cold pore water below ls04 ls07 ls08 and ls15 stand for the shallow groundwater around the f1 fault ls01 ls05 ls09 ls11 and ls12 are cold karst spring sites cold spring water below compared to the shallow groundwater contained within pore spaces in unconsolidated sediments near the surface the cold spring water commonly circulates more rapidly through the shallow bedrock karst system generally speaking geothermal springs are related with deep groundwater circulation as outputs of flow systems moreover geological structures control the flow of groundwater yuan et al 2011 therefore the sampling sites are located around the geothermal springs in the syncline structure in our case to survey the deep groundwater circulation water table depth was measured before pumping of groundwater temperature electrical conductance ec ph value and oxidation reduction potential eh of water samples were measured in situ horiba u51 water samples were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes into three 50 ml and one 100 ml high density polyethylene bottles which were filled to overflowing and double capped samples for cation analyses were acidified immediately ph 2 using high purity concentrated h2so4 samples in the 100 ml bottles were used for titration of bicarbonate on the sampling day all other samples were stored cold and dark until analyzed in the laboratory of institute of geographic sciences and natural resources research chinese academy of sciences cations and anions were characterized by an icp oes perkinelmer optime 5300dv and an ion chromatography shimadzu lc 10a

drc e hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of the water samples were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer los gatos research usa lgr lwia 24d the δ 18o and δd values were reported as per mill deviations from the international standard v smow vienna standard mean ocean water with the accuracy to 0 2 and 1 0 respectively the saturation index si values of minerals in water samples were calculated using phreeqci ver 2 15 0 for the deep groundwater circulation relating to geothermal systems the cycling depth is considered as the sum of the geothermal reservoir depth and the elevation difference between the recharge area and the thermal spring the depth of the geothermal reservoir can be estimated as follows 1 d t t0 g z0 where d is the geothermal reservoir depth m t is the estimated reservoir equilibrium temperature c t0 is the local average annual temperature c g is the thermal gradient c km and z0 is the thickness of the constant temperature zone m the quartz silica geothermometers and the silica enthalpy warm spring mixing model were compared and employed to estimate the equilibrium temperatures of the geothermal reservoirs of the thermal springs the quartz silica geothermometers without steam losses are given by 2 t 44 119 0 24469s 1 7414 10 4 s 2 79 305lgs verma and santoyo 1997 3 t 1309 5 19 lgs 273 15 fournier 1977 where t c is the equilibration temperature at depth and s is the silica concentration in mg kg generally the lighter isotopes of water can be attributed to the precipitation from higher altitudes the elevation of the recharge area can be derived using the altitude effect of water isotopes gonfiantini et al 2001 shakya et al 2019 4 a δ δ 0 i a0 where a is the altitude of the recharge area m δ is the water isotope value at the recharge area δ 0 is the water isotope value at the study area i is the water isotope vertical gradient 100 m and a0 is the altitude of the study area m chloro alkaline indices cai1 and cai2 proposed by schoeller 1965 and 1967 were widely used to identify specific ion exchange gao et al 2020 houatmia et al 2016 li et al 2013 the indices can be calculated using the following formula 5 c a i 1 cl na k cl 6 c a i 2 cl na k so 4 2 hco 3 co 3 2 no 3 where concentrations of all ions are in meq l the chloro alkaline indices were used to reveal possible ion exchange between water and aquifer matrix materials during the deep groundwater circulation 3 results 3 1 hydrochemical features the groundwater was characterized by close connections with the atmosphere and rapid circulations the shallow groundwater and the thermal spring water were neutral or weakly alkaline with a mean ph of 7 6 the river water was alkaline with an average ph of 8 6 there was no obvious seasonal difference in ph the mean eh of shallow groundwater was 445 mv in summer and 468 mv in winter respectively the thermal spring water and the river water showed the same eh as the shallow groundwater however the ec of waters were different although no obvious seasonal difference was found the ec of cold pore water was the maximum with a mean 420 μs cm while that of shallow groundwater near the f1 fault was the minimum with a mean 43 μs cm the mean ec of the cold spring water was 316 μs cm in the nw wing of the syncline and 168 μs cm in the se wing respectively the mean ec of the thermal spring water was 335 μs cm which is between the ec values of the cold pore water and the cold spring water in the nw wing the ec of river water was relative low with a mean of 205 μs cm tds the total dissolved solids showed a similar variation with ec among waters no more than 300 mg l fig 3 except for the cold groundwater near the f1 fault the hydrochemical type of the waters was hco3 ca fig 4 ca2 and hco3 in the cold spring water of the nw wing of the syncline accounted for 87 of cations and 93 of anions respectively while ca2 and hco3 in the cold spring water of the se wing of the syncline accounted for 76 of cations and 84 of anions respectively for the thermal spring water ca2 and hco3 accounted for 75 of cations and 87 of anions respectively for the cold pore water ca2 and hco3 accounted for 84 of cations and 88 of anions respectively high no3 contents were observed for the cold pore water and the river water in the core of the syncline the thermal spring water had a low no3 content with an average of 1 mg l it is distinct from the other waters that the hydrochemical type of the cold groundwater near the f1 fault was hco3 ca na fig 4 in the study area the groundwater was lightly mineralized karst or karst related water owing to the occurrence of a thick layer of limestone in the syncline 3 2 water isotope compositions we refer to the local meteoric water lines lmwl of changsha and guilin to estimate the lmwl of the study area changsha is located 300 km to the north of the study area while guilin is 350 km to the west the lmwl of changsha was estimated to be δd 8 6δ 18o 18 6 by huang et al 2014 and δd 8 4δ 18o 15 1 by wu et al 2012 respectively according to tu et al 2004 the lmwl of guilin was estimated to be δd 8 4δ 18o 16 3 these local meteoric water lines are similar based on the averages the lmwl of the study area was estimated to be δd 8 5δ 18o 16 7 fig 5 the points are close to the lmwl indicating that all the waters originate from local precipitation the thermal spring water relatively depleted heavy water isotopes with averages of δ 18o 6 7 and δd 40 the river water had a mean isotopic composition of δ 18o 6 3 and δd 38 the isotopic composition of shallow groundwater was more widely distributed than that of the thermal spring water and the river water fig 5 especially δ 18o 6 4 divided the shallow groundwater into the cold pore water and the cold spring water the δ 18o of cold spring water at the both wings of the syncline was lower than 6 4 indicating different water sources the impact of evaporation on the shallow groundwater was indicated by the so called local evaporation line lel which intersects with the lmwl at δ 18o 6 4 and δd 38 5 3 3 trace element contents the contents of fe sr and ba were obviously higher than that of the other trace elements in the waters the cold pore water showed the highest trace element contents while the shallow groundwater near the f1 fault presented the lowest trace element contents for example the average contents of fe sr and ba were 203 μg l 109 μg l and 26 μg l for the cold pore water at the same time they were 13 μg l 30 μg l and 14 μg l for the groundwater near the f1 fault the contents of ag al be bi cd co and in were lower than the detection limit dl of the analytical technique in almost all the samples the thermal spring water had the highest sr content among the waters in particular the average sr content of the thermal spring rs02 was 214 μg l the contents of sr li as and sb were obviously higher in rs02 than those in rs01 the contents of ba li as ga and cs of the thermal spring were also higher than the contents in the shallow groundwater the content of zn in the shallow groundwater and the concentrations of zn and mn in the thermal spring water showed obviously seasonal variations the mean content of zn was 497 μg l in summer and 5 μg l in winter for the thermal spring water especially the content of zn reached 849 μg l for the thermal spring rs01 in summer for the shallow groundwater and the river water the mean content of zn was 104 μg l in summer and 10 μg l in winter 4 discussion 4 1 thermal reservoir temperature and mixture a deep circulating groundwater usually arrives at depth through a regional major fault possibly contacting with geothermal heat source as a result a positive anomaly of water temperature usually occurs at surface when the deep circulating groundwater rises up in our case the water temperatures of the luoquan rs02 and the tangkou rs01 thermal springs were 48 c and 34 c respectively which are obviously positive anomalies of temperature compared to the local mean air temperature of 16 7 c close to annual mean temperature of shallow groundwater furthermore the luoquan thermal spring is artesian suggesting a rising groundwater flow from the deep the two thermal springs were considered as outflow of the deep groundwater circulation in the syncline the geothermal reservoir depth of the thermal spring is one of components of deep groundwater circulation depth to calculate the geothermal reservoir depth the thermal reservoir temperature should be determined first in addition the mixing of the upward geothermal deep groundwater with cold shallow groundwater should be detected the mixing can conceal the original chemical features of deep circulating groundwater the mixing ratio is crucial for recovering of hydrochemistry of deep groundwater and then groundwater source and hydrochemical evolution can be explored the temperature of the deep circulating groundwater is consistent with that of the geothermal reservoir before rising however deep circulating groundwater loses thermal energy to surrounding rock mass during ascent from the geothermal reservoir to the surface such that the measured outlet temperature will not reflect the geothermal reservoir temperature to calculate the subsurface temperature of deep circulating groundwater cation and silica geothermometers were widely used based on hydrochemical measurements of the spring waters the assumption of no mixing with waters is usually made in using the chemical geothermometers cation geothermometers are based on ion exchange reactions with temperature dependent equilibrium constants the na k mg triangle diagram giggenbach 1988 was used to evaluate the equilibrium state of underground water rock interaction the thermal spring waters were classified as the immature water suggesting that the cation geothermometers are not applicable the silica geothermometers are based on the solubility of quartz or chalcedony silica is rapidly acquired by low ph co2 rich water from precipitation as it infiltrates and attacks minerals frisbee et al 2017 the reservoir temperatures of rs01 and rs02 were calculated using the silica geothermometer of verma and santoyo 1997 as 71 1 and 79 6 c respectively they were 70 4 and 78 8 c by the silica geothermometer of fournier 1977 those estimates from the two methods are approximate water ascending from a geothermal reservoir to the surface may cool on the way by mixing with cold shallow groundwater which leads to the underestimation of the equilibration temperature and circulation depth ferguson et al 2009 frisbee et al 2017 the silica enthalpy warm spring mixing model has been developed to estimate the reservoir temperature and the geothermal water component in spring in the silica enthalpy graph fig 6 the point a indicates the enthalpy value and sio2 content of the local cold water and the point b represents the geothermal spring for the thermal springs rs01 and rs02 the local cold springs ls05 and ls12 were set as the point a respectively the straight line determined by the points a and b was extended and the intersection point of the straight line with the silica quartz solubility curve was regarded as the point c the line is called the mixing line the proportion of deep geothermal water in the mixed water was determined by the ratio of the length of ab to ac meanwhile the enthalpy of point c is equivalent to the initial enthalpy of the deep geothermal water according to the relationship among temperature and enthalpy the temperature of the deep circulating groundwater can be inferred for the rs01 the deep geothermal reservoir temperature was estimated as 156 c and the mixing ratio of deep thermal water in the geothermal spring was 14 8 for the rs02 the temperature was 108 c with a ratio of 35 6 compared to the result of the silica geothermometer ignoring of the mixing induces an obvious deviation the boiling process during the ascending of deep circulating groundwater should be also taken into account when the steam loss occurred before the mixing the intersection point of the mixing line and the line corresponding to the boiling temperature is connected with the maximal steam loss line paralleling to the enthalpy axes fig 6 the obtained intersection the point d in the fig 6 provides values of enthalpy of the deep circulating groundwater then the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures of rs01 and rs02 were obtained as 125 c and 105 c respectively the boiling point of water increases with the increase in environmental pressure a deep circulating groundwater can boil during a rapid ascending when the water temperature exceeds the boiling point with the quick decrease of the surrounding rock pressure it has been reported that the steam separation happened for the loma blanca fumarole geothermal fluids with an initial temperature of about 290 c lelli et al 2021 if the deep groundwater slowly ascends it is hard to boil for the medium low temperature geothermal water due to the decrease of temperature induced by the heat conduction during the ascending in our case the highest estimate of the geothermal reservoir temperature is only 156 c at which water wouldn t boil until the pressure of surrounding rocks is less than 6 atm given the heat conduction and the non negligible thickness of the overlying porous aquifer namely a great pressure of surrounding rocks boiling before the mixing with the shallow groundwater is practically impossible in rs01 and rs02 in addition steam separation from ascending thermal fluids often induces changes in the isotope composition of the geothermal water lelli et al 2021 in our case rs01 and rs02 are distributed along the lmwl which doesn t support the boiling and steam separation 4 2 water source and cycling depth the water source and recharge area altitude of the deep circulating groundwater are related with the depth of deep groundwater circulation water isotopes can trace water sources and indicate recharge area altitude of regional groundwater flow the original hydrochemical characteristics of deep circulating groundwater need to be retrieved in advance according to the estimated mixing ratios a conservative mixing assumption is rational in our case given the tds less than 300 mg l loder and reichard 1981 fry 2002 if the deep circulating groundwater and the shallow groundwater well mixed the initial contents of hydrochemical components can be estimated by the end member mixing analysis emma the thermal spring water was considered as the mixture of the nearby cold spring water and the deep circulating groundwater the results of emma revealed the isotopic compositions of the deep circulating groundwater that were close to lmwl and obviously depleted in heavy isotopes fig 5 the deep circulating groundwater is consequently of meteoric origin and recharged by precipitation in high latitude mountain areas in the syncline the elevation decreases from the wings to the core the outcrops of strata formed mountains at the two wings which are considered as the main recharge area for the deep circulating water to verify the hypothesis the elevation of the recharge area was estimated using the altitude effect of water isotopes altitude is considered as the main geographic control on δ 18o in precipitation in southern china with a lapse rate about 0 2 100 m liu et al 2010 the lel intersects the lmwl at δ 18o 6 4 and δd 38 5 which indicates the average isotopic composition of groundwater in the core of the syncline using the emma the δ 18o values of the deep circulating groundwater were estimated at 8 1 and 7 4 for rs01 and rs02 respectively considering an average elevation of 350 m in the core of the syncline the mean elevations of the recharge areas of the deep circulating groundwater were calculated to be 1200 m and 850 m for rs01 and rs02 respectively the synclinal axis plane is inclined to the southeast and the outcrops in the nw wing of the syncline have a steeper dip angle and a higher elevation than the se wing thus the mean elevation of the recharge area of rs01 is much higher than that of rs02 indicating that the recharge area of rs01 should be the nw wing with the se wing as the recharge area of rs02 the f1 and f2 faults distributing along the strike of the syncline are regional deep water blocking faults owing to thecompressive core of syncline as the results of the upward deformation of underlying intrusive rocks those 250 290 trending secondary faults were formed crossing the f1 and f2 faults those faults act as water conducting pathways for the upflow of the deep circulating groundwater deep groundwater circulation exists in mountain regions where water conducting fault and water blocking fault are combined long et al 2019 it is inferred that precipitation infiltrated in the synclinal wings and then flowed into deep along the fracture and conduit of the carbonate stratum until meeting with the f2 and f1 faults respectively where groundwater were heated by the underlying intrusive rocks under the forcing of the topographic gradient the deep thermal water ascended from where the water conducting faults intersect with the water blocking faults before arriving at the land surface the deep circulating groundwater mixed with the cold shallow groundwater then the thermal springs occurred obviously the rs01 thermal spring is related with the nw wing and the f2 fault while the rs02 thermal spring is related with the se wing and the f1 fault the depth of the geothermal reservoir can be estimated according to the equation 1 the local annual average air temperature is 16 5 c in the study area the thickness of the local constant temperature zone is about 20 m in previous studies geothermal gradients g ranging from 24 to 40 c km were employed in the estimation of geothermal reservoir depth mao et al 2021 huang et al 2020 long et al 2019 grasby et al 2017 walsh 2013 it was reported that the g value in south china ranges from 7 82 to 162 5 c km with a mean of 24 1 c km yuan et al 2006 long et al 2019 estimated circulation depths of groundwater using 35 and 40 c km in the reshui geothermal field the study area locates in the south china close to the reshui geothermal field where igneous rocks are exposed and the maximum temperature of the hot spring is as high as 98 c it is rational that g in our study area falls in 24 1 35 0 c km with a very high probability if the probability was 95 the average of g would be 30 c km with a standard deviation of 3 c km based on a normal distribution hypothesis therefore g has 68 probability to fall in the range of 30 3 c km consequently the geothermal reservoir depths of rs01 and rs02 were estimated at 4 7 0 5 km and 3 1 0 3 km respectively the cycling depths of deep groundwater circulation are 5 5 0 5 and 3 6 0 3 km for rs01 and rs02 respectively these deep circulation systems require naturally occurring high permeability pathways that are largely controlled by tectonic features however permeability generally decreases with depth the penetration depth of precipitation derived waters and the bottom of the more active hydrologic cycle is relatively unknown mcintosh and ferguson 2021 recently grasby et al 2016 and 2017 studied the deep circulating groundwater with circulation depths up to 3 8 km in the canadian rocky mountains long et al 2019 estimated the circulation depths of the rucheng hot springs at 3 8 4 3 km in the xinzhou geothermal field a maximal circulation depth of groundwater was estimated to be 4 34 km mao et al 2021 in the tibetan plateau a high temperature geothermal fluid reached a circulation depth of 6 8 7 8 km pan et al 2021 our result of circulation depths falls into the range of previous results in the study area great topographic relief of the syncline and the water conducting water blocking faults played an important role in the great circulation depth 4 3 hydrochemical evolution groundwater chemistry is largely a function of mineral composition the formation through which it flows due to rock water interaction elango and kannan 2007 hydrochemical evolution of the deep circulating groundwater contains the information of flow paths in the study area the groundwater is lightly mineralized karst or karst related water with the hydrochemical type of hco3 ca dominated according to the gibbs plot the chemical components of groundwater are mainly derived from water rock interactions fig 7 however the chemistry of meteoric water poses an important influence on the groundwater in the sites of ls04 ls07 and ls08 furthermore the gaillardet plot reveals that carbonatites silicate rocks and evaporates contribute to the chemistry of groundwater fig 8 according to the calculated solubility indexes the groundwater was saturated with calcite aragonite kaolinite quartz and chalcedony which is consistent with the result of the gaillardet plot carbonatites are recognized as the dominate source for the groundwater chemistry it is rational due to the presence of limestone formations in the syncline the groundwater of ls04 ls07 and ls08 obtained considerable ionic components from evaporates and was of the very low tds sea salt particles in atmosphere from the south china sea and the west pacific ocean can be imported into groundwater by summer monsoon precipitation and contribute to groundwater hydrochemistry in these sites around the f1 fault consequently groundwater around the water blocking f1 fault is considered as recent infiltrating rain water with limited water rock interactions based on hydrochemical features the q type cluster reveals four groups of water samples fig 9 the first group is composed of the cold groundwater near the f1 fault including ls04 ls07 and ls08 which can be the result of differences in ionic sources the second group includes river water samples and cold karst spring ls01 ls05 and ls12 the third group includes the thermal spring samples rs01 and rs02 cold karst springs ls09 ls11 and cold pore water samples ls02 ls03 ls10 and ls14 the deep thermal water mixed with cold shallow pore water before gushing on the ground which is supported by the clustering result the forth group is composed of cold pore water ls06 ls10 ls13 and ls15 the results of the r type cluster and the pearson s r discover the relation among major ions tds and ph fig 10 and table 1 ca2 hco3 and tds are divided into a group exhibiting closest correlations r 0 95 which numerically verifies the limestone source of ca2 and hco3 and their domination in tds no3 is a typical agricultural contaminant in groundwater no3 showed a pearson s r of 0 66 with cl that is obviously greater than the r between no3 and the other major ions the grouping of cl and no3 consequently indicates a dominated agricultural fertilizer source of the two ions mgso4 is a common soil improver used in agriculture among the pearson s r between so4 2 and the other major ions so4 2 presents the highest correlation with mg2 r 0 65 the grouping of mg2 and so4 2 suggests an agricultural contribution na and k show similar natural abundances and chemical properties which results in the high r of 0 81 between them at the same time both na and k show high r with cl moreover na k and cl were also divided into a group in the clustering suggesting a possible source of na and k from agricultural fertilizers cation exchange processes might play a role in groundwater chemistry zaidi et al 2015 when there is an exchange between na or k in groundwater and ca2 or mg2 in the aquifer material both of the chloro alkaline indices cai1 and cai2 are positive however negative values of the indices indicate na k absorbed on the surface of fine grained materials of the aquifers can be replaced by ca2 mg2 in groundwater resulting in an increase in na k in groundwater in the study area these indices mainly show negative values fig 11 nearly a half of groundwater samples presented very low negative values of the indices suggesting an obvious exchange between na and k in the aquifer material and ca2 and mg2 in groundwater the karst water from the two wings of the syncline replenished the aquifer of unconsolidated sediments on which na and k were adsorbed through the reverse ion exchange processes the contents of na and k in the shallow groundwater increased mixing processes imposed great influences on the hydrochemical evolution of the deep circulating groundwater the deep groundwater flowed upward from the geothermal reservoir and mixed with cold groundwater in the unconsolidated sediment aquifer the estimated mixing ratios of the deep groundwater were 14 8 and 35 6 at rs01 and rs02 respectively using the ratios and the average composition of the cold groundwater the chemical composition of the deep circulating groundwater can be inferred the results showed that the water type of the deep circulating groundwater is unchanged after the mixing however the dominant ion contents including ca2 mg2 hco3 so4 2 and sio2 of the deep circulating groundwater greatly decreased on average by 58 in the mixing the tds of deep circulating groundwater therefore inclined from 470 mg l to 205 mg l in rs01 and from 498 mg l to 257 mg l in rs02 the shallow groundwdater flows local paths in the core of the syncline compared to it the deep circulating groundwater experiences regional flow paths which is much longer than that of the shallow groundwater furthermore the temperature of the deep circulating groundwater is much higher than the shallow groundwater as a result the water rock interactions of the deep circulating groundwater would be stronger and contribute more ions than that in the shallow groundwater then the mixing dilutes the deep circulating groundwater owing to the large proportion of the shallow groundwater agricultural no3 is unstable and usually found high contents in shallow groundwater wang et al 2019 for the deep circulating groundwater originated from the steep nw wing of the syncline the contents of no3 and cl were close to zero however the contents of deep circulating groundwater in the se wing were basically the same as that of the shallow groundwater despite the marked difference in tds the difference in the no3 and cl contents between the two deep circulating groundwater flow systems supports the non geological origin of the two ions which is consistent with the previous analysis 4 4 a deep groundwater circulation conceptual model based on the hydrogeochemical analysis we put forward a deep groundwater circulation conceptual model of the study area two deep groundwater circulation systems were developed on the two wings of syncline respectively fig 12 the thermal springs rs01 tangkou and rs02 luoquan were exposed at the synclinal core near the junctions of the two groups of faults the thermal spring water discharges the deep circulating groundwater which is of meteoric origin the recharge area of rs01 is the nw wing of the syncline with a mean elevation of 1200 m while the recharge area of rs02 is the se wing with an average elevation of 850 m due to the great depths of the geothermal reservoirs the total cycling depths of groundwater at rs01 and rs02 reached 5 5 0 5 and 3 6 0 3 km respectively the syncline structure and faults form the geological basis supporting the deep groundwater circulation in our case the synclinal axis plane is inclined to the southeast and then the strata in the nw wing of the syncline have a steeper dip angle and a higher elevation than the se wing at the core of the syncline the f1 and f2 main faults distributed along the strike of the syncline are water blocking main faults owing to thecompression in the core the intersection of 250 290 trending secondary faults with the f1 and f2 faults is the result of upward syncline deformation caused by the uplift of underlying intrusive rocks and forms the upward flow channel for deep groundwater younger mechanical flexing of the syncline then is associated with tension that opens vertical pathways for the deep groundwater flow fractured karst reservoirs often exhibit complex multiscale heterogeneities involving pores fractures and caves whose length scales range from microns to tens or hundreds of meters zhang et al 2022 along the fractures and conduits of the carbonate stratum precipitation infiltrates in the two wings of the syncline and then nearly horizontally flows to the deep where significant flow channeling would occur around the percolation threshold and be dominated by a limited number of preferential pathways zhang et al 2022 the main faults impede the flow and could deflect sub horizontal flow to greater depth where geothermal reservoirs are heated by the underlying intrusive rocks for the rs01 the deep groundwater circulation is related with the nw wing and the f2 main fault and the deep geothermal reservoir temperature is 156 c for the rs02 the deep groundwater flow is related with the se wing and the f1 main fault and the temperature of the geothermal reservoir is 108 c after the heating in the geothermal reservoirs the deep groundwater ascends along the water conducting secondary faults under the forcing of the topographic gradient and neotectonic stress before arriving at the land surface the deep circulating groundwater mixes into the cold shallow groundwater in the unconsolidated sediments of the syncline core the mean mixing ratios of the deep groundwater are 14 8 at rs01 and 35 6 at rs02 finally the water temperatures of rs01 and rs02 are 34 c and 48 c respectively controlling by faults and mixing with shallow groundwater are common phenomena in deep groundwater circulation systems recently finn et al 2022 found that high flux conduits of upward thermal fluids distributed along buried faults in the yellowstone region moreover shallow groundwater mixes with thermal fluids and then emerges at the surface 5 conclusion physical chemical and isotopic investigations of thermal and cold groundwaters reveal two different fault controlled deep circulating groundwater flow systems developed in a synclinal structure with maximal spring temperatures of 34 c rs01 and 48 c rs02 deep circulating groundwater flow paths originate in the limestone strata outcrops widely distributed on the two wings of the syncline infiltrating precipitation in the northwest wing of the syncline flows downward a vertical distance of 5 5 0 5 km and is heated up to 156 c in the geothermal reservoir in the southeast wing infiltrating precipitation flows downward 3 6 0 3 km and is heated up to 108 c due to the topographic gradient forcing the deep circulating groundwater ascends along the intersections of the water blocking main faults and the water conducting secondary faults in the core of the syncline and forms the thermal springs the water of the two different deep circulation systems is mineralized by water rock interactions in the limestone formation of the syncline carbonate dissolution is the dominant water rock interaction consequently the groundwater is slightly mineralized karst or karst related water with the hydrochemical type of hco3 ca dominated the reverse cation exchange process plays a role in the chemistry of the shallow groundwater as a result the contents of na and k in the shallow groundwater increase and the concentrations of ca2 and mg2 decrease during the ascending the deep circulation thermal groundwater interacted with cold shallow groundwater and mixing processes imposed great influences on the chemistry of the deep circulating groundwater the mixing ratios of the deep groundwater were 14 8 at rs01 and 35 6 at rs02 respectively the mixing obviously diluted the deep circulating groundwater but didn t alter its water type generally deep water conducting main faults act as pathways forming the physical base of downward flow of deep groundwater circulation we demonstrate that large scale synclinal structures are also favorable to the formation of deep groundwater circulation furthermore obstructed by water blocking main faults different deep circulating groundwater systems can develop in the two wings of a syncline the upflow of the deep groundwater circulation is related to the intersections of the water blocking main faults and the water conducting secondary faults where the force of topographic gradient and neotectonic stress converge it is considered as the physical base of deep circulating groundwater upflow deep circulating groundwater tends to be influenced by geotherm consequently the depth of the deep groundwater circulation can be determined by the sum of the geothermal reservoir depth and the elevation difference between the recharge area and the thermal spring which is a simple and effective method in addition the determination of original chemical features of deep circulating groundwater is crucial to estimate the recharge elevation and the geothermal reservoir depth credit authorship contribution statement ruiqiang yuan conceptualization data curation formal analysis investigation methodology writing original draft

3303,controlling the damaging effects of fluvial flood events has been a major challenge for mankind integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic models are often employed to estimate the flow and vital flood inundation information for mitigating such damages the most important criterion for their implementation is that they should offer large scale applicability with a finer resolution to have local relevance and practicability this study presented an integrated modeling framework vic rapid lisfp that couples a hydrological model vic a river routing model rapid and a hydrodynamic model lisflood fp for fast generation of high resolution flow and flood inundation extent the utility of the model is tested and demonstrated for a case study in the upper krishna river basin in india the results showed that the simulated hourly streamflows from the calibrated model match reasonably well with the observations in terms of various efficiency measures also the generated flood inundation maps from the model can reliably capture more than 80 of the satellite derived flood inundation extent during both the low and high flow events the proposed modeling framework is based on readily available open source hydrographic data and minimum meteorological information so it has global applicability for supporting a flood management system with local relevance especially for the data scarce regions keywords vic rapid lisfp flood inundation integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic model streamflow estimation upper krishna basin 1 introduction floods are one of the most catastrophic natural disasters causing hugely negative socioeconomic impacts and taking thousands of human lives every year all around the globe grimaldi et al 2019 with the increased climatic extremes population growth and rapid urbanization it is expected that flood damages might increase manifold in the future to mitigate such flood damages and build flood resilience accurate prediction of flood hydrograph and flood inundation extent is crucial follum et al 2017 unfortunately many regions of the world especially the developing nations like india mostly lack sufficient in situ hydrological data type and resolution which poses a great challenge in flood modelling and developing subsequent mitigation measures the current advancement in remotely sensed observations and readily available open access high resolution global hydrological and hydrographical datasets can circumvent the data availability constraints especially for hydrological modelling applications wu et al 2014 nandi and reddy 2018 wu et al 2018 lin et al 2019 hydrological modelling has shown great promise in the field of water resources especially for supporting flood management and operational decision making physically based hydrological models have been widely used for simulation prediction of streamflows and for establishing a direct relationship between the observable land characteristics soil property land cover information etc and the model parameters the grid based variable infiltration capacity vic is one of the most widely used hydrological models worldwide schumann et al 2013 tavakoly et al 2017 nandi and reddy 2020a this model can simulate land atmospheric fluxes and water and energy balances on the land for each grid independently it can simulate hydrological components at sub daily or hourly timescales the vic model is input output intensive but not memory intensive and its source code is freely available which has encouraged its wider use the ability to account for the sub grid variability is the standout feature of the vic model which is advantageous over most of the well known models therefore this model is suitable for large scale flood modelling which has also been recommended in several prior studies wu et al 2014 wu et al 2018 chawla and mujumdar 2020 nevertheless the vic model doesn t contain any process for routing the generated runoff from model grid cells to a downstream point or basin outlet to handle this usually a source to sink routing scheme based on the unit hydrograph method is used to transfer the flow through the river network composed of uniform grid cells however there exist few drawbacks using grid based routing applications with vic such as 1 high computational requirements for large scale application at a finer resolution 2 difficulty to convert gridded runoff volume to estimate discharge hydrograph at a specific location and 3 accurate representation of hydrological features e g reservoirs vector based river routing with large scale hydrological models has received great interest in recent studies as it facilitates large scale high resolution hydrological prediction and eliminates the mentioned caveats of grid based routing applications yamazaki et al 2013 tavakoly et al 2017 in a global river modelling study yamazaki et al 2013 used cama flood global river model and compared the model s performance for daily river flow simulation using vector based and grid based river network maps derived from the same global flow direction maps this study found a 60 increase in simulation speed for the vector based routing as compared to the grid based river network approach and recommended the use of a grid based river network in large scale river flow simulation the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid is one such vector based river routing application supported by its easy configuration across the globe with the availability of a global scale hydrography dataset such as hydrosheds david et al 2011 tavakoly et al 2017 demonstrated the coupled application of vic and rapid models for river flow modelling over the mississippi river basin they highlighted the benefits of such integrated vector based river routing over the grid based hydrological model for large scale high resolution river flow modelling vic or other grid based large scale hydrological models are typically operated at a relatively coarser resolution for fully distributed hydrological models such as hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrological model triangular irregular network based real time integrated basin simulator etc at least for streamflow simulation and provide less practical value for flood prediction at the local scale therefore there is a need to develop an integrated system that can intake and allocate the gridded runoff from a relatively coarser resolution hydrological model to a vector based river network and subsequently route the flows in the river network for high resolution discharge and flood prediction accurate prediction of streamflow using a coupled hydrological and river routing model may constitute only one crucial element for a robust flood modelling system still reliable estimation of flood inundation extent makes that system complete schumann et al 2013 grimaldi et al 2019 hydrodynamic models have generally used and preferred for simulation of the overbank i e floodplain flow conditions which can fulfill this gap lerat et al 2012 a variety of hydrodynamic models 1d or 2d can be employed to achieve this target while the 1d hydrodynamic models are sufficient for flood dynamics in the river channel 2d hydrodynamic models are essential for the accurate prediction of flood inundation in the floodplain neal et al 2012 dottori et al 2017 the two most popular hydrodynamic models that have been used for 2d hydrodynamic modelling are hec ras and lisflood fp shustikova et al 2019 however the applicability of hec ras model for the large spatial domain is limited due to its higher computational demand follum et al 2017 also although hec ras is a free tool it is not open sourced i e its source codes are not publicly available and it is a gui based program this may be suitable for standalone execution but difficult to incorporate in pipelines of different model execution in an integrated manner on the other hand lisflood fp being open sourced its input and output are easily controllable further the representation of floodplain topography is an important criterion for the selection of a hydrodynamic model lisflood fp considers a sub grid modelling scheme which allows the model to represent channels smaller than the digital elevation model dem resolution neal et al 2012 such sub grid schemes for channel representation are beneficial for areas where high resolution dem e g lidar data is not available another important criterion in hydrodynamic modelling is the precise definition of boundary conditions domeneghetti et al 2013 hydrodynamic models are generally forced with available stage or discharge data which can be problematic in ungauged river catchments or at a specific location in a gauged catchment where a gauging station is not installed rajib et al 2020 in both cases an effective solution is to integrate a hydrologic model to produce the discharge data that can be used as an upstream boundary condition to drive the hydrodynamic model several studies have presented the integrated operation of a hydrologic and hydrodynamic model for flood monitoring specifically at the catchment scale for example pappenberger et al 2005 used lisflood hydrological model to predict the discharge hydrograph which was further fed into the lisflood fp hydrodynamic model to predict the spatial inundation extent for the meuse catchment in belgium komi et al 2017 demonstrated the ability of the coupled modelling to identify flood affected areas in an ungauged catchment of the oti river basin in west africa in the last few years a great amount of effort has ledto developing continental to global scale coupled flood models dottori et al 2017 hoch et al 2017 these models often produce large scale predictions of flood flows and inundation maps i e at km scale which are extremely helpful in certain applications e g socioeconomic eco hydrologic climate change etc however these studies lack the local relevance i e the spatial resolution of topographic data in modelling required for geo specific flood assessment as floods are mostly local scale events and controlled by the local hydrometeorological conditions bacopoulos et al 2017 the integrated modelling approach presented by rajib et al 2020 in the ohio river basin united states was found to be effective regarding the local relevance in large scale coupled flood modelling however they considered daily meteorological forcing for preparation of the flood inundation extent which was too coarse to produce actionable short range forecast information in case of flooding since the difference between average discharge for a day and the equivalent amount of water passing in a few hours might cause a drastic difference another possible way to maintain local relevance in large scale coupled modelling studies was presented by hoch et al 2017 where the study coupled coarse resolution pcr globwb hydrological model with fine resolution lisflood fp and delft3d hydrodynamic models only at a fraction of the study area which can be selected based on the complexity of the terrain or socioeconomic importance of flooding overall the coupling frameworks have shown great promise to handle the critical issues of flood modelling there have been studies on coupling a hydrologic model with a routing model or a hydrologic model with a hydrodynamic model however to the best of authors awareness there is hardly any studies that have integrated all the three types of models i e hydrologic routing and hydrodynamic to frame a comprehensive flood modelling system though model integration is useful and have been successfully applied in previous studies it has to be noted that the reliability of such coupled models depends on many factors such as the selection of the model structure model parametrization study area or use of different input data haghnegahdar et al 2017 in such a scenario it would be advantageous to understand the importance of various model parameters estimate the unknown model parameters and quantify the impacts of the model s uncertainty on the model outputs another important concern that may arise when coupling two or more models together is the inconvenience and potential error during the transfer of input output between the individual models wei et al 2019 in this regard automating the model coupling would result in making a single modelling unit with capabilities of the constituent models which would greatly help their quick implementation in various flood modelling applications therefore this study aims to develop a novel framework by integrating hydrologic routing and hydrodynamic models into a single flood modelling system the upper krishna river basin located in southwestern india is a densely populated region with significant agricultural importance however it is frequently struck with high flood events which has caused thousands of fatalities and large destruction to agricultural activities menon and bhatt 2005 moreover the public infrastructures viz roads bridges culverts embankments were frequently damaged due to intense floods particularly in the kolhapur region of maharashtra a low lying region of the basin floods have caused severe repercussions phadnis 2016 therefore it is imperative to develop a robust flood modelling system over the basin to mitigate the pernicious impacts of the flood however no studies conducted to address the same considering the aforementioned issues this study aims to develop a robust framework by integrating different types of models to form a comprehensive flood modelling system which should be able to model the flooding conditions within the upper krishna river basin in this regard the specific objectives of this study are to 1 to develop a comprehensive flood modleing system by integrating the vic rapid and lisflood fp models and 2 perform calibration and validation of the model over the upper krishna river basin and demonstrate the utlity of the developed modelling framework for historical flooding conditions in the following sections firstly the individual model and the model coupling processes are described section 2 section 3 presents the details of the case study and the model application results of the model for a case study application are presented in section 4 section 5 contains critical discussion on the model results from the study and the scope for future improvements finally the major conclusions drawn from the study are presented in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model this study adopts the vic model a grid based macro scale hydrological model for streamflow generation liang et al 1994 while the model was originally designed to improve the horizontal representation of general circulation models gcms its various unique characteristics i e sub grid variability nonlinear baseflow estimation etc have made it one of the most commonly used hydrological model in recent time schumann et al 2013 tavakoly et al 2017 nandi and reddy 2020a there are two additional factors for the selection of the vic model in the present study firstly this model has continuously undergone substantial community driven improvements which is further expected to grow with its maximized application and testing with the wider community secondly the model can efficiently simulate the continuous hydrological responses at an hourly scale vital for flood management studies wu et al 2014 2018 vic divides the study area into several computational grids or cells as a grid based model and then a simulation of hydrological fluxes is made at each modelling grid but several vegetation classes can exist within a single grid the computation of soil moisture runoff infiltration and other relevant hydrological processes are performed for each vegetation class finally the total hydrological fluxes for a grid are obtained by summing the individual vegetation class fluxes weighted by their fractional area coverage such representation of subgrid physical processes in the vic model enables an efficient strategy to balance the model accuracy and heavy computational demand the vic model allows water to enter a grid only from the atmosphere suggesting the non channel flow transmission between grids is not considered following the continuity equation the water balance in each time step for the vic model can be expressed as 1 p r e ds dt where p r e ds dt are the precipitation mm runoff mm evapotranspiration mm and changes in water storage mm and chosen time step respectively the evapotranspiration in the model is computed using the penman monteith method the total runoff r in the model is comprised of direct runoff or surface runoff rd from the top two soil layers and the baseflow or subsurface runoff rb from the bottom most or third soil layer only direct runoff and subsurface runoff are computed in the model by using the following expressions 2 r d p w w max p i 0 i m p w w max w max 1 1 i 0 p i m 1 b inf l t p i 0 i m 3 r b d s d m w s w 3 max w 3 0 w 3 w s w 3 max d s d m w s w 3 max w 3 d m d s d m w s w 3 w s w 3 max w 3 max w s w 3 max 2 w 3 w s w 3 max where rd top two layers and rb bottom or third layer are the direct runoff mm and base flow mm p represents the precipitation mm wmax and w denote the maximum and current soil moisture mm for the upper two soil layers im and i0 are the maximum and initial infiltration rate mm w3 represents the initial soil moisture for the bottom most third soil layer w 3 max and ws are the maximum soil moisture at the bottom most third soil layer mm and its fraction unitless where nonlinear baseflow begins dm and ds represent the maximum daily base flow mm and its fraction unitless where nonlinear baseflow begins for the third soil layer and binflt is the variable infiltration curve parameter unitless 2 2 rapid river routing model the vector based rapid river routing model is used in this study to transport the runoff downstream generated by the vic model at each model grid until the river empties into a lake ocean or reaches the outlet of a basin the rapid model was developed by david et al 2011 and is freely available at https github com c h david rapid the main inputs to the model are a river network river network connectivity information specification of the muskingum parameters for the river network and lateral flow coming into the river network the three key advantages of rapid as compared to other river routing models are 1 vector based high resolution streamflow modelling 2 flexibility to adapt for raster based river networks and 3 ability to simulate in a distributed computing framework rapid uses a matrix based version of the muskingum method which is a one dimensional diffusive wave estimate of streamflow continuity equation that excludes the momentum equation for routing the flow through the river networks the storage constant k with a dimension of time and a dimensionless weighing parameter based on the relative influence of inflow outflow are the two parameters of the muskingum method the following equation can describe the finite difference form of the muskingum method in the model 3 q t δ t c 1 q u t δ t q e t δ t c 2 q u t q e t c 3 q t where 4 c 1 δ t 2 k x k 1 x δ t 2 5 c 2 δ t 2 k x k 1 x δ t 2 and 6 c 3 k 1 x δ t 2 k 1 x δ t 2 where c1 c2 and c3 are the dimensionless parameter matrix and have the property of j 1 3 c j 1 here q m3 s is the outflow in the reach qu m3 s and qe m3 s are the upstream contribution of inflow and lateral inflow for the reach respectively t is the simulation time and δ t represents the time step a suitable calibration strategy must be adopted to estimate the values of the parameters ki and xi 2 3 lisflood fp hydrodynamic model the lisflood fp is used as a low complexity two dimensional hydrodynamic model in the present study to predict the flood inundation extent bates and de roo 2000 the lisflood fp model was developed by bates and de roo 2000 which is available at http www bristol ac uk geography research hydrology models lisflood downloads the unique features of this hydrodynamic model are 1 support for raster based model structure computational mesh has the same resolution as that of the input resolution of the terrain 2 provision for high resolution simulations and 3 subgrid scale representation of river channel scheme the model uses an explicit finite difference scheme for solving the shallow water equation eq 7 by neglecting the advection contributions as follows 7 δ q δ t g h δ h z δ x g n 2 q 2 r 4 3 h 0 where q represents the flow per unit width m2s 1 t is the simulation time s h m and z m are the flow depth and bed elevation n represents manning s coefficient value m 1 3s g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 and r is the hydraulic radius m the final unit flow for the next time step q t δ t is subsequently calculated with respect to the time step of δ t using 8 q t δ t q t g h t δ t δ h t z δ x 1 g h t δ t n 2 q t h t 7 3 where δ x is the modelling cell resolution specified by resolution of input dem and other terms are mentioned earlier for eq 7 the present implementation of the lisflood fp model uses the subgrid representation of the river channel which allows representing channel width independent of input dem resolution however consideration of the subgrid channel scheme involves three additional input data requirements bank full channel widths channel bed elevation and bank elevation 2 4 coupling vic rapid and lisflood fp the coupling of the rapid and lisflood fp model with vic is accomplished in two distinct phases and the corresponding workflow is shown in fig 1 first the rapid model is linked with the vic model which results in the vic rapid model next the vic rapid model is employed as the starting point for incorporating lisflood fp into the coupled vic rapid lisfp model the coupling between the models is based on the loose coupling concept where vic rapid and lisflood fp are executed as a stand alone model however a single python wrapper programme is developed to execute the individual model in serial and control the transfer of information across the models required for the coupling the linking and execution of the individual model in the vic rapid lisfp modelling framework is presented in fig 1 the coupled model can execute the vic rapid and lisflood fp with different spatial extent the main intention behind this is the common practice of computationally demanding hydrodynamic model applications to smaller flood prone areas within a basin instead of the entire river basin hoch et al 2017 hoch et al 2018 therefore such an option in the modelling framework provides flexibility to the modeller to focus on a smaller area of importance for hydrodynamic modelling and reduce its subsequent heavy computational burden the present study makes use of the three layer 5 1 version of vic and the latest 1 8 0 version of the rapid model for the coupled vic rapid modelling after providing the various necessary input data the vic model is executed to generate the subsurface runoff baseflow from the third soil layer and surface runoff from the top two soil layers of each model grid next the rapid routing model is called a post processor to route the grid based runoff both surface and subsurface runoff through the river channel network to the outlet of the basin using the same timestep as that of the vic however vic is a grid based model and rapid is a vector based model that requires inflow at each river reach in netcdf file format this requires two intermediate steps to transfer the vic generated runoff to be used in the rapid model the first step is to create a mapping function between vic model grids and rapid river reaches the second step is to convert the ascii formatted gridded runoff from the vic model into the reach level river inflow data in netcdf format using the mapping function created in the first step the rapidhelper and rapidinputcreate are two python programmes created to accomplish these two tasks the rapidhelper uses hydrography data i e river network to create a weight table that includes the relative contribution of the vic model grids to the individual river reach for the rapid modelling the rapidinputcreate uses the generated weight table to produce the incremental runoff volume at each time step for each reach in the netcdf format the creation of the weight table is required only once and can be reused every time when there is a need to convert the vic gridded runoff to rapid lateral inflow at every reach the other required inputs for the execution of rapid such as river connectivity river basin information muskingum k and values are created using rapidpy an open source python library available at https github com erdc rapidpy snow et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that the parameter kj value of parameter k for at a river reach j in rapidpy is computed as kini λk where λk is a multiplier that needs to be calibrated and kini is the initial value of k which depends on the river topography and wave celerity and can be estimated from the hydrosheds dataset after acquiring all the relevant input data the rapid model solves the matrix based muskingum equation to produce the streamflow at every reach the dashed line in fig 1 denotes the streamflow simulation process by the coupled vic rapid model the output hydrographs from the vic rapid model provide the upstream boundary condition for driving the lisflood fp model at any time for generating the flood inundation information the most important step for this coupling is to identify the river reaches that are encompassed by the lisflood fp model domain the other required parameters for execution of lisflood fp models are dem bankfull river width river bed elevation manning s roughness coefficient n value the default timestep used in the coupling of the vic rapid and lisflood fp is one hour however the developed coupled model can be easily executed for daily or other sub hourly time steps if required 3 application 3 1 study area and data used the study area is situated within the upper krishna river basin in the state of maharashtra india the spatial extent of the study area is 73 3 e to 73 9 e and 16 1 n to 18 1 n and the location map is shown in fig 2 the outlet of this basin falls in the kurundwad region which is shown with a red circle in fig 2 the average annual rainfall and temperature in the basin are 947 24 mm and 25 8 c respectively the study area has a size of 15 186 km2 elevation in this area varies from 170 to 968 m above mean sea level the major land cover type found in this area is cropland hourly gridded meteorological forcing data for the vic model is obtained at 12km spatial resolution from the imdaa regional reanalysis product ashrit et al 2020 to validate simulated flows hourly observed discharge data at kurundwad is collected from the upper krishna division of central water commission cwc government of india the available daily streamflow records for arjunwad samdoli karad and warunji streamflow gauging stations fig 2 are also collected from cwc the lulc and soil information for vic model is prepared using the nasa s modis mod12q1 land cover product 1 km and food and agricultural organization fao harmonized world soil database 1 km respectively the rapid model requires stream network information in vector format which is obtained from the global hydrographic database hydroriver https hydrosheds org page hydrorivers srtm 30 m resolution dem is used for setting up the lisflood fp sub grid version lisflood fp also requires bank full channel width information which is prepared using the global river widths from landsat grwl database allen pavelsky 2018 lastly for validation of flood inundation extent sar 30 m images are acquired from the sentinel 1 mission www sentinel hub com the obtained sar images are manually processed with a visual inspection of those imageries to isolate flooded cells from non flooded cells and prepare the binary flood inundation extent oberstadler et al 1997 di baldassarre et al 2009 3 2 model configuration the streamflow is simulated in all the 1802 river reaches blue lines in fig 2 across the study area by the execution of rapid using direct runoff and baseflow data from the vic model simulation of the vic model is carried out with 0 25 grid cells which are also shown with green square boxes in fig 2 the streamflow simulation is performed with an hourly time step for two distinctive time periods i e 2000 2011 and 2018 the main reason behind this is the unavailability of both observed streamflow and flood inundation data during the same time period more specifically the hourly streamflow observation is available only up to the year 2011 and sentinel 1 sar images are only available during a flooding event only after 2018 for the study area as the performance of streamflow simulation is heavily dependent on the accurate estimation of the unknown model parameters this study performed a joint automatic calibration of unknown vic and rapid model parameters using self adaptive differential evolution sade which is a population based metaheuristic search algorithm the sade has been found to be performing better for calibration of computationally intensive distributed hydrological model as compared to other popular evolutionary algorithms such as shuffled complex evolution sce genetic algorithm ga and differential evolution de algorithm nandi and reddy 2020a nandi and reddy 2020b while nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is chosen as the objective function for the calibration more details on the implementation of the sade based model calibration are given in appendix 1 sensitivity analysis is another fundamental step in hydrological modelling which is carried out for model calibration uncertainty assessment diagnostic evaluation and decision making pianosi et al 2016 devak and dhanya 2017 saltelli et al 2008 highlighted ranking and screening of model parameters as two important purposes among many others of sensitivity analysis irrespective of the purpose sensitivity analysis is broadly classified into two categories namely local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2016 the global sensitivity analysis attempts to search the entire parameter space rather than exploring the model output at some reference value as in the case of local sensitivity analysis sarrazin et al 2016 global sensitivity analysis has been successfully applied to computationally intensive hydrological models prior to their calibration to screen out unimportant parameters from the model calibration van werkhoven et al 2009 this study employed a variance based global sensitivity analysis technique namely sobol s sensitivity analysis which computes first order si and total order sensitivity sti indices tang et al 2007 herman et al 2013 to estimate the quantitative sensitivity of the considered model parameters although global sensitivity analysis techniques are computationally more demanding than local sensitivity analysis techniques they are more useful in the case of interactive model parameters which is certainly advantageous for hydrological models tang et al 2007 khare et al 2019 the various parameters and their associated ranges considered for the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 1 the vic model parameters and their related ranges are given in table 1 which are adapted from online documentation for the vic model https vic readthedocs io and earlier studies xie et al 2007 nandi and reddy 2020b the rapid parameter ranges are adapted from the suggestion of snow et al 201 7 formulation of the two mentioned sensitivity indices is provided in appendix 2 in spite of the calibration of the model parameters there will still be uncertainty in the calibrated streamflow due to various factors such as input data error selection of a particular model structure etc therefore to analyze the collective uncertainty present in streamflow from various sources a quantile regression technique is used to generate the 95 uncertainty bound of the simulated streamflow more details on the formulation of uncertainty bound using the quantile regression method can be found in appendix 3 for the simulation of the flood inundation maps the calibrated hourly discharge from the earlier step is used to drive the lisfflood fp model the lisfflood fp model is applied to the kolhapur region in the study area which is denoted by the black square box in fig 2 with the 30 m srtm dem the study area is covered by 80 808 grid cells which are simulated for flood inundation in the lisflood fp model the elevation ranges between 528 and 614 m in this domain which will have a major effect on the perceived accuracy after dem the second most important input parameter in the model is the manning s coefficient the spatially varying manning s coefficient values fig s2 are computed for the different land cover classes fig s1 by the recommendation of passeri et al 2018 the bank elevation is computed from native resolution srtm dem the bank full channel width and channel bed elevation data are prepared as a raster layer for the study domain hydrodynamic from the grwl database this raster layer contains zero width elevation value for grids outside the channel and the grids falling within channel gets the value of the river width bed elevation information from grwl database the accuracy of the grwl dataset can be inferred from allen and pavelsky 2018 to verify the flood inundation extent for both high flow events two associated remotely sensed images from sar sentinel 1 are acquired for the year 2018 fig 3 the blue polygon in these images defines the binary fluvial inundation extent neglecting those water pixels from standing or permanent water bodies e g lake pond etc the main advantage of using sar image data is that they are not affected by cloud coverage problems 3 3 statistical performance measures evaluation of hourly streamflow is performed using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias the formulation of these indices is shown below 9 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 r 2 n i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i i 1 n s i 2 n i 1 n o i 2 i 1 n o i 2 n i 1 n s i 2 i 1 n

mean of observed flows n represents the total number of time steps for a better agreement between simulated flow and observed flow the value of rsr and pbias should be close to zero and the value of nse and r2 should be close to one for the evaluation of uncertainty the prediction interval coverage probability picp and the average relative interval length aril indices are computed in this study nasseri et al 2014 the picp is one important measure that measures the fraction of observation enclosed in the prediction interval picp can be expressed as 13 picp 1 n i 1 n y i where n represents the number of observations and yi is one or zero depending on whether it lies within the range of upper and lower prediction interval or not a picp value of 100 represents the ideal case where all the observations are covered by the prediction interval aril is an indicator to describe the width of uncertainty bounds which can be formulated as 14 aril 1 n i 1 n u i u u i l y i where n is the total number of observations y is the observed streamflow m3s 1 i represents the time step and uu m3s 1 and ul m3s 1 are the upper and lower boundary of the uncertainty band respectively for an ideal case the value of aril is zero and increasing aril values represent increasing uncertainty for validation of flood inundation extent probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are computed based on the contingency table table 2 as below 15 pod hit hit m i s s 16 far false hit f a l s e 17 csi hit hit m i s s f a l s e for optimal detection of flood inundation extent while the value of pod and csi should be close to one the far score should be close to zero 4 results 4 1 streamflow evaluation the vic rapid modelling is applied for streamflow or flood flow simulation in the study 4 1 1 sensitivity analysis the first order and total order sobol s sensitivity indices for all the 15 parameters of the coupled vic rapid model for flow simulation are investigated using nse as an objective function with distributed forcing at an hourly time step the results are presented in table 3 where columns 1 3 show the results for the first order sensitivity index and columns 4 6 for the total order sensitivity index the first order indices represent a parameter s only own contribution referred to as main effect towards variance in the model response while the total order sensitivity indices include the effect of a parameter s interaction with the other model parameters too considering si values the parameter d3 is noticeably the most important parameter followed by the parameters d2 λ k ex2 ws binflt and ds which can be seen from the table 3 the d3 parameter alone contributes 39 of the overall first order variance in the simulated flow its sensitivity value is more than double as compared to the second or other lowered ranked parameters as per total order sensitivity index sti values from table 3 d3 dm ws and ds are the top four sensitive parameters followed by the λ k d2 ex2 and binflt overall the top 8 parameters for the total order sensitivity index contribute 97 of the total model variance the parameters binflt d1 and ks3 also have a moderate total order sensitivity even though their sti value is significantly smaller when compared with those of the top 8 parameters it is also interesting to note that the top 8 sensitive parameters for the total order sensitivity index are also in the list of top 8 sensitive parameters considering the first order sensitivity index the first order sensitivity index of the parameter binflt is very less as compared to the parameter ds however an inverse relationship can be easily noticed in the case of total order sensitivity which signifies that the parameter binflt has stronger interaction i e interaction total order effect first order effect with the other model parameters on the streamflow simulation as compared to the parameter ds the probable reason for this is that the parameter binflt has a more direct influence on the direct runoff and parameter ds is closely related to the process of baseflow as can be seen from eq 2 3 and typically the contribution of direct runoff is higher than the baseflow on the total runoff generation from table 3 it can be observed that dm has a very low si value and a very high sti value indicating its highly interactive nature with the other model parameters the first order sensitivity index value of the parameter ks3 is zero however the total order sensitivity index value of the parameter is 0 005 which suggests all the impact of ks3 on streamflow generation is caused solely by its interactions with the other model parameters it is also interesting to note that the vic model s various baseflow related parameters have shown more sensitivity especially considering the total order sensitivity indices a possible reason for this might be the relatively high baseflow contribution to the total streamflow amount in the basin mohaideen and varija 2018 among two parameters of the rapid model one parameter λ k is found to be highly sensitive while the other x is insensitive overall among all the 15 parameters considered for the sensitivity analysis four parameters ks3 ks1 ex3 and x are found to be insensitive because of their zero sensitivity score pianosi and wagener 2015 considering both si and sti values 4 1 2 vic rapid model calibration and validation the sensitive parameters found from the global sensitivity analysis are further considered for the automatic calibration of the vic rapid model to provide a consistent streamflow estimation the sade algorithm along with the hourly observed streamflow information at the kurundwad station is used to calibrate the model automatically seven years data 2000 2006 are considered for the calibration and five years data 2007 2011 for the validation the final calibrated values of the eleven vic rapid model parameters are given in table s1 fig 4 shows the comparison of the observed discharge time series in blue line with the discharge series generated by the calibrated in red line vic rapid model for the calibration and validation periods further to assess the improvement in the streamflow estimation using the calibrated model over the pre calibrated model using default model parameter values the pre calibrated discharge series in black is also shown in fig 4 from the pre calibrated discharge series it can be noted that low flows are heavily overestimated and high flows are under estimated if the default parameter values are used in the vic rapid model simulation this large underestimation and overestimation in the discharge simulation are reduced significantly with the sade based calibration of the model overall an excellent match is noticeable between the observed flows and simulated flows from the vic rapid model calibrated with sade to quantitatively evaluate the hourly streamflow simulation from the vic rapid model four performance measures viz nse r2 rsr and pbias are computed and presented in table 4 the nse statistics for the calibration and validation period have increased significantly almost double for sade calibrated model over the pre calibrated model using default model parameter values in terms of r2 the model performance has increased by 22 and 27 for the calibration and validation periods respectively a similar improvement decreased can also be seen in the case of rsr statistic for the sade calibrated model the pbias statistic for the calibrated model has improved from 4 75 to 0 70 during validation but deteriorated to 7 86 from 1 29 during calibration this might be due to the fact that this study has employed nse as the objective function for the model calibration which can be sensitive towards higher flow values and sometimes may degrade the overall water balance statistics in the model mizukami et al 2019 however the model performance during the calibration and validation can be considered satisfactory in terms of pbias statistics as long as the pbias 25 moriasi et al 2015 as shown in table 4 and fig 4 the discharge is well simulated and the model performs very well considering the various performance measures during both the calibration and validation periods therefore the calibrated model can be used for further applications 4 1 3 uncertainty estimation in spite of model calibration there will be uncertainty in the deterministic streamflow simulation from the vic rapid model due to the uncertainty in the input data and model structure to analyze such uncertainty in the simulated flows from the vic rapid quantile regression analysis is performed and the corresponding results are presented in fig 5 this figure fig 5 presents the comparison of observed hourly flow blue and 95 uncertainty band light grey in the simulated flow obtained through quantile regression from 2000 to 2011 the lower and upper bounds of the uncertainty band which reflect the fluctuation in the simulated flow are obtained using 0 25 and 0 975 quantiles in the quantile regression technique it can be clearly seen from the figure that most of the time the 95 uncertainty band covers the observed flow moreover to further illustrate the accuracy of the vic rapid simulation the picp and aril indices are computed to reflect the percentage coverage of the observed flow by the 95 uncertainty band and the corresponding width of the uncertainty band the calibrated vic rapid model exhibited a picp value of 90 2 and aril value of 0 34 these results demonstrate that the vic rapid calibration performs well with reasonable predictive uncertainty ranges from the quantile regression technique 4 2 analysis of flood inundation extent the final results of the coupled vic rapid lisfp are the flood inundation map generated by the lisflood fp model with its boundary conditions derived from the vic rapid model a low flow and a high flow scenario are considered to verify the simulated flood extent over kolhapur city which is the most flood affected region in the study area the sentinel 1 sar data on 27th may 2018 low flow and 14th july 2018 high flow are used for validation of the simulated flood extent and considered as the observed or true flood inundation maps the sentinel 1 data for those two dates were acquired around 6 30 am local time consequently the corresponding discharge estimates from the vic rapid are used to force the lisflood fp model fig 6 shows the comparison between the simulated flood inundation maps and sentinel 1 flood maps for the area the blue areas in the figure indicate that both simulated flood and sentinel 1 derived observed flood maps agree areas shaded in green indicates where only the sentinel 1 shows the area as flooded whereas areas shaded in red indicates areas that can be labeled flooded only by the simulated flood inundation maps table 5 shows the computed values of pod far and csi indices for the two flood events of 2018 in the kolhapur region the simulated flood inundation map for the high flow scenario is found to have a very good agreement with the observation as it can be seen from fig 6b a high pod 0 83 and low far 0 11 score represents most flood inundated areas are simulated accurately with less under and over estimation the high csi 0 73 score also shows the skillful performance of simulated flood maps considering other flood modelling studies horritt and bates 2002 paiva et al 2013 fig 6b shows that most of the under and over estimation of the simulated flood extent occurs at the downstream end i e the northern part of the study region as compared to the upstream end of the considered reach for the low flow scenario the pod score increases from 0 83 to 0 86 as compared to the high flow scenario it means only 14 of the actual flooded areas are not predicted in the simulated flood map however the far score in the case of a low flow scenario has increased to 0 36 from 0 11 such an increase in the far is mainly due to the high overestimation of the flood extents in the low flow scenario fig 6a shows that most of the overprediction in the simulated flood inundation map occurs at the downstream end of the reach a similar kind of increased far score for low flow flood inundation map was also reported in various past studies paiva et al 2013 the probable reason for such overprediction may be the hydraulic separation that often happens at low flow in various regions across the river reach resulting in the disconnected course of a small river which cannot be handled by coarse resolution of the srtm dem overall fig 6 and various performance measures from table 5 indicate a satisfactory performance of the simulated flood maps especially for the high flow scenario even thoughit has incomplete knowledge of in situ channel geometric data 5 discussion the need for a coupled hydrologic routing hydrodynamic modelling system formed the primary motivation of this research this study successfully integrated vic rapid and lisflood fp models which are widely employed in their respective domains the novel combined framework has resulted in a single model i e vic rapid lisfp more importantly the coupled model isimplemented in a python based automated modular framework which enhances its user friendliness the model possessed the capabilities of its constituent models and thus can produce high resolution streamflow simulations along with accurate flood inundation maps the model application results in the upper krishna basin are encouraging and could exquisitely capture the flood inundation extent as confirmed by the sar imageries certainly this research acts as a notable value addition to flood modelling literature further the coupled modelling framework can use relatively coarser gridded runoff from large scale hydrological models to produce fine resolution streamflow and flood inundation maps relevant at local scales many regions of the world have little or no observed data that may be required to perform hydrological studies at the local scale large scale process based hydrological models can provide useful baseline hydrological information in such cases but there might be a doubt regarding the use of that information at a local scale especially for flooding which is mostly a local scale phenomenon flood management authorities need to provide flood predictions at specific sites or cities villages that are most vulnerable to flooding the coupled vic rapid lisfp model can achieve such a goal which can be helpful for various local and international organizations that are focusing more and more on leveraging such tools in making flood management policies under changing climate it must be noted that the hourly calibration and validation of the vic rapid model in the current study was performed with only one gauge station data at the basin outlet kurundwad this is mainly due to the availability of the hourly streamflow observation only at kurundwad station however it may be noted that the employed models are generally preferred for large scale hydrological studies and earlier studies recommended multi site validation of these models for their reliable use in large and spatially heterogenous river basins naha et al 2021 xue et al 2016 to verify the performance of the calibrated model over the different parts of the basin the available daily streamflow observations at four additional gauge stations apart from the basin outlet namely arjunwad samdoli karad and warunji were utilized the locations of these four stations are shown in fig 2 in addition to the comparison with observed streamflow the vic rapid daily streamflow simulations from the current study were also compared with the recently developed global reach level flood reanalysis grfr dataset yang et al 2021 the grfr provides reach level 3 hourly global discharge simulation 1980 2019 using vic and rapid model with meteorological forcing from mswep and era5 the comparison of daily vic rapid simulation from the current study and the streamflow data from the grfr database with the observed streamflow records at the four selected gauging stations for the two distinctive simulation periods i e 2000 2011 and 2018 are shown in fig s3 and the performance statistics are presented in table s2 the nse values of the current vic rapid simulation were generally higher than 0 5 at all four stations also a good correlation r2 greater than 0 75 was observed between the observed and the vic rapid simulated streamflow for the four gauging stations therefore the calibrated vic rapid model was able to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological processes in the basin and can be considered to deliver a satisfactory performance at other parts of the basin the grfr streamflow also showed a decent match with the daily observed streamflow at the selected stations fig s3 in spite of being a global database the nse values for the grfr database ranges between 0 11 and 0 42 at the four gauging stations again indicating a decent performance of the grfr database over the current study basin however as expected from a regional modelling application the vic rapid model from this study produced better streamflow simulation than the grfr database the nse values of the grfr database at the arjunwad samdoli karad and warunji gauging stations were 0 38 0 22 0 11 and 0 27 respectively which were improved to 0 67 0 55 0 59 and 0 54 in the case of the vic rapid streamflow simulation from this study table s2 this comparison of the current modelling results with other databases substantiates the developed model s predictive capability in addition the results of present modelling framework also indicated an enhanced performance over global modelling schemes for regional applications with regard to the use of vic rapid lisfp model a proper care should be taken while defining the separate model domains during their integration e g a modelling system with a larger hydrological domain and smaller hydrodynamic domain this helps to avoid unnecessary computational burden by running the computationally heavy hydrodynamic model only for the important i e flood prone areas instead of the whole catchment which can be a major deciding factor in real time operational applications of the vic rapid lisfp nevertheless the coupled model can be extended to large scale applications for example the lisflood fp hydrodynamic model has already been employed for large scale operational flood management studies dottori et al 2017 uhe et al 2019 o loughlin et al 2020 dottori et al 2017 have shown the combined use of lisflood hydrological model and lisflood fp hydrodynamic model for developing the european operational flood risk assessment service there are three key important aspects that makes lisflood fp suitable for its use in large scale operational system first the implementation of a novel simplified representation of shallow water equation bates et al 2010 has been crucial for the expansion of the lisflood fp in large scale studies alfieri et al 2014 sampson et al 2015 secondly the implementation of the improved shallow water algorithms with the help of parallel processing and graphical processing units gpus have resulted in significant improvement in the model simulation time shaw et al 2021 finally the inclusion of the sub grid channel representation scheme removes the limitation of representing rivers with their width smaller than the modelling grid size sampson et al 2015 when expanding the hydrodynamic domain or using the framework on an operational basis all these advances should be considered to limit the computational resources requirement of the lisflood fp simulation although results are promising in the initial demonstration of vic rapid lisfp model application in this study few limitations should be addressed in future applications of the model the current implementation of vic rapid lisfp is not considering any effect of storage structure in the simulation of streamflow or flood inundation maps the calibration of the lisflood fp model parameters i e channel roughness coefficient and channel depth is also not considered the data availability at desirable resolution posed another constraint nevertheless the model is calibrated and validated for the station where the hourly data was available thereby substantiating its future utility therefore the model is used for a flood event to produce inundation maps which are validated by sar imageries still it can be noted that the availability of more data would enrich the quality of model simulations and therefore the application of the integrated model over the data rich regions of the world is encouraged moreover it is important to acknowledge that although a newly developed flood modelling framework has been proposed this study doesn t compare it with the other modelling framework that are available for a particular area of interest such comparison between different modelling frameworks is beyond the scope of this study work regarding the performance of the proposed approach in the larger hydrodynamic domains data scarce regions and its comparison with other flood modelling frameworks will be carried out in the near future studies despite the mentioned caveats to the authors knowledge this study presents the first attempt to provide high resolution flow and flood inundation information that is locally relevant by integrated operation of vic rapid and lisflood fp model also this study presented the first effort in variance based global sensitivity analysis and sade based automatic calibration of the coupled vic rapid model the encouraging results from this study open the scope for many similar studies that can be carried out in different flood affected regions worldwide and contribute to improving their national flood management programmes 6 summary and conclusions floods are amongst the most catastrophic natural disasters causing severe damages across the world in developing countries the availability of continuous high resolution data hinders accurate flood monitoring developing a robust flood modelling system can support flood management and operational decision making which can be reinforced by coupling different types of models i e hydrologic routing and hydrodynamic vic rapid and lisflood fp are amongst the most widely applied models in their respective domains the current study presents a novel framework of coupling these models to estimate locally relevant streamflow and flood inundation extent from large scale modelling the coupled model uses gridded runoff data from running grid based vic model in the vector based rapid routing application to predict streamflow which is subsequently used by the lisflood fp model to produce high resolution flood inundation information at a local scale to make the coupling hassle free and automatic vic rapid lisfp is run through a single python programme the efficiency of the integrated modelling system is demonstrated over the upper krishna river basin which is a frequently flooded region located in india the model was calibrated and validated using sade algorithm and the global sensitivity analysis is performed using sobol s method the key conclusions drawn from the present study are as follows 1 this is the first study to present a framework for coupling widely used and open sourced hydrologic vic routing rapid and hydrodynamic lisflood fp models to develop a comprehensive flood modelling system vic rapid lisfp this system is designed to provide accurate streamflow prediction at finer temporal resolution and flood inundation maps 2 the coupled model i e vic rapid lisfp is a single model which is run through a python based modular framework this controls all the stages of the constituent models executions and their interconnections at a single place resulting in an integrated modelling system 3 the model is applied in the upper krishna river basin to demonstrate its efficacy where it produced reliable hourly streamflow simulations as evident from the performance measures a notable 20 70 improvement in streamflow simulations is observed after incorporating sade based calibration approach the flood inundation maps generated by the model reliably captured more than 80 of the sar derived flood inundation extent during both low and high flow events 4 sobol s global sensitivity analysis helped in selecting the influential parameters in the coupled modelling framework which were important for subsequent model calibration it also revealed the dominance of the parameter interactions of the total variation in the simulated flows 5 results from the present study supported the fact that the coupled vic rapid lisfp modelling framework can be applied to any given geographical and meteorological condition and is suitable to predict high resolution flood flows and flood inundation maps also the current modelling framework can be extended to other regions of the

3303,controlling the damaging effects of fluvial flood events has been a major challenge for mankind integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic models are often employed to estimate the flow and vital flood inundation information for mitigating such damages the most important criterion for their implementation is that they should offer large scale applicability with a finer resolution to have local relevance and practicability this study presented an integrated modeling framework vic rapid lisfp that couples a hydrological model vic a river routing model rapid and a hydrodynamic model lisflood fp for fast generation of high resolution flow and flood inundation extent the utility of the model is tested and demonstrated for a case study in the upper krishna river basin in india the results showed that the simulated hourly streamflows from the calibrated model match reasonably well with the observations in terms of various efficiency measures also the generated flood inundation maps from the model can reliably capture more than 80 of the satellite derived flood inundation extent during both the low and high flow events the proposed modeling framework is based on readily available open source hydrographic data and minimum meteorological information so it has global applicability for supporting a flood management system with local relevance especially for the data scarce regions keywords vic rapid lisfp flood inundation integrated hydrologic hydrodynamic model streamflow estimation upper krishna basin 1 introduction floods are one of the most catastrophic natural disasters causing hugely negative socioeconomic impacts and taking thousands of human lives every year all around the globe grimaldi et al 2019 with the increased climatic extremes population growth and rapid urbanization it is expected that flood damages might increase manifold in the future to mitigate such flood damages and build flood resilience accurate prediction of flood hydrograph and flood inundation extent is crucial follum et al 2017 unfortunately many regions of the world especially the developing nations like india mostly lack sufficient in situ hydrological data type and resolution which poses a great challenge in flood modelling and developing subsequent mitigation measures the current advancement in remotely sensed observations and readily available open access high resolution global hydrological and hydrographical datasets can circumvent the data availability constraints especially for hydrological modelling applications wu et al 2014 nandi and reddy 2018 wu et al 2018 lin et al 2019 hydrological modelling has shown great promise in the field of water resources especially for supporting flood management and operational decision making physically based hydrological models have been widely used for simulation prediction of streamflows and for establishing a direct relationship between the observable land characteristics soil property land cover information etc and the model parameters the grid based variable infiltration capacity vic is one of the most widely used hydrological models worldwide schumann et al 2013 tavakoly et al 2017 nandi and reddy 2020a this model can simulate land atmospheric fluxes and water and energy balances on the land for each grid independently it can simulate hydrological components at sub daily or hourly timescales the vic model is input output intensive but not memory intensive and its source code is freely available which has encouraged its wider use the ability to account for the sub grid variability is the standout feature of the vic model which is advantageous over most of the well known models therefore this model is suitable for large scale flood modelling which has also been recommended in several prior studies wu et al 2014 wu et al 2018 chawla and mujumdar 2020 nevertheless the vic model doesn t contain any process for routing the generated runoff from model grid cells to a downstream point or basin outlet to handle this usually a source to sink routing scheme based on the unit hydrograph method is used to transfer the flow through the river network composed of uniform grid cells however there exist few drawbacks using grid based routing applications with vic such as 1 high computational requirements for large scale application at a finer resolution 2 difficulty to convert gridded runoff volume to estimate discharge hydrograph at a specific location and 3 accurate representation of hydrological features e g reservoirs vector based river routing with large scale hydrological models has received great interest in recent studies as it facilitates large scale high resolution hydrological prediction and eliminates the mentioned caveats of grid based routing applications yamazaki et al 2013 tavakoly et al 2017 in a global river modelling study yamazaki et al 2013 used cama flood global river model and compared the model s performance for daily river flow simulation using vector based and grid based river network maps derived from the same global flow direction maps this study found a 60 increase in simulation speed for the vector based routing as compared to the grid based river network approach and recommended the use of a grid based river network in large scale river flow simulation the routing application for parallel computation of discharge rapid is one such vector based river routing application supported by its easy configuration across the globe with the availability of a global scale hydrography dataset such as hydrosheds david et al 2011 tavakoly et al 2017 demonstrated the coupled application of vic and rapid models for river flow modelling over the mississippi river basin they highlighted the benefits of such integrated vector based river routing over the grid based hydrological model for large scale high resolution river flow modelling vic or other grid based large scale hydrological models are typically operated at a relatively coarser resolution for fully distributed hydrological models such as hydrology laboratory research distributed hydrological model triangular irregular network based real time integrated basin simulator etc at least for streamflow simulation and provide less practical value for flood prediction at the local scale therefore there is a need to develop an integrated system that can intake and allocate the gridded runoff from a relatively coarser resolution hydrological model to a vector based river network and subsequently route the flows in the river network for high resolution discharge and flood prediction accurate prediction of streamflow using a coupled hydrological and river routing model may constitute only one crucial element for a robust flood modelling system still reliable estimation of flood inundation extent makes that system complete schumann et al 2013 grimaldi et al 2019 hydrodynamic models have generally used and preferred for simulation of the overbank i e floodplain flow conditions which can fulfill this gap lerat et al 2012 a variety of hydrodynamic models 1d or 2d can be employed to achieve this target while the 1d hydrodynamic models are sufficient for flood dynamics in the river channel 2d hydrodynamic models are essential for the accurate prediction of flood inundation in the floodplain neal et al 2012 dottori et al 2017 the two most popular hydrodynamic models that have been used for 2d hydrodynamic modelling are hec ras and lisflood fp shustikova et al 2019 however the applicability of hec ras model for the large spatial domain is limited due to its higher computational demand follum et al 2017 also although hec ras is a free tool it is not open sourced i e its source codes are not publicly available and it is a gui based program this may be suitable for standalone execution but difficult to incorporate in pipelines of different model execution in an integrated manner on the other hand lisflood fp being open sourced its input and output are easily controllable further the representation of floodplain topography is an important criterion for the selection of a hydrodynamic model lisflood fp considers a sub grid modelling scheme which allows the model to represent channels smaller than the digital elevation model dem resolution neal et al 2012 such sub grid schemes for channel representation are beneficial for areas where high resolution dem e g lidar data is not available another important criterion in hydrodynamic modelling is the precise definition of boundary conditions domeneghetti et al 2013 hydrodynamic models are generally forced with available stage or discharge data which can be problematic in ungauged river catchments or at a specific location in a gauged catchment where a gauging station is not installed rajib et al 2020 in both cases an effective solution is to integrate a hydrologic model to produce the discharge data that can be used as an upstream boundary condition to drive the hydrodynamic model several studies have presented the integrated operation of a hydrologic and hydrodynamic model for flood monitoring specifically at the catchment scale for example pappenberger et al 2005 used lisflood hydrological model to predict the discharge hydrograph which was further fed into the lisflood fp hydrodynamic model to predict the spatial inundation extent for the meuse catchment in belgium komi et al 2017 demonstrated the ability of the coupled modelling to identify flood affected areas in an ungauged catchment of the oti river basin in west africa in the last few years a great amount of effort has ledto developing continental to global scale coupled flood models dottori et al 2017 hoch et al 2017 these models often produce large scale predictions of flood flows and inundation maps i e at km scale which are extremely helpful in certain applications e g socioeconomic eco hydrologic climate change etc however these studies lack the local relevance i e the spatial resolution of topographic data in modelling required for geo specific flood assessment as floods are mostly local scale events and controlled by the local hydrometeorological conditions bacopoulos et al 2017 the integrated modelling approach presented by rajib et al 2020 in the ohio river basin united states was found to be effective regarding the local relevance in large scale coupled flood modelling however they considered daily meteorological forcing for preparation of the flood inundation extent which was too coarse to produce actionable short range forecast information in case of flooding since the difference between average discharge for a day and the equivalent amount of water passing in a few hours might cause a drastic difference another possible way to maintain local relevance in large scale coupled modelling studies was presented by hoch et al 2017 where the study coupled coarse resolution pcr globwb hydrological model with fine resolution lisflood fp and delft3d hydrodynamic models only at a fraction of the study area which can be selected based on the complexity of the terrain or socioeconomic importance of flooding overall the coupling frameworks have shown great promise to handle the critical issues of flood modelling there have been studies on coupling a hydrologic model with a routing model or a hydrologic model with a hydrodynamic model however to the best of authors awareness there is hardly any studies that have integrated all the three types of models i e hydrologic routing and hydrodynamic to frame a comprehensive flood modelling system though model integration is useful and have been successfully applied in previous studies it has to be noted that the reliability of such coupled models depends on many factors such as the selection of the model structure model parametrization study area or use of different input data haghnegahdar et al 2017 in such a scenario it would be advantageous to understand the importance of various model parameters estimate the unknown model parameters and quantify the impacts of the model s uncertainty on the model outputs another important concern that may arise when coupling two or more models together is the inconvenience and potential error during the transfer of input output between the individual models wei et al 2019 in this regard automating the model coupling would result in making a single modelling unit with capabilities of the constituent models which would greatly help their quick implementation in various flood modelling applications therefore this study aims to develop a novel framework by integrating hydrologic routing and hydrodynamic models into a single flood modelling system the upper krishna river basin located in southwestern india is a densely populated region with significant agricultural importance however it is frequently struck with high flood events which has caused thousands of fatalities and large destruction to agricultural activities menon and bhatt 2005 moreover the public infrastructures viz roads bridges culverts embankments were frequently damaged due to intense floods particularly in the kolhapur region of maharashtra a low lying region of the basin floods have caused severe repercussions phadnis 2016 therefore it is imperative to develop a robust flood modelling system over the basin to mitigate the pernicious impacts of the flood however no studies conducted to address the same considering the aforementioned issues this study aims to develop a robust framework by integrating different types of models to form a comprehensive flood modelling system which should be able to model the flooding conditions within the upper krishna river basin in this regard the specific objectives of this study are to 1 to develop a comprehensive flood modleing system by integrating the vic rapid and lisflood fp models and 2 perform calibration and validation of the model over the upper krishna river basin and demonstrate the utlity of the developed modelling framework for historical flooding conditions in the following sections firstly the individual model and the model coupling processes are described section 2 section 3 presents the details of the case study and the model application results of the model for a case study application are presented in section 4 section 5 contains critical discussion on the model results from the study and the scope for future improvements finally the major conclusions drawn from the study are presented in section 6 2 methodology 2 1 variable infiltration capacity vic hydrological model this study adopts the vic model a grid based macro scale hydrological model for streamflow generation liang et al 1994 while the model was originally designed to improve the horizontal representation of general circulation models gcms its various unique characteristics i e sub grid variability nonlinear baseflow estimation etc have made it one of the most commonly used hydrological model in recent time schumann et al 2013 tavakoly et al 2017 nandi and reddy 2020a there are two additional factors for the selection of the vic model in the present study firstly this model has continuously undergone substantial community driven improvements which is further expected to grow with its maximized application and testing with the wider community secondly the model can efficiently simulate the continuous hydrological responses at an hourly scale vital for flood management studies wu et al 2014 2018 vic divides the study area into several computational grids or cells as a grid based model and then a simulation of hydrological fluxes is made at each modelling grid but several vegetation classes can exist within a single grid the computation of soil moisture runoff infiltration and other relevant hydrological processes are performed for each vegetation class finally the total hydrological fluxes for a grid are obtained by summing the individual vegetation class fluxes weighted by their fractional area coverage such representation of subgrid physical processes in the vic model enables an efficient strategy to balance the model accuracy and heavy computational demand the vic model allows water to enter a grid only from the atmosphere suggesting the non channel flow transmission between grids is not considered following the continuity equation the water balance in each time step for the vic model can be expressed as 1 p r e ds dt where p r e ds dt are the precipitation mm runoff mm evapotranspiration mm and changes in water storage mm and chosen time step respectively the evapotranspiration in the model is computed using the penman monteith method the total runoff r in the model is comprised of direct runoff or surface runoff rd from the top two soil layers and the baseflow or subsurface runoff rb from the bottom most or third soil layer only direct runoff and subsurface runoff are computed in the model by using the following expressions 2 r d p w w max p i 0 i m p w w max w max 1 1 i 0 p i m 1 b inf l t p i 0 i m 3 r b d s d m w s w 3 max w 3 0 w 3 w s w 3 max d s d m w s w 3 max w 3 d m d s d m w s w 3 w s w 3 max w 3 max w s w 3 max 2 w 3 w s w 3 max where rd top two layers and rb bottom or third layer are the direct runoff mm and base flow mm p represents the precipitation mm wmax and w denote the maximum and current soil moisture mm for the upper two soil layers im and i0 are the maximum and initial infiltration rate mm w3 represents the initial soil moisture for the bottom most third soil layer w 3 max and ws are the maximum soil moisture at the bottom most third soil layer mm and its fraction unitless where nonlinear baseflow begins dm and ds represent the maximum daily base flow mm and its fraction unitless where nonlinear baseflow begins for the third soil layer and binflt is the variable infiltration curve parameter unitless 2 2 rapid river routing model the vector based rapid river routing model is used in this study to transport the runoff downstream generated by the vic model at each model grid until the river empties into a lake ocean or reaches the outlet of a basin the rapid model was developed by david et al 2011 and is freely available at https github com c h david rapid the main inputs to the model are a river network river network connectivity information specification of the muskingum parameters for the river network and lateral flow coming into the river network the three key advantages of rapid as compared to other river routing models are 1 vector based high resolution streamflow modelling 2 flexibility to adapt for raster based river networks and 3 ability to simulate in a distributed computing framework rapid uses a matrix based version of the muskingum method which is a one dimensional diffusive wave estimate of streamflow continuity equation that excludes the momentum equation for routing the flow through the river networks the storage constant k with a dimension of time and a dimensionless weighing parameter based on the relative influence of inflow outflow are the two parameters of the muskingum method the following equation can describe the finite difference form of the muskingum method in the model 3 q t δ t c 1 q u t δ t q e t δ t c 2 q u t q e t c 3 q t where 4 c 1 δ t 2 k x k 1 x δ t 2 5 c 2 δ t 2 k x k 1 x δ t 2 and 6 c 3 k 1 x δ t 2 k 1 x δ t 2 where c1 c2 and c3 are the dimensionless parameter matrix and have the property of j 1 3 c j 1 here q m3 s is the outflow in the reach qu m3 s and qe m3 s are the upstream contribution of inflow and lateral inflow for the reach respectively t is the simulation time and δ t represents the time step a suitable calibration strategy must be adopted to estimate the values of the parameters ki and xi 2 3 lisflood fp hydrodynamic model the lisflood fp is used as a low complexity two dimensional hydrodynamic model in the present study to predict the flood inundation extent bates and de roo 2000 the lisflood fp model was developed by bates and de roo 2000 which is available at http www bristol ac uk geography research hydrology models lisflood downloads the unique features of this hydrodynamic model are 1 support for raster based model structure computational mesh has the same resolution as that of the input resolution of the terrain 2 provision for high resolution simulations and 3 subgrid scale representation of river channel scheme the model uses an explicit finite difference scheme for solving the shallow water equation eq 7 by neglecting the advection contributions as follows 7 δ q δ t g h δ h z δ x g n 2 q 2 r 4 3 h 0 where q represents the flow per unit width m2s 1 t is the simulation time s h m and z m are the flow depth and bed elevation n represents manning s coefficient value m 1 3s g is the gravitational acceleration ms 2 and r is the hydraulic radius m the final unit flow for the next time step q t δ t is subsequently calculated with respect to the time step of δ t using 8 q t δ t q t g h t δ t δ h t z δ x 1 g h t δ t n 2 q t h t 7 3 where δ x is the modelling cell resolution specified by resolution of input dem and other terms are mentioned earlier for eq 7 the present implementation of the lisflood fp model uses the subgrid representation of the river channel which allows representing channel width independent of input dem resolution however consideration of the subgrid channel scheme involves three additional input data requirements bank full channel widths channel bed elevation and bank elevation 2 4 coupling vic rapid and lisflood fp the coupling of the rapid and lisflood fp model with vic is accomplished in two distinct phases and the corresponding workflow is shown in fig 1 first the rapid model is linked with the vic model which results in the vic rapid model next the vic rapid model is employed as the starting point for incorporating lisflood fp into the coupled vic rapid lisfp model the coupling between the models is based on the loose coupling concept where vic rapid and lisflood fp are executed as a stand alone model however a single python wrapper programme is developed to execute the individual model in serial and control the transfer of information across the models required for the coupling the linking and execution of the individual model in the vic rapid lisfp modelling framework is presented in fig 1 the coupled model can execute the vic rapid and lisflood fp with different spatial extent the main intention behind this is the common practice of computationally demanding hydrodynamic model applications to smaller flood prone areas within a basin instead of the entire river basin hoch et al 2017 hoch et al 2018 therefore such an option in the modelling framework provides flexibility to the modeller to focus on a smaller area of importance for hydrodynamic modelling and reduce its subsequent heavy computational burden the present study makes use of the three layer 5 1 version of vic and the latest 1 8 0 version of the rapid model for the coupled vic rapid modelling after providing the various necessary input data the vic model is executed to generate the subsurface runoff baseflow from the third soil layer and surface runoff from the top two soil layers of each model grid next the rapid routing model is called a post processor to route the grid based runoff both surface and subsurface runoff through the river channel network to the outlet of the basin using the same timestep as that of the vic however vic is a grid based model and rapid is a vector based model that requires inflow at each river reach in netcdf file format this requires two intermediate steps to transfer the vic generated runoff to be used in the rapid model the first step is to create a mapping function between vic model grids and rapid river reaches the second step is to convert the ascii formatted gridded runoff from the vic model into the reach level river inflow data in netcdf format using the mapping function created in the first step the rapidhelper and rapidinputcreate are two python programmes created to accomplish these two tasks the rapidhelper uses hydrography data i e river network to create a weight table that includes the relative contribution of the vic model grids to the individual river reach for the rapid modelling the rapidinputcreate uses the generated weight table to produce the incremental runoff volume at each time step for each reach in the netcdf format the creation of the weight table is required only once and can be reused every time when there is a need to convert the vic gridded runoff to rapid lateral inflow at every reach the other required inputs for the execution of rapid such as river connectivity river basin information muskingum k and values are created using rapidpy an open source python library available at https github com erdc rapidpy snow et al 2017 it is worth mentioning that the parameter kj value of parameter k for at a river reach j in rapidpy is computed as kini λk where λk is a multiplier that needs to be calibrated and kini is the initial value of k which depends on the river topography and wave celerity and can be estimated from the hydrosheds dataset after acquiring all the relevant input data the rapid model solves the matrix based muskingum equation to produce the streamflow at every reach the dashed line in fig 1 denotes the streamflow simulation process by the coupled vic rapid model the output hydrographs from the vic rapid model provide the upstream boundary condition for driving the lisflood fp model at any time for generating the flood inundation information the most important step for this coupling is to identify the river reaches that are encompassed by the lisflood fp model domain the other required parameters for execution of lisflood fp models are dem bankfull river width river bed elevation manning s roughness coefficient n value the default timestep used in the coupling of the vic rapid and lisflood fp is one hour however the developed coupled model can be easily executed for daily or other sub hourly time steps if required 3 application 3 1 study area and data used the study area is situated within the upper krishna river basin in the state of maharashtra india the spatial extent of the study area is 73 3 e to 73 9 e and 16 1 n to 18 1 n and the location map is shown in fig 2 the outlet of this basin falls in the kurundwad region which is shown with a red circle in fig 2 the average annual rainfall and temperature in the basin are 947 24 mm and 25 8 c respectively the study area has a size of 15 186 km2 elevation in this area varies from 170 to 968 m above mean sea level the major land cover type found in this area is cropland hourly gridded meteorological forcing data for the vic model is obtained at 12km spatial resolution from the imdaa regional reanalysis product ashrit et al 2020 to validate simulated flows hourly observed discharge data at kurundwad is collected from the upper krishna division of central water commission cwc government of india the available daily streamflow records for arjunwad samdoli karad and warunji streamflow gauging stations fig 2 are also collected from cwc the lulc and soil information for vic model is prepared using the nasa s modis mod12q1 land cover product 1 km and food and agricultural organization fao harmonized world soil database 1 km respectively the rapid model requires stream network information in vector format which is obtained from the global hydrographic database hydroriver https hydrosheds org page hydrorivers srtm 30 m resolution dem is used for setting up the lisflood fp sub grid version lisflood fp also requires bank full channel width information which is prepared using the global river widths from landsat grwl database allen pavelsky 2018 lastly for validation of flood inundation extent sar 30 m images are acquired from the sentinel 1 mission www sentinel hub com the obtained sar images are manually processed with a visual inspection of those imageries to isolate flooded cells from non flooded cells and prepare the binary flood inundation extent oberstadler et al 1997 di baldassarre et al 2009 3 2 model configuration the streamflow is simulated in all the 1802 river reaches blue lines in fig 2 across the study area by the execution of rapid using direct runoff and baseflow data from the vic model simulation of the vic model is carried out with 0 25 grid cells which are also shown with green square boxes in fig 2 the streamflow simulation is performed with an hourly time step for two distinctive time periods i e 2000 2011 and 2018 the main reason behind this is the unavailability of both observed streamflow and flood inundation data during the same time period more specifically the hourly streamflow observation is available only up to the year 2011 and sentinel 1 sar images are only available during a flooding event only after 2018 for the study area as the performance of streamflow simulation is heavily dependent on the accurate estimation of the unknown model parameters this study performed a joint automatic calibration of unknown vic and rapid model parameters using self adaptive differential evolution sade which is a population based metaheuristic search algorithm the sade has been found to be performing better for calibration of computationally intensive distributed hydrological model as compared to other popular evolutionary algorithms such as shuffled complex evolution sce genetic algorithm ga and differential evolution de algorithm nandi and reddy 2020a nandi and reddy 2020b while nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is chosen as the objective function for the calibration more details on the implementation of the sade based model calibration are given in appendix 1 sensitivity analysis is another fundamental step in hydrological modelling which is carried out for model calibration uncertainty assessment diagnostic evaluation and decision making pianosi et al 2016 devak and dhanya 2017 saltelli et al 2008 highlighted ranking and screening of model parameters as two important purposes among many others of sensitivity analysis irrespective of the purpose sensitivity analysis is broadly classified into two categories namely local sensitivity analysis and global sensitivity analysis pianosi et al 2016 the global sensitivity analysis attempts to search the entire parameter space rather than exploring the model output at some reference value as in the case of local sensitivity analysis sarrazin et al 2016 global sensitivity analysis has been successfully applied to computationally intensive hydrological models prior to their calibration to screen out unimportant parameters from the model calibration van werkhoven et al 2009 this study employed a variance based global sensitivity analysis technique namely sobol s sensitivity analysis which computes first order si and total order sensitivity sti indices tang et al 2007 herman et al 2013 to estimate the quantitative sensitivity of the considered model parameters although global sensitivity analysis techniques are computationally more demanding than local sensitivity analysis techniques they are more useful in the case of interactive model parameters which is certainly advantageous for hydrological models tang et al 2007 khare et al 2019 the various parameters and their associated ranges considered for the sensitivity analysis are presented in table 1 the vic model parameters and their related ranges are given in table 1 which are adapted from online documentation for the vic model https vic readthedocs io and earlier studies xie et al 2007 nandi and reddy 2020b the rapid parameter ranges are adapted from the suggestion of snow et al 201 7 formulation of the two mentioned sensitivity indices is provided in appendix 2 in spite of the calibration of the model parameters there will still be uncertainty in the calibrated streamflow due to various factors such as input data error selection of a particular model structure etc therefore to analyze the collective uncertainty present in streamflow from various sources a quantile regression technique is used to generate the 95 uncertainty bound of the simulated streamflow more details on the formulation of uncertainty bound using the quantile regression method can be found in appendix 3 for the simulation of the flood inundation maps the calibrated hourly discharge from the earlier step is used to drive the lisfflood fp model the lisfflood fp model is applied to the kolhapur region in the study area which is denoted by the black square box in fig 2 with the 30 m srtm dem the study area is covered by 80 808 grid cells which are simulated for flood inundation in the lisflood fp model the elevation ranges between 528 and 614 m in this domain which will have a major effect on the perceived accuracy after dem the second most important input parameter in the model is the manning s coefficient the spatially varying manning s coefficient values fig s2 are computed for the different land cover classes fig s1 by the recommendation of passeri et al 2018 the bank elevation is computed from native resolution srtm dem the bank full channel width and channel bed elevation data are prepared as a raster layer for the study domain hydrodynamic from the grwl database this raster layer contains zero width elevation value for grids outside the channel and the grids falling within channel gets the value of the river width bed elevation information from grwl database the accuracy of the grwl dataset can be inferred from allen and pavelsky 2018 to verify the flood inundation extent for both high flow events two associated remotely sensed images from sar sentinel 1 are acquired for the year 2018 fig 3 the blue polygon in these images defines the binary fluvial inundation extent neglecting those water pixels from standing or permanent water bodies e g lake pond etc the main advantage of using sar image data is that they are not affected by cloud coverage problems 3 3 statistical performance measures evaluation of hourly streamflow is performed using nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error observations standard deviation ratio rsr and percent bias pbias the formulation of these indices is shown below 9 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 10 r 2 n i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i i 1 n s i 2 n i 1 n o i 2 i 1 n o i 2 n i 1 n s i 2 i 1 n s i 2 11 rsr i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i i 1 n o i 2 12 pbias i 1 n o i s i 100 i 1 n o i where o i m3s 1 and s i m3s 1 are observed and simulated flow values for the ith time step o m3s 1 designate the mean of observed flows n represents the total number of time steps for a better agreement between simulated flow and observed flow the value of rsr and pbias should be close to zero and the value of nse and r2 should be close to one for the evaluation of uncertainty the prediction interval coverage probability picp and the average relative interval length aril indices are computed in this study nasseri et al 2014 the picp is one important measure that measures the fraction of observation enclosed in the prediction interval picp can be expressed as 13 picp 1 n i 1 n y i where n represents the number of observations and yi is one or zero depending on whether it lies within the range of upper and lower prediction interval or not a picp value of 100 represents the ideal case where all the observations are covered by the prediction interval aril is an indicator to describe the width of uncertainty bounds which can be formulated as 14 aril 1 n i 1 n u i u u i l y i where n is the total number of observations y is the observed streamflow m3s 1 i represents the time step and uu m3s 1 and ul m3s 1 are the upper and lower boundary of the uncertainty band respectively for an ideal case the value of aril is zero and increasing aril values represent increasing uncertainty for validation of flood inundation extent probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi are computed based on the contingency table table 2 as below 15 pod hit hit m i s s 16 far false hit f a l s e 17 csi hit hit m i s s f a l s e for optimal detection of flood inundation extent while the value of pod and csi should be close to one the far score should be close to zero 4 results 4 1 streamflow evaluation the vic rapid modelling is applied for streamflow or flood flow simulation in the study 4 1 1 sensitivity analysis the first order and total order sobol s sensitivity indices for all the 15 parameters of the coupled vic rapid model for flow simulation are investigated using nse as an objective function with distributed forcing at an hourly time step the results are presented in table 3 where columns 1 3 show the results for the first order sensitivity index and columns 4 6 for the total order sensitivity index the first order indices represent a parameter s only own contribution referred to as main effect towards variance in the model response while the total order sensitivity indices include the effect of a parameter s interaction with the other model parameters too considering si values the parameter d3 is noticeably the most important parameter followed by the parameters d2 λ k ex2 ws binflt and ds which can be seen from the table 3 the d3 parameter alone contributes 39 of the overall first order variance in the simulated flow its sensitivity value is more than double as compared to the second or other lowered ranked parameters as per total order sensitivity index sti values from table 3 d3 dm ws and ds are the top four sensitive parameters followed by the λ k d2 ex2 and binflt overall the top 8 parameters for the total order sensitivity index contribute 97 of the total model variance the parameters binflt d1 and ks3 also have a moderate total order sensitivity even though their sti value is significantly smaller when compared with those of the top 8 parameters it is also interesting to note that the top 8 sensitive parameters for the total order sensitivity index are also in the list of top 8 sensitive parameters considering the first order sensitivity index the first order sensitivity index of the parameter binflt is very less as compared to the parameter ds however an inverse relationship can be easily noticed in the case of total order sensitivity which signifies that the parameter binflt has stronger interaction i e interaction total order effect first order effect with the other model parameters on the streamflow simulation as compared to the parameter ds the probable reason for this is that the parameter binflt has a more direct influence on the direct runoff and parameter ds is closely related to the process of baseflow as can be seen from eq 2 3 and typically the contribution of direct runoff is higher than the baseflow on the total runoff generation from table 3 it can be observed that dm has a very low si value and a very high sti value indicating its highly interactive nature with the other model parameters the first order sensitivity index value of the parameter ks3 is zero however the total order sensitivity index value of the parameter is 0 005 which suggests all the impact of ks3 on streamflow generation is caused solely by its interactions with the other model parameters it is also interesting to note that the vic model s various baseflow related parameters have shown more sensitivity especially considering the total order sensitivity indices a possible reason for this might be the relatively high baseflow contribution to the total streamflow amount in the basin mohaideen and varija 2018 among two parameters of the rapid model one parameter λ k is found to be highly sensitive while the other x is insensitive overall among all the 15 parameters considered for the sensitivity analysis four parameters ks3 ks1 ex3 and x are found to be insensitive because of their zero sensitivity score pianosi and wagener 2015 considering both si and sti values 4 1 2 vic rapid model calibration and validation the sensitive parameters found from the global sensitivity analysis are further considered for the automatic calibration of the vic rapid model to provide a consistent streamflow estimation the sade algorithm along with the hourly observed streamflow information at the kurundwad station is used to calibrate the model automatically seven years data 2000 2006 are considered for the calibration and five years data 2007 2011 for the validation the final calibrated values of the eleven vic rapid model parameters are given in table s1 fig 4 shows the comparison of the observed discharge time series in blue line with the discharge series generated by the calibrated in red line vic rapid model for the calibration and validation periods further to assess the improvement in the streamflow estimation using the calibrated model over the pre calibrated model using default model parameter values the pre calibrated discharge series in black is also shown in fig 4 from the pre calibrated discharge series it can be noted that low flows are heavily overestimated and high flows are under estimated if the default parameter values are used in the vic rapid model simulation this large underestimation and overestimation in the discharge simulation are reduced significantly with the sade based calibration of the model overall an excellent match is noticeable between the observed flows and simulated flows from the vic rapid model calibrated with sade to quantitatively evaluate the hourly streamflow simulation from the vic rapid model four performance measures viz nse r2 rsr and pbias are computed and presented in table 4 the nse statistics for the calibration and validation period have increased significantly almost double for sade calibrated model over the pre calibrated model using default model parameter values in terms of r2 the model performance has increased by 22 and 27 for the calibration and validation periods respectively a similar improvement decreased can also be seen in the case of rsr statistic for the sade calibrated model the pbias statistic for the calibrated model has improved from 4 75 to 0 70 during validation but deteriorated to 7 86 from 1 29 during calibration this might be due to the fact that this study has employed nse as the objective function for the model calibration which can be sensitive towards higher flow values and sometimes may degrade the overall water balance statistics in the model mizukami et al 2019 however the model performance during the calibration and validation can be considered satisfactory in terms of pbias statistics as long as the pbias 25 moriasi et al 2015 as shown in table 4 and fig 4 the discharge is well simulated and the model performs very well considering the various performance measures during both the calibration and validation periods therefore the calibrated model can be used for further applications 4 1 3 uncertainty estimation in spite of model calibration there will be uncertainty in the deterministic streamflow simulation from the vic rapid model due to the uncertainty in the input data and model structure to analyze such uncertainty in the simulated flows from the vic rapid quantile regression analysis is performed and the corresponding results are presented in fig 5 this figure fig 5 presents the comparison of observed hourly flow blue and 95 uncertainty band light grey in the simulated flow obtained through quantile regression from 2000 to 2011 the lower and upper bounds of the uncertainty band which reflect the fluctuation in the simulated flow are obtained using 0 25 and 0 975 quantiles in the quantile regression technique it can be clearly seen from the figure that most of the time the 95 uncertainty band covers the observed flow moreover to further illustrate the accuracy of the vic rapid simulation the picp and aril indices are computed to reflect the percentage coverage of the observed flow by the 95 uncertainty band and the corresponding width of the uncertainty band the calibrated vic rapid model exhibited a picp value of 90 2 and aril value of 0 34 these results demonstrate that the vic rapid calibration performs well with reasonable predictive uncertainty ranges from the quantile regression technique 4 2 analysis of flood inundation extent the final results of the coupled vic rapid lisfp are the flood inundation map generated by the lisflood fp model with its boundary conditions derived from the vic rapid model a low flow and a high flow scenario are considered to verify the simulated flood extent over kolhapur city which is the most flood affected region in the study area the sentinel 1 sar data on 27th may 2018 low flow and 14th july 2018 high flow are used for validation of the simulated flood extent and considered as the observed or true flood inundation maps the sentinel 1 data for those two dates were acquired around 6 30 am local time consequently the corresponding discharge estimates from the vic rapid are used to force the lisflood fp model fig 6 shows the comparison between the simulated flood inundation maps and sentinel 1 flood maps for the area the blue areas in the figure indicate that both simulated flood and sentinel 1 derived observed flood maps agree areas shaded in green indicates where only the sentinel 1 shows the area as flooded whereas areas shaded in red indicates areas that can be labeled flooded only by the simulated flood inundation maps table 5 shows the computed values of pod far and csi indices for the two flood events of 2018 in the kolhapur region the simulated flood inundation map for the high flow scenario is found to have a very good agreement with the observation as it can be seen from fig 6b a high pod 0 83 and low far 0 11 score represents most flood inundated areas are simulated accurately with less under and over estimation the high csi 0 73 score also shows the skillful performance of simulated flood maps considering other flood modelling studies horritt and bates 2002 paiva et al 2013 fig 6b shows that most of the under and over estimation of the simulated flood extent occurs at the downstream end i e the northern part of the study region as compared to the upstream end of the considered reach for the low flow scenario the pod score increases from 0 83 to 0 86 as compared to the high flow scenario it means only 14 of the actual flooded areas are not predicted in the simulated flood map however the far score in the case of a low flow scenario has increased to 0 36 from 0 11 such an increase in the far is mainly due to the high overestimation of the flood extents in the low flow scenario fig 6a shows that most of the overprediction in the simulated flood inundation map occurs at the downstream end of the reach a similar kind of increased far score for low flow flood inundation map was also reported in various past studies paiva et al 2013 the probable reason for such overprediction may be the hydraulic separation that often happens at low flow in various regions across the river reach resulting in the disconnected course of a small river which cannot be handled by coarse resolution of the srtm dem overall fig 6 and various performance measures from table 5 indicate a satisfactory performance of the simulated flood maps especially for the high flow scenario even thoughit has incomplete knowledge of in situ channel geometric data 5 discussion the need for a coupled hydrologic routing hydrodynamic modelling system formed the primary motivation of this research this study successfully integrated vic rapid and lisflood fp models which are widely employed in their respective domains the novel combined framework has resulted in a single model i e vic rapid lisfp more importantly the coupled model isimplemented in a python based automated modular framework which enhances its user friendliness the model possessed the capabilities of its constituent models and thus can produce high resolution streamflow simulations along with accurate flood inundation maps the model application results in the upper krishna basin are encouraging and could exquisitely capture the flood inundation extent as confirmed by the sar imageries certainly this research acts as a notable value addition to flood modelling literature further the coupled modelling framework can use relatively coarser gridded runoff from large scale hydrological models to produce fine resolution streamflow and flood inundation maps relevant at local scales many regions of the world have little or no observed data that may be required to perform hydrological studies at the local scale large scale process based hydrological models can provide useful baseline hydrological information in such cases but there might be a doubt regarding the use of that information at a local scale especially for flooding which is mostly a local scale phenomenon flood management authorities need to provide flood predictions at specific sites or cities villages that are most vulnerable to flooding the coupled vic rapid lisfp model can achieve such a goal which can be helpful for various local and international organizations that are focusing more and more on leveraging such tools in making flood management policies under changing climate it must be noted that the hourly calibration and validation of the vic rapid model in the current study was performed with only one gauge station data at the basin outlet kurundwad this is mainly due to the availability of the hourly streamflow observation only at kurundwad station however it may be noted that the employed models are generally preferred for large scale hydrological studies and earlier studies recommended multi site validation of these models for their reliable use in large and spatially heterogenous river basins naha et al 2021 xue et al 2016 to verify the performance of the calibrated model over the different parts of the basin the available daily streamflow observations at four additional gauge stations apart from the basin outlet namely arjunwad samdoli karad and warunji were utilized the locations of these four stations are shown in fig 2 in addition to the comparison with observed streamflow the vic rapid daily streamflow simulations from the current study were also compared with the recently developed global reach level flood reanalysis grfr dataset yang et al 2021 the grfr provides reach level 3 hourly global discharge simulation 1980 2019 using vic and rapid model with meteorological forcing from mswep and era5 the comparison of daily vic rapid simulation from the current study and the streamflow data from the grfr database with the observed streamflow records at the four selected gauging stations for the two distinctive simulation periods i e 2000 2011 and 2018 are shown in fig s3 and the performance statistics are presented in table s2 the nse values of the current vic rapid simulation were generally higher than 0 5 at all four stations also a good correlation r2 greater than 0 75 was observed between the observed and the vic rapid simulated streamflow for the four gauging stations therefore the calibrated vic rapid model was able to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological processes in the basin and can be considered to deliver a satisfactory performance at other parts of the basin the grfr streamflow also showed a decent match with the daily observed streamflow at the selected stations fig s3 in spite of being a global database the nse values for the grfr database ranges between 0 11 and 0 42 at the four gauging stations again indicating a decent performance of the grfr database over the current study basin however as expected from a regional modelling application the vic rapid model from this study produced better streamflow simulation than the grfr database the nse values of the grfr database at the arjunwad samdoli karad and warunji gauging stations were 0 38 0 22 0 11 and 0 27 respectively which were improved to 0 67 0 55 0 59 and 0 54 in the case of the vic rapid streamflow simulation from this study table s2 this comparison of the current modelling results with other databases substantiates the developed model s predictive capability in addition the results of present modelling framework also indicated an enhanced performance over global modelling schemes for regional applications with regard to the use of vic rapid lisfp model a proper care should be taken while defining the separate model domains during their integration e g a modelling system with a larger hydrological domain and smaller hydrodynamic domain this helps to avoid unnecessary computational burden by running the computationally heavy hydrodynamic model only for the important i e flood prone areas instead of the whole catchment which can be a major deciding factor in real time operational applications of the vic rapid lisfp nevertheless the coupled model can be extended to large scale applications for example the lisflood fp hydrodynamic model has already been employed for large scale operational flood management studies dottori et al 2017 uhe et al 2019 o loughlin et al 2020 dottori et al 2017 have shown the combined use of lisflood hydrological model and lisflood fp hydrodynamic model for developing the european operational flood risk assessment service there are three key important aspects that makes lisflood fp suitable for its use in large scale operational system first the implementation of a novel simplified representation of shallow water equation bates et al 2010 has been crucial for the expansion of the lisflood fp in large scale studies alfieri et al 2014 sampson et al 2015 secondly the implementation of the improved shallow water algorithms with the help of parallel processing and graphical processing units gpus have resulted in significant improvement in the model simulation time shaw et al 2021 finally the inclusion of the sub grid channel representation scheme removes the limitation of representing rivers with their width smaller than the modelling grid size sampson et al 2015 when expanding the hydrodynamic domain or using the framework on an operational basis all these advances should be considered to limit the computational resources requirement of the lisflood fp simulation although results are promising in the initial demonstration of vic rapid lisfp model application in this study few limitations should be addressed in future applications of the model the current implementation of vic rapid lisfp is not considering any effect of storage structure in the simulation of streamflow or flood inundation maps the calibration of the lisflood fp model parameters i e channel roughness coefficient and channel depth is also not considered the data availability at desirable resolution posed another constraint nevertheless the model is calibrated and validated for the station where the hourly data was available thereby substantiating its future utility therefore the model is used for a flood event to produce inundation maps which are validated by sar imageries still it can be noted that the availability of more data would enrich the quality of model simulations and therefore the application of the integrated model over the data rich regions of the world is encouraged moreover it is important to acknowledge that although a newly developed flood modelling framework has been proposed this study doesn t compare it with the other modelling framework that are available for a particular area of interest such comparison between different modelling frameworks is beyond the scope of this study work regarding the performance of the proposed approach in the larger hydrodynamic domains data scarce regions and its comparison with other flood modelling frameworks will be carried out in the near future studies despite the mentioned caveats to the authors knowledge this study presents the first attempt to provide high resolution flow and flood inundation information that is locally relevant by integrated operation of vic rapid and lisflood fp model also this study presented the first effort in variance based global sensitivity analysis and sade based automatic calibration of the coupled vic rapid model the encouraging results from this study open the scope for many similar studies that can be carried out in different flood affected regions worldwide and contribute to improving their national flood management programmes 6 summary and conclusions floods are amongst the most catastrophic natural disasters causing severe damages across the world in developing countries the availability of continuous high resolution data hinders accurate flood monitoring developing a robust flood modelling system can support flood management and operational decision making which can be reinforced by coupling different types of models i e hydrologic routing and hydrodynamic vic rapid and lisflood fp are amongst the most widely applied models in their respective domains the current study presents a novel framework of coupling these models to estimate locally relevant streamflow and flood inundation extent from large scale modelling the coupled model uses gridded runoff data from running grid based vic model in the vector based rapid routing application to predict streamflow which is subsequently used by the lisflood fp model to produce high resolution flood inundation information at a local scale to make the coupling hassle free and automatic vic rapid lisfp is run through a single python programme the efficiency of the integrated modelling system is demonstrated over the upper krishna river basin which is a frequently flooded region located in india the model was calibrated and validated using sade algorithm and the global sensitivity analysis is performed using sobol s method the key conclusions drawn from the present study are as follows 1 this is the first study to present a framework for coupling widely used and open sourced hydrologic vic routing rapid and hydrodynamic lisflood fp models to develop a comprehensive flood modelling system vic rapid lisfp this system is designed to provide accurate streamflow prediction at finer temporal resolution and flood inundation maps 2 the coupled model i e vic rapid lisfp is a single model which is run through a python based modular framework this controls all the stages of the constituent models executions and their interconnections at a single place resulting in an integrated modelling system 3 the model is applied in the upper krishna river basin to demonstrate its efficacy where it produced reliable hourly streamflow simulations as evident from the performance measures a notable 20 70 improvement in streamflow simulations is observed after incorporating sade based calibration approach the flood inundation maps generated by the model reliably captured more than 80 of the sar derived flood inundation extent during both low and high flow events 4 sobol s global sensitivity analysis helped in selecting the influential parameters in the coupled modelling framework which were important for subsequent model calibration it also revealed the dominance of the parameter interactions of the total variation in the simulated flows 5 results from the present study supported the fact that the coupled vic rapid lisfp modelling framework can be applied to any given geographical and meteorological condition and is suitable to predict high resolution flood flows and flood inundation maps also the current modelling framework can be extended to other regions of the

3304,deep geological disposal is internationally accepted as a feasible and safe way to dispose the high level radioactive waste hlw in low permeability fractured bedrocks it is essential to understand the regimes of groundwater flow circulation and predict the characteristics of long term flow systems for site selection and safety assessment of deep geological hlw disposal by using numerical simulation technology in this study tough3 eos9 software with an improved evaporation module is used to develop a two dimensional variably saturated numerical model of a typical profile at xinchang site which is considered as a potential deep geological repository for spent hlw in china results reveal that almost 99 of the precipitation is discharged through evaporation and less than 1 infiltrates into shallow groundwater the groundwater flow pattern is closely related to topography and lithological distribution and the groundwater flow in xinchang rock mass cannot discharge to the south hexi corridor groundwater in the typical profile is divided into three types of groundwater flow system namely local intermediate and regional flow system and each has its own characteristics based on aspects of flow path cycle amount cycle path residence time and discharge position the circulation flux of these three systems accounts for 79 25 13 24 and 7 51 of the total groundwater quantity of xinchang site respectively meanwhile different depth models were constructed to validate the influence of bottom boundary depths on groundwater characteristics increasing the bottom boundary depth has limited influence on the maximum circulation depth of regional flow system but negligible impact on circulation flux this study can enhance the understanding of groundwater circulation and evolution in fractured bedrock aquifers with low permeability and provide the feasibility of geological repository for spent hlw for the view point of groundwater flow keywords high level radioactive waste hlw fractured bedrock aquifer two dimensional groundwater flow groundwater flow pattern tough3 eos9 1 introduction the operation of nuclear power industry provides large amounts of clean energy for human but produces correspondingly radioactive waste especially high level radioactive waste hlw characterized by extremely high radioactivity acute toxicity and long duration consequently its safety disposal has always been the focus of attention bodvarsson et al 2003 joyce et al 2014 pan and qian 2009 schwartz 2012 deep geological disposal is internationally accepted as a feasible way witherspoon 1996 2002 which means that the solid form of hlw is buried in a geological formation about 500 1000 m below the surface to make it permanently isolated from the human living environment cao et al 2017b rechard et al 2014 wang et al 2006 however groundwater plays a vital role in the transport of harmful radionuclides into the human environment during the final disposal of radioactive waste cao et al 2017a selroos and follin 2014 using numerical simulation technology to synthesize hydrogeological information understand the regimes of groundwater recharge flow circulation and evolution predict the characteristics of groundwater flow systems for quite a long time are essential to effectively dispose hlw which has become a significant study of site selection and evaluation of hlw disposal repository considerable studies have been conducted on numerical simulation of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in fractured rocks for hlw deep geological disposal cvetkvic et al 2004 systematically studied the nuclide transport and retention in a discrete fracture network on approximately 100 m scale at the äspö hard rock laboratory in southern sweden löfman and mészáros 2005 studied the permeability of deep rock mass 500 m underground at olkiluoto site in finland by 3d finite element simulation method werner et al 2006 used mike 11 and mike she to develop a coupled surface water and groundwater model for laxemar and forsmark pre selected areas in sweden which is to evaluate the circulation between groundwater and surface and apply the coupled model to two pre selected areas for site evaluation d agnese et al 1999 and belcher and sweetkind 2010 used modflow to conduct a comprehensive groundwater simulation and prediction in the yucca mountain dai et al 2008 dai et al 2010 dai et al 2012 used the stepwise inversion method coupled with the los alamos national laboratory site scale numerical model to estimate the flow parameters and applied this method to the identification of the sorption processes and transport parameters for uranium and neptunium transport in laboratory scale fractured rock wolfsberg et al 2017 presents an experimental and numerical investigation of colloid facilitated plutonium transport in fractured porous media to identify plutonium reactive transport processes blessent et al 2011 adopted hydrogeosphere software and tetrahedral elements to simulate the fractures and the regional groundwater flow field in olkiluoto site site selection for china s hlw deep geological repository started in 1985 after nationwide regional area screening and preliminary comparison major efforts have been focused on beishan pre selected area in gansu since 1990 comprehensive geological hydrogeological and geophysical investigations based on surface mapping and drilling of deep boreholes have been undertaken in parallel at candidate sites providing a sound basis for numerical simulation of regional groundwater dong et al 2009 applied parallel computing to large scale groundwater flow simulation and established a groundwater model with an area of nearly 105 km2 and millions of elements xiao et al 2011 developed a three dimensional numerical flow model by pmwin software and simulated the migration traces of nuclides in different scenarios and the range they reached in different times with pmpath module wang 2015 adopted numerical simulation method at different scales to implement the coupling and nesting of multi scale groundwater numerical models of regional basin site in beishan area cao et al 2017b cao et al 2020 used tough2 mp eos3 and grace methods to establish a three dimensional numerical model of saturated unsaturated groundwater flow at regional scale based on a comprehensive assessment of the site selection results obtained in the past the xinchang site in the beishan area located in gansu province of northwestern china has been selected as the final site for chinese first underground research laboratory url built in granite wang et al 2018 the majority of surrounding rocks involved in the deep geological disposal of hlw are low permeability fractured bedrocks the conceptual models describing groundwater flow and solute transport for fractured rock exist and the choice of a conceptual model for a given application depends on the scale of the problem the geological formation properties and the modeling objectives the simplest conceptual model is based on the equivalent porous media epm approach bodin et al 2003a 2003b oda 1986 odén et al 2008 snow 1969 which is a mature method suitable for regional scale and the required data and parameters are easy to obtain more complex models are based on two continua that distinguish fluid flow and solute transport in the fractures and in the rock matrix barenblatt et al 1960 bodvarsson et al 2003 schwartz 2012 zimmerman et al 1993 but there are some limitations in the practical application another approach is the discrete fracture network dfn model that allows for the explicit representation of fracture geometries joyce et al 2014 karimi et al 2006 long et al 1985 the dfn model is applied for solving the groundwater flow problems that need to be finely characterized such as repository or canister scale the dfn approach is the most appropriate method for modeling fractured rock but due to the detailed data of fractures and their connectivity and the computational resources required to model dfns most studies have used the equivalent properties for continuous porous modeling clear understandings of the pattern of groundwater circulation and evolution of strategic importance the main methods to study groundwater circulation are hydro geochemistry isotope and groundwater flow numerical simulation groundwater carries chemical signatures of recharge water and interaction with minerals and sediments forming aquifers along the flow paths as well as anthropogenic activities monjerezi et al 2012 the environmental isotopes are applied to provide valuable insight into regime and movement of groundwater and determine groundwater origin recharge condition and residence time khalil et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 adopted a comprehensive approach using isotopes and hydrochemistry coupled with numerical simulation to assess the groundwater origin flow and geochemical evolution in the golmud river watershed of the qaidam basin although many studies were performed to reveal the regional groundwater regimes very little research reported the groundwater circulation pattern in fractured bedrock aquifers due to the notable difficulties to accurately describe the vertical characteristics of groundwater flow this would greatly limit the understanding of the role of groundwater circulation process in fractured aquifers therefore it is necessary to quantitatively assess the groundwater circulation process and reveal flow patterns in fractured bedrock aquifers numerical modeling with faithful consideration of low permeability of fractured bedrock aquifers and vertical characteristics of groundwater flow for site selection and safety assessment of deep geological hlw disposal is a challenging task the purpose of this study is to preliminarily construct a research method for groundwater circulation and evolution in low permeability fractured bedrock aquifers using the xinchang url site as a case study a two dimensional variably saturated groundwater flow model employed the tough3 eos9 module is built for a typical profile in xinchang the two dimensional model chen et al 2020 liang et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 can more accurately express the characteristics of groundwater in the vertical and along the main flow direction which is of great significance to intuitively and thoroughly understand the movement of groundwater from xinchang site to the discharge area with the in depth development of url s construction the key issues such as the hydraulic connection between xinchang and its downstream groundwater system the groundwater migration time from xinchang to the drainage area need to be resolved urgently we perform the two dimensional simulations to quantitatively assess the groundwater circulation process reveal groundwater flow patterns predict the groundwater migration time from xinchang to the discharge area and determine the groundwater circulation and renewal capacity at different locations and depths 2 methodology 2 1 numerical simulator the tough3 code transport of unsaturated groundwater and heat is employed in this study tough3 is a numerical simulation program developed by lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl with quite robust simulation capabilities which can simulate one two and three dimensional porous or fractured media multiphase flow multicomponent and non isothermal flow and heat transfer jung et al 2018 jung et al 2017 pruess et al 1999 the software has been widely used in geothermal exploitation nuclear waste disposal co2 geological storage saturated unsaturated zone hydrology environmental assessment and remediation and other related underground seepage engineering tough3 numerical simulator is based on the integral finite difference method which could offer the advantage of being applicable to regular or irregular discretization in one two and three dimensions the tough3 eos9 module can be used to simulate both the saturated and unsaturated flow as well as situations which both saturated and unsaturated flow exist at the same time and transform each other the equation governing variably saturated groundwater flow is as the following richards 1931 1 t ϕ s l ρ l d i v k k rl μ l ρ l p l ρ l g z where ϕ is porosity which is dimensionless s l is water

test double ring infiltration test is a simple method to determine the hydraulic characteristics of vadose zone in field investigation auteri et al 2020 khasraei et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 conducting the double ring infiltration tests for representative sites with different lithology and geomorphic units is the primary content to obtain the hydraulic conductivity of vadose zone in hydrogeological investigation the double ring infiltration test equipment consists of two iron rings fig 1 the inner ring from which the infiltration measurement is taken is 25 cm in diameter and the outer one which is used to form the buffer pond to minimize the lateral diffusion of water is 50 cm in diameter both rings are usually 25 cm deep and be buried about 10 cm deep in the soil during the test inject water into the inner and outer rings simultaneously and keep the water column head of the inner and outer equal and 10 cm higher than the bottom of the test pit when the amount of water infiltrated is stable the corresponding hydraulic conductivity can be obtained by using the following formula ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2007 3 k 16 67 q z f h z 0 5 h a where k is

inner ring cm2 h is the test head cm and h a is the rising height of capillary water in the test soil layer cm 2 3 double packer test system double packer test is a mature drilling technique for acquiring rock permeability and collecting original groundwater samples in hydrogeological test the technology has been widely used in engineering geology water resources evaluation mineral exploration pollution control and investigation of geological disposal sites for high level radioactive waste beauheim et al 2014 braester and thunvik 1984 cheng and renner 2021 price et al 1982 the heavy duty double packer hydraulic test equipment was imported into beijing research institute of uranium geology to establish an in situ hydraulic measurement suitable for low permeability field investigation ji et al 2020 ji et al 2016 the heavy duty double packer test system can be divided into two parts surface and downhole equipment these two parties are integrated in real time through cables drill rods and pressure tolerant nylon tubing with other pressure transmission pipes the test equipment consists of the borehole instrumentation packer and test tubing probe shut in valve and measuring cable the flow and pressure control units and the data acquisition system fig 2 the implementation of the double packer hydrogeological test usually involves several steps 1 test design in which the length and isolation points of test section are determined based on the borehole drilling records core photos and borehole acoustic televiewing 2 install the downhole equipment to desired depth 3 packer inflation to isolate test section and wait for the pressure balance within test section 4 conduct test by the appropriate method 5 relieve pressure from packer and conclude the test 3 two dimensional groundwater flow numerical simulation 3 1 site characterization the xinchang site is located in the southwest of the beishan pre selected area gansu province at a distance of about 20 km from huahai town and surrounded by the hexi corridor to the south the ditch of shazaoyuan to the east with an area of approximately 3973 9 km2 fig 3 the overall terrain is high in the west and north low in the east and south with elevation ranging between 1194 m and 1836 m above the sea level mainly characterized by gobi and small flat hills depressions and valleys are distributed among them forming an undulating topography the major lithology is composed of low permeable metamorphic rocks granite and sedimentary rocks some areas are covered with a bit of quaternary sediments and clay interlayers more specifically the url site is located within the xinchang granite intrusion a 22 km long and 7 km wide rock block with higher integrity and lower fracture density the main rock types include gneissic biotite monzonitic granite and biotite granodiorite with an age of around 260 million years chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 pores and fractures are the main water bearing media in the region which mainly include three types of groundwater namely fracture water in the mountain bedrock pore fracture water in the valley and depression and pore fracture water in the basin systematical in situ borehole logging and tests were conducted investigations have shown that there are mainly east west trending extension or extension slip faults with well consolidated breccia and fractures are mostly filled by fault gouges or dikes the beishan area is a typical inland arid region with little rainfall and large evaporation the average annual rainfall is 65 4 mm and mainly concentrated in june to august with rainstorm in the majority the mean temperature is about 7 2 and the mean annual potential evaporation is about 2789 3 mm no major river in the study area only dry ditches formed by seasonal flood flow the groundwater level contours of xinchang site fig 3 are drawn based on the boreholes laid out in mountainous area mountain piedmont section and unpumped civilian wells in huahai basin area the groundwater level decreases gradually from the xinchang north watershed to the northern boundary and the xinchang north watershed to hexi corridor and the xinchang rock mass is the highest groundwater level among the region groundwater mainly flows from mountainous area to piedmont and finally discharges to huahai basin the cross section is nearly n s trending parallel to the main direction of groundwater flow with a total length of about 56 km focus on groundwater flowing southward to human living area hexi corridor while flowing northward is far away from the discharge area and sparsely populated from the north to the south the profile passes through f13 fault north watershed of xinchang and f11 fault which is used to explain the hydraulic connection between xinchang url site and its downstream groundwater system this study consists of the comprehensive preparatory work a preliminary understand the hydrogeological characteristics of xinchang site through field investigations b perform a total of 24 double ring infiltration tests near the xinchang granite rock mass and f11 fault which are located in the gullies quaternary strata weathering fracture zone and other suitable places for excavation c measure 100 sets of fractures which are mainly to measure and investigate the surface outcrops of fractures developed in the range of xinchang rock mass d collect and analyze the data of surface geological map borehole televiewer double packer hydraulic tests and so on in the xinchang site wang 2019 zhao et al 2015 e develop a 3d geological model of xinchang site by using gridworld software tong 2020 the groundwater flows in the fractures and faults in the fractured rock but compared with the model scale the distribution density and width of these fractures are very small thus the fracture medium can be approximated equivalent as porous medium and the epm approach is applied to simulate the groundwater flow in xinchang site the fractured medium was defined as two hydrogeological units the large fault tectonic unit and the rock mass between the large fault tectonic unit the large fault tectonic units were characterized as homogeneous and independent continuum and the rock mass units are generalized as continuum under the current conditions the study area is under a state of dynamic equilibrium for many years without any human activity interference and the recharge and discharge maintain in balanced in addition due to the arid climate in the simulation area and the intense evaporation makes the superficial aquifer change back and forth between saturated and unsaturated states thus a two dimensional steady groundwater model of variably saturated is developed 3 2 elevation and model discretization in this study the elevation data comes from 30 m resolution digital elevation data of gdemdem and the hydrological analysis module of arcgis10 2 platform is used to extract the water system and divide the watershed in the study area so as to determine the range and location of watershed combined with the actual hydrogeological conditions the scope of the groundwater flow model in xinchang site is finally determined this typical profile was discretized into 45220 grid blocks with a total of 90298 connections which were divided into 323 grid blocks horizontally and 140 layers vertically the bottom boundary is horizontal and the minimum simulation depth is 650 m an irregular discretization was conducted horizontally and vertically to finely describe the fault occurrence and capture the variation of water table near the ground surface and also implement an efficient simulation the encrypted processing was performed at the shallow 50 m of the model and faults position 3 3 zonation of hydrogeological parameters comprehensive permeability of 3 shallow boreholes and 15 deep boreholes using the double packer hydraulic tests and 115 sets of double ring infiltration test provided by beijing research institute of uranium geology were referred average permeability data of each test section of 18 double packer hydrogeological test boreholes were taken to capture the variation of hydraulic conductivity of each layer with depth in the key area guo et al 2014 wang et al 2018 based on all the test results the variation of permeability with depth to the surface in the simulated area was obtained as shown in fig 4 with the increase of borehole depth the comprehensive permeability of fractured rock gradually decreases in a negative exponential law and the average permeability with the depth to the surface range from 10 11 10 20 m2 taking bs32 borehole as an example fig 5 layer 1 60 is the quaternary and weathered fracture zone with a thickness of 50 m and the distribution of permeability is 10 12 10 15 m2 the layer 61 140 is the structural fracture zone with a thickness of more than 600 m further refinement in accordance with the different degree of fracture development the distribution of permeability is 10 14 10 16 m2 at 50 150 m 10 15 10 17 m2 at 50 250 m 10 16 10 19 m2 from 250 m to the bottom boundary according to the results of geological hydrogeological and geophysical and real time supplementary investigations the cross section is divided into 9 hydrogeological zones including f13 fault f11 fault loam sand gravel clay bearing sand gravel metamorphic rocks sandstone and mudstone xinchang granite and other granite formations fig 6 considering the high integrity of granite at xinchang url site the granites in the area are characterized separately as the decrease of permeability with depth it is further divided into 40 sub zones after model identification and verification the modified model parameters are shown in table 1 3 4 boundary and initial conditions boundaries were specified according to the hydrogeology condition the top boundary of the model is the atmospheric boundary and the bottom boundary is generalized as a zero flux boundary in the field geological investigations the northern and southern boundaries are located in gullies the lowest of local terrain and the groundwater level is stable throughout the year therefore the northern and southern lateral boundaries are defined as dirichlet boundaries which set the grid blocks at the boundary as constant pressure in the model the hydraulic head can be converted from pressure according to the equation 4 h p p 0 ρ l g where h is the hydraulic head m p is the water pressure pa p 0 is the standard atmospheric pressure pa ρ l is water density kg m3 and g is acceleration of gravity m2 s the main recharge of groundwater model is precipitation infiltration and the main discharge include evaporation and lateral outflow the model is used to present the flow pattern under equilibrium condition thus the recharge rates and hydraulic heads are given according to the annual average values the buried depth of groundwater level in mountainous area and mountain piedmont section is greatly influenced by topography boreholes located around the xinchang north watershed or the xinchang rock mass with flat terrain the buried depth of groundwater level is generally about 30 m such as bs32 and bs33 boreholes within xinchang rock mass the buried depth of boreholes located in and near gullies is generally shallow such as bsq28 and bsq36 is only about 10 m the initial pressure field is assumed to be hydrostatic equilibrium by running the model over millions of years with the condition of rainfall of 65 4 mm a the amount of precipitation replenishment into the variably saturated groundwater flow model should be precipitation minus surface runoff according to the combined with the hydrogeology and research results of surface runoff in the arid region of northwest china he et al 2019 lan et al 2012 the annual runoff coefficient in this area is estimated to be 0 27 the precipitation is input by using wate module to given a constant rainfall intensity kg s m2 in the first layer below the atmospheric boundary evaporation is calculated by the embedded evaporation module and lateral runoff is given by the constant pressure boundary 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration 1 groundwater level the regional hydrogeological investigations in the study area are not thorough enough and the borehole data is scarce as the hlw underground laboratory is located in the xinchang rock mass some boreholes are constructed within the rock mass the remaining peripheral boreholes are mainly laid according to regional geological conditions which are used to solve practical hydrogeological problems there is no long time series of observation data in the study area only the annual average hydraulic head of boreholes in xinchang site are available thus the groundwater flow model was calibrated using annual average hydraulic heads from 12 boreholes along the cross section and the trial estimation correction method is used for parameters adjustment and correction the calibration shows a good match between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads as demonstrated in fig 7 the deviations of bs60 and bsq36 are mainly caused by the heterogeneity and anisotropy of fracture bedrock the nse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and r2 coefficient of determination are respectively calculated according to the groundwater simulation results over the whole study area the nse is 0 989 and r2 is 0 997 thus the calibrated model can be used to reveal the groundwater flow pattern in xinchang key site 2 groundwater budget under the multi year average conditions the amount of precipitation infiltration to recharge groundwater flow system is the lateral outflow that is the amount of precipitation deducting evaporation in model according to the simulation results the discharge at the northern boundary of the profile is 13 06 m3 a and the discharge at the southern boundary is 2 59 m3 a indicating that the replenishment capacity of mountainous areas to the basin is very weak the amount of precipitation recharging groundwater by infiltration is 15 65 m3 a 0 28 mm a accounted for only 0 43 of the annual average rainfall li et al 2020 used the artificial tritium tracer method the chlorine mass balance method based on the vadose zone and saturated zone to test the precipitation infiltration replenishment in the study area the annual average infiltration replenishment of each test site calculated by the chlorine mass balance method based on the vadose zone is 0 05 mm a 1 57 mm a based on the chlorine mass balance method of saturated zone the average annual infiltration recharge in the whole region is 0 28 mm a less than 1 of the average annual rainfall this model takes the data as the standard of budget fitting and the model budget at present stage is shown in table 2 the deviation between measured and simulated rainfall infiltration volume is small and the proportion of each budget term basically is in line with the law of recharge and discharge in the study area conform to the accuracy requirements of the model 3 groundwater residence time the particle tracking algorithm implemented for steady state flow fields goode 1990 was used to calculate the transport time and position of the particle the partial differential equation describing conservation of mass in a steady state two dimensional groundwater flow system can be expressed as 5 y n e v y z n e v z w where v y and v z are the principal components of the average linear groundwater velocity vector m s n e is effective porosity which is dimensionless w is the volume rate of water created or consumed by internal sources and sinks per unit volume of aquifer m3 s a particle s path is computed by tracking the particle from one cell to the next until it reaches a boundary an internal sink source or satisfies another termination criterion obtaining the hydraulic heads at nodes located at the cell centers from simulation results then the intercell flow rates can be computed from darcy s law the velocity vector of groundwater particle in the y and z directions is calculated by the integral finite difference method so as to obtain the groundwater pathlines the groundwater residence time distribution diagram of the profile in the study area is drawn fig 8 by collecting the information of existing hydrogeochemical and isotope dating in the study area zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 the characteristics of groundwater circulation were analyzed and compare the calculated results with hydrogeochemical and isotopic dating data finally from the fit of groundwater simulated age and isotopic age table 3 the measured ages of three boreholes dbsw 24 dbsw 43 and dbsw 69 are younger than the simulated ages it is considered that these three groundwater samples are mixed borehole water with relatively younger ages in general the measured ages of boreholes are close to the simulated ages which indicates that the calculation results from numerical simulation have certain credibility from the fig 8 there is a certain relationship between the distribution of groundwater residence time and different draped layers and the most direct influencing parameter is the amount of precipitation infiltration precipitation infiltration reflects the renewable capacity of aquifer and is the basis for conducting research on regional groundwater circulation to better analyze the effect of precipitation recharging groundwater in xinchang area the amount of groundwater recharged by rainfall infiltration of different lithology in the study area and its proportion coefficient to average annual rainfall 65 4 mm a were calculated the surface lithology of the study area is divided into 7 hydrogeological zones in table 4 which the quaternary sediment zone includes 3 sub zones of sand gravel clay bearing sand gravel and loam it can be seen that the capacity of groundwater recharging by precipitation infiltration is ranked as quaternary sediment f13 fault sandstone and mudstone metamorphic rock other granite xinchang low permeability granite f11 fault as we all know the greater the rainfall infiltration the faster the groundwater velocity the stronger the groundwater renewal circulation ability and the younger the residence time therefore this ranking is applicable to groundwater velocity groundwater renewal circulation capacity and residence time 4 2 groundwater flow system and circulation renewal capacity theoretically in accordance with the definition of the groundwater flow system freeze and witherspoon 1966 1967 tóth 1963 combined with topography hydrogeological parameters groundwater streamline shape discharge point position and groundwater residence time fig 8 the groundwater flow system can be divided and the circulation characteristics and flux of each system are determined the groundwater in the shallow part strongly affected by terrain undulating flows from adjacent topographic highs to adjacent lows and with the shortest flow path leading to development of local flow systems the groundwater in the deep part flows from regional topographic highs to catchments in the lower reaches with maximum circulation depth and the longest path leading to development of regional flow systems the intermediate flow systems develop below the local flow systems passing through one or more local flow systems and flows toward non adjacent discharge areas based on the distribution of groundwater streamlines three types of groundwater flow systems namely local ⅰ intermediate ⅱ and regional iii occur in the typical profile fig 9 a and each flow system has its own characteristics of cycle depth circulation flux and residence time table 5 groundwater flow of the profile is driven by gravity and the development distribution and flow path of groundwater flow system are strictly controlled by topography and aquifer lithology distribution characteristics of topography and lithology at different scales control the development of groundwater flow systems at different hierarchies flow path and circulation depth since the study area is under a state of dynamic equilibrium the circulation flux of groundwater in each system equals to its recharge or discharge the local groundwater flow system ⅰ occurs in the shallow part of profile with the deepest circulation depth within 350 m of the surface and the circulation flux of this system is the largest accounting for about 79 25 of the total circulation flux groundwater has a relatively rapid velocity in this part of the system with the residence time mostly less than 1 ka and the renewal circulation capacity is strong the intermediate ⅱ flow system occurs below the local system and depth of system cycle can reach nearly 500 m the total cycle water quantity accounts for 13 24 of the total cycle groundwater amount only less than the local groundwater flow system aquifers of this system have lower renewal rates due to their decreased permeability compared to those in local system the average groundwater residence time is more than 10 ka regional groundwater flow system iii circulation depth is over 800 m with the minimum circulation flux accounting for only 7 51 of the total flux aquifers of this system have extremely poor renewal capacity with the residence time up to and greater than 20 ka groundwater mostly in detention state under the control of topography permeability distribution and faults it is difficult to develop deeper groundwater flow system in xinchang rock mass considering the million year time scale of model operation and under the condition of the impermeable f11 fault it can be seen from the distribution of groundwater streamlines that both sides of f11 fault belong to different hydrogeological units and the groundwater of xinchang url site cannot pass through the f11 fault to drain in the south since the url is located at a depth of about 560 m below the ground in the intermediate groundwater circulation system of the xinchang section particle tracking simulation is considered to be performed in the range of 500 600 m below the bs32 borehole the particles were placed at the positions of 500 m 520 m 540 m 560 m 580 m and 600 m respectively fig 9b and the traveling time and the maximum migration distance to the discharge point were calculated as shown in table 6 it takes about 290 ka for the particle located at the depth of 560 m to reach the discharge point of yuanyang ditch south of xinchang and the maximum migration distance is 8 525 m with the increase of particle depth the circulation depth increases and the migration path becomes longer thus the corresponding traveling time and the maximum migration distance also increase natural fractures can enhance the permeability of rock mass locally resulting in dominant channels and nuclides will migrate along the dominant channel to form dominant flow deng et al 2010 wang et al 2020 both the fractures and the pre existing faults are preferential flow paths for the migration of nuclides in the formation the dfn approach is able to characterize the heterogeneity of fractured rock by explicitly depicting the geometry of fractures and faults the epm is difficult to describe such heterogeneous characteristics but it is impossible to accurately describe all fractures from the deep urls to shallow aquifer due to the scarcity of fracture information such as the location orientation shape size and transmissivity of each fracture besides a regional scale dfn model with large number of fractures will require a huge amount of calculation therefore to accurately simulate flow in fractured rocks the real challenge for either epm or dfn lies on whether we can characterize the complex spatial pattern of fractures in details or not hydraulic tomography has emerged as a potentially viable method for mapping fractures in geologic media as demonstrated by recent studies illman 2014 illman et al 2009 zha et al 2015 dong et al 2019 generated fracture networks to imitate real world fractured geologic media employed the dfn model to simulate hydraulic interference tests and proposed the hydraulic tomography is able to capture the dominant fractures however he also pointed out that these fracture networks by dfn completely ignore the surrounding rock matrix and this omission of the matrix may exaggerate the discontinuity of the real world fractured rock mass and inflate the difficulties for characterizing fractured rock mass in nature the real velocity is much greater than that based on the equivalent permeability coefficient so the simulated migration time calculated by the epm model in this paper is more conservative than that of dfn the statistical characteristics and probability distribution function of fracture distribution and permeability spatial variation can be further considered in the future and the dfn or dfn epm coupling model can be selected for more detailed generalization 4 3 influence of bottom boundary depth on groundwater flow system the above is mainly aimed at the analysis of the groundwater flow pattern on the regional scale from the xinchang site to huahai basin but the recharge of the mountainous area to the basin also involves a key issue the depth of groundwater flow according to the generalization of groundwater flow system between the mountain block and basin by markovich et al 2019 the flowpaths in mountain block systems can be divided into four types based the different flow depths local intermediate regional and front slope flow with the different depth of groundwater flow there are different forms of flowpaths therefore it is necessary to analyze the vertical flow pattern of groundwater from the xinchang site to huahai basin in view of the actual geological condition at the level of 560 m url there is still a possibility that nuclides migrate with the deeper groundwater flow system and even occur that the groundwater flow in xinchang url site pass through the f11 fault and drain in the south huahai basin therefore it is necessary to carry out the prediction simulation study the influence of different bottom boundary depths on the groundwater flow system in this study by modifying the bottom boundary depth the influence of model depth on the groundwater flow system distribution and development of two dimensional profile in xinchang key site is simulated and analyzed as shown in table 7 scheme s1 is the background value and the other schemes increase the bottom boundary depth respectively increasing the depth of the bottom boundary has no significant effect on the circulation flux of groundwater flow system only slightly increases the circulation flux in regional and intermediate groundwater flow system and decreases in the local flow system the influence of bottom boundary depth on distribution and development of groundwater flow systems can be understood more clearly from fig 10 boundary depth increases no change on the overall distribution of groundwater flow system and the shape negligible impact on the particle traveling time and maximum migration distance but the maximum cycle depth of the regional groundwater system gradually increases the maximum cycle depth of the regional flow system in s2 case is over 1000 m with the minimum circulation flux accounting for only 7 67 of the total flux groundwater mostly in detention state and the capacity to renew the cycle is extremely poor in s3 case the maximum circulation depth of the regional flow system is more than 1100 m with accounting for 7 77 of the total flux and in s4 case the maximum circulation depth exceeds 1300 m accounting for only 7 92 it can be obviously inferred that increasing the bottom boundary depth which only has a certain influence on the maximum circulation depth of the regional groundwater flow system in xinchang key site but the impact on the circulation flux of groundwater flow system particle traveling time and the maximum migration distance can be ignored the groundwater flow paths are strictly controlled by topography and aquifer lithology distribution the xinchang site to huahai basin does not have the conditions for developing deeper regional groundwater flow which is mainly due to the following three aspects 1 the groundwater recharging by precipitation infiltration in xinchang section is extremely low which is insufficient to drive the development of deeper circulation ball et al 2014 caine et al 2017 believed that only when the recharge of groundwater in mountainous areas is greater than 10 mm a in fractured bedrock areas will occur the phenomenon that the groundwater in mountainous areas flows to the basin otherwise the discharge of groundwater from mountainous areas to the basin is negligible the recharge amount of groundwater in the xinchang is far lower than the threshold of 10 mm a thus the groundwater in xinchang lacks sufficient downward driving force to form deeper regional groundwater flow to the basin 2 the comprehensive permeability of fractured bedrock aquifers in the study area is very low only the weathered fracture zone with a thickness of 50 m below the surface has a slightly higher permeability and the permeability of the structural fracture zone below 50 m is generally lower than 10 15 m2 s and no widely connected fracture network is found the continuous low permeability structure is not conducive to the deeper regional flow of xinchang huahai 3 the f11 fault developed in xinchang huahai is a wide and impermeable formation in the fractured rock large fractures may play the role as the dominant seepage channels of groundwater become the route of groundwater flow to the deeper and greatly accelerate the travelling time of groundwater to the discharge point however the f11 faults has been proved in hydrogeological tests that it mainly blocks the groundwater which is not conducive to the southward discharge of xinchang groundwater across the f11 fault nor the development of deeper flow 5 conclusions in this study tough3 eos9 software with the improved evaporation module was used to develop a two dimensional variably saturated numerical model of a typical profile in xinchang this model quantitatively assesses the groundwater circulation process reveals groundwater flow patterns predicts the groundwater migration time from xinchang to the discharge area and determines the groundwater circulation and renewal capacity at different locations and depths salient conclusions from this study include three different hierarchical groundwater flow systems were identified namely local intermediate and regional flow system and each has its own characteristics based on aspects of flow path cycle amount cycle path residence time and discharge position the local groundwater flow system ⅰ occurs in the shallow part of profile accounting for about 79 25 of the total circulation flux and the renewal circulation capacity is strong the intermediate ⅱ flow system occurs below the local system with lower renewal rates accounting for 13 24 of the total flux the regional flow system iii is characterized by the deepest cycle depth the minimum cycle amount and extremely poor renewal capacity the study area is under a state of dynamic equilibrium and the profile of precipitation infiltration recharge is 15 65 m3 a 0 28 mm a accounted for only 0 43 of the annual average rainfall the groundwater flow of xinchang url site cannot discharge to the south hexi corridor owing to the existence of the wide and impermeable f11 fault the travel time of particle performed at 560 m below the bs32 borehole to reach the discharge point of yuanyang ditch in the southern xinchang is about 290 ka and the maximum migration distance is 8 525 m increasing the bottom boundary depth has a certain influence on the maximum circulation depth of regional groundwater flow system in xinchang site but negligible impact on circulation flux particle traveling time and the maximum migration distance this study can enhance the understanding of groundwater circulation and evolution in fractured bedrock aquifers with low permeability and provide the feasibility of geological repository for spent hlw for the view point of groundwater flow these results can provide a basis for further analysis of nuclides migration range and time in the pre selected area and also provide references for understanding the circulation processes in other similar places of china and elsewhere in the world however the study does not consider the radionuclide transport process thus numerical simulation of the migration and transformation behavior of radionuclides in different media including rock mass groundwater and various buffer materials should be carried out in the future so as to better predict the impact of these processes on the repository performance moreover in view of lacking fracture detail data in the study area the statistical characteristics and probability distribution function of fracture distribution and permeability spatial variation can be further considered in the future and the dfn or dfn epm coupling model can be selected for more detailed generalization credit authorship contribution statement

3304,deep geological disposal is internationally accepted as a feasible and safe way to dispose the high level radioactive waste hlw in low permeability fractured bedrocks it is essential to understand the regimes of groundwater flow circulation and predict the characteristics of long term flow systems for site selection and safety assessment of deep geological hlw disposal by using numerical simulation technology in this study tough3 eos9 software with an improved evaporation module is used to develop a two dimensional variably saturated numerical model of a typical profile at xinchang site which is considered as a potential deep geological repository for spent hlw in china results reveal that almost 99 of the precipitation is discharged through evaporation and less than 1 infiltrates into shallow groundwater the groundwater flow pattern is closely related to topography and lithological distribution and the groundwater flow in xinchang rock mass cannot discharge to the south hexi corridor groundwater in the typical profile is divided into three types of groundwater flow system namely local intermediate and regional flow system and each has its own characteristics based on aspects of flow path cycle amount cycle path residence time and discharge position the circulation flux of these three systems accounts for 79 25 13 24 and 7 51 of the total groundwater quantity of xinchang site respectively meanwhile different depth models were constructed to validate the influence of bottom boundary depths on groundwater characteristics increasing the bottom boundary depth has limited influence on the maximum circulation depth of regional flow system but negligible impact on circulation flux this study can enhance the understanding of groundwater circulation and evolution in fractured bedrock aquifers with low permeability and provide the feasibility of geological repository for spent hlw for the view point of groundwater flow keywords high level radioactive waste hlw fractured bedrock aquifer two dimensional groundwater flow groundwater flow pattern tough3 eos9 1 introduction the operation of nuclear power industry provides large amounts of clean energy for human but produces correspondingly radioactive waste especially high level radioactive waste hlw characterized by extremely high radioactivity acute toxicity and long duration consequently its safety disposal has always been the focus of attention bodvarsson et al 2003 joyce et al 2014 pan and qian 2009 schwartz 2012 deep geological disposal is internationally accepted as a feasible way witherspoon 1996 2002 which means that the solid form of hlw is buried in a geological formation about 500 1000 m below the surface to make it permanently isolated from the human living environment cao et al 2017b rechard et al 2014 wang et al 2006 however groundwater plays a vital role in the transport of harmful radionuclides into the human environment during the final disposal of radioactive waste cao et al 2017a selroos and follin 2014 using numerical simulation technology to synthesize hydrogeological information understand the regimes of groundwater recharge flow circulation and evolution predict the characteristics of groundwater flow systems for quite a long time are essential to effectively dispose hlw which has become a significant study of site selection and evaluation of hlw disposal repository considerable studies have been conducted on numerical simulation of groundwater flow and radionuclide transport in fractured rocks for hlw deep geological disposal cvetkvic et al 2004 systematically studied the nuclide transport and retention in a discrete fracture network on approximately 100 m scale at the äspö hard rock laboratory in southern sweden löfman and mészáros 2005 studied the permeability of deep rock mass 500 m underground at olkiluoto site in finland by 3d finite element simulation method werner et al 2006 used mike 11 and mike she to develop a coupled surface water and groundwater model for laxemar and forsmark pre selected areas in sweden which is to evaluate the circulation between groundwater and surface and apply the coupled model to two pre selected areas for site evaluation d agnese et al 1999 and belcher and sweetkind 2010 used modflow to conduct a comprehensive groundwater simulation and prediction in the yucca mountain dai et al 2008 dai et al 2010 dai et al 2012 used the stepwise inversion method coupled with the los alamos national laboratory site scale numerical model to estimate the flow parameters and applied this method to the identification of the sorption processes and transport parameters for uranium and neptunium transport in laboratory scale fractured rock wolfsberg et al 2017

hydrogeosphere software and tetrahedral elements to simulate the fractures and the regional groundwater flow field in olkiluoto site site selection for china s hlw deep geological repository started in 1985 after nationwide regional area screening and preliminary comparison major efforts have been focused on beishan pre selected area in gansu since 1990 comprehensive geological hydrogeological and geophysical investigations based on surface mapping and drilling of deep boreholes have been undertaken in parallel at candidate sites providing a sound basis for numerical simulation of regional groundwater dong et al 2009 applied parallel computing to large scale groundwater flow simulation and established a groundwater model with an area of nearly 105 km2 and millions of elements xiao et al

pmpath module wang 2015 adopted numerical simulation method at different scales to implement the coupling and nesting of multi scale groundwater numerical models of regional basin site in beishan area cao et al 2017b cao et al 2020 used tough2 mp eos3 and grace methods to establish a three dimensional numerical model of saturated unsaturated groundwater flow at regional scale based on a comprehensive assessment of the site selection results obtained in the past the xinchang site in the beishan area located in gansu province of northwestern china has been selected as the final site for chinese first underground research laboratory url built in granite wang et al 2018 the majority of surrounding rocks involved in the deep geological disposal of hlw are low permeability fractured bedrocks the conceptual models describing groundwater flow and solute transport for fractured rock exist and the choice of a conceptual model for a given application depends on the scale of the problem the geological formation properties and the modeling objectives the simplest conceptual model is based on the equivalent porous media epm approach bodin et al 2003a 2003b oda 1986 odén et al 2008 snow 1969 which is a mature method suitable for regional scale and the required data and parameters are easy to obtain more complex models are based on two continua that distinguish fluid flow and solute transport in the fractures and in the rock matrix barenblatt et al 1960 bodvarsson et al 2003 schwartz 2012 zimmerman et al 1993 but there are some limitations in the practical application another approach is the discrete fracture network dfn model that allows for the explicit representation of fracture geometries joyce et al 2014 karimi et al 2006 long et al 1985 the dfn model is applied for solving the groundwater flow problems that need to be finely characterized such as repository or canister scale the dfn approach is the most appropriate method for modeling fractured rock but due to the detailed data of fractures and their connectivity and the computational resources required to model dfns most studies have used the equivalent properties for continuous porous modeling clear understandings of the pattern of groundwater circulation and evolution of strategic importance the main methods to study groundwater circulation are hydro geochemistry isotope and groundwater flow numerical simulation groundwater carries chemical signatures of recharge water and interaction with minerals and sediments forming aquifers along the flow paths as well as anthropogenic activities monjerezi et al 2012 the environmental isotopes are applied to provide valuable insight into regime and movement of groundwater and determine groundwater origin recharge condition and residence time khalil et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 adopted a comprehensive approach using isotopes and hydrochemistry coupled with numerical simulation to assess the groundwater origin flow and geochemical evolution in the golmud river watershed of the qaidam basin although many studies were performed to reveal the regional groundwater regimes very little research reported the groundwater circulation pattern in fractured bedrock aquifers due to the notable difficulties to accurately describe the vertical characteristics of groundwater flow this would greatly limit the understanding of the role of groundwater circulation process in fractured aquifers therefore it is necessary to quantitatively assess the groundwater circulation process and reveal flow patterns in fractured bedrock aquifers numerical modeling with faithful consideration of low permeability of fractured bedrock aquifers and vertical characteristics of groundwater flow for site selection and safety assessment of deep geological hlw disposal is a challenging task the purpose of this study is to preliminarily construct a research method for groundwater circulation and evolution in low permeability fractured bedrock aquifers using the xinchang url site as a case study a two dimensional variably saturated groundwater flow model employed the tough3 eos9 module is built for a typical profile in xinchang the two dimensional model chen et al 2020 liang et al 2015 xiao et al 2018 can more accurately express the characteristics of groundwater in the vertical and along the main flow direction which is of great significance to intuitively and thoroughly understand the movement of groundwater from xinchang site to the discharge area with the in depth development of url s construction the key issues such as the hydraulic connection between xinchang and its downstream groundwater system the groundwater migration time from xinchang to the drainage area need to be resolved urgently we perform the two dimensional simulations to quantitatively assess the groundwater circulation process reveal groundwater flow patterns predict the groundwater migration time from xinchang to the discharge area and determine the groundwater circulation and renewal capacity at different locations and depths 2 methodology 2 1 numerical simulator the tough3 code transport of unsaturated groundwater and heat is employed in this study tough3 is a numerical simulation program developed by lawrence berkeley national laboratory lbnl with quite robust simulation capabilities which can simulate one two and three dimensional porous or fractured media multiphase flow multicomponent and non isothermal flow and heat transfer jung et al 2018 jung et al 2017 pruess et al 1999 the software has been widely used in geothermal exploitation nuclear waste disposal co2 geological storage saturated unsaturated zone hydrology environmental assessment and remediation and other related underground seepage engineering tough3 numerical simulator is based on the integral finite difference method which could offer the advantage of being applicable to regular or irregular discretization in one two and three dimensions the tough3 eos9 module can be used to simulate both the saturated and unsaturated flow as well as situations which both saturated and unsaturated flow exist at the same time and transform each other the equation governing variably saturated groundwater flow is as the following richards 1931 1 t ϕ s l ρ l d i v k k rl μ l ρ l p l ρ l g z where ϕ is porosity which is dimensionless s l is water

test double ring infiltration test is a simple method to determine the hydraulic characteristics of vadose zone in field investigation auteri et al 2020 khasraei et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 conducting the double ring infiltration tests for representative sites with different lithology and geomorphic units is the primary content to obtain the hydraulic conductivity of vadose zone in hydrogeological investigation the double ring infiltration test equipment consists of two iron rings fig 1 the inner ring from which the infiltration measurement is taken is 25 cm in diameter and the outer one which is used to form the buffer pond to minimize the lateral diffusion of water is 50 cm in diameter both rings are usually 25 cm deep and be buried about 10 cm deep in the soil during the test inject water into the inner and outer rings simultaneously and keep the water column head of the inner and outer equal and 10 cm higher than the bottom of the test pit when the amount of water infiltrated is stable the corresponding hydraulic conductivity can be obtained by using the following formula ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2007 3 k 16 67 q z f h z 0 5 h a where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the tested soil layer cm s q is the stable infiltration rate of inner ring l min z is the depth measured from the bottom of the test pit cm f is the base area of the inner ring cm2 h is the test head cm and h a is the rising height of capillary water in the test soil layer cm 2 3 double packer test system double packer test is a mature drilling technique for acquiring rock permeability and collecting original groundwater samples in hydrogeological test the technology has been widely used in engineering geology water resources evaluation mineral exploration pollution control and investigation of geological disposal sites for high level radioactive waste beauheim et al 2014 braester and thunvik 1984 cheng and renner 2021 price et al 1982 the heavy duty double packer hydraulic test equipment was imported into beijing research institute of uranium geology to establish an in situ hydraulic measurement suitable for low permeability field investigation ji et al 2020 ji et al 2016 the heavy duty double packer test system can be divided into two parts surface and downhole equipment these two parties are integrated in real time through cables drill rods and pressure tolerant nylon tubing with other pressure transmission pipes the test equipment consists of the borehole instrumentation packer and test tubing probe shut in valve and measuring cable the flow and pressure control units and the data acquisition system fig 2 the implementation of the double packer hydrogeological test usually involves several steps 1 test design in which the length and isolation points of test section are determined based on the borehole drilling records core photos and borehole acoustic televiewing 2 install the downhole equipment to desired depth 3 packer inflation to isolate test section and wait for the pressure balance within test section 4 conduct test by the appropriate method 5 relieve pressure from packer and conclude the test 3 two dimensional groundwater flow numerical simulation 3 1 site characterization the xinchang site is located in the southwest of the beishan pre selected area gansu province at a distance of about 20 km from huahai town and surrounded by the hexi corridor to the south the ditch of shazaoyuan to the east with an area of approximately 3973 9 km2 fig 3 the overall terrain is high in the west and north low in the east and south with elevation ranging between 1194 m and 1836 m above the sea level mainly characterized by gobi and small flat hills depressions and valleys are distributed among them forming an undulating topography the major lithology is composed of low permeable metamorphic rocks granite and sedimentary rocks some areas are covered with a bit of quaternary sediments and clay interlayers more specifically the url site is located within the xinchang granite intrusion a 22 km long and 7 km wide rock block with higher integrity and lower fracture density the main rock types include gneissic biotite monzonitic granite and biotite granodiorite with an age of around 260 million years chen et al 2012 zhao et al 2016 pores and fractures are the main water bearing media in the region which mainly include three types of groundwater namely fracture water in the mountain bedrock pore fracture water in the valley and depression and pore fracture water in the basin systematical in situ borehole logging and tests were conducted investigations have shown that there are mainly east west trending extension or extension slip faults with well consolidated breccia and fractures are mostly filled by fault gouges or dikes the beishan area is a typical inland arid region with little rainfall and large evaporation the average annual rainfall is 65 4 mm and mainly concentrated in june to august with rainstorm in the majority the mean temperature is about 7 2 and the mean annual potential evaporation is about 2789 3 mm no major river in the study area only dry ditches formed by seasonal flood flow the groundwater level contours of xinchang site fig 3 are drawn based on the boreholes laid out in mountainous area mountain piedmont section and unpumped civilian wells in huahai basin area the groundwater level decreases gradually from the xinchang north watershed to the northern boundary and the xinchang north watershed to hexi corridor and the xinchang rock mass is the highest groundwater level among the region groundwater mainly flows from mountainous area to piedmont and finally discharges to huahai basin the cross section is nearly n s trending parallel to the main direction of groundwater flow with a total length of about 56 km focus on groundwater flowing southward to human living area hexi corridor while flowing northward is far away from the discharge area and sparsely populated from the north to the south the profile passes through f13 fault north watershed of xinchang and f11 fault which is used to explain the hydraulic connection between xinchang url site and its downstream groundwater system this study consists of the comprehensive preparatory work a preliminary understand the hydrogeological characteristics of xinchang site through field investigations b perform a total of 24 double ring infiltration tests near the xinchang granite rock mass and f11 fault which are located in the gullies quaternary strata weathering fracture zone and other suitable places for excavation c measure 100 sets of fractures which are mainly to measure and investigate the surface outcrops of fractures developed in the range of xinchang rock mass d collect and analyze the data of surface geological map borehole televiewer double packer hydraulic tests and so on in the xinchang site wang 2019 zhao et al 2015 e develop a 3d geological model of xinchang site by using gridworld software tong 2020 the groundwater flows in the fractures and faults in the fractured rock but compared with the model scale the distribution density and width of these fractures are very small thus the fracture medium can be approximated equivalent as porous medium and the epm approach is applied to simulate the groundwater flow in xinchang site the fractured medium was defined as two hydrogeological units the large fault tectonic unit and the rock mass between the large fault tectonic unit the large fault tectonic units were characterized as homogeneous and independent continuum and the rock mass units are generalized as continuum under the current conditions the study area is under a state of dynamic equilibrium for many years without any human activity interference and the recharge and discharge maintain in balanced in addition due to the arid climate in the simulation area and the intense evaporation makes the superficial aquifer change back and forth between saturated and unsaturated states thus a two dimensional steady groundwater model of variably saturated is developed 3 2 elevation and model discretization in this study the elevation data comes from 30 m resolution digital elevation data of gdemdem and the hydrological analysis module of arcgis10 2 platform is used to extract the water system and divide the watershed in the study area so as to determine the range and location of watershed combined with the actual hydrogeological conditions the scope of the groundwater flow model in xinchang site is finally determined this typical profile was discretized into 45220 grid blocks with a total of 90298 connections which were divided into 323 grid blocks horizontally and 140 layers vertically the bottom boundary is horizontal and the minimum simulation depth is 650 m an irregular discretization was conducted horizontally and vertically to finely describe the fault occurrence and capture the variation of water table near the ground surface and also implement an efficient simulation the encrypted processing was performed at the shallow 50 m of the model and faults position 3 3 zonation of hydrogeological parameters comprehensive permeability of 3 shallow boreholes and 15 deep boreholes using the double packer hydraulic tests and 115 sets of double ring infiltration test provided by beijing research institute of uranium geology were referred average permeability data of each test section of 18 double packer hydrogeological test boreholes were taken to capture the variation of hydraulic conductivity of each layer with depth in the key area guo et al 2014 wang et al 2018 based on all the test results the variation of permeability with depth to the surface in the simulated area was obtained as shown in fig 4 with the increase of borehole depth the comprehensive permeability of fractured rock gradually decreases in a negative exponential law and the average permeability with the depth to the surface range from 10 11 10 20 m2 taking bs32 borehole as an example fig 5 layer 1 60 is the quaternary and weathered fracture zone with a thickness of 50 m and the distribution of permeability is 10 12 10 15 m2 the layer 61 140 is the structural fracture zone with a thickness of more than 600 m further refinement in accordance with the different degree of fracture development the distribution of permeability is 10 14 10 16 m2 at 50 150 m 10 15 10 17 m2 at 50 250 m 10 16 10 19 m2 from 250 m to the bottom boundary according to the results of geological hydrogeological and geophysical and real time supplementary investigations the cross section is divided into 9 hydrogeological zones including f13 fault f11 fault loam sand gravel clay bearing sand gravel metamorphic rocks sandstone and mudstone xinchang granite and other granite formations fig 6 considering the high integrity of granite at xinchang url site the granites in the area are characterized separately as the decrease of permeability with depth it is further divided into 40 sub zones after model identification and verification the modified model parameters are shown in table 1 3 4 boundary and initial conditions boundaries were specified according to the hydrogeology condition the top boundary of the model is the atmospheric boundary and the bottom boundary is generalized as a zero flux boundary in the field geological investigations the northern and southern boundaries are located in gullies the lowest of local terrain and the groundwater level is stable throughout the year therefore the northern and southern lateral boundaries are defined as dirichlet boundaries which set the grid blocks at the boundary as constant pressure in the model the hydraulic head can be converted from pressure according to the equation 4 h p p 0 ρ l g where h is the hydraulic head m p is the water pressure pa p 0 is the standard atmospheric pressure pa ρ l is water density kg m3 and g is acceleration of gravity m2 s the main recharge of groundwater model is precipitation infiltration and the main discharge include evaporation and lateral outflow the model is used to present the flow pattern under equilibrium condition thus the recharge rates and hydraulic heads are given according to the annual average values the buried depth of groundwater level in mountainous area and mountain piedmont section is greatly influenced by topography boreholes located around the xinchang north watershed or the xinchang rock mass with flat terrain the buried depth of groundwater level is generally about 30 m such as bs32 and bs33 boreholes within xinchang rock mass the buried depth of boreholes located in and near gullies is generally shallow such as bsq28 and bsq36 is only about 10 m the initial pressure field is assumed to be hydrostatic equilibrium by running the model over millions of years with the condition of rainfall of 65 4 mm a the amount of precipitation replenishment into the variably saturated groundwater flow model should be precipitation minus surface runoff according to the combined with the hydrogeology and research results of surface runoff in the arid region of northwest china he et al 2019 lan et al 2012 the annual runoff coefficient in this area is estimated to be 0 27 the precipitation is input by using wate module to given a constant rainfall intensity kg s m2 in the first layer below the atmospheric boundary evaporation is calculated by the embedded evaporation module and lateral runoff is given by the constant pressure boundary 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration 1 groundwater level the regional hydrogeological investigations in the study area are not thorough enough and the borehole data is scarce as the hlw underground laboratory is located in the xinchang rock mass some boreholes are constructed within the rock mass the remaining peripheral boreholes are mainly laid according to regional geological conditions which are used to solve practical hydrogeological problems there is no long time series of observation data in the study area only the annual average hydraulic head of boreholes in xinchang site are available thus the groundwater flow model was calibrated using annual average hydraulic heads from 12 boreholes along the cross section and the trial estimation correction method is used for parameters adjustment and correction the calibration shows a good match between the simulated and observed hydraulic heads as demonstrated in fig 7 the deviations of bs60 and bsq36 are mainly caused by the heterogeneity and anisotropy of fracture bedrock the nse nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient and r2 coefficient of determination are respectively calculated according to the groundwater simulation results over the whole study area the nse is 0 989 and r2 is 0 997 thus the calibrated model can be used to reveal the groundwater flow pattern in xinchang key site 2 groundwater budget under the multi year average conditions the amount of precipitation infiltration to recharge groundwater flow system is the lateral outflow that is the amount of precipitation deducting evaporation in model according to the simulation results the discharge at the northern boundary of the profile is 13 06 m3 a and the discharge at the southern boundary is 2 59 m3 a indicating that the replenishment capacity of mountainous areas to the basin is very weak the amount of precipitation recharging groundwater by infiltration is 15 65 m3 a 0 28 mm a accounted for only 0 43 of the annual average rainfall li et al 2020 used the artificial tritium tracer method the chlorine mass balance method based on the vadose zone and saturated zone to test the precipitation infiltration replenishment in the study area the annual average infiltration replenishment of each test site calculated by the chlorine mass balance method based on the vadose zone is 0 05 mm a 1 57 mm a based on the chlorine mass balance method of saturated zone the average annual infiltration recharge in the whole region is 0 28 mm a less than 1 of the average annual rainfall this model takes the data as the standard of budget fitting and the model budget at present stage is shown in table 2 the deviation between measured and simulated rainfall infiltration volume is small and the proportion of each budget term basically is in line with the law of recharge and discharge in the study area conform to the accuracy requirements of the model 3 groundwater residence time the particle tracking algorithm implemented for steady state flow fields goode 1990 was used to calculate the transport time and position of the particle the partial differential equation describing conservation of mass in a steady state two dimensional groundwater flow system can be expressed as 5 y n e v y z n e v z w where v y and v z are the principal components of the average linear groundwater velocity vector m s n e is effective porosity which is dimensionless w is the volume rate of water created or consumed by internal sources and sinks per unit volume of aquifer m3 s a particle s path is computed by tracking the particle from one cell to the next until it reaches a boundary an internal sink source or satisfies another termination criterion obtaining the hydraulic heads at nodes located at the cell centers from simulation results then the intercell flow rates can be computed from darcy s law the velocity vector of groundwater particle in the y and z directions is calculated by the integral finite difference method so as to obtain the groundwater pathlines the groundwater residence time distribution diagram of the profile in the study area is drawn fig 8 by collecting the information of existing hydrogeochemical and isotope dating in the study area zhou et al 2016 zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 the characteristics of groundwater circulation were analyzed and compare the calculated results with hydrogeochemical and isotopic dating data finally from the fit of groundwater simulated age and isotopic age table 3 the measured ages of three boreholes dbsw 24 dbsw 43 and dbsw 69 are younger than the simulated ages it is considered that these three groundwater samples are mixed borehole water with relatively younger ages in general the measured ages of boreholes are close to the simulated ages which indicates that the calculation results from numerical simulation have certain credibility from the fig 8 there is a certain relationship between the distribution of groundwater residence time and different draped layers and the most direct influencing parameter is the amount of precipitation infiltration precipitation infiltration reflects the renewable capacity of aquifer and is the basis for conducting research on regional groundwater circulation to better analyze the effect of precipitation recharging groundwater in xinchang area the amount of groundwater recharged by rainfall infiltration of different lithology in the study area and its proportion coefficient to average annual rainfall 65 4 mm a were calculated the surface lithology of the study area is divided into 7 hydrogeological zones in table 4 which the quaternary sediment zone includes 3 sub zones of sand gravel clay bearing sand gravel and loam it can be seen that the capacity of groundwater recharging by precipitation infiltration is ranked as quaternary sediment f13 fault sandstone and mudstone metamorphic rock other granite xinchang low permeability granite f11 fault as we all know the greater the rainfall infiltration the faster the groundwater velocity the stronger the groundwater renewal circulation ability and the younger the residence time therefore this ranking is applicable to groundwater velocity groundwater renewal circulation capacity and residence time 4 2 groundwater flow system and circulation renewal capacity theoretically in accordance with the definition of the groundwater flow system freeze and witherspoon 1966 1967 tóth 1963 combined with topography hydrogeological parameters groundwater streamline shape discharge point position and groundwater residence time fig 8 the groundwater flow system can be divided and the circulation characteristics and flux of each system are determined the groundwater in the shallow part strongly affected by terrain undulating flows from adjacent topographic highs to adjacent lows and with the shortest flow path leading to development of local flow systems the groundwater in the deep part flows from regional topographic highs to catchments in the lower reaches with maximum circulation depth and the longest path leading to development of regional flow systems the intermediate flow systems develop below the local flow systems passing through one or more local flow systems and flows toward non adjacent discharge areas based on the distribution of groundwater streamlines three types of groundwater flow systems namely local ⅰ intermediate ⅱ and regional iii occur in the typical profile fig 9 a and each flow system has its own characteristics of cycle depth circulation flux and residence time table 5 groundwater flow of the profile is driven by gravity and the development distribution and flow path of groundwater flow system are strictly controlled by topography and aquifer lithology distribution characteristics of topography and lithology at different scales control the development of groundwater flow systems at different hierarchies flow path and circulation depth since the study area is under a state of dynamic equilibrium the circulation flux of groundwater in each system equals to its recharge or discharge the local groundwater flow system ⅰ occurs in the shallow part of profile with the deepest circulation depth within 350 m of the surface and the circulation flux of this system is the largest accounting for about 79 25 of the total circulation flux groundwater has a relatively rapid velocity in this part of the system with the residence time mostly less than 1 ka and the renewal circulation capacity is strong the intermediate ⅱ flow system occurs below the local system and depth of system cycle can reach nearly 500 m the total cycle water quantity accounts for 13 24 of the total cycle groundwater amount only less than the local groundwater flow system aquifers of this system have lower renewal rates due to their decreased permeability compared to those in local system the average groundwater residence time is more than 10 ka regional groundwater flow system iii circulation depth is over 800 m with the minimum circulation flux accounting for only 7 51 of the total flux aquifers of this system have extremely poor renewal capacity with the residence time up to and greater than 20 ka groundwater mostly in detention state under the control of topography permeability distribution and faults it is difficult to develop deeper groundwater flow system in xinchang rock mass considering the million year time scale of model operation and under the condition of the impermeable f11 fault it can be seen from the distribution of groundwater streamlines that both sides of f11 fault belong to different hydrogeological units and the groundwater of xinchang url site cannot pass through the f11 fault to drain in the south since the url is located at a depth of about 560 m below the ground in the intermediate groundwater circulation system of the xinchang section particle tracking simulation is considered to be performed in the range of 500 600 m below the bs32 borehole the particles were placed at the positions of 500 m 520 m 540 m 560 m 580 m and 600 m respectively fig 9b and the traveling time and the maximum migration distance to the discharge point were calculated as shown in table 6 it takes about 290 ka for the particle located at the depth of 560 m to reach the discharge point of yuanyang ditch south of xinchang and the maximum migration distance is 8 525 m with the increase of particle depth the circulation depth increases and the migration path becomes longer thus the corresponding traveling time and the maximum migration distance also increase natural fractures can enhance the permeability of rock mass locally resulting in dominant channels and nuclides will migrate along the dominant channel to form dominant flow deng et al 2010 wang et al 2020 both the fractures and the pre existing faults are preferential flow paths for the migration of nuclides in the formation the dfn approach is able to characterize the heterogeneity of fractured rock by explicitly depicting the geometry of fractures and faults the epm is difficult to describe such heterogeneous characteristics but it is impossible to accurately describe all fractures from the deep urls to shallow aquifer due to the scarcity of fracture information such as the location orientation shape size and transmissivity of each fracture besides a regional scale dfn model with large number of fractures will require a huge amount of calculation therefore to accurately simulate flow in fractured rocks the real challenge for either epm or dfn lies on whether we can characterize the complex spatial pattern of fractures in details or not hydraulic tomography has emerged as a potentially viable method for mapping fractures in geologic media as demonstrated by recent studies illman 2014 illman et al 2009 zha et al 2015 dong et al 2019 generated fracture networks to imitate real world fractured geologic media employed the dfn model to simulate hydraulic interference tests and proposed the hydraulic tomography is able to capture the dominant fractures however he also pointed out that these fracture networks by dfn completely ignore the surrounding rock matrix and this omission of the matrix may exaggerate the discontinuity of the real world fractured rock mass and inflate the difficulties for characterizing fractured rock mass in nature the real velocity is much greater than that based on the equivalent permeability coefficient so the simulated migration time calculated by the epm model in this paper is more conservative than that of dfn the statistical characteristics and probability distribution function of fracture distribution and permeability spatial variation can be further considered in the future and the dfn or dfn epm coupling model can be selected for more detailed generalization 4 3 influence of bottom boundary depth on groundwater flow system the above is mainly aimed at the analysis of the groundwater flow pattern on the regional scale from the xinchang site to huahai basin but the recharge of the mountainous area to the basin also involves a key issue the depth of groundwater flow according to the generalization of groundwater flow system between the mountain block and basin by markovich et al 2019 the flowpaths in mountain block systems can be divided into four types based the different flow depths local intermediate regional and front slope flow with the different depth of groundwater flow there are different forms of flowpaths therefore it is necessary to analyze the vertical flow pattern of groundwater from the xinchang site to huahai basin in view of the actual geological condition at the level of 560 m url there is still a possibility that nuclides migrate with the deeper groundwater flow system and even occur that the groundwater flow in xinchang url site pass through the f11 fault and drain in the south huahai basin therefore it is necessary to carry out the prediction simulation study the influence of different bottom boundary depths on the groundwater flow system in this study by modifying the bottom boundary depth the influence of model depth on the groundwater flow system distribution and development of two dimensional profile in xinchang key site is simulated and analyzed as shown in table 7 scheme s1 is the background value and the other schemes increase the bottom boundary depth respectively increasing the depth of the bottom boundary has no significant effect on the circulation flux of groundwater flow system only slightly increases the circulation flux in regional and intermediate groundwater flow system and decreases in the local flow system the influence of bottom boundary depth on distribution and development of groundwater flow systems can be understood more clearly from fig 10 boundary depth increases no change on the overall distribution of groundwater flow system and the shape negligible impact on the particle traveling time and maximum migration distance but the maximum cycle depth of the regional groundwater system gradually increases the maximum cycle depth of the regional flow system in s2 case is over 1000 m with the minimum circulation flux accounting for only 7 67 of the total flux groundwater mostly in detention state and the capacity to renew the cycle is extremely poor in s3 case the maximum circulation depth of the regional flow system is more than 1100 m with accounting for 7 77 of the total flux and in s4 case the maximum circulation depth exceeds 1300 m accounting for only 7 92 it can be obviously inferred that increasing the bottom boundary depth which only has a certain influence on the maximum circulation depth of the regional groundwater flow system in xinchang key site but the impact on the circulation flux of groundwater flow system particle traveling time and the maximum migration distance can be ignored the groundwater flow paths are strictly controlled by topography and aquifer lithology distribution the xinchang site to huahai basin does not have the conditions for developing deeper regional groundwater flow which is mainly due to the following three aspects 1 the groundwater recharging by precipitation infiltration in xinchang section is extremely low which is insufficient to drive the development of deeper circulation ball et al 2014 caine et al 2017 believed that only when the recharge of groundwater in mountainous areas is greater than 10 mm a in fractured bedrock areas will occur the phenomenon that the groundwater in mountainous areas flows to the basin otherwise the discharge of groundwater from mountainous areas to the basin is negligible the recharge amount of groundwater in the xinchang is far lower than the threshold of 10 mm a thus the groundwater in xinchang lacks sufficient downward driving force to form deeper regional groundwater flow to the basin 2 the comprehensive permeability of fractured bedrock aquifers in the study area is very low only the weathered fracture zone with a thickness of 50 m below the surface has a slightly higher permeability and the permeability of the structural fracture zone below 50 m is generally lower than 10 15 m2 s and no widely connected fracture network is found the continuous low permeability structure is not conducive to the deeper regional flow of xinchang huahai 3 the f11 fault developed in xinchang huahai is a wide and impermeable formation in the fractured rock large fractures may play the role as the dominant seepage channels of groundwater become the route of groundwater flow to the deeper and greatly accelerate the travelling time of groundwater to the discharge point however the f11 faults has been proved in hydrogeological tests that it mainly blocks the groundwater which is not conducive to the southward discharge of xinchang groundwater across the f11 fault nor the development of deeper flow 5 conclusions in this study tough3 eos9 software with the improved evaporation module was used to develop a two dimensional variably saturated numerical model of a typical profile in xinchang this model quantitatively assesses the groundwater circulation process reveals groundwater flow patterns predicts the groundwater migration time from xinchang to the discharge area and determines the groundwater circulation and renewal capacity at different locations and depths salient conclusions from this study include three different hierarchical groundwater flow systems were identified namely local intermediate and regional flow system and each has its own characteristics based on aspects of flow path cycle amount cycle path residence time and discharge position the local groundwater flow system ⅰ occurs in the shallow part of profile accounting for about 79 25 of the total circulation flux and the renewal circulation capacity is strong the intermediate ⅱ flow system occurs below the local system with lower renewal rates accounting for 13 24 of the total flux the regional flow system iii is characterized by the deepest cycle depth the minimum cycle amount and extremely poor renewal capacity the study area is under a state of dynamic equilibrium and the profile of precipitation infiltration recharge is 15 65 m3 a 0 28 mm a accounted for only 0 43 of the annual average rainfall the groundwater flow of xinchang url site cannot discharge to the south hexi corridor owing to the existence of the wide and impermeable f11 fault the travel time of particle performed at 560 m below the bs32 borehole to reach the discharge point of yuanyang ditch in the southern xinchang is about 290 ka and the maximum migration distance is 8 525 m increasing the bottom boundary depth has a certain influence on the maximum circulation depth of regional groundwater flow system in xinchang site but negligible impact on circulation flux particle traveling time and the maximum migration distance this study can enhance the understanding of groundwater circulation and evolution in fractured bedrock aquifers with low permeability and provide the feasibility of geological repository for spent hlw for the view point of groundwater flow these results can provide a basis for further analysis of nuclides migration range and time in the pre selected area and also provide references for understanding the circulation processes in other similar places of china and elsewhere in the world however the study does not consider the radionuclide transport process thus numerical simulation of the migration and transformation behavior of radionuclides in different media including rock mass groundwater and various buffer materials should be carried out in the future so as to better predict the impact of these processes on the repository performance moreover in view of lacking fracture detail data in the study area the statistical characteristics and probability distribution function of fracture distribution and permeability spatial variation can be further considered in the future and the dfn or dfn epm coupling model can be selected for more detailed generalization credit authorship contribution statement
