bundschuh 2015 vega et al 2017 aquifers are the major storage of fresh water and it is comparatively clean because most of surface waters are contaminated by anthropogenic waste akinbile and yusoff 2011 singh et al 2012 groundwater is therefore being widely used for serving various purposes such as domestic agricultural recreational industrial and many more activities khan et al 2003 sargaonkar and deshpande 2003 sustainable use of groundwater is becoming a major concern in many countries including bangladesh dey et al 2017a groundwater quality depends on interactions between water with the aquifer solid phases sediments or rock bhattacharya et al 2002 hasan et al 2009 raju et al 2015 chemical configuration and composition of re charge water which is influenced by various natural processes and anthropogenic activities ijeh and udoinyany 2013 srivastava et al 2014 besides escherichia coli e coli and thermo tolerant fecal coliforms fc bacteria are index organisms which describe the health risks due to biological contamination of drinking water gruber et al 2014 the target 7 c goal 7 of millennium development goals 2000 had aimed to provide safe drinking water tirkey et al 2017 while ensure access to water and sanitation for all sustainable development goal no 6 is a real challenge for people of bangladesh and can be achieved by facilitating equitable access to safe and affordable water akter et al 2016 osborn et al 2015 water quality index wqi reflects the composite influence of different water quality parameters calculated value of wqi describes the suitability of water for drinking and providing overall water quality information of water sources khanna et al 2013 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 the wqi was first developed by horton in 1965 and then this technique was subsequently modified by several experts akter et al 2016 the wqi is used to investigate contamination level of drinking water and is a comprehensive guideline for water resources management and policymaking ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yadav et al 2010 yisa and jimoh 2010 on the other hand geographic information system gis a computer aided tool for sophisticated analysis and modelling of spatial data is being commonly used in developing solutions for natural resource problems samson et al 2010 gis uses spatial statistics and has been used for various purposes such as groundwater potentials quality mapping and to delineate spatial distribution of water quality parameters etc ijumulana et al 2017 gis and wqi can therefore be used to combine different water quality data available into an easily visualize and understandable format a synthesized gis wqi output will provide a way to summarize overall water quality conditions and their distribution in a groundwater system specific indicator maps of groundwater quality can facilitate rapid assessment of pollution extent according to respective concentration at various locations in a study area ijeh and udoinyang 2013 bangladesh a country located in the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta north of the bay of bengal with a approximately 144 million population heavily depends on groundwater for drinking water supply other domestic uses and irrigation bbs 2014 bhattacharjee et al 2018 aquifers in bangladesh are located at a relatively shallow depth and extends at greater depths 350 m bhattacharya et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008a 2008b ravenscroft et al 2005 most of shallow aquifers depth 150 m contain high levels of arsenic as iron fe and manganese mn ahmed et al 2004 hossain et al 2006 von brömssen et al 2007 2008 vega et al 2017 several important studies have been conducted to understand the extent of contamination in groundwater ahmed et al 2004 biswas et al 1998 harvey et al 2006 mcarthur et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 according to a national survey conducted in 2009 by unicef bbs 2011 high as concentration has been detected in groundwater system within 322 upazilas sub districts under 61 districts out of 64 districts of bangladesh hossain et al 2015 even though several initiatives such as installation of tubewells tw mostly deep tubewells dtw depth 150 m in as affected prone areas have been carried out radloff et al 2011 still people in many areas drink as contaminated water hossain 2015 groundwater system in different parts of bangladesh especially the south west coastal region has been experiencing many problems such as high level elemental concentration over drafting etc national water policy 1999 however one fifth of the total land area of bangladesh about 29 000 km2 area is considered as coastal zone which is especially characterized by influence of tidal waters salinity intrusion and cyclones storm surges etc nearly 53 productive aquifers in coastal bangladesh have been affected by saline water intrusion from bay of bengal mofdm 2005 mowr 2005 in the coastal areas of bangladesh people often experience scarcity of safe water and unavailability of safe aquifers high salinity and as concentration in groundwater system are major problems in the tidal delta plain of southwest bangladesh ayers et al 2016 shallow aquifers in the meghna river basin and coastal plains of bangladesh are extremely contaminated with as ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 high fe concentration and turbidity are also associated with the groundwater sources in the south western coastal areas and therefore quality of groundwater is being continued to be an important environmental and public health issue samson et al 2010 in coastal area of bangladesh water quality has been identified as a serious problem and few studies focused on either on as or salinity not both benneyworth et al 2016 it has become extremely difficult to identify the most suitable sites and approximate depths of safe aquifers thus it is essential to develop adequate information for successful installation of water options long term conservation policy and decision making in groundwater development and management strategies on a regional scale the overall aim of the study was to explore suitable locations and depths for safe drinking water wells installation based on wqi and geo statistical analysis the study findings will provide sufficient information to identify appropriate sites and depth of aquifers where drinking water of good quality can be found and abstracted in a sustainable manner 2 methodology 2 1 study site and population tala upazila sub district of satkhira district was selected as the study area 22 35 0 to 22 50 0 n and 89 5 0 to 89 20 0 e which was located in the south west coastal zone of bangladesh fig 1 the study area is 337 24 km2 with a total population of 0 299 million bbs 2014 2 2 selected drinking water sources for sampling a total of 632 most usable drinking water sources including deep tubewells dtw and shallow tubewells stw were selected for water sampling locations of sampling points are described in fig 1 in the study area out of 50 819 functional water sources ws 31 624 ws were being used for drinking purpose c3er 2015 specific criteria were followed to select 632 ws for sampling from 31 624 ws selection criteria were 1 mainly used for drinking water collection and serving other purposes 2 about 20 households hh depend on a particular tubewell and 3 must be operative year round jakariya et al 2007 2 3 water sampling and testing of water quality parameters water samples were collected during august 15 to september 15 2015 from tw sampling points groundwater samples were collected from final output device after purging the well for the first two minutes using a hand pump seven important water quality parameters temperature t electrical conductivity ec total iron fe arsenic as total coliform tc e coli and fecal coliform fc were tested distribution of parameters among different types of sources are described in table 1 in situ measurements for t ec fe and as were done at the sampling site soon after collecting samples from ws in order to analyze tc e coli and fc in the laboratory water samples were collected in a transparent white colored clean and sterilized 500 ml plastic bottle and immediately kept into a cooling box where temperature was below 4 c portable field test kits and standard methods were used to measure water quality parameters coliform colonies were counted in the laboratory temperature and ec were measured using a pocket pro high range conductivity tester product 9531400 hach co usa detection limit 0 50 c for t and 0 1990 µs cm for

bacteria colony were counted in 100 ml water sample for ec fe and coliform bacteria measurement some samples were diluted with distilled water because of high concentration and after the analysis obtained value was multiplied by the dilution factor 2 4 wqi calculation weighted arithmetic index method was used to calculate wqi as shown below 1 q i c i s i 100 where qi ci si are quality rating scale concentration of i th parameter and standard value of i th parameter respectively 2 relative weight w i 1 s i the overall wqi was calculated by the aggregated product of quality rating qi and unit weight wi and then divided by aggregated unit weight wi value as shown in eq 3 yisa and jimoh 2010 3 wqi σ q i w i σ w i wqi was calculated for 632 most usable water sources by considering six important drinking water quality parameters ec fe as tc e coli and fc 2 5 geo statistical analysis several geo spatial technologies of gis geo location tools of gps and water quality testing data were coupled to conduct geo statistical analysis in the gis platform for in depth understanding of water quality status in the groundwater system and to delineate the spatial variability before conducting analysis attribute dataset and geo referencing were checked and corrected topographically to ensure quality of data proper identification of water sources description and inter connectivity among different datasets rahman 2008 zhang 2006 the geochemical database comprised of groundwater quality parameters collected from stw 12 150 m and dtw 150 384 m two databases were developed processed and analyzed separately to find vertical and longitudinal distribution of tested water quality parameters experimental value based maps of each parameter were prepared using geo statistical analysis in arcgis 10 prepared maps were analyzed to interpret spatial distribution and extension of water quality value tirkey et al 2017 radial basis functions rbf a data interpolation technique in geo statistical analysis was selected considering number and distribution of water sources rbf interpolator was selected due to its exactness flexibility no assessment of prediction error and also its suitability for generating smooth surfaces in the gently varying topography following who drinking water quality standard spatial distribution maps of each water quality parameter tested ec fe as tc e coli and fc were generated using arcgis rbf same way integrated wqi and depth of water sources maps one for stw and another for dtw were created to explore most suitable aquifer locations for installing safe tw in two different depth ranges 150 m and 150 384 m of aquifers and locations of safe area including percentage of coverage were calculated 2 6 standardization using reference values the selected water quality parameters were analyzed to know the concentration level and compared with who and bangladesh standard values to know how many water sources exceeded drinking water quality standard selected tws for sampling were classified in two types one is dtw depth 150 m and another is stw depth 150 m ahmed et al 2004 according to the who guideline and bangladesh drinking water standard bdws the safety limit considered for drinking water quality parameters were 10 and 50 µg l for as 0 3 and 1 0 mg l for fe 250 and 600 µs cm for ec 25 c for temp 0 cfu 100 ml for tc 0 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 0 cfu 100 ml for fc for coliform bacteria who and bdws were the same akter et al 2016 hossain et al 2015 gruber et al 2014 singh et al 2012 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 however yisa and jimoh 2010 categorized wqi values into five types excellent 50 good 50 100 poor 101 200 very poor 201 300 and unsuitable 300 for drinking water sources 2 7 descriptive statistical analysis descriptive statistical analysis range median mean standard deviation and frequency distribution and comparison with who standard of measured values were done by using stata 12 0 arcgis 10 was used for locating sampling points geo statistical analysis calculating areas and visualization of spatial distribution based on water quality parameters and wqi 3 results 3 1 water quality status at most usable drinking water sources water temperature ranged between 25 8 and 36 6 c and the mean value of both types of ws stw and dtw were very close high variability of ec values were found in dtw with a range of 349 8715 µs cm sd 2402 34 all ws tested result exceeded the who and bdws standards for ec table 2 the tested fe concentrations were not very high in both types of ws and varied at 0 18 and 0 8 mg l for stw and dtw respectively almost all stw exceeded who standard 99 and bdws 96 but it was only 71 who and 31 bdws for dtw table 2 the lowest and the highest value of as concentration in stw and dtw were found to be 0 500 and 0 100 µg l respectively distance of the water sampling points weren t so high but the variation of tested result of as concentration in stws was found quite high sd 80 14 most of the stw exceeded the who drinking water standards 88 and bdws 62 for as and percentage of dtw exceeding the who 64 and bdws 14 were comparatively lower table 2 however who and bdws were same for tc e coli and fc in in situ observation comparatively less number of coliform bacteria were found in dtw significant proportion of stw were contaminated by coliform bacteria where range of tc e coli and fc were 0 208 sd 34 17 0 160 sd 16 59 and 0 212 sd 47 86 cfu 100 ml the variation of coliform counts among stws was found to be slightly wider compared to dtw table 2 3 2 wqi calculation at most usable drinking water sources during wqi calculation it was assumed that all the parameters had influence on value but a high index value was found mainly due to high concentration of ec fe and as the calculated wqi ranged from 0 142 stw to 7382 535 dtw are given in table 3 based on wqi values overall we found that only 28 were excellent to good while the rest 72 were poor to unsuitable sources for drinking water according to computed values of wqi distribution of stw were 3 1 excellent 5 2 good 0 poor 6 2 very poor and 295 95 unsuitable and for dtw were 85 26 excellent 85 26 good 41 13 poor 20 6 very poor and 92 28 unsuitable drinking water sources 3 3 identification of suitable aquifer depths and locations based on the wqi values and geo spatial analysis the calculated safe aquifer areas for stw and dtw in obtaining drinking water are described in table 3 who permissible limit of fe and as were found in the deep aquifers dtw of the northern part of the study area fig 3a b safe areas for fe and as were found to be respectively 27 km2 8 and 24 km2 7 in the study area table 3 however the spatial map of ec does not indicate any safe area for both shallow and deeper aquifers fig 2c 3c in case of tc e coli and fc bacteria safer areas were identified in dtw aquifer above 30 of total area in table 2 and multiple patches of safe zone were identified in the northern eastern central and south eastern parts of the study area fig 3d f however as very clearly shown in fig 4a almost all areas of shallow depth aquifer stw were found unsuitable for drinking water abstraction in dtw aquifer multiple patches of excellent and good quality groundwater zones were visible in the central line of the study area fig 4b using wqi and geo statistical analysis we found excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable sites for water point installation 13 78 km2 4 11 25 03 km2 7 48 34 46 km2 10 29 40 53 km2 12 10 and 221 07 km2 66 02 respectively for dtw table 2 in the study overall 39 km2 12 of the study area were explored as a suitable sites for installing water abstraction device such as tw where we can get excellent to good quality water in greater depth 150 384 m aquifer identified depths of most suitable aquifers where excellent to good quality water could be abstracted are shown in fig 4b 4 discussion groundwater system in the study area located in the coastal area of bangladesh mowr 2005 contains high concentration of as and salinity the non availability of suitable aquifer for obtaining drinking water has been reported by khanom and salehin 2012 in the present study we have identified 632 high dependent drinking water sources where each water source is being used by about 20 1000 households seven important water quality parameters were investigated to determine the actual water quality status using wqi of the aquifer based on two different depth classes stw 150 m and dtw 150 m and this information will be useful to delineate the most suitable locations and depth for installing safe water options tw water temperature is an important parameter for physicochemical and biological activities of the aquatic eco system gupta et al 2009 morrison et al 2001 high temperature in water significantly affects the solubility of dissolved oxygen and amplifies the taste and odor of drinking water singh et al 2012 according to present in situ measurement all the tested ws 100 exceeded standard recommended value of drinking water temperature if the exceeded temperature goes higher than the acceptable limit then it could have potential harm for human health ec is a good and standard measure of dissolved solids in water which depends on concentration of ions and nutrient status gupta et al 2009 normally ec range in groundwater is 100 2000 µs cm and a comparatively low value indicates good quality drinking water ijeh and udoinyang 2013 the entire tested drinking ws including stw and dtw contained much higher concentration of ec than the who recommended level khanom and salehin 2012 reported that salinity concentration in dtw 840 1350 ft were found to be much higher six times or more beyond standard than stw in the coastal areas enhanced chemical weathering high residence time of groundwater in the aquifer etc might be the reasons for high ec values in groundwater tirkey et al 2017 besides groundwater table recharges directly from surface waters including direct rainfall or surface stored water through infiltration mainly from seawater brackish river water and aquaculture during storm surge a huge amount of saline water is stored in surface water bodies in addition saline water based aquaculture is an emerging potential source of socioeconomic activities in this area that will also potentially contribute to groundwater recharge by salt water increasing trend of groundwater salinity has been shown from southern coastal area to northern part of the country mahmud et al 2017 salinity intrusion has adverse effects on water soils agriculture fisheries ecosystem and livelihoods in the coastal area of bangladesh habiba et al 2014 because of high salinity lifting groundwater for drinking and other purposes has become a threat to environmental health ahmed 2006 minar et al 2013 national water policy 1999 besides excess amount of fe raises aesthetic concern giving a metallic taste to drinking water gupta et al 2009 and a majority of tested drinking water sources in our study exceeded the recommended fe level the toxic effects of high fe concentration are not often well documented merrill et al 2011 if concentration exceeds 200 mg l it may lead to several health hazard such as fatigue gupta et al 2009 arsenic has a very strong affinity for fe oxyhydroxides in groundwater systems ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 van geen et al 2003 our findings indicated that almost all stw and majority of dtw according to who drinking water standard were contaminated with as ahmed et al 2004 and huq et al 2003 found that 80 of stw of meghna river basin and coastal plain were highly affected by as also van geen et al 2003 stated that more than half of the tested tw total sample 6000 didn t meet bdws 50 µg l for as concentration occurrence of high as in some greater depth aquifer system in the south western part coastal area probably due to absence of prominent impermeable layer between shallow and greater depth aquifer system mahmud et al 2017 at present as is universally environmental toxin zhu et al 2016 high as concentration might arise from natural geo chemical processes and also sometimes due to anthropogenic activities such as discharge of as containing industrial chemicals most of these anthropogenic activities contaminate shallow water systems while geo chemical processes are responsible for contamination of greater depth aquifer systems in bangladesh aquifers are contaminated with naturally occurring high as concentration ahmed et al 2004 hossain et al 2014 especially lower portions of ganges brahmaputra river system mostly coastal area are moderate to severely contaminated with as that could be a potential health hazard to a very high population rahman et al 2008 in south asia lack of awareness on naturally occurring and elevated concentration of as in ws are the main causes of death of thousands of people and millions to be exposed to serious health hazard hossain et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2016 as well as in various parts of the world yu et al 2003 coliform bacteria indicate fecal contamination and our present investigation showed unacceptable amount of bacterial colonies in significant number of tested ws the findings also match river kabul water samples where the bacteria count was much higher than the who standard limit however groundwater system in the southeast asia region is much less likely to contain microbial pathogens than surface water fendorf et al 2010 biological pollution loads coliform bacteria might be attributed to storage of high organic content household waste agricultural runoff contaminated stagnant water latrine pit situated 10 m distance from water sources etc of which all could be responsible for pathogenic content in the ws dey et al 2017b gupta et al 2003 sanap et al 2006 wqi is usually used to decide whether water is permissible for drinking and other necessary purposes according to several detailed studies wqi values were classified into five categories where 100 value indicate water is not good for human consumption khanna et al 2013 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yisa and jimoh 2010 groundwater quality map based on wqi has been considered as an important tool for identification of safe aquifer sites precautionary indication of potential environmental health problems and help to design sustainable groundwater management plan chatterjee et al 2010 rokbani et al 2011 in this study spatial distribution of six selected water quality parameters and derived wqi maps postma et al 2016 were developed which can facilitate to rapid assessment of pollution extent with respect to concentration in different locations ijeh and udoinyang 2013 and also can be applied as a diversified screening tools for policy and decision making in groundwater management strategies samson et al 2010 coastal area of bangladesh has been experiencing contamination in most of the groundwater system and it is essential to find suitable aquifer locations where safe water can be abstracted consequently contamination also has a wider impact on public health national water management plan 2001 in our findings proportionally only 12 of tested deeper aquifer area found to be safe for groundwater abstraction which reflects the scarcity of safe aquifer sites in the study area also specific depths 150 384 m of aquifer for installation of safe water options were explored in several parts of the study area and identified depths for installing safe drinking water wells match with sasmit project concept sasmit 2014 the findings will help to provide safe and affordable access to water and will be very effective for policy formulation in groundwater resources management in bangladesh south asia and in the world to improve this situation and securing public health several policy and management steps such as periodical monitoring of water quality at different aquifer depths placing the wells at safe distance from the sources of contamination needs to be followed it is also important that adequate number of safe drinking water wells provided through government non government and private drillers initiatives are protected from contamination of surface water bodies especially for drinking and household level use in areas with safe water scarcity it is necessary to establish sufficient water treatment facilities conservation of rainwater in protected ponds as well as facilities of proper treatment for drinking thus in order to ensure clean drinking water from groundwater sources site selectivity should be complemented with effective water governance tirkey et al 2017 and help to meet the targets for sustainable development goals in drinking water safety 5 conclusion a number of water quality problems linked with groundwater sources several interventions had been made but adequate attention was not paid in drinking water safety plan and installation of wells had been done on an ad hoc basis therefore identification of suitable aquifer sites and depths were necessary for installing tube wells to extract safe drinking water most important seven water quality parameters were investigated and a very high percentage of most usable drinking water sources were found beyond who s drinking water standard gis based geo statistical and spatial analysis were conducted to identify safe aquifer sites according to water quality parameters and measured data in this study the results of the present study reveals that the drinking water wells were found unsafe in shallow aquifer 150 m within 100 of the study area however deep aquifers 150 384 m were found safe in only 12 of the upazila covering an area of 39 km2 this 39 km2 patch of suitable deep aquifer were identified in northern north central central and south western part of the study area these results will help policy makers local community and other relevant water sector professionals to explore suitable site of safe aquifer for installation of safe tubewells sustainable abstraction of water from the suitable sites would be a concern if aquifers are not adequately recharged further investigations could be undertaken where the geogenic contaminant such as mn and other trace elements are included to assess the groundwater system from drinking

other domestic uses and irrigation bbs 2014 bhattacharjee et al 2018 aquifers in bangladesh are located at a relatively shallow depth and extends at greater depths 350 m bhattacharya et al 2004 mukherjee et al 2008a 2008b ravenscroft et al 2005 most of shallow aquifers depth 150 m contain high levels of arsenic as iron fe and manganese mn ahmed et al 2004 hossain et al 2006 von brömssen et al 2007 2008 vega et al 2017 several important studies have been conducted to understand the extent of contamination in groundwater ahmed et al 2004 biswas et al 1998 harvey et al 2006 mcarthur et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 according to a national survey conducted in 2009 by unicef bbs 2011 high as concentration has been detected in groundwater system within 322 upazilas sub districts under 61 districts out of 64 districts of bangladesh hossain et al 2015 even though several initiatives such as installation of tubewells tw mostly deep tubewells dtw depth 150 m in as affected prone areas have been carried out radloff et al 2011 still people in many areas drink as contaminated water hossain 2015 groundwater system in different parts of bangladesh especially the south west coastal region has been experiencing many problems such as high level elemental concentration over drafting etc national water policy 1999 however one fifth of the total land area of bangladesh about 29 000 km2 area is considered as coastal zone which is especially characterized by influence of tidal waters salinity intrusion and cyclones storm surges etc nearly 53 productive aquifers in coastal bangladesh have been affected by saline water intrusion from bay of bengal mofdm 2005 mowr 2005 in the coastal areas of bangladesh people often experience scarcity of safe water and unavailability of safe aquifers high salinity and as concentration in groundwater system are major problems in the tidal delta plain of southwest bangladesh ayers et al 2016 shallow aquifers in the meghna river basin and coastal plains of bangladesh are extremely contaminated with as ahmed et al 2004 bhattacharya et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 high fe concentration and turbidity are also associated with the groundwater sources in the south western coastal areas and therefore quality of groundwater is being continued to be an important environmental and public health issue samson et al 2010 in coastal area of bangladesh water quality has been identified as a serious problem and few studies focused on either on as or salinity not both benneyworth et al 2016 it has become extremely difficult to identify the most suitable sites and approximate depths of safe aquifers thus it is essential to develop adequate information for successful installation of water options long term conservation policy and decision making in groundwater development and management strategies on a regional scale the overall aim of the study was to explore suitable locations and depths for safe drinking water wells installation based on wqi and geo statistical analysis the study findings will provide sufficient information to identify appropriate sites and depth of aquifers where drinking water of good quality can be found and abstracted in a sustainable manner 2 methodology 2 1 study site and population tala upazila sub district of satkhira district was selected as the study area 22 35 0 to 22 50 0

unit weight wi and then divided by aggregated unit weight wi value as shown in eq 3 yisa and jimoh 2010 3 wqi σ q i w i σ w i wqi was calculated for 632 most usable water sources by considering six important drinking water quality parameters ec fe as tc e coli and fc 2 5 geo statistical analysis several geo spatial technologies of gis geo location tools of gps and water quality testing data were coupled to conduct geo statistical analysis in the gis platform for in depth understanding of water quality status in the groundwater system and to delineate the spatial variability before conducting analysis attribute dataset and geo referencing were checked and corrected topographically to ensure quality of data proper identification of water sources description and inter connectivity among different datasets rahman 2008 zhang 2006 the geochemical database comprised of groundwater quality parameters collected from stw 12 150 m and dtw 150 384 m two databases were developed processed and analyzed separately to find vertical and longitudinal distribution of tested water quality parameters experimental value based maps of each parameter were prepared using geo statistical analysis in arcgis 10 prepared maps were analyzed to interpret spatial distribution and extension of water quality value tirkey et al 2017 radial basis functions rbf a data interpolation technique in geo statistical analysis was selected considering number and distribution of water sources rbf interpolator was selected due to its exactness flexibility no assessment of prediction error and also its suitability for generating smooth surfaces in the gently varying topography following who drinking water quality standard spatial distribution maps of each water quality parameter tested ec fe as tc e coli and fc were generated using arcgis rbf same way integrated wqi and depth of water sources maps one for stw and another for dtw were created to explore most suitable aquifer locations for installing safe tw in two different depth ranges 150 m and 150 384 m of aquifers and locations of safe area including percentage of coverage were calculated 2 6 standardization using reference values the selected water quality parameters were analyzed to know the concentration level and compared with who and bangladesh standard values to know how many water sources exceeded drinking water quality standard selected tws for sampling were classified in two types one is dtw depth 150 m and another is stw depth 150 m ahmed et al 2004 according to the who guideline and bangladesh drinking water standard bdws the safety limit considered for drinking water quality parameters were 10 and 50 µg l for as 0 3 and 1 0 mg l for fe 250 and 600 µs cm for ec 25 c for temp 0 cfu 100 ml for tc 0 cfu 100 ml for e coli and 0 cfu 100 ml for fc for coliform bacteria who and bdws were the same akter et al 2016 hossain et al 2015 gruber et al 2014 singh et al 2012 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 however yisa and jimoh 2010 categorized wqi values into five types excellent 50 good 50 100 poor 101 200 very poor 201 300 and unsuitable 300 for drinking water sources 2 7 descriptive statistical analysis descriptive statistical analysis range median mean standard deviation and frequency distribution and comparison with who standard of measured values were done by using stata 12 0 arcgis 10 was used for locating sampling points geo statistical analysis calculating areas and visualization of spatial distribution based on water quality parameters and wqi 3 results 3 1 water quality status at most usable drinking water sources water temperature ranged between 25 8 and 36 6 c and the mean value of both types of ws stw and dtw were very close high variability of ec values were found in dtw with a range of 349 8715 µs cm sd 2402 34 all ws tested result exceeded the who and bdws standards for ec table 2 the tested fe concentrations were not very high in both types of ws and varied at 0 18 and 0 8 mg l for stw and dtw respectively almost all stw exceeded who standard 99 and bdws 96 but it was only 71 who and 31 bdws for dtw table 2 the lowest and the highest value of as concentration in stw and dtw were found to be 0 500 and 0 100 µg l respectively distance of the water sampling points weren t so high but the variation of tested result of as concentration in stws was found quite high sd 80 14 most of the stw exceeded the who drinking water standards 88 and bdws 62 for as and percentage of dtw exceeding the who 64 and bdws 14 were comparatively lower table 2 however who and bdws were same for tc e coli and fc in in situ observation comparatively less number of coliform bacteria were found in dtw significant proportion of stw were contaminated by coliform bacteria where range of tc e coli and fc were 0 208 sd 34 17 0 160 sd 16 59 and 0 212 sd 47 86 cfu 100 ml the variation of coliform counts among stws was found to be slightly wider compared to dtw table 2 3 2 wqi calculation at most usable drinking water sources during wqi calculation it was assumed that all the parameters had influence on value but a high index value was found mainly due to high concentration of ec fe and as the calculated wqi ranged from 0 142 stw to 7382 535 dtw are given in table 3 based on wqi values overall we found that only 28 were excellent to good while the rest 72 were poor to unsuitable sources for drinking water according to computed values of wqi distribution of stw were 3 1 excellent 5 2 good 0 poor 6 2 very poor and 295 95 unsuitable and for dtw were 85 26 excellent 85 26 good 41 13 poor 20 6 very poor and 92 28 unsuitable drinking water sources 3 3 identification of suitable aquifer depths and locations based on the wqi values and geo spatial analysis the calculated safe aquifer areas for stw and dtw in obtaining drinking water are described in table 3 who permissible limit of fe and as were found in the deep aquifers dtw of the northern part of the study area fig 3a b safe areas for fe and as were found to be respectively 27 km2 8 and 24 km2 7 in the study area table 3 however the spatial map of ec does not indicate any safe area for both shallow and deeper aquifers fig 2c 3c in case of tc e coli and fc bacteria safer areas were identified in dtw aquifer above 30 of total area in table 2 and multiple patches of safe zone were identified in the northern eastern central and south eastern parts of the study area fig 3d f however as very clearly shown in fig 4a almost all areas of shallow depth aquifer stw were found unsuitable for drinking water abstraction in dtw aquifer multiple patches of excellent and good quality groundwater zones were visible in the central line of the study area fig 4b using wqi and geo statistical analysis we found excellent good poor very poor and unsuitable sites for water point installation 13 78 km2 4 11 25 03 km2 7 48 34 46 km2 10 29 40 53 km2 12 10 and 221 07 km2 66 02 respectively for dtw table 2 in the study overall 39 km2 12 of the study area were explored as a suitable sites for installing water abstraction device such as tw where we can get excellent to good quality water in greater depth 150 384 m aquifer identified depths of most suitable aquifers where excellent to good quality water could be abstracted are shown in fig 4b 4 discussion groundwater system in the study area located in the coastal area of bangladesh mowr 2005 contains high concentration of as and salinity the non availability of suitable aquifer for obtaining drinking water has been reported by khanom and salehin 2012 in the present study we have identified 632 high dependent drinking water sources where each water source is being used by about 20 1000 households seven important water quality parameters were investigated to determine the actual water quality status using wqi of the aquifer based on two different depth classes stw 150 m and dtw 150 m and this information will be useful to delineate the most suitable locations and depth for installing safe water options tw water temperature is an important parameter for physicochemical and biological activities of the aquatic eco system gupta et al 2009 morrison et al 2001 high temperature in water significantly affects the solubility of dissolved oxygen and amplifies the taste and odor of drinking water singh et al 2012 according to present in situ measurement all the tested ws 100 exceeded standard recommended value of drinking water temperature if the exceeded temperature goes higher than the acceptable limit then it could have potential harm for human health ec is a good and standard measure of dissolved solids in water which depends on concentration of ions and nutrient status gupta et al 2009 normally ec range in groundwater is 100 2000 µs cm and a comparatively low value indicates good quality drinking water ijeh and udoinyang 2013 the entire tested drinking ws including stw and dtw contained much higher concentration of ec than the who recommended level khanom and salehin 2012 reported that salinity concentration in dtw 840 1350 ft were found to be much higher six times or more beyond standard than stw in the coastal areas enhanced chemical weathering high residence time of groundwater in the aquifer etc might be the reasons for high ec values in groundwater tirkey et al 2017 besides groundwater table recharges directly from surface waters including direct rainfall or surface stored water through infiltration mainly from seawater brackish river water and aquaculture during storm surge a huge amount of saline water is stored in surface water bodies in addition saline water based aquaculture is an emerging potential source of socioeconomic activities in this area that will also potentially contribute to groundwater recharge by salt water increasing trend of groundwater salinity has been shown from southern coastal area to northern part of the country mahmud et al 2017 salinity intrusion has adverse effects on water soils agriculture fisheries ecosystem and livelihoods in the coastal area of bangladesh habiba et al 2014 because of high salinity lifting groundwater for drinking and other purposes has become a threat to environmental health ahmed 2006 minar et al 2013 national water policy 1999 besides excess amount of fe raises aesthetic concern giving a metallic taste to drinking water gupta et al 2009 and a majority of tested drinking water sources in our study exceeded the recommended fe level the toxic effects of high fe concentration are not often well documented merrill et al 2011 if concentration exceeds 200 mg l it may lead to several health hazard such as fatigue gupta et al 2009 arsenic has a very strong affinity for fe oxyhydroxides in groundwater systems ahmed et al 2004 mukherjee and bhattacharya 2001 van geen et al 2003 our findings indicated that almost all stw and majority of dtw according to who drinking water standard were contaminated with as ahmed et al 2004 and huq et al 2003 found that 80 of stw of meghna river basin and coastal plain were highly affected by as also van geen et al 2003 stated that more than half of the tested tw total sample 6000 didn t meet bdws 50 µg l for as concentration occurrence of high as in some greater depth aquifer system in the south western part coastal area probably due to absence of prominent impermeable layer between shallow and greater depth aquifer system mahmud et al 2017 at present as is universally environmental toxin zhu et al 2016 high as concentration might arise from natural geo chemical processes and also sometimes due to anthropogenic activities such as discharge of as containing industrial chemicals most of these anthropogenic activities contaminate shallow water systems while geo chemical processes are responsible for contamination of greater depth aquifer systems in bangladesh aquifers are contaminated with naturally occurring high as concentration ahmed et al 2004 hossain et al 2014 especially lower portions of ganges brahmaputra river system mostly coastal area are moderate to severely contaminated with as that could be a potential health hazard to a very high population rahman et al 2008 in south asia lack of awareness on naturally occurring and elevated concentration of as in ws are the main causes of death of thousands of people and millions to be exposed to serious health hazard hossain et al 2017 mukherjee et al 2016 as well as in various parts of the world yu et al 2003 coliform bacteria indicate fecal contamination and our present investigation showed unacceptable amount of bacterial colonies in significant number of tested ws the findings also match river kabul water samples where the bacteria count was much higher than the who standard limit however groundwater system in the southeast asia region is much less likely to contain microbial pathogens than surface water fendorf et al 2010 biological pollution loads coliform bacteria might be attributed to storage of high organic content household waste agricultural runoff contaminated stagnant water latrine pit situated 10 m distance from water sources etc of which all could be responsible for pathogenic content in the ws dey et al 2017b gupta et al 2003 sanap et al 2006 wqi is usually used to decide whether water is permissible for drinking and other necessary purposes according to several detailed studies wqi values were classified into five categories where 100 value indicate water is not good for human consumption khanna et al 2013 ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 yisa and jimoh 2010 groundwater quality map based on wqi has been considered as an important tool for identification of safe aquifer sites precautionary indication of potential environmental health problems and help to design sustainable groundwater management plan chatterjee et al 2010 rokbani et al 2011 in this study spatial distribution of six selected water quality parameters and derived wqi maps postma et al 2016 were developed which can facilitate to rapid assessment of pollution extent with respect to concentration in different locations ijeh and udoinyang 2013 and also can be applied as a diversified screening tools for policy and decision making in groundwater management strategies samson et al 2010 coastal area of bangladesh has been experiencing contamination in most of the groundwater system and it is essential to find suitable aquifer locations where safe water can be abstracted consequently contamination also has a wider impact on public health national water management plan 2001 in our findings proportionally only 12 of tested deeper aquifer area found to be safe for groundwater abstraction which reflects the scarcity of safe aquifer sites in the study area also specific depths 150 384 m of aquifer for installation of safe water options were explored in several parts of the study area and identified depths for installing safe drinking water wells match with sasmit project concept sasmit 2014 the findings will help to provide safe and affordable access to water and will be very effective for policy formulation in groundwater resources management in bangladesh south asia and in the world to improve this situation and securing public health several policy and management steps such as periodical monitoring of water quality at different aquifer depths placing the wells at safe distance from the sources of contamination needs to be followed it is also important that adequate number of safe drinking water wells provided through government non government and private drillers initiatives are protected from contamination of surface water bodies especially for drinking and household level use in areas with safe water scarcity it is necessary to establish sufficient water treatment facilities conservation of rainwater in protected ponds as well as facilities of proper treatment for drinking thus in order to ensure clean drinking water from groundwater sources site selectivity should be complemented with effective water governance tirkey et al 2017 and help to meet the targets for sustainable development goals in drinking water safety 5 conclusion a number of water quality problems linked with groundwater sources several interventions had been made but adequate attention was not paid in drinking water safety plan and installation of wells had been done on an ad hoc basis therefore identification of suitable aquifer sites and depths were necessary for installing tube wells to extract safe drinking water most important seven water quality parameters were investigated and a very high percentage of most usable drinking water sources were found beyond who s drinking water standard gis based geo statistical and spatial analysis were conducted to identify safe aquifer sites according to water quality parameters and measured data in this study the results of the present study reveals that the drinking water wells were found unsafe in shallow aquifer 150 m within 100 of the study area however deep aquifers 150 384 m were found safe in only 12 of the upazila covering an area of 39 km2 this 39 km2 patch of suitable deep aquifer were identified in northern north central central and south western part of the study area these results will help policy makers local community and other relevant water sector professionals to explore suitable site of safe aquifer for installation of safe tubewells sustainable abstraction of water from the suitable sites would be a concern if aquifers are not adequately recharged further investigations could be undertaken where the geogenic contaminant such as mn and other trace elements are included to assess the groundwater system from drinking

singh 2012 mittal et al 2015 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph ph of the aqueous solution is an important variable and controlling parameter in the adsorption process it affects the surface charge of the nanocomposite degree of ionization and speciation of adsorbate during the adsorption process kumar et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 the maximum adsorption of pb ii cu ii and ni ii occurred at ph 4 5 and 4 respectively fig 7 a ahmad and haseeb 2014 kumar et al 2011 zeng et al 2015 at low ph the decrease in adsorption is mainly due to the higher concentration of h in the suspension which competes with mn ions for the adsorption sites of nanocomposite at higher ph the decrease in adsorption is due to the formation of soluble hydroxyl complexes rao et al 2015 the influence of solution ph on mn adsorption can be explained in terms of point of zero charge phpzc ph at which the adsorbent is neutral of the nanocomposite the phpzc of bionanocomposite was found to be 7 5 which is greater than solution ph of pb ii cu ii and ni ii therefore the predominant metal species will be positively charged mn and m oh n 1 thus uptake of metals in the ph range below phpzc

with time and the equilibrium was attained in 60 min 120 min and 60 min for cu ii ni ii and pb ii respectively the rate and mechanism of adsorption were determined by using different kinetic models the linear forms of various kinetic models such as pseudo first order pseudo second order and weber morris intra particle diffusion models were as follows eqs 3 5 3 log q e q t log q e k 1 t 2 303 4 t q t t q e q e 2 k 2 5 q t k i d t 1 2 c where qe and qt represents amount of heavy metal adsorbed on the adsorbent mg g 1 at equilibrium and time t k1 min 1 and k2 g mg 1 min 1 were the rate constant of pseudo first and pseudo second order kinetics ahmad and kumar 2010 kyzas et al 2015 kid mg g 1 min 1 2 was the intra particle diffusion rate constant c was the intercept mg g 1 which gives the idea about the thickness of boundary layer the values of various kinetic parameters obtained from their respective linear plots were tabulated in table 1 the value of correlation coefficient r2 indicated a better fit to pseudo second order model and the qe values obtained by pseudo second order stand much closer with the experimental results these observations suggested that the overall rate of metal adsorption was controlled by pseudo second order kinetics and chemisorption is the rate limiting step that controlled the adsorption process lee et al 2013 fig 7 b the intra particle diffusion model

at all temperatures langmuir isotherm model fig 8 a b and c can be used to best describe the metal adsorption behaviour on bionanocomposite with lowest χ2 values it can be deduced that metal adsorption isotherm process is mainly homogeneous and monolayer adsorption occurs without any interaction between adsorbed ions huang et al 2014 as n 1 represents favourable physical adsorption wang et al 2013 the values of rl at three different temperature for all metal ions were between 0 and 1 which demonstrates adsorption of metal ions with the adsorbent is favourable pourreza and naghdi 2014 it can be observed from table 2 that the values of qmax increases with rise in temperature which reveal endothermic behaviour of the adsorption process and the equilibrium adsorption data was better fitted to the langmuir isotherm model wang et al 2013 according to qmax parameter adsorption onto bionanocomposite followed the following sequence as pb ii cu ii ni ii in accordance to hydrated radius

different temperature respectively fig 8 d guo et al 2014 kyzas et al 2014 the thermodynamic parameters were tabulated in table 4 it could be revealed from table 4 δg is negative at all temperatures for all metals proving spontaneous and favourable adsorption and as the δg value decreased on increasing the temperature which reveals the high adsorption capacity at higher temperature which is in agreement with previous discussion guo et al 2014 δg values were in the range of 5 776 to 7 116 kjmol 1 indicating physisorption process is involved in metal ion adsorption onto nanocomposite kumar et al 2014 ahmad and mirza 2015 δh for all metal ions were positive indicating endothermic nature of adsorption affirming previous results guo et al 2014 the value of δs0 were positive for all metal ions

respectively the monolayer adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature 303 323 k results indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity was observed in ph range of 4 5 with contact time of 1 2 h for different metal ions thermodynamic parameters showed adsorption process was spontaneous endothermic with increased randomness at solid liquid interface desorption studies showed highest recovery was achieved with hcl for all metal ions the mechanism involved in the adsorption of metal ion onto the bionanocomposite was the combined effect of physiosorption ion exchange precipitation

better fit to pseudo second order model and the qe values obtained by pseudo second order stand much closer with the experimental results these observations suggested that the overall rate of metal adsorption was controlled by pseudo second order kinetics and chemisorption is the rate limiting step that controlled the adsorption process lee et al 2013 fig 7 b the intra particle diffusion model is not fitting well for adsorption process as the value of regression coefficient is low and the line did not pass through origin mittal et al 2015 3 2 3 adsorption isotherms and effect of temperature in order to study the interaction between metal ion and bionanocomposite and to explore the mechanism of surface binding adsorption equilibrium data were analyzed at 303 k 313 k and 323 k by langmuir freundlich and tempkin isotherm models for all metal ions the non linear regression analysis was done using origin pro8 the mathematical expressions of non linear form of these models were represented in eq 6 eq 7 eq 8 respectively 6 q e q max b c e 1 b c e 7 q e k f c e 1 n 8 q e b t ln k t c e where qe mg g 1 was the adsorption capacity of metal on adsorbent at equilibrium qmax mg g 1 was the maximum adsorption capacity from langmuir model ce mg l 1 was the concentration of metal solution at equilibrium b l mg 1 was the langmuir constant kf mg g 1 l mg 1 1 n was the freundlich constant n was the heterogeneity factor indicating the adsorption intensity of the adsorbent kt l mg 1 was the equilibrium binding constant bt is related to heat of adsorption ahmad and haseeb 2013 yu et al 2013 separation factor or equilibrium parameter rl a dimensionless constant was defined to describe the characteristics of langmuir model r l 1 1 b c o rl values indicate whether the shape of isotherm is unfavourable rl 1 or favourable 0 rl 1 or linear rl 1 badruddoza et al 2013 the theoretical isotherm parameters with error evaluation reduced χ2 were listed in table 2 by comparing r2 for all metals at all temperatures langmuir isotherm model fig 8 a b and c can be used to best describe the metal adsorption behaviour on bionanocomposite with lowest χ2 values it can be deduced that metal adsorption isotherm process is mainly homogeneous and monolayer adsorption occurs without any interaction between adsorbed ions huang et al 2014 as n 1 represents favourable physical adsorption wang et al 2013 the values of rl at three different temperature for all metal ions were between 0 and 1 which demonstrates adsorption of metal ions with the adsorbent is favourable pourreza and naghdi 2014 it can be observed from table 2 that the values of qmax increases with rise in temperature which reveal endothermic behaviour of the adsorption process and the equilibrium adsorption data was better fitted to the langmuir isotherm model wang et al 2013 according to qmax parameter adsorption onto bionanocomposite followed the following sequence as pb ii cu ii ni ii in accordance to hydrated radius and hydration energy mobasherpour et al 2012 zeng et al 2015 comparison of maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of pb ii cu ii ni ii with various other adsorbents have been reported in table 3 the feasibility of present bionanocomposite can be inferred from table 3 as it showed highest qmax among other adsorbents 3 2 4 thermodynamic studies thermodynamic parameters such as δg kjmol 1 δh kjmol 1 and δs kjmol 1 k 1 at 303 313 and 323 k for cu ii ni ii and pb ii were evaluated using following eqs 9 10 9 δ g o r t ln k c 10 ln k c δ h o r t δ s o r where r was the gas constant 8 314 jmol 1 k 1 kc was the distribution coefficient t was the temperature in kelvin δg kjmol 1 δh kjmol 1 and δs kjmol 1 k 1 were the gibbs free energy change enthalpy change and entropy change for all metal ions at different temperature respectively fig 8 d guo et al 2014 kyzas et al 2014 the thermodynamic parameters were tabulated in table 4 it could be revealed from table 4 δg is negative at all temperatures for all metals proving spontaneous and favourable adsorption and as the δg value decreased on increasing the temperature which reveals the high adsorption capacity at higher temperature which is in agreement with previous discussion guo et al 2014 δg values were in the range of 5 776 to 7 116 kjmol 1 indicating physisorption process is involved in metal ion adsorption onto nanocomposite kumar et al 2014 ahmad and mirza 2015 δh for all metal ions were positive indicating endothermic nature of adsorption affirming previous results guo et al 2014 the value of δs0 were positive for all metal ions indicating increased randomness at solid liquid interface during the adsorption of metal ions onto bionanocomposite guo et al 2014 ahmad and mirza 2015 3 2 5 desorption studies desorption was done in order to show convincing economic feasibility resourcefulness and to restore the used adsorbent for this various desorbing agents 20 ml 0 02 g adsorbent contact time 24 h were investigated such as 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m acetic acid 0 1 m oxalic acid 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m nacl the best result for all metal ions were observed with 0 1 m hcl 90 of cu ii 87 of ni ii and 85 of pb ii were desorbed by 0 1 m hcl fig 9 4 conclusion based on the outcomes of the present study it was envisaged that the synthesized novel bionanocomposite showed the removal of metal ions in the order of pb ii 99 cu ii 97 ni ii 93 respectively the adsorption process followed pseudo second order and langmuir adsorption isotherm with monolayer adsorption capacity of 530 54 177 2 and 51 48 mg g 1 at 323 k for pb ii cu ii and ni ii respectively the monolayer adsorption capacity increases with increasing temperature 303 323 k results indicate that the maximum adsorption capacity was observed in ph range of 4 5 with contact time of 1 2 h for different metal ions thermodynamic parameters showed adsorption process was spontaneous endothermic with increased randomness at solid liquid interface desorption studies showed highest recovery was achieved with hcl for all metal ions the mechanism involved in the adsorption of metal ion onto the bionanocomposite was the combined effect of physiosorption ion exchange precipitation and chemisorption with chemisorption as the rate limiting step the bionanocomposite showed excellent adsorption properties for pb ii cu ii and ni ii the various functional groups on n acetyl cysteine modified mica interacted with the functional groups on xanthan gum that enhances the adsorption process of various metal ions by providing new functional sites acknowledgements the authors gratefully

12347,water scarcity unequal water distribution and overexploitation make of groundwater a strategic resource to protect and preserve for future generations particularly in arid and semi arid regions groundwater governance faces many issues and challenges and many governance gaps exist almost everywhere around the world it has experienced many models and approaches worldwide over the past century in literature there are several research papers and reports talking about the importance of data and information in implementing effective governance nevertheless few are showing their impact on stakeholders engagement such as in the implementation of the groundwater engagements or contracts as a form of participatory governance this paper aims to show the impact of information trust in relationships and communication on the small farmers commitment in participatory governance this had been experimented in six rural communes in saiss plain in two steps the first step consisted on collecting and analyzing small farmers requirements on information and communication in five communes quite similar in characteristics through a survey in order to assess their ability to commit and cooperate under a participatory governance framework in developing mediterranean countries the second one consists on showing a concrete case of information need on groundwater found in another commune in saiss and the impact of the trust in relationships the good communication the will to develop the socio economic situation and the leadership through the case of a small group of young farmers associated in cooperative in the enhancement of the information dissemination and the farmers awareness regarding rural development and environment protection the study shows that there is a weakness in information transmission and communication around groundwater the paper recommends a new communication channel to give relevant information to farmers and to assist them to collaborate in

participatory governance contract information communication channel commitment 1 introduction water scarcity overexploitation of none or hardly renewable water resources and unequal water distribution make of groundwater considered as being inexhaustible a strategic resource to protect and preserve for future generations particularly in arid and semi arid regions such for countries in mediterranean region brouma and scoullos 2008 escun 2007 undp 2015 during the global and international events in relation with environment water and climate change scientists continue to sound the alarm on ecological and socio economic risks that planet runs by continuing to exploit its natural resources in irrational and unsustainable way for socio economic reasons the seventeen goals of sustainable development as it was agreed by world leaders at the special summit of the united nations on sustainable development held in new york in september 2015 just continue the considerable progress made to achieve the millennium development goals in fact two goals are touching directly the issue of groundwater governance gwg in one hand the goal 6 is related to water and sanitation and is about to ensure by 2030 a universal and equitable access to safe water at an affordable cost protecting and restoring ecosystems related water undp 2015 one of this goal targets 6 b is focusing on the support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management undp 2015 the goal 12 is relating to the establishment of sustainable consumption and production patterns this goal aims to achieve economic growth and sustainable development through an efficient management of human shared natural resources according to many researches janssen 2013 oecd 2015a oecd 2015b ostrom 1990 this global willingness to change the trend of overexploitation and natural resources degradation including groundwater resources and deal with related challenges linked among others to social equity in terms of water supply in a sufficient quantity and acceptable quality as well as food security and sustainable development can only be achieved through the adoption of a new participatory governance model involving all stakeholders it might be also possible if a multitude of factors are available such as the existence of a regulatory institutional and organizational framework and stakeholders commitment as well as reliable and available information the committee of experts on public administration of economic and social council un had considered in 2007 the participatory governance as one of many institutional strategies of governance development the committee underlines that citizen participation in decision making is the result or the logical consequence of participatory governance policies and participation is not only a goal but also a fundamental value in itself different approaches and theories have been discussed around natural resources and especially groundwater as a common good over the last century before arriving to participatory governance advance these theories and approaches are joining both economic and social aspects in order to prevent groundwater over exploitation and address use conflicts two solutions have been proposed by economists the market and the state there are many researches in literature explaining these theories and thesis araral 2014 escun 2007 gordon 1954 hardin 1968 mansbridge 2014 olson 1965 1971 ostrom 1990 2005 petit 2002 early in 1954 gordon pointed out in his article the need for a single owner of the resource either public or private in 1968 and due to the increase of natural resources and population growth hardin indicated the urgency and the need to control the commons through privatization or government control through its well known theory the tragedy of the commons illustrated through the model of the shepherd and his flock twenty years after the publication of his paper hardin s theory became the heart of the global debate of environmental governance especially in the earth summit in rio in 1978 olson with his thesis under the name of the logic of collective action highlights the importance of the common interests of groups when he said whereas group interests were everything individual interests were nothing what mattered were the common interests of groups of people not the losses and gains to single individuals he also brings to light the relationship between group size and organizational behavior through economic analysis in his point of view small and large groups organizations are completely different small groups can act to advance their interests much more easily than large ones and need few resources to meet their common interests in addition to state and market there are a series of intermediate situations between them and even situations where different actors develop organization models to find solutions to avoid the tragedy of the commons petit 2002 that is what elinor ostrom proved in 1990 through her famous thesis under the name of governing the commons she analyzed the depletion of groundwater and tried to prove how individuals can commit themselves to cooperate and govern the commons without destroying it and without any state s assistance or pressure mansbridge 2014 at the same time she emphasized the role of institutions in providing information to users to make decisions for the auto governing of the cpr in order to investigate the capabilities of organizations for managing common pool resources cpr she looks at collectives from 50 to 15 000 people who share some vital cpr thirteen cases have been studied around the world which self governance for a long time can be considered a success but also failures and some are difficult to judge ostrom 1990 further in 2011 ostrom highlights that there is no magic formula to govern the commons and each common can be considered as a niche on an empirical ground she also emphasized in 2005 that the extent of cooperation in commons governance is a function of two fundamental variables trust and reciprocity among stakeholders araral 2014 and highlights the key role that communication plays in community engagement by helping to build the social capital necessary to bring groups and individuals together willis 2012 in spite of the evolution of theories and worldwide efforts on setting up some governance tools and institutional arrangements to manage groundwater resources in a sustainable way this resource remains difficult to manage because of numerous deficiencies and lacks which are varying depending on the country context these deficiencies could be related to information and knowledge legal frameworks and their application country strategies policies and plans and stakeholders engagement unesco et al 2015 studies of commons have shown during the last 40 years an incredible variety of institutions governing commons exploitation and management over the world berge and van laerhoven 2011 successful arrangements were seen mainly in developed countries such as united states of america australia japan swiss and spain which have the favorable scientific and institutional framework to implement the participatory governance ostrom 1990 shah 2014 in 2015 oecd considered in its report on water governance that water governance is based on 3 principles effectiveness efficiency and trust and engagement fig 1 due to its intrinsic characteristics and its dependence to multi level governance stakeholders engagement and commitment in the early stages of decision making affect strongly and directly the success of institutional arrangement for gwg or as it called groundwater agreement or groundwater contract this is summarized perfectly by the ostrom phrase decisions made in collective choice situations directly affect operational situations decisions made in constitutional choice situations indirectly affect operational situations by creating and limiting the powers that can be exercised within collective choice arrangements creating legislative and judicial bodies protecting rights of free speech and property etc ostrom 1990 data and information are not only an instrument of supporting decision making at different levels of groundwater management but also one of the pillars of effective governance and play an important role in engaging stakeholders berge 2011 many developed countries understood the impact of sharing information with public on the governance of the commons such as usa korea and australia etc to overcome the lack of information they implemented online services providing public access to sufficient data and relevant information on the cpr s state uses and their development as well as a platform in order to push farmers to communicate widely in recent years farmers in uk had used internet as source of information significant bang has known websites with agricultural vocation dedicated to sharing information and advice such as the website www fwi co uk in order to communicate more simply and for who don t have computer or adequate broadband farming organizations have chosen to communicate with farmers through short messages or smart phones applications as well as in netherlands the agricultural website http www boerderij nl had known an exceptional success stocks 2011 in morocco some existing websites and magazines are devoted to agricultural issues but none is specialized or at least taking into account regularly groundwater issues these communication channels cc are mainly dedicated to big farmers with a certain level of education and awareness and with access to internet in the last two decades more than 90 countries have legislated to guarantee the widest public access to data available from public services and to develop information of general interest canavaggio and balafrej 2011 janssen 2013 new technologies have been used extensively to improve the collection organization and data storage to facilitate their dissemination and to reduce management costs by administrations and their use by citizens moreover state plays a considerable role as a facilitator through the implementation of the institutional framework which can foster stakeholders exchange of data information and experiences and several decision making bottom up mansbridge 2014 popular participation in decision making processes has many implications not only on efficiency and sustainable use of cpr but also on economic development human rights equity and social justice democracy social capital and decentralized governance berge and van laerhoven 2011 emerging literature draws attention to the failure of gwg arrangements especially in developing countries including those in the mediterranean region berge and van laerhoven 2011 cmi et al 2014 janssen 2013 plan bleu et al 2012 some of the success constraints are linked to users participation in 2008 brouma and scoullos think that the various stages of the evolution of the participation process are attained along a growing curve closely linked to the expansion and deepening of democratization the education and public awareness of environmental development and cultural issues according to them the constraints that hinder the progress of participatory processes in the mediterranean region can be summarized as a deficient or inadequate legal and institutional framework to support public participation weak administrative infrastructure and limited resources to meet the public demand the lack of coordination between different administrative sectors and public agencies segmentation of ngos and civil society initiatives the unwillingness of the authorities to provide information to the public even if it is feasible technically and legally mainly due to poor recognition or acceptance in the practice of groups of civil society and ngos as legitimate partners in decision making the physical invisibility of groundwater systems makes it harder to handle the issues of overexploitation and related risks and then to participate in monitoring however the impact of climate change felt by communities in arid and semi arid regions through the decrease of rainfalls over the last decades might change groundwater users attitudes awareness and their ability to cooperate this cooperation could not be effective without an open and equitable users access to relevant information and knowledge information level about the actions of other users affects the level of cooperation janssen 2013 in order to understand aquifer behavior and trends information should be on groundwater resource characteristics uses and users berge and van laerhoven 2011 cmi et al 2014 plan bleu et al 2012 in morocco access of groundwater users especially farmers to reliable information on groundwater remains very restricted this access is limited to particular cases where the farmer needs some information during the process of the application for authorization in order to dig wells or boreholes or simply through the advice of a well known digger or agricultural inputs and equipment seller in this case an important question arises in regard to the quality of the received information and thus its impact on farmers decisions on choosing the location of the wells or boreholes the type of pumps installations and the irrigation system as well as the crops the right of access to information is one of the fundamental rights and freedoms enunciated by the sherif dahir n 1 11 91 of july 29 2011 promulgating the text of the constitution constitution of morocco 2011 especially in article 27 which provides that citizens have the right to access information held by the public administration elected bodies and bodies entrusted with a public service mission the right to information may be limited only by law for the protection of all matters relating to national defense the internal and external security of the state and the privacy of persons and with the aim to preventing the infringement of the rights and freedoms set forth in this constitution and to protect sources and areas expressly determined by law the consecration of this right confirms the continuing commitment of morocco to human rights as recognized internationally as well as its commitment to respect the provisions of article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights article 19 of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article 10 of the united nations convention against corruption which obliged public administrations to facilitate access to information by citizens via the implementation of all measures enabling them to exercise this right with a view to enhancing transparency and embedding the culture of good governance to implement the provisions of this article a draft law no 31 13 on the right of access to information was undertaken by the ministry in charge of public service and the modernization of the administration in 2013 and which was approved by the government and submitted to parliament the overview of this draft law notes that it has been proved that the provision of sufficient information contributes to embedding participatory democracy and encouraging citizens to participate in monitoring the work of the administration as well as in decision making this draft law defines information as data which could be expressed in numbers letters drawings or images in paper or electronic format in morocco the debate of participatory governance through groundwater contract gwc has begun actually ten years ago at the national water debate in 2006 the experience with this type of arrangements has started after the enactment of water law n 10 95 in 1995 in 2006 the first gwc was made in souss massa draa river basin in the southwest of the country this agreement which objective was the preservation and development of water resources in this region has been elaborated between 24 institutions representing public institutions and relevant ministries local authorities and representatives of farmers cmi et al 2014 unfortunately this experience has failed for several reasons these reasons can be summarized in some points linked to the lack of the adequate financial and regulatory framework to implement the contents of the contract the constraints of the water points regularization and users engagement cmi et al 2014 water policy in morocco places a considerable priority on protecting and preserving groundwater as a strategic resource for this end a list of priority aquifers was made with a roadmap for the implementation of their gwc by 2030 from now on these gwcs have been mastered under the legal framework of the new water law n 36 15 promulgated in 2016 among the general principles of this law are four important points related to the management and conservation of groundwater resources water and public water management in general in accordance with the rules of good governance by involving administrations local authorities operators concerned and representatives of different water users at national regional and local levels integrated participatory and decentralized water management taking into account the principle of equity and spatial solidarity protection of the aquatic environment and promotion of the sustainable development of water resources integration of adaptation to climate change at all levels in water planning and management the law also defined three distinct notions in relation to water management namely sustainable water management management that meets the needs of the present without compromising or affecting the right of future generations to meet their own needs integrated water management management based on a holistic a systematic transversal and intersectoral approach considering in an integrated manner the environmental social economic and technical aspects in the formulation and implementation of policies strategies plans and programs in the field of water participatory water management management consisting in decisions making on water development management use and preservation based on consultation and in partnership with relevant stakeholders including users the law has devoted a whole section section 4 to the preservation of groundwater in chapter x this section includes 3 sub sections which are respectively perimeters of safeguard and prohibition perimeters drilling conditions and participatory management contract the last one entitles the river basin agencies to establish participatory management contracts for the groundwater and for the portions of groundwater in agreement with the concerned partners and users of water or the public hydraulic domain with a view to ensure the sustainable use and preservation of water the public hydraulic domain and the aquatic environment the law also specifies the content of a participatory management contract in particular the action plan its objectives the duration the terms of its financing the rights and duties of users river basin agencies administration and the various partners concerned the contract also defines the rules and framework for the participation of users in the management and control of water use nevertheless the terms and conditions for the elaboration of participatory management contract will be subject to implementing legislation in addition and in terms of water users access to information the water law specifies in its chapter xi relating on the water information system that the administration and the river basin agency should make available to stakeholders and the general public relevant information in relation with water in this context and taking into account all these stipulations of the law particularly in relation to good governance participatory water management and information sharing with users and the public the aim of this paper is to show with field experiment how information sharing dialogue interactive communication and trust in relationships could contribute to strengthening stakeholders ownership of participatory groundwater governance pgwg this work consists actually to make a diagnosis of how small farmers have access of which information on groundwater and which information and communication channels are required and would be more useful for this population and also to highlight the difficulties encountered by this category of farmers in access and use of information to contribute to groundwater management analyzing information needs is an essential and necessary step for the development of an information system that could become a tool for management and decision support this diagnosis has been made through a survey with small farmers in the plain of saiss which holds an important aquifer in sebou river basin one of the important basins in morocco this paper would enrich the knowledge of communication channels forms used and relevant information required by small farmers rarely consulted to be able to commit and cooperate in order to fill the existing gap in this field and succeed pgwg in countries having similar context and conditions as morocco especially developing mediterranean countries 2 materials and methods the experiment consisted on holding a dialogue with farmers in saiss plain to understand their needs in terms of information and communication channels forms to access to reliable information on groundwater as well as other issues related to their socio economic development to exchange experiences between them and mainly to be aware of groundwater challenges in their area in order to cooperate with other actors such as authorities and other potential users to implement an agreement or simply the saiss gwc 2 1 study area the study area is the saiss plain commonly known as the plain of fez meknes which covers the center of the sebou river basin in morocco and bordered to the north by the prerif mountains and to the south by the atlas area it s located in a semi arid bioclimatic stage with a temperate winter the average annual precipitation is about 455 mm at fez station and 550 mm at meknes station this important plain of an area of 2100 square kilometers is characterized by an aquifer system composed of two superimposed aquifers confined and unconfined one these aquifers play an important role in socio economic development of its region through the supply of drinking water of fez and meknes cities and satisfying irrigation demand of more than 45 000 ha rda 2014 irrigation in saiss plain is made mainly through three methods of irrigation surface sprinkler and localized drip irrigation was introduced in the 1980 s and today over 36 of areas is equipped with drip irrigation facilities dominant speculations in the plain are annual crops and arboriculture actually this area is very famous in agriculture at national level through its production of fruits and vegetables especially onion and potatoes due to the combined effects of the decrease of rainfalls since the 1980 s which has reduced the natural recharge of groundwater and increased groundwater pumping for irrigation saiss aquifers suffer from overexploitation and the groundwater level continues to decline the groundwater balance established in the framework of the master plan of integrated water resources development of sebou showed an annual deficit of 100 million cubic meters rbas 2006 2009 the drawdown of groundwater level has affected the flow of many rivers and springs in the plain the surveys were carried out in 6 rural communes of the saiss plain in two stages in two different fields the first stage was carried out in april 2016 and consisted of interviews with farmers in five rural communes of the saiss plain sbaa ayoun sidi slimane moul kifane majjate ait yaazem and jahjouh as shown in fig 2 these five communes are all in the western side of the plain with a rather flat geomorphology the second stage was carried out in june 2016 in the commune of ait bourzouine in the province of el hajeb close to the 1st area fig 3 this stage consisted of conducting interviews with a young farmer who is also the vice president of a socio cultural association and the founder of a new agricultural cooperative in the heart of an older agricultural cooperative sidi mimoun as a result of the policy of the agrarian reform in the 1970 s the cooperative sidi mimoun is crossed by the river ain maarouf which is a tributary of the river boufekrane fig 4 this river comes from an upstream source with the same name regarding groundwater resources mobilization the number of water points in the whole commune of ait bourzouine is like 87 which 52 are boreholes with an average depth of 100 m below ground level 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 first stage of the experiment the methodology of this first stage consisted of conducting interviews with farmers in the plain of saiss on which types of information they have access on groundwater and different channels of communication used for this and also which information and cc they need to reinforce their awareness on groundwater issues and challenges in their area the purpose of this phase is to assess their capacities to commit to managing and using groundwater resources in a sustainable manner especially in participatory management framework sampling of farmers is done with a multi criteria and multi stage approach as shown in the diagram below the idea is to select from saiss plain which is the first stage five rural communes they have almost the same characteristics such as the predominance of wells some boreholes and well bores are found in the commune of mejjate fig 5 all of them have almost the same cropping patterns and they irrigate from a shallow aquifer the depth of the shallow aquifer is varying from 1 to 60 m bellow surface level with an average of 25 m data on piezometric measure were made in 2005 in the framework of the water points inventory led by rbas and used in the preparation of the master plan of integrated water resource development of sebou river basin from these areas the target group is farmers which have specific criteria this third stage consists on choosing small farmers with lands area varying from 0 to 10 ha and having as a minimum one well in fact this type of farmers is almost not consulted or at least not enough especially if they are not organized in associations neither in the preparation of regulation and rules in general nor if it s for agricultural issues or others some farmers in the saiss plain are organized via agriculture associations but in the opinion of farmers consulted many of them did not work or have difficulties to deal with age and gender distinction man and women at different ages were interviewed from 30 farmers randomly selected and having all criteria only 20 were finally chosen 4 farmers from each commune regarding the representativeness of the sample twenty farmers is considered representative of the target category of farmers chosen primly based on the criteria presented before in the methodology like to be small farmer with a maximum of 20 ha as a surface area and abstracting groundwater at least from one water point in five quite similar communes response rate approximates 60 regarding the number of complete and usable responses in order to carry out the investigations a survey form has been prepared on the basis of a number of assumptions such as groundwater over exploitation is a common concern of farmers farmers need information and communication on topics related to groundwater as a single water source in the study area communication with its different types of channels plays an important role in the governance of a common resource as groundwater farmers are organized into associations and local governance entities farmers exchange around groundwater issues the idea was to see towards this survey if these hypotheses are true hence several issues and questions have been raised in the questionnaire annex for instance personal data of farmers these data are with a high importance and reflects the difference of responses relying on age sex education level and belong to any association or entity data on land water data on land and groundwater resources accessed by farmers are of the prime importance as well because of the information offered in terms of surface area type of irrigation number of water points used with their different characteristics such as water depth and authorizations data on information it s important to know the type of information already available for farmers and their needs in terms of information to commit and to be engaged in groundwater agreement if yes which kind of information is required data on communication channels without communication channels information could not be disseminated and arrived to target population farmers it s necessary to know which already exist and which are needed it was important to give farmers the opportunity to add more details in addition to what it was included in the sheet and to express difficulties encountered in receiving information and to give any proposal to deal with this issue in order to analyze data collected from the survey a number was given for each category of data data collected was then selected treated and organized in relational database 2 2 2 second stage of the experiment this second stage aims to show how farmers associations when a climate of trust is established between the members and their president can play a central role in strengthening access to information and improving of communication in rural areas a successful association of young farmers is taken as a model this sociocultural association which gave birth to a young agricultural cooperative in the heart of an older agricultural cooperative resulting from the policy of the agrarian reform in the 1970 s at the beginning the cooperative had about 20 farmers each one has access and was able to benefit from a farm land of about ten hectares in average to cultivate and a house of about 1000 m2 the area of the land granted to the cooperative members varied according to the characteristics of the land more the land has bad characteristics more the larger the area is since its inception the cooperative equipped itself with collective agricultural equipment to help members meeting the challenge and succeed in productive agriculture according to one of the member farmers among the few who are still alive the cooperative has experienced many difficulties and above all a great failure according to this farmer the major reason was the establishment of a climate of non confidence between the members and the president of the cooperative and the non transparent management of the common property of the cooperative following this observation the members preferred to dissolve the cooperative to share common goods and thus to move from a cooperation work to individualism we have described the evolution of this association into a cooperative analyzed the secrets of the success of this initiative and above all how this association has an important role in preserving the water resources of the commune of ait bourzouine and informing farmers on many issues related to agriculture interviews were held with the president of the agricultural cooperative who showed great interest in the cause of this work and volunteered to answer the various questions 3 results and discussions 3 1 overexploitation of common is it a common concern coming out on the field i was expecting finding that the issue of saiss groundwater overexploitation and all associated risks are felt toughly by farmers and that this represents a common concern actually all farmers are aware that water resources are threatened by a continuing decrease of rainfalls nevertheless the majority do not feel the danger of a possible drying up of the groundwater of saiss especially in the short run rainfall in the study area for these 3 years have allowed maintaining a water level quite satisfactory especially in wells and accessible for farmers to understand farmers behavior in terms of groundwater management it was necessary to know if water shortage is felt and this is considered as a common worry for farmers the amazing and common response of this question was that water deficit is not felt as a risk that threatens the sustainability of this resource collected data analysis shows that there are many reasons explaining farmers behavior these hypothetical reasons are summarized below the abstracted water is enough to meet farmers water needs whether for domestic or agricultural needs the case of the tragedy of the commons or the competition between neighbors to pump as much water is not existent in this field the impact of neighboring abstraction is not visible for farmers the study area is a flat ground and covered by the plio quaternary formation explaining the existence of shallow aquifer and the predominant of wells the easy access to groundwater with the average of 25 m below the surface level the absence of any idea or projection of groundwater evolution in the future for farmers the lack of information on groundwater abstraction impacts on water resources either groundwater or surface water and on other users of saiss aquifer actually all these factors have encouraged farmers to use groundwater resources in open access as a way to meet their water needs whether for domestic or agricultural purposes without any worry of overexploitation as long as water is available in quantity and quality easily accessible technically and economically and enough to meet water needs the risk of groundwater resources depletion or overexploitation does not arise in this area at least in the short term so the response of the question of overexploitation of common is it a common concern is simply no 3 2 need of information on groundwater is it the case for all the most widespread irrigation technique in the study area is surface irrigation only 10 of studied sample have adopted drip irrigation this number remains modest but does not automatically mean the ignorance of farmers regarding the importance of water saving irrigation techniques and their impact on water and nutrient use efficiency as well as maximizing crop productivity this is due to several reasons which two are major the first is the lack of financial resources and the inability of small farmers to mobilize subsidies provided by state to finance this technology the second is the existence of a large gap in terms of access to reliable and sufficient information to shift from traditional practices to sophisticated technologies water efficient and ensuring a better performance small farmers are dependent on climatic and environmental factors such as rainfall land water and so on basically it is more logical that this category of people needs to be informed on all these issues which have direct impact on their lives the amazing result of the analysis of the questionnaire shows that only 70 of farmers need information and especially on groundwater both in quantity and quality only 50 of them are illiterate the rest have been at least in the prime school women represent 35 of this proportion the question was why the proportion of 30 of farmers does not need to be aware and updated on beyond issues the response of this proportion of farmers was a little bit same for example mohamed all what we know from our parents is enough for us to have a good life and satisfy our needs aziz groundwater is largely enough for us and for our neighbors and our parents told us that this water is a grant from god and it will never decrease fatima the water in this well is guaranteed because of the baraka of the driller these three testimonies taken as examples indicate the existence of two different points of view explaining why some farmers do not feel the need of information especially on groundwater issues firstly groundwater abstracted and used is highly sufficient to satisfy their need on water secondly because of the faith that water is an eternal resource and its availability is assured by god and there is no risk to decrease or disappear one day and finally because groundwater is simply not visible and is in open access and the cost of pumping still supportable by farmers other reason is that some farmers thinks that baraka which could means a grant given by god to some drillers as cited also by fofack et al 2015 3 3 which information and communication on groundwater in saiss information and communication are two interrelated components pertinent information is communicated that enable people to carry out their responsibilities to support decisions and to coordinate activities for this study and as the questionnaire sheet annex nine responses have been proposed to farmers to choose the communication channels used or needed to exchange information on groundwater the survey sheet proposed three choices to farmers in terms of groundwater information type information on resource users and uses and nine choices for the types of communication channels dialogue with the authorities farmers meetings associations meetings neighbors relatives friends internet radio magazines other and nothing data analysis showed that the information accessed by farmers concerns mainly the resource such as the water depth on the other hand the majority of farmers have limited access to groundwater information the following figure is in the form of radar chart presenting the farmers choice in terms of communication channels used and requested fig 6 regarding the cc used collected data treatment shows that 15 out of 20 have confirmed that the exchange between neighbors relatives and friends is the most common cc used by farmers which represents almost 70 of responses as some farmers are members of associations 10 of farmers undertake meetings within under this legal framework meanwhile 20 of responses indicate that there is no communication at all around groundwater based on all these analyses we note that communication between farmers and authorities is almost inexistent on groundwater information exchange is taken in an informal and uncontrolled framework existent information on groundwater is almost unreliable this is due to the unreliable information sources magazines radio and internet are almost not used as communication channels to get information on groundwater concerning the cc needed or required by our sample of farmers 19 out of 20 farmers expressed their hope to undertake dialogue with authorities to obtain the reliable and consistent information on issues related to agriculture and water management farmers need also to meet and exchange with farmers and in the framework of associations meetings these two types of communication represent the proportion of 22 and 18 of the whole responses respectively the need to have information through radio represents only 5 comparing to get it through magazines which represents 15 of responses using internet to intercept information represents only 2 of responses only one farmer expressed the hope to consult information on groundwater via internet regarding the use of internet we got an amazing response from one farmer if i had the ability to work with internet i will do something else than agriculture it is important to note that only two farmers are members of two different associations they consider that these associations have not a great added value and are not efficient meetings are very rare and the information is not shared between all the analysis of these results shows that there is a huge inequality in accessing to reliable information on groundwater this inequality could be explained by various reasons such as the type of information is linked to the communication channel used if the source of information is not reliable automatically the question on the reliability of information is raised farmers organized in associations has more chance to access to reliable data and information highest the intellectual level of farmers is highest is the chance to contact authorities get and understand the information gotten in the study area communication around groundwater is very low and mainly informal some of farmers confirmed that there is no communication at all this finding might be explained more through a schematic developed based on different relationships between farmers either organized in associations or not with authorities as well as between themselves in this area fig 7 one of the main reasons explaining the communication weakness in this area is the mistrust in relationships between farmers themselves farmers and their leader in the framework of associations and between farmers and authorities actually this mistrust has been developed based on experiences over the time farmers requirements in terms of communication and exchange around groundwater is crucial meetings between farmers either in organized framework such as associations or informal ones are considered as an opportunity with a high importance for farmers to exchange information on different issues related to their daily life and to compare techniques adopted by different farmers to manage their lands such as irrigation techniques crops pumping techniques etc moreover the analysis of the cc required by farmers to have information on groundwater reveals the openness of farmers to other communication forms such as radio magazines and even internet 3 4 information need for groundwater resources a concrete case the quality of groundwater collected from the saiss aquifer in the cooperative area is generally qualified by farmers as good nevertheless the water extracted from certain boreholes is saline which caused to the owners many damages and push them to abandon them and not to irrigate their land the existence of a salt production unit in the area leads to questions about the origin of this saline water geological formations some link with the salt unit this scenario illustrates the imminent need of farmers for geographic information in relation to the groundwater simple information on the geology of the area would avoid farmers the considerable losses of money and efforts in the drilling of boreholes that later turn out to be non producible however geographic information systems for groundwater resources dedicated to farmers prove to be an excellent tool for information communication and even decision making for farmers and also for understanding of water resources issues in general and their interaction with the other elements of the environment 3 5 reliable information dissemination any alternative in favor of farmers commitment first alternative ngos as an intermediate between authorities and farmers the questionnaire used in the first field was designed to provide to farmers the opportunity to express their proposals and suggestions in terms of cc via the choice number 8 other actually this choice has led to think to a new cc to disseminate reliable information to this category of farmers which is characterized mainly by weak financial capacity and low intellectual level this new cc should take into account the common concern or constraint which is the mistrust in relationships basically the idea was born from interviews with some farmers this alternative consists on developing nongovernmental organizations ngos consisting of experts researchers or experienced individuals in the field of groundwater management these organizations would focus especially on small farmers the main objective of this kind of ngos is the enhancement of small farmers awareness the technical support the advice and guidance and eventually the preservation of groundwater resources they would have several activities such as i receiving and understanding the famers worries and requirements and transmit it to authorities ii strengthening their understanding and awareness regarding groundwater and related issues through the development of educational tools iii facilitating the organization of farmers via the creation of farmers associations it could be association of farmers using groundwater such as the existing associations of water users for agriculture iv facilitating communication and coordination in order to improve trust between farmers and authorities and play the role of the mediator v facilitating cooperation between farmers organizations for mutual benefit vi facilitating access to reliable data and information from different actors and information sources vii transferring of knowledge and mentoring viii organizing meetings trainings field trips to see other succeed experiences ix facilitating the commitment of farmers in the groundwater preservation especially in the signing of the gwc etc these ngos should make contact with farmers and gain their trust this alternative would have a huge impact on the change of farmers behavior regarding groundwater management and then their commitment to preserve this strategic resource and use it in a sustainable way these ngos would be as a facilitator and could be also the voice of this farmers category in any collaboration or arrangement national or international events to defend their rights and to transmit their positions regarding groundwater issues second alternative role of farmers associations in the information dissemination on groundwater in the second field of the agricultural cooperative sidi mimoun in the commune of ait bourzouine an interesting association was born this association called ait bourzouine association for rural development and composed of young farmers second and third generations of farmers is interested in rural development the main objective of this association is to promote their commune and to improve their living standards environmental and agricultural practices moreover the association is interested also in cultural social sports religious medical and cultural activities the idea of the creation of this association emerged from a group of young people of the cooperative sidi mimoun have been undertaken by a doctor installed in the region and who was elected president of the association the vice president of the association is called imad this young man is less than 30 years old who is the grandson of one of the members of the sidi mimoun cooperative has a remarkable intellectual level an ex accountant in a banking establishment and has preferred to devote himself entirely to the development of his commune imad is considered the leader and the beating heart of this association the association has therefore existed for 14 years and has undertaken several activities in different fields one of the most interesting activities is the electrification of the douar ait hassi ouali through the funding of the national initiative for human development nihd 2015 which is a program launched in 2005 by king mohammed vi of morocco with the aims to combat poverty precariousness and social exclusion through the implementation of basic infrastructure support projects training and capacity building projects social cultural and sporting activities and the promotion of income generating activities and employment 26 regarding the protection of the natural resources especially water resources the association has undertaken a very good initiative it was the cleaning of the bed of sidi maarouf stream by the proper own means of the association indeed this stream crossing the cooperative of sidi mimoun has been subjected to the clutter of branches debris and garbage thrown by the local residents which has led to the obstruction of the stream flow moreover and because of the lack of a landfill in the rural commune of ait bourzouine the association has thought of a solid waste management project this project was submitted this year for funding from the province of el hajeb under the title collection and sorting of waste in 2014 imad the vice president of the ait bourzouine association for rural development with a group of other young farmers members of the association of ait bourzouine has decided to create an agricultural cooperative untitled al fallah cooperative in order to cooperate and federate efforts for the economic and social development of farmers of ait bourzouine and to generate profits for its members this association is composed of 13 members and has a number of objectives such as cattle breeding milk production and marketing meat production and marketing collective marketing of cooperative products trainings in agricultural practices acquisition of agricultural products during the discussions with the president of the cooperative the issue of the overexploitation of groundwater resources has aroused great interest indeed the overexploitation of the groundwater at the level of the cooperative is not very felt and therefore does not figure in the priorities of the farmers nevertheless he believes that farmers awareness should be done in order to share information and to use this resource in appropriate way in response to a question that was asked about who should ensure this awareness imad affirmed with the phrase it is our role as much as association and cooperative to do it that the role of ngos and associations of farmers is with a great importance in this action but with the support of the state which is the source of reliable data and information the cooperative is an excellent project to undertake the agricultural and rural development of the commune and could be considered as a successful model of understanding and cooperation between young farmers who believe in sustainable rural development this work aims to show that in the absence or rather lack of information and communication around groundwater resources users are unresponsive to the issue of the overexploitation of a resource considered as strategic in countries with an arid and semi arid climate and quite vulnerable to climatic hazards such as drought this lack of interest due to the lack of awareness on this subject make farmers as main users of this resource unable to cooperate and commit in any agreement to its preservation the strength of this study is that farmers themselves ask to be accompanied and supported to self organize with the support of specialized ngos which could constitute intermediaries with the administrative authorities and provide them with reliable and useful information 4 conclusion the overexploitation of groundwater has become at the heart of debates undertaken by water community the principles and components of groundwater governance forms part of water governance in general however the groundwater characteristics and conditions deserve a specific attention to be adapted to the context the governance of this precious resource has experienced many forms over the time many countries worldwide tried to implement participatory governance through arrangements or contracts however they still face many difficulties such as in relation with stakeholders engagement information and communication are not only an instrument of supporting decision making at different levels of groundwater management but also one of the pillars of effective governance and play an important role in engaging stakeholders through the survey conducted in five counties in saiss plain in morocco with small farmers as potential groundwater users and which are rarely consulted to show how data information and communication could affect the decision making and commitment of this category of farmers to preserve groundwater the analysis of this first stage of fieldwork showed that the groundwater overexploitation is not a common concern of the sampled farmers this could be explained by the easy accessibility of the groundwater in this zone and mainly by the lack of both information and communication between them in one hand and with authorities in the other hand the results proved that farmers could not be engaged in any arrangement regarding groundwater in the absence of awareness and mentoring the analysis of a model of young farmers association was the subject of the second stage of the fieldwork this model proves that with trust and the will to develop and mainly the leadership even small farmers can cooperate and join forces in an organization that might ensure their socio economic development and the protection of their common and even private resources to enhance small farmers awareness the coordination and the cooperation between them and other stakeholders such as authorities and particularly to allay any fears or mistrust existing in different relationships between them the paper recommends and highlights the role which can play ngos specialized in groundwater issues or at least in environment protection in order to succeed in these missions it will be necessary for states to encourage such organizations and initiatives by providing them with the necessary legal framework and the technical and financial resources even if this category of farmers is vulnerable and highly linked to climate hazards it still representing a large group of groundwater users especially in mediterranean developing countries the agricultural development and the groundwater preservation could not be reached effectively without the engagement of the small farmers who could deeply influence the decisions and procedures through their contributions and sharing their experiences on the ground annex see table a1 
12347,water scarcity unequal water distribution and overexploitation make of groundwater a strategic resource to protect and preserve for future generations particularly in arid and semi arid regions groundwater governance faces many issues and challenges and many governance gaps exist almost everywhere around the world it has experienced many models and approaches worldwide over the past century in literature there are several research papers and reports talking about the importance of data and information in implementing effective governance nevertheless few are showing their impact on stakeholders engagement such as in the implementation of the groundwater engagements or contracts as a form of participatory governance this paper aims to show the impact of information trust in relationships and communication on the small farmers commitment in participatory governance this had been experimented in six rural communes in saiss plain in two steps the first step consisted on collecting and analyzing small farmers requirements on information and communication in five communes quite similar in characteristics through a survey in order to assess their ability to commit and cooperate under a participatory governance framework in developing mediterranean countries the second one consists on showing a concrete case of information need on groundwater found in another commune in saiss and the impact of the trust in relationships the good communication the will to develop the socio economic situation and the leadership through the case of a small group of young farmers associated in cooperative in the enhancement of the information dissemination and the farmers awareness regarding rural development and environment protection the study shows that there is a weakness in information transmission and communication around groundwater the paper recommends a new communication channel to give relevant information to farmers and to assist them to collaborate in

make of groundwater considered as being inexhaustible a strategic resource to protect and preserve for future generations particularly in arid and semi arid regions such for countries in mediterranean region brouma and scoullos 2008 escun 2007 undp 2015 during the global and international events in relation with environment water and climate change scientists continue to sound the alarm on ecological and socio economic risks that planet runs by continuing to exploit its natural resources in irrational and unsustainable way for socio economic reasons the seventeen goals of sustainable development as it was agreed by world leaders at the special summit of the united nations on sustainable development held in new york in september 2015 just continue the considerable progress made to achieve the millennium development goals in fact two goals are touching directly the issue of groundwater governance gwg in one hand the goal 6 is related to water and sanitation and is about to ensure by 2030 a universal and equitable access to safe water at an affordable cost protecting and restoring ecosystems related water undp 2015 one of this goal targets 6 b is focusing on the support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management undp 2015 the goal 12 is relating to the establishment of sustainable consumption and production patterns this goal aims to achieve economic growth and sustainable development through an efficient management of human shared natural resources according to many researches janssen 2013 oecd 2015a oecd 2015b ostrom 1990 this global willingness to change the trend of overexploitation and natural resources degradation including groundwater resources and deal with related challenges linked among others to social equity in terms of water supply in a sufficient quantity and acceptable quality as well as food security and sustainable development can only be achieved through the adoption of a new participatory governance model involving all stakeholders it might be also possible if a multitude of factors are available such as the existence of a regulatory institutional and organizational framework and stakeholders commitment as well as reliable and available information the committee of experts on public administration of economic and social council un had considered in 2007 the participatory governance as one of many institutional strategies of governance development the committee underlines that citizen participation in decision making is the result or the logical consequence of participatory governance policies and participation is not only a goal but also a fundamental value in itself different approaches and theories have been discussed around natural resources and especially groundwater as a common good over the last century before arriving to participatory governance advance these theories and approaches are joining both economic and social aspects in order to prevent groundwater over exploitation and address use conflicts two solutions have been proposed by economists the market and the state there are many researches in literature explaining these theories and thesis araral 2014 escun 2007 gordon 1954 hardin 1968 mansbridge 2014 olson 1965 1971 ostrom 1990 2005 petit 2002 early in 1954 gordon pointed out in his article the need for a single owner of the resource either public or private in 1968 and due to the increase of natural resources and population growth hardin indicated the urgency and the need to control the commons through privatization or government control through its well known theory the tragedy of the commons illustrated through the model of the shepherd and his flock twenty years after the publication of his paper hardin s theory became the heart of the global debate of environmental governance especially in the earth summit in rio in 1978 olson with his thesis under the name of the logic of collective action highlights the importance of the common interests of groups when he said whereas group interests were everything individual interests were nothing what mattered were the common interests of groups of people not the losses and gains to single individuals he also brings to light the relationship between group size and organizational behavior through economic analysis in his point of view small and large groups organizations are completely different small groups can act to advance their interests much more easily than large ones and need few resources to meet their common interests in addition to state and market there are a series of intermediate situations between them and even situations where different actors develop organization models to find solutions to avoid the tragedy of the commons petit 2002 that is what elinor ostrom proved in 1990 through her famous thesis under the name of governing the commons she analyzed the depletion of groundwater and tried to prove how individuals can commit themselves to cooperate and govern the commons without destroying it and without any state s assistance or pressure mansbridge 2014 at the same time she emphasized the role of institutions in providing information to users to make decisions for the auto governing of the cpr in order to investigate the capabilities of organizations for managing common pool resources cpr she looks at collectives from 50 to 15 000 people who share some vital cpr thirteen cases have been studied around the world which self governance for a long time can be considered a success but also failures and some are difficult to judge ostrom 1990 further in 2011 ostrom highlights that there is no magic formula to govern the commons and each common can be considered as a niche on an empirical ground she also emphasized in 2005 that the extent of cooperation in commons governance is a function of two fundamental variables trust and reciprocity among stakeholders araral 2014 and highlights the key role that communication plays in community engagement by helping to build the social capital necessary to bring groups and individuals together willis 2012 in spite of the evolution of theories and worldwide efforts on setting up some governance tools and institutional arrangements to manage groundwater resources in a sustainable way this resource remains difficult to manage because of numerous deficiencies and lacks which are varying depending on the country context these deficiencies could be related to information and knowledge legal frameworks and their application country strategies policies and plans and stakeholders engagement unesco et al 2015 studies of commons have shown during the last 40 years an incredible variety of institutions governing commons exploitation and management over the world berge and van laerhoven 2011 successful arrangements were seen mainly in developed countries such as united states of america australia japan swiss and spain which have the favorable scientific and institutional framework to implement the participatory governance ostrom 1990 shah 2014 in 2015 oecd considered in its report on water governance that water governance is based on 3 principles effectiveness efficiency and trust and engagement fig 1 due to its intrinsic characteristics and its dependence to multi level governance stakeholders engagement and commitment in the early stages of decision making affect strongly and directly the success of institutional arrangement for gwg or as it called groundwater agreement or groundwater contract this is summarized perfectly by the ostrom phrase decisions made in collective choice situations directly affect operational situations decisions made in constitutional choice situations indirectly affect operational situations by creating and limiting the powers that can be exercised within collective choice arrangements creating legislative and judicial bodies protecting rights of free speech and property etc ostrom 1990 data and information are not only an instrument of supporting decision making at different levels of groundwater management but also one of the pillars of effective governance and play an important role in engaging stakeholders berge 2011 many developed countries understood the impact of sharing information with public on the governance of the commons such as usa korea and australia etc to overcome the lack of information they implemented online services providing public access to sufficient data and relevant information on the cpr s state uses and their development as well as a platform in order to push farmers to communicate widely in recent years farmers in uk had used internet as source of information significant bang has known websites with agricultural vocation dedicated to sharing information and advice such as the website www fwi co uk in order to communicate more simply and for who don t have computer or adequate broadband farming organizations have chosen to communicate with farmers through short messages or smart phones applications as well as in netherlands the agricultural website http www boerderij nl had known an exceptional success stocks 2011 in morocco some existing websites and magazines are devoted to agricultural issues but none is specialized or at least taking into account regularly groundwater issues these communication channels cc are mainly dedicated to big farmers with a certain level of education and awareness and with access to internet in the last two decades more than 90 countries have legislated to guarantee the widest public access to data available from public services and to develop information of general interest canavaggio and balafrej 2011 janssen 2013 new technologies have been used extensively to improve the collection organization and data storage to facilitate their dissemination and to reduce management costs by administrations and their use by citizens moreover state plays a considerable role as a facilitator through the implementation of the institutional framework which can foster stakeholders exchange of data information and experiences and several decision making bottom up mansbridge 2014 popular participation in decision making processes has many implications not only on efficiency and sustainable use of cpr but also on economic development human rights equity and social justice democracy social capital and decentralized governance berge and van laerhoven 2011 emerging literature draws attention to the failure of gwg arrangements especially in developing countries including those in the mediterranean region berge and van laerhoven 2011 cmi et al 2014 janssen 2013 plan bleu et al 2012 some of the success constraints are linked to users participation in 2008 brouma and scoullos think that the various stages of the evolution of the participation process are attained along a growing curve closely linked to the expansion and deepening of democratization the education and public awareness of environmental development and cultural issues according to them the constraints that hinder the progress of participatory processes in the mediterranean region can be summarized as a deficient or inadequate legal and institutional framework to support public participation weak administrative infrastructure and limited resources to meet the public demand the lack of coordination between different administrative sectors and public agencies segmentation of ngos and civil society initiatives the unwillingness of the authorities to provide information to the public even if it is feasible technically and legally mainly due to poor recognition or acceptance in the practice of groups of civil society and ngos as legitimate partners in decision making the physical invisibility of groundwater systems makes it harder to handle the issues of overexploitation and related risks and then to participate in monitoring however the impact of climate change felt by communities in arid and semi arid regions through the decrease of rainfalls over the last decades might change groundwater users attitudes awareness and their ability to cooperate this cooperation could not be effective without an open and equitable users access to relevant information and knowledge information level about the actions of other users affects the level of cooperation janssen 2013 in order to understand aquifer behavior and trends information should be on groundwater resource characteristics uses and users berge and van laerhoven 2011 cmi et al 2014 plan bleu et al 2012 in morocco access of groundwater users especially farmers to reliable information on groundwater remains very restricted this access is limited to particular cases where the farmer needs some information during the process of the application for authorization in order to dig wells or boreholes or simply through the advice of a well known digger or agricultural inputs and equipment seller in this case an important question arises in regard to the quality of the received information and thus its impact on farmers decisions on choosing the location of the wells or boreholes the type of pumps installations and the irrigation system as well as the crops the right of access to information is one of the fundamental rights and freedoms enunciated by the sherif dahir n 1 11 91 of july 29 2011 promulgating the text of the constitution constitution of morocco 2011 especially in article 27 which provides that citizens have the right to access information held by the public administration elected bodies and bodies entrusted with a public service mission the right to information may be limited only by law for the protection of all matters relating to national defense the internal and external security of the state and the privacy of persons and with the aim to preventing the infringement of the rights and freedoms set forth in this constitution and to protect sources and areas expressly determined by law the consecration of this right confirms the continuing commitment of morocco to human rights as recognized internationally as well as its commitment to respect the provisions of article 19 of the universal declaration of human rights article 19 of the international covenant on civil and political rights and article 10 of the united nations convention against corruption which obliged public administrations to facilitate access to information by citizens via the implementation of all measures enabling them to exercise this right with a view to enhancing transparency and embedding the culture of good governance to implement the provisions of this article a draft law no 31 13 on the right of access to information was undertaken by the ministry in charge of public service and the modernization of the administration in 2013 and which was approved by the government and submitted to parliament the overview of this draft law notes that it has been proved that the provision of sufficient information contributes to embedding participatory democracy and encouraging citizens to participate in monitoring the work of the administration as well as in decision making this draft law defines information as data which could be expressed in numbers letters drawings or images in paper or electronic format in morocco the debate of participatory governance through groundwater contract gwc has begun actually ten years ago at the national water debate in 2006 the experience with this type of arrangements has started after the enactment of water law n 10 95 in 1995 in 2006 the first gwc was made in souss massa draa river basin in the southwest of the country this agreement which objective was the preservation and development of water resources in this region has been elaborated between 24 institutions representing public institutions and relevant ministries local authorities and representatives of farmers cmi et al 2014 unfortunately this experience has failed for several reasons these reasons can be summarized in some points linked to the lack of the adequate financial and regulatory framework to implement the contents of the contract the constraints of the water points regularization and users engagement cmi et al 2014 water policy in morocco places a considerable priority on protecting and preserving groundwater as a strategic resource for this end a list of priority aquifers was made with a roadmap for the implementation of their gwc by 2030 from now on these gwcs have been mastered under the legal framework of the new water law n 36 15 promulgated in 2016 among the general principles of this law are four important points related to the management and conservation of groundwater resources water and public water management in general in accordance with the rules of good governance by involving administrations local authorities operators concerned and representatives of different water users at national regional and local levels integrated participatory and decentralized water management taking into account the principle of equity and spatial solidarity protection of the aquatic environment and promotion of the sustainable development of water resources integration of adaptation to climate change at all levels in water planning and management the law also defined three distinct notions in relation to water management namely sustainable water management management that meets the needs of the present without compromising or affecting the right of future generations to meet their own needs integrated water management management based on a holistic a systematic transversal and intersectoral approach considering in an integrated manner the environmental social economic and technical aspects in the formulation and implementation of policies strategies plans and programs in the field of water participatory water management management consisting in decisions making on water development management use and preservation based on consultation and in partnership with relevant stakeholders including users the law has devoted a whole section section 4 to the preservation of groundwater in chapter x this section includes 3 sub sections which are respectively perimeters of safeguard and prohibition perimeters drilling conditions and participatory management contract the last one entitles the river basin agencies to establish participatory management contracts for the groundwater and for the portions of groundwater in agreement with the concerned partners and users of water or the public hydraulic domain with a view to ensure the sustainable use and preservation of water the public hydraulic domain and the aquatic environment the law also specifies the content of a participatory management contract in particular the action plan its objectives the duration the terms of its financing the rights and duties of users river basin agencies administration and the various partners concerned the contract also defines the rules and framework for the participation of users in the management and control of water use nevertheless the terms and conditions for the elaboration of participatory management contract will be subject to implementing legislation in addition and in terms of water users access to information the water law specifies in its chapter xi relating on the water information system that the administration and the river basin agency should make available to stakeholders and the general public relevant information in relation with water in this context and taking into account all these stipulations of the law particularly in relation to good governance participatory water management and information sharing with users and the public the aim of this paper is to show with field experiment how information sharing dialogue interactive communication and trust in relationships could contribute to strengthening stakeholders ownership of participatory groundwater governance pgwg this work consists actually to make a diagnosis of how small farmers have access of which information on groundwater and which information and communication channels are required and would be more useful for this population and also to highlight the difficulties encountered by this category of farmers in access and use of information to contribute to groundwater management analyzing information needs is an essential and necessary step for the development of an information system that could become a tool for management and decision support this diagnosis has been made through a survey with small farmers in the plain of saiss which holds an important aquifer in sebou river basin one of the important basins in morocco this paper would enrich the knowledge of communication channels forms used and relevant information required by small farmers rarely consulted to be able to commit and cooperate in order to fill the existing gap in this field and succeed pgwg in countries having similar context and conditions as morocco especially developing mediterranean countries 2 materials and methods the experiment consisted on holding a dialogue with farmers in saiss plain to understand their needs in terms of information and communication channels forms to access to reliable information on groundwater as well as other issues related to their socio economic development to exchange experiences between them and mainly to be aware of groundwater challenges in their area in order to cooperate with other actors such as authorities and other potential users to implement an agreement or simply the saiss gwc 2 1 study area the study area is the saiss plain commonly known as the plain of fez meknes which covers the center of the sebou river basin in morocco and bordered to the north by the prerif mountains and to the south by the atlas area it s located in a semi arid bioclimatic stage with a temperate winter the average annual precipitation is about 455 mm at fez station and 550 mm at meknes station this important plain of an area of 2100 square kilometers is characterized by an aquifer system composed of two superimposed aquifers confined and unconfined one these aquifers play an important role in socio economic development of its region through the supply of drinking water of fez and meknes cities and satisfying irrigation demand of more than 45 000 ha rda 2014 irrigation in saiss plain is made mainly through three methods of irrigation surface sprinkler and localized drip irrigation was introduced in the 1980 s and today over 36 of areas is equipped with drip irrigation facilities dominant speculations in the plain are annual crops and arboriculture actually this area is very famous in agriculture at national level through its production of fruits and vegetables especially onion and potatoes due to the combined effects of the decrease of rainfalls since the 1980 s which has reduced the natural recharge of groundwater and increased groundwater pumping for irrigation saiss aquifers suffer from overexploitation and the groundwater level continues to decline the groundwater balance established in the framework of the master plan of integrated water resources development of sebou showed an annual deficit of 100 million cubic meters rbas 2006 2009 the drawdown of groundwater level has affected the flow of many rivers and springs in the plain the surveys were carried out in 6 rural communes of the saiss plain in two stages in two different fields the first stage was carried out in april 2016 and consisted of interviews with farmers in five rural communes of the saiss plain sbaa ayoun sidi slimane moul kifane majjate ait yaazem and jahjouh as shown in fig 2 these five communes are all in the western side of the plain with a rather flat geomorphology the second stage was carried out in june 2016 in the commune of ait bourzouine in the province of el hajeb close to the 1st area fig 3 this stage consisted of conducting interviews with a young farmer who is also the vice president of a socio cultural association and the founder of a new agricultural cooperative in the heart of an older agricultural cooperative sidi mimoun as a result of the policy of the agrarian reform in the 1970 s the cooperative sidi mimoun is crossed by the river ain maarouf which is a tributary of the river boufekrane fig 4 this river comes from an upstream source with the same name regarding groundwater resources mobilization the number of water points in the whole commune of ait bourzouine is like 87 which 52 are boreholes with an average depth of 100 m below ground level 2 2 methodology 2 2 1 first stage of the experiment the methodology of this first stage consisted of conducting interviews with farmers in the plain of saiss on which types of information they have access on groundwater and different channels of communication used for this and also which information and cc they need to reinforce their awareness on groundwater issues and challenges in their area the purpose of this phase is to assess their capacities to commit to managing and using groundwater resources in a sustainable manner especially in participatory management framework sampling of farmers is done with a multi criteria and multi stage approach as shown in the diagram below the idea is to select from saiss plain which is the first stage five rural communes they have almost the same characteristics such as the predominance of wells some boreholes and well bores are found in the commune of mejjate fig 5 all of them have almost the same cropping patterns and they irrigate from a shallow aquifer the depth of the shallow aquifer is varying from 1 to 60 m bellow surface level with an average of 25 m data on piezometric measure were made in 2005 in the framework of the water points inventory led by rbas and used in the preparation of the master plan of integrated water resource development of sebou river basin from these areas the target group is farmers which have specific criteria this third stage consists on choosing small farmers with lands area varying from 0 to 10 ha and having as a minimum one well in fact this type of farmers is almost not consulted or at least not enough especially if they are not organized in associations neither in the preparation of regulation and rules in general nor if it s for agricultural issues or others some farmers in the saiss plain are organized via agriculture associations but in the opinion of farmers consulted many of them did not work or have difficulties to deal with age and gender distinction man and women at different ages were interviewed from 30 farmers randomly selected and having all criteria only 20 were finally chosen 4 farmers from each commune regarding the representativeness of the sample twenty farmers is considered representative of the target category of farmers chosen primly based on the criteria presented before in the methodology like to be small farmer with a maximum of 20 ha as a surface area and abstracting groundwater at least from one water point in five quite similar communes response rate approximates 60 regarding the number of complete and usable responses in order to carry out the investigations a survey form has been prepared on the basis of a number of assumptions such as groundwater over exploitation is a common concern of farmers farmers need information and communication on topics related to groundwater as a single water source in the study area communication with its different types of channels plays an important role in the governance of a common resource as groundwater farmers are organized into associations and local governance entities farmers exchange around groundwater issues the idea was to see towards this survey if these hypotheses are true hence several issues and questions have been raised in the questionnaire annex for instance personal data of farmers these data are with a high importance and reflects the difference of responses relying on age sex education level and belong to any association or entity data on land water data on land and groundwater resources accessed by farmers are of the prime importance as well because of the information offered in terms of surface area type of irrigation number of water points used with their different characteristics such as water depth and authorizations data on information it s important to know the type of information already available for farmers and their needs in terms of information to commit and to be engaged in groundwater agreement if yes which kind of information is required data on communication channels without communication channels information could not be disseminated and arrived to target population farmers it s necessary to know which already exist and which are needed it was important to give farmers the opportunity to add more details in addition to what it was included in the sheet and to express difficulties encountered in receiving information and to give any proposal to deal with this issue in order to analyze data collected from the survey a number was given for each category of data data collected was then selected treated and organized in relational database 2 2 2 second stage of the experiment this second stage aims to show how farmers associations when a climate of trust is established between the members and their president can play a central role in strengthening access to information and improving of communication in rural areas a successful association of young farmers is taken as a model this sociocultural association which gave birth to a young agricultural cooperative in the heart of an older agricultural cooperative resulting from the policy of the agrarian reform in the 1970 s at the beginning the cooperative had about 20 farmers each one has access and was able to benefit from a farm land of about ten hectares in average to cultivate and a house of about 1000 m2 the area of the land granted to the cooperative members varied according to the characteristics of the land more the land has bad characteristics more the larger the area is since its inception the cooperative equipped itself with collective agricultural equipment to help members meeting the challenge and succeed in productive agriculture according to one of the member farmers among the few who are still alive the cooperative has experienced many difficulties and above all a great failure according to this farmer the major reason was the establishment of a climate of non confidence between the members and the president of the cooperative and the non transparent management of the common property of the cooperative following this observation the members preferred to dissolve the cooperative to share common goods and thus to move from a cooperation work to individualism we have described the evolution of this association into a cooperative analyzed the secrets of the success of this initiative and above all how this association has an important role in preserving the water resources of the commune of ait bourzouine and informing farmers on many issues related to agriculture interviews were held with the president of the agricultural cooperative who showed great interest in the cause of this work and volunteered to answer the various questions 3 results and discussions 3 1 overexploitation of common is it a common concern coming out on the field i was expecting finding that the issue of saiss groundwater overexploitation and all associated risks are felt toughly by farmers and that this represents a common concern actually all farmers are aware that water resources are threatened by a continuing decrease of rainfalls nevertheless the majority do not feel the danger of a possible drying up of the groundwater of saiss especially in the short run rainfall in the study area for these 3 years have allowed maintaining a water level quite satisfactory especially in wells and accessible for farmers to understand farmers behavior in terms of groundwater management it was necessary to know if water shortage is felt and this is considered as a common worry for farmers the amazing and common response of this question was that water deficit is not felt as a risk that threatens the sustainability of this resource collected data analysis shows that there are many reasons explaining farmers behavior these hypothetical reasons are summarized below the abstracted water is enough to meet farmers water needs whether for domestic or agricultural needs the case of the tragedy of the commons or the competition between neighbors to pump as much water is not existent in this field the impact of neighboring abstraction is not visible for farmers the study area is a flat ground and covered by the plio quaternary formation explaining the existence of shallow aquifer and the predominant of wells the easy access to groundwater with the average of 25 m below the surface level the absence of any idea or projection of groundwater evolution in the future for farmers the lack of information on groundwater abstraction impacts on water resources either groundwater or surface water and on other users of saiss aquifer actually all these factors have encouraged farmers to use groundwater resources in open access as a way to meet their water needs whether for domestic or agricultural purposes without any worry of overexploitation as long as water is available in quantity and quality easily accessible technically and economically and enough to meet water needs the risk of groundwater resources depletion or overexploitation does not arise in this area at least in the short term so the response of the question of overexploitation of common is it a common concern is simply no 3 2 need of information on groundwater is it the case for all the most widespread irrigation technique in the study area is surface irrigation only 10 of studied sample have adopted drip irrigation this number remains modest but does not automatically mean the ignorance of farmers regarding the importance of water saving irrigation techniques and their impact on water and nutrient use efficiency as well as maximizing crop productivity this is due to several reasons which two are major the first is the lack of financial resources and the inability of small farmers to mobilize subsidies provided by state to finance this technology the second is the existence of a large gap in terms of access to reliable and sufficient information to shift from traditional practices to sophisticated technologies water efficient and ensuring a better performance small farmers are dependent on climatic and environmental factors such as rainfall land water and so on basically it is more logical that this category of people needs to be informed on all these issues which have direct impact on their lives the amazing result of the analysis of the questionnaire shows that only 70 of farmers need information and especially on groundwater both in quantity and quality only 50 of them are illiterate the rest have been at least in the prime school women represent 35 of this proportion the question was why the proportion of 30 of farmers does not need to be aware and updated on beyond issues the response of this proportion of farmers was a little bit same for example mohamed all what we know from our parents is enough for us to have a good life and satisfy our needs aziz groundwater is largely enough for us and for our neighbors and our parents told us that this water is a grant from god and it will never decrease fatima the water in this well is guaranteed because of the baraka of the driller these three testimonies taken as examples indicate the existence of two different points of view explaining why some farmers do not feel the need of information especially on groundwater issues firstly groundwater abstracted and used is highly sufficient to satisfy their need on water secondly because of the faith that water is an eternal resource and its availability is assured by god and there is no risk to decrease or disappear one day and finally because groundwater is simply not visible and is in open access and the cost of pumping still supportable by farmers other reason is that some farmers thinks that baraka which could means a grant given by god to some drillers as cited also by fofack et al 2015 3 3 which information and communication on groundwater in saiss information and communication are two interrelated components pertinent information is communicated that enable people to carry out their responsibilities to support decisions and to coordinate activities for this study and as the questionnaire sheet annex nine responses have been proposed to farmers to choose the communication channels used or needed to exchange information on groundwater the survey sheet proposed three choices to farmers in terms of groundwater information type information on resource users and uses and nine choices for the types of communication channels dialogue with the authorities farmers meetings associations meetings neighbors relatives friends internet radio magazines other and nothing data analysis showed that the information accessed by farmers concerns mainly the resource such as the water depth on the other hand the majority of farmers have limited access to groundwater information the following figure is in the form of radar chart presenting the farmers choice in terms of communication channels used and requested fig 6 regarding the cc used collected data treatment shows that 15 out of 20 have confirmed that the exchange between neighbors relatives and friends is the most common cc used by farmers which represents almost 70 of responses as some farmers are members of associations 10 of farmers undertake meetings within under this legal framework meanwhile 20 of responses indicate that there is no communication at all around groundwater based on all these analyses we note that communication between farmers and authorities is almost inexistent on groundwater information exchange is taken in an informal and uncontrolled framework existent information on groundwater is almost unreliable this is due to the unreliable information sources magazines radio and internet are almost not used as communication channels to get information on groundwater concerning the cc needed or required by our sample of farmers 19 out of 20 farmers expressed their hope to undertake dialogue with authorities to obtain the reliable and consistent information on issues related to agriculture and water management farmers need also to meet and exchange with farmers and in the framework of associations meetings these two types of communication represent the proportion of 22 and 18 of the whole responses respectively the need to have information through radio represents only 5 comparing to get it through magazines which represents 15 of responses using internet to intercept information represents only 2 of responses only one farmer expressed the hope to consult information on groundwater via internet regarding the use of internet we got an amazing response from one farmer if i had the ability to work with internet i will do something else than agriculture it is important to note that only two farmers are members of two different associations they consider that these associations have not a great added value and are not efficient meetings are very rare and the information is not shared between all the analysis of these results shows that there is a huge inequality in accessing to reliable information on groundwater this inequality could be explained by various reasons such as the type of information is linked to the communication channel used if the source of information is not reliable automatically the question on the reliability of information is raised farmers organized in associations has more chance to access to reliable data and information highest the intellectual level of farmers is highest is the chance to contact authorities get and understand the information gotten in the study area communication around groundwater is very low and mainly informal some of farmers confirmed that there is no communication at all this finding might be explained more through a schematic developed based on different relationships between farmers either organized in associations or not with authorities as well as between themselves in this area fig 7 one of the main reasons explaining the communication weakness in this area is the mistrust in relationships between farmers themselves farmers and their leader in the framework of associations and between farmers and authorities actually this mistrust has been developed based on experiences over the time farmers requirements in terms of communication and exchange around groundwater is crucial meetings between farmers either in organized framework such as associations or informal ones are considered as an opportunity with a high importance for farmers to exchange information on different issues related to their daily life and to compare techniques adopted by different farmers to manage their lands such as irrigation techniques crops pumping techniques etc moreover the analysis of the cc required by farmers to have information on groundwater reveals the openness of farmers to other communication forms such as radio magazines and even internet 3 4 information need for groundwater resources a concrete case the quality of groundwater collected from the saiss aquifer in the cooperative area is generally qualified by farmers as good nevertheless the water extracted from certain boreholes is saline which caused to the owners many damages and push them to abandon them and not to irrigate their land the existence of a salt production unit in the area leads to questions about the origin of this saline water geological formations some link with the salt unit this scenario illustrates the imminent need of farmers for geographic information in relation to the groundwater simple information on the geology of the area would avoid farmers the considerable losses of money and efforts in the drilling of boreholes that later turn out to be non producible however geographic information systems for groundwater resources dedicated to farmers prove to be an excellent tool for information communication and even decision making for farmers and also for understanding of water resources issues in general and their interaction with the other elements of the environment 3 5 reliable information dissemination any alternative in favor of farmers commitment first alternative ngos as an intermediate between authorities and farmers the questionnaire used in the first field was designed to provide to farmers the opportunity to express their proposals and suggestions in terms of cc via the choice number 8 other actually this choice has led to think to a new cc to disseminate reliable information to this category of farmers which is characterized mainly by weak financial capacity and low intellectual level this new cc should take into account the common concern or constraint which is the mistrust in relationships basically the idea was born from interviews with some farmers this alternative consists on developing nongovernmental organizations ngos consisting of experts researchers or experienced individuals in the field of groundwater management these organizations would focus especially on small farmers the main objective of this kind of ngos is the enhancement of small farmers awareness the technical support the advice and guidance and eventually the preservation of groundwater resources they would have several activities such as i receiving and understanding the famers worries and requirements and transmit it to authorities ii strengthening their understanding and awareness regarding groundwater and related issues through the development of educational tools iii facilitating the organization of farmers via the creation of farmers associations it could be association of farmers using groundwater such as the existing associations of water users for agriculture iv facilitating communication and coordination in order to improve trust between farmers and authorities and play the role of the mediator v facilitating cooperation between farmers organizations for mutual benefit vi facilitating access to reliable data and information from different actors and information sources vii transferring of knowledge and mentoring viii organizing meetings trainings field trips to see other succeed experiences ix facilitating the commitment of farmers in the groundwater preservation especially in the signing of the gwc etc these ngos should make contact with farmers and gain their trust this alternative would have a huge impact on the change of farmers behavior regarding groundwater management and then their commitment to preserve this strategic resource and use it in a sustainable way these ngos would be as a facilitator and could be also the voice of this farmers category in any collaboration or arrangement national or international events to defend their rights and to transmit their positions regarding groundwater issues second alternative role of farmers associations in the information dissemination on groundwater in the second field of the agricultural cooperative sidi mimoun in the commune of ait bourzouine an interesting association was born this association called ait bourzouine association for rural development and composed of young farmers second and third generations of farmers is interested in rural development the main objective of this association is to promote their commune and to improve their living standards environmental and agricultural practices moreover the association is interested also in cultural social sports religious medical and cultural activities the idea of the creation of this association emerged from a group of young people of the cooperative sidi mimoun have been undertaken by a doctor installed in the region and who was elected president of the association the vice president of the association is called imad this young man is less than 30 years old who is the grandson of one of the members of the sidi mimoun cooperative has a remarkable intellectual level an ex accountant in a banking establishment and has preferred to devote himself entirely to the development of his commune imad is considered the leader and the beating heart of this association the association has therefore existed for 14 years and has undertaken several activities in different fields one of the most interesting activities is the electrification of the douar ait hassi ouali through the funding of the national initiative for human development nihd 2015 which is a program launched in 2005 by king mohammed vi of morocco with the aims to combat poverty precariousness and social exclusion through the implementation of basic infrastructure support projects training and capacity building projects social cultural and sporting activities and the promotion of income generating activities and employment 26 regarding the protection of the natural resources especially water resources the association has undertaken a very good initiative it was the cleaning of the bed of sidi maarouf stream by the proper own means of the association indeed this stream crossing the cooperative of sidi mimoun has been subjected to the clutter of branches debris and garbage thrown by the local residents which has led to the obstruction of the stream flow moreover and because of the lack of a landfill in the rural commune of ait bourzouine the association has thought of a solid waste management project this project was submitted this year for funding from the province of el hajeb under the title collection and sorting of waste in 2014 imad the vice president of the ait bourzouine association for rural development with a group of other young farmers members of the association of ait bourzouine has decided to create an agricultural cooperative untitled al fallah cooperative in order to cooperate and federate efforts for the economic and social development of farmers of ait bourzouine and to generate profits for its members this association is composed of 13 members and has a number of objectives such as cattle breeding milk production and marketing meat production and marketing collective marketing of cooperative products trainings in agricultural practices acquisition of agricultural products during the discussions with the president of the cooperative the issue of the overexploitation of groundwater resources has aroused great interest indeed the overexploitation of the groundwater at the level of the cooperative is not very felt and therefore does not figure in the priorities of the farmers nevertheless he believes that farmers awareness should be done in order to share information and to use this resource in appropriate way in response to a question that was asked about who should ensure this awareness imad affirmed with the phrase it is our role as much as association and cooperative to do it that the role of ngos and associations of farmers is with a great importance in this action but with the support of the state which is the source of reliable data and information the cooperative is an excellent project to undertake the agricultural and rural development of the commune and could be considered as a successful model of understanding and cooperation between young farmers who believe in sustainable rural development this work aims to show that in the absence or rather lack of information and communication around groundwater resources users are unresponsive to the issue of the overexploitation of a resource considered as strategic in countries with an arid and semi arid climate and quite vulnerable to climatic hazards such as drought this lack of interest due to the lack of awareness on this subject make farmers as main users of this resource unable to cooperate and commit in any agreement to its preservation the strength of this study is that farmers themselves ask to be accompanied and supported to self organize with the support of specialized ngos which could constitute intermediaries with the administrative authorities and provide them with reliable and useful information 4 conclusion the overexploitation of groundwater has become at the heart of debates undertaken by water community the principles and components of groundwater governance forms part of water governance in general however the groundwater characteristics and conditions deserve a specific attention to be adapted to the context the governance of this precious resource has experienced many forms over the time many countries worldwide tried to implement participatory governance through arrangements or contracts however they still face many difficulties such as in relation with stakeholders engagement information and communication are not only an instrument of supporting decision making at different levels of groundwater management but also one of the pillars of effective governance and play an important role in engaging stakeholders through the survey conducted in five counties in saiss plain in morocco with small farmers as potential groundwater users and which are rarely consulted to show how data information and communication could affect the decision making and commitment of this category of farmers to preserve groundwater the analysis of this first stage of fieldwork showed that the groundwater overexploitation is not a common concern of the sampled farmers this could be explained by the easy accessibility of the groundwater in this zone and mainly by the lack of both information and communication between them in one hand and with authorities in the other hand the results proved that farmers could not be engaged in any arrangement regarding groundwater in the absence of awareness and mentoring the analysis of a model of young farmers association was the subject of the second stage of the fieldwork this model proves that with trust and the will to develop and mainly the leadership even small farmers can cooperate and join forces in an organization that might ensure their socio economic development and the protection of their common and even private resources to enhance small farmers awareness the coordination and the cooperation between them and other stakeholders such as authorities and particularly to allay any fears or mistrust existing in different relationships between them the paper recommends and highlights the role which can play ngos specialized in groundwater issues or at least in environment protection in order to succeed in these missions it will be necessary for states to encourage such organizations and initiatives by providing them with the necessary legal framework and the technical and financial resources even if this category of farmers is vulnerable and highly linked to climate hazards it still representing a large group of groundwater users especially in mediterranean developing countries the agricultural development and the groundwater preservation could not be reached effectively without the engagement of the small farmers who could deeply influence the decisions and procedures through their contributions and sharing their experiences on the ground annex see table a1 
12348,hydrochemical data of groundwater samples collected from thirty five wells in alluvial aquifer of el milia were examined using self organizing map som approach based on visualization of som analysis and hydrochemical characteristics groundwater samples were clustered into three clusters which revealed three basic representative water types freshwater cluster 1 moderate salinity cluster 2 and high salinity cluster 3 based on ionic ratio the source of soluble ions in the groundwater of the freshwater types was found to be the carbonate rock dissolution while evaporation and evapotranspiration were found to be the main factors affecting the chemistry of the groundwater characterized by the moderate and high salinity types respectively this study shows that the som approach can be successfully used to classify and characterize the groundwater in terms of quality graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater self organizing maps quality index ionic ratio drinking water irrigation water 1 introduction water quality below the surface displays the all processes and reactions that affect on the water from the moment it condenses in the atmosphere to the time it is abstracted from the wells arumugam and elangovan 2009 dissolution precipitation weathering ion exchange and various biological processes are main factors which influence water chemistry below the surface however in recent decades contaminations by domestic agricultural and industrial activities are serious problems which threated groundwater quality especially in developing countries groundwater quality assessment is gaining importance due to intense urbanization industrialization and agricultural activities putting the soil and groundwater to greater risk of contamination ackah et al 2011 sayyed and wagh 2011 belkhiri et al 2011 carol et al 2013 brindha et al 2017 generally monitoring groundwater quality develops large number of samples including chemical and physical parameters which large and high dimensional datasets because of the variety of variables observed as groundwater quality data and uncertainty involved in transport and reaction mechanism into groundwater systems it is necessary to implement a sophisticated knowledge extraction and diagnosis tool that can provide the analysis and visualization of multidimensional groundwater quality data srivastava and ramanathan 2008 hydrochemical study is a useful method to identify the mechanism controlling groundwater quality in a region rajesh et al 2012 however modelling of hydrochemical processes and assessing groundwater quality in high dimensional and long term datasets are complicated extraction of efficient information from the large monitoring datasets can play an important role to reduce high dimensional data into a lower dimension space with minimum loss of information choi et al 2014 which can reveal unknown patterns in complex hydrochemical data although many researchers principal component analysis pca as a classical approach for linear dimensionality reduction to reveal relationships between variables jeevanandam et al 2007 belkhiri and narany 2015 the results of method is sometime difficult to interpreted due to complexity and non linearity of large dataset recently some data driven approaches such as the projection pursuit technique and neural networks have been applied to groundwater quality assessment due to the rapid innovation of computer technology the artificial neural network technique particularly self organizing maps som has recently attracted considerable attention in analysis and diagnosis of dynamic systems the self organizing map som is introduced by kohonen et al 1984 as an unsupervised neural network algorithm which is capable of clustering classification prediction and data mining in large datasets kohonen and somervuo 2002 kalteh et al 2008 generally som is used in medical chemical biological and financial research there are limited studies have used som algorithm in water resources assessment peeters and dassargues 2006 compared pca a traditional multivariate statistical method to the som algorithm approach on groundwater chemistry data in central belgium the results revealed that although pca can quantify the mount of variance explained by each component som able to visualize the entire dataset in terms of the original variables and can detect non linear relationship between variables this study attempted to apply som for investigation of the spatial hydrochemical characteristic of the alluvial aquifer in el milia plain algeria to assess the quality of groundwater for drinking and agricultural purposes the paper is organized into four sections the first section introduces the general background and ideas used in this study the second section describes the study area the third section describes the methodology and focuses on the hydrochemical datasets used in this study how to som approach can be classified the hydrochemical groundwater data and hydrochemical assessment the final section summarizes the results and gives conclusions regarding the groundwater system in the area 2 study area el mila plain is located at the northeast of the province of jijel algeria the study area is situated at a few kilometers from the mediterranean sea and between eastern longitude of 6 10 6 20 e and northern latitude of 36 40 36 47 n fig 1 it is characterized by low to moderate topography and with an average altitude of 35 m this area is considered as the wettest regions of algeria with a hydrographic network converges to oued el kebir and its stream on the right bank oued bou siaba the study area is characterized by a sub humid mediterranean climate in september dry in may very dry during summer and wet from october until april the average annual of precipitation and temperature is 930 mm and 17 c respectively the evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration in this region are 536 mm 58 357 mm 38 and 37 mm 4 respectively the agricultural deficit is estimated at 331 mm and distributed from june to september nuibat and belkhiri 2015 groundwater resources in the study area were very important sources of water the mio plio quaternary aquifer alluvial aquifer is considered as one of these sources and an important reservoir the studied area is situated in this alluvial aquifer that showing a heterogeneous continental detrital sedimentation in the hydrogeological study thirty five wells were selected during the third week of april 2015 and all of them used for the domestic and agricultural purposes the depth of these wells was varied from 2 5 to 12 m the potentiometric study showed that the main axes of groundwater flow converge towards the center of el milia plain and geological boundaries of the study area generally have a synclinal form to hold water in permeable formations and the groundwater recharge is done primarily by the infiltration of precipitation waters direct infiltration and underground spill from massive of cambro ordovician cristallophyllians around the plain fig 1 the hydrodynamic study showed that the transmissivity 0 03 10 2 20 94 10 2 m2 s and permeability 0 15 10 3 8 05 10 3 m s are good in the study area 3 methodology 3 1 hydrochemical data and pre processing groundwater samples were collected from 35 observation wells in april 2015 using standard sampling procedures fig 1 american public health association apha 2005 international standards organisation iso 1993 groundwater samples were collected from pumping wells after minimum of several hours of pumping prior to sampling in order to remove any standing water from the wells the samples were collected in a 100 cm3 polyethylene bottle and filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane filter a sample for major cations was acidified with nitric acid hno3 until the ph reached 2 while samples for anion analyses were collected without being acidified the samples were stored below 4 c until the analysis was achieved immediately after sampling the physical parameters such as electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in situ using a multi parameter wtw p3 multiline ph lf set however the chemical parameters such as calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 bicarbonate hco3 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were analyzed in the laboratory ca and mg were estimated titrimetrically using 0 05n 0 01n edta hco3 and cl by h2so4 and agno3 titration respectively na and k were tested by flame photometer method model systronics flame photometer 128 and so4 by turbidimetric method clesceri et al 1998 no3 and no2 were analyzed by colorimetry with a uv visible spectrophotometer rowell 1994 the accuracy of the chemical analysis was verified by calculating ion balance errors where the errors were generally around 10 3 2 self organizing method the self organizing map algorithm som kohonen 1982 is an algorithm applied to visualize and interpret linear and nonlinear relationships in high dimensional datasets the construction of a som network consists of an input layer and an output layer a layer of neurons which are connected to each neuron in the output layer through a weight vector on a hexagonal grid wang et al 2015 in the typical structure of an som the kohonen layer neurons are connected to every neuron in the input layer through adjustable weights or network parameters therefore som is an unsupervised pattern recognition method similar to cluster analysis which has a goal to map high dimensional data onto a low dimensional array of neurons farmaki et al 2013 olkowska et al 2014 using the assumption that the neurons physically located close to each other in the output layer of the som have similar input patterns in general the som algorithm clusters the samples or patterns into predefined classes and also orders the classes into meaningful maps topology preservation or ordering property kalteh et al 2008 chon et al 1996 to pattern benthic communities in streams first applied som in the environmental studies however in the recent decade the som has proved as a practical tool in water studies mostly in assessing water quality choi et al 2014 olkowska et al 2014 in this study all calculations concerning som were performed by som toolbox 2 0 developed by helsinki university of technology vesanto et al 2000 from matlab r2016a and this method was selected as a suitable data analysis tool to help determine the spatial variation of groundwater samples 3 3 hydrochemical assessment 3 3 1 piper diagram piper diagram is a classic visualize representation of the chemistry of water samples from the study area hydrochemical facies reflect the effects of chemical reactions occurring between the minerals within the lithologic framework and groundwater a classic piper diagram includes the three parts two trilinear diagrams along the bottom and one diamond shaped diagram in the middle the hydrochemical facies of water can be interpreted and identify by plot the multiple analysis of water samples on the same diagram however the classic format of piper diagram does not simplify the geospatial assessment of groundwater quality therefore the new pattern diagram is required translate information from the piper diagram into a format that can be mapped spatially therefore tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 developed a groundwater quality index gqi specific to seawater intrusion which can be analyzed with geographic information system gis to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of water chemistry in the study area 3 3 2 piper diagram groundwater quality indices six different domains can be recognized in the diamond field of the piper diagram including i ca hco3

parameters of 35 groundwater samples this som was used for the cluster analysis of the standardized hydrochemical groundwater data the number of the som nodes was calculated as 30 and the numbers of columns and rows were 5 and 6 respectively after the training the som the values of final quantization error and final topographic error were equal to 2 003 and 0 000 respectively indicating that the som was smoothly trained in topology visual comparison of the component plots and similarity index plot figs 2 and 3 suggest that the electrical conductivity is most strongly associated with the following components magnesium sodium potassium sulfate and bicarbonate in groundwater samples which might be the result of ion exchange in the aquifer baig et al 2009 the optimal number of clusters was selected using indices to propose the best number the method provides 30 indices and proposes the best clustering scheme from different results obtained by varying all combinations of number of clusters distance measures and clustering methods charrad et al 2014 eight indices which were the highest indices compared to the rest proposed three as best number of clusters as seen in table 4 and fig 4 two clusters were proposed by 4 indices and 8 clusters by 4 indices the k means clustering of the som also shows three clear clusters of the groundwater samples fig 5 and table 5 the values of the most physicochemical parameters increased from the first cluster to the last cluster the first cluster cluster 1 contained 13 groundwater samples and represented 37 of the total samples it is characterized essentially by low concentrations of the most parameters and generally defined as fresh water types the second cluster cluster 2 included 7 samples and formed 20 of the total samples the mean value of electrical conductivity was 935µs cm suggesting that the water of these groundwater samples generally represented moderate salinization the third cluster cluster 3 contained 15 sample wells and corresponded to 43 of the total samples these samples were characterized by a ec of 1009 µs cm and high concentrations of most ions representing the high salinity type 4 2 hydrochemical facies the geochemical evolution of groundwater can be recognized by plotting the concentrations of major cations and anions in the piper 1944 trilinears piper domains indexes and scholler diagrams fig 6a showed that the groundwater type change from mixed ca mg cl to ca cl in groundwater samples for more detail piper domains indices was used fig 6a the mean value of gqipiper mix in the three clusters was 60 8 58 8 and 61 7 respectively which clearly indicate no evidence of seawater intrusion moreover the mean value of gqipiper dom was 24 23 8 24 8 in the three clusters respectively which indicate to secondary saline water represented by ca cl water type fig 6b showed that the majority of samples in the three clusters 62 57 and 53 respectively were of a ca cl water type domain v the rest of samples indicated the ca mg cl type domain iv except the sample 10 in cluster 3 which represented ca hco3 water type domain i the results of scholler diagram clearly reveal the differences of ions concentrations between three clusters fig 7 although the clusters one and two show similar anionic and cationic compositions that were dominated by cl with abundance orders of cl hco3 so4 meq l and dominated with ca with abundance orders of ca mg na meq l the cluster one shows lower concentration of ions in contrast with cluster one and two cluster 3 has an anionic composition that was dominated by hco3 with abundance orders hco3 cl so4 meq l although cationic composition of cluster 3 follows the sample patterns as cluster 1 and 2 the concentrations of na and mg are higher than two other clusters in overall the dominance of major ion chemical parameters was in the order ca mg na k and cl hco3 so4 no3 for cations and anions respectively fig 7 the plot shows that most of the groundwater samples are ca mg cl clusters 1 and 2 and ca mg hco3 cluster 3 detailed classification of groundwater quality based on the tds and total hardness th confirmed that samples belong to class one and 13 sampling wells belong to class 2 and 3 show hard fresh water type around 28 of sampling wells belong to class 2 and 3 show hard brackish water type only sampling well number 29 shows soft brackish water type fig 8 fig 8 shows groundwater quality gradually change from hard fresh water in recharge zone class one wells cluster 1 to hard brackish water type in discharge zone classes 2 and 3 clusters 2 and 3 4 3 evaluation of water quality for drinking purposes the chemical analyses of groundwater and the comparison with the who 2004 guidelines for drinking water are represented in table 2 it indicates that the average concentration of major ions is lower than the permissible limit recommended by the who table 2 presents the weights assigned to the different physico chemical parameters depending on its relative importance in the global quality of groundwater for drinking purposes the highest weight of 5 was assigned to ec ca cl and hco3 owing to their major significance in water quality assessment and their health implications when they have high concentration in water yidana and yidaa 2010 the minimum weight of 1 has been assigned to no2 due to the least importance in water quality assessment the groundwater quality classification based on wqi values showed in fig 9 the values of wqi ranged from 45 to 72 71 134 and 70 97 for cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 respectively fig 9 parameters showing good to significant correlation with wqi have been shown in table 6 wqi has a strong positive and significant correlation with ec so4 and no2 and good positive correlation with ca and hco3 from the table 7 77 57 and 100 of the groundwater samples showed good water quality in the three clusters respectively while 23 and 43 in the first and second cluster fell under excellent and poor water quality respectively this may be due to effective leaching of ions over exploitation of groundwater direct discharge of effluents agricultural impact dissolution process of rock salt and gypsum bearing rock formations thivya et al 2013 thilagavathi et al 2014 4 4 ionic ratio based on the scholler and piper diagrams results calcium and magnesium are the dominant cations and chloride is the dominant anion in the study area existence of carbonate rock can be the possible source of ca and mg in this area the ratio of ca mg represents that around 60 of samples have a ca mg ratio between 1 and 2 which indicated that the role of carbonate rocks dissolution on ca and mg concentrations in samples fig 10a around 22 8 of the samples have higher ratio than 2 which also indicate on the role of silicate minerals in contribute of calcium and magnesium in the groundwater of study area there are limited samples around 18 represents the ca mg ratio less than one which show the limited impact of dolomite dissolution on ca and my abundance in groundwater samples moreover the plot of ca mg vs hco3 so4 indicates that the majority of samples scattered along the 1 1 line fig 10b the average ratio of ca mg hco3 so4 is 1 34 097 and 1 40 for clusters 1 2 and 3 respectively the ratio near to equivalence line indicates the important role of calcite dolomite and gypsum dissolution on ca mg hco3 and so4 concentrations in groundwater samples however some samples in cluster 1 and 3 show the ratio greater above the 1 1 line which can be indicated that reverse ion exchanges are an active reaction in some areas if ion exchange is the process it will shift the points to right due to an excess of so4 hco3 salinity in the groundwater can come from different sources which could be identified by the relation between the na and cl in the groundwater fig 10c the average molar ratio of na cl is 0 28 in the study area which clearly indicate the higher cl values than na the na vs cl plot indicates that most all the groundwater samples except sample 9 lie below the equiline indicating that evaporation maybe the cause of addition of cl in the groundwater samples in the study area in the plot of na cl vs electrical conductivity in general showed a horizontal line to slightly increasing trend with increasing ec along with a higher ratio of na cl in the study area fig 10d however samples belong to cluster 1 and 2 show slightly decreasing trends in na cal ratio with increasing ec the results indicate the role of evaporation and evapotranspiration to increase sodium concentration in the groundwater samples however decreasing trends in cluster 1 and 2 can be related to silicate weathering process in some areas 4 5 irrigation water quality the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation is mainly evaluated using electrical conductivity ec sodium percent na sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi which reflect groundwater quality al khashman and jaradat 2014 electrical conductivity ec is reflects of tds and is a good measure of salinity in water the salinity hazard is directly related to the concentration of ions in the water which also affects soils by enriching with a sodium concentration when sodium values are much higher than calcium in the water it can destroy the structure of soil due to the dispersion of clay particles and decrease the osmotic activity of plants usually water with ec values greater than 3000 µs cm is considered to be an unsuitable quality for irrigation purposes however only nine out of 35 samples show concentration above 1000 µs cm which are classified as moderate suitability for agricultural usage sodium absorption ratio sar is a measure of the suitability of groundwater for irrigation usage because sodium concentration can reduce the soil permeability and soil structure todd 2007 sar is a measure of alkali sodium hazard to crops and is calculated by the following formula karanth 1987 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where the concentrations of sodium calcium and magnesium are in meq l groundwater for irrigation with a sar value less than 10 are classified as excellent those with sar values between 10 and 18 are termed good and doubtful if the sar value is between 18 and 26 unsuitable refers to groundwater with a sar value greater than 26 todd 1980 sadashivaiah et al 2008 nishanthiny et al 2010 sar values varied from 0 27 to 1 03 meq l and all groundwater samples were less than 10 meq l indicating that all the groundwaters could be classified as excellent and would be suitable for irrigation a plot of groundwater samples on the us salinity diagram richards and redfield 1954 in which the ec is taken as salinity hazard and sar as alkalinity hazard fig 11 shows that all samples of the first cluster fall within the medium salinity low sodium type of water c2 s1 and all of samples belong to cluster 2 and 3 fall under the high salinity hazard low sodium hazard class c3 s1 groundwaters that fall within the c2 s1 can be used for irrigation on all types of soil with little danger of the development of harmful levels of exchangeable sodium however c3 s1 types of water could only be used to irrigate certain semi tolerant crops ahamed et al 2013 the sodium percentage na is an indication of the soluble sodium content of the groundwater and also used to evaluate na hazard excess sodium in water will change the soil structure and reduce soil permeability the sodium percent values are obtained using the following formula wilcox and mcdougald 1955 7 n a n a k 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the wilcox and mcdougald 1955 diagram fig 12 relating sodium percent and ec shows that 34 of the groundwater samples belong to cluster 1 fall in excellent to good while 66 of the groundwater samples belong to clusters 2 and 3 are under good to permissible for agricultural activities this clearly indicates that groundwater quality is better for irrigation in the case of the first cluster than the second and third cluster the residual sodium carbonate rsc is a valuable parameter that has a significant effect on the suitability of water for irrigation uses which determine the hazardous effect of hco3 and co3 2 on the irrigation water quality rsc index of water samples in the study site is estimated by the equation eaton 1950 8 r s c c o 3 2 h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l lloyd and heathcote 1985 have classified irrigation water based on rsc as suitable 1 25 marginal 1 25 2 5 and not suitable 2 5 according to rsc values all groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation fig 13 the permeability index pi values also indicate that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation it is defined as follows raghunath 1987 9 p i n a h c o 3 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a where the concentrations are reported in meq l the pi ranges from 23 7 to 85 5 a doneen chart divides irrigation waters into three major types on the basis of the pi and total ions in solution in meq l class i waters present low pi values and are the best water types for irrigation class ii waters are acceptable for irrigation but lower in quality compared to class i class iii waters are unacceptable and may not be used for irrigation all the samples are classified in class i except well number 29 which classified in class iii fig 14 5 conclusion in this study the som approach was applied for clustering hydrochemical groundwater data from 35 observation wells to investigate the spatial hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the alluvial aquifer of el milia plain in addition hydrochemical facies water quality index and ionic ratio were also examined to elucidate the hydrochemical characteristics classified by the som the som approach classified the groundwater chemistry data into 3 clusters which revealed three basic representative water types characterized by the high salinity cluster 3 moderate salinity cluster 2 and freshwater cluster 1 samples of cluster 1 located in the recharge zone where calcium and magnesium mostly come from the carbonate rocks dissolution however samples of clusters 2 and 3 situated in the discharge zone where evaporation was the dominate processes based on wqi index most samples of the three clusters have good water quality for drinking purposes moreover cluster 1 showed excellent quality for agricultural purposes meanwhile cluster 3 and 2 represent good to permissible water type the som approach introduced in this study represents a cost effective way to classify spatially the groundwater chemistry data acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the editor and reviewers who helped a lot for improving the paper 
12348,hydrochemical data of groundwater samples collected from thirty five wells in alluvial aquifer of el milia were examined using self organizing map som approach based on visualization of som analysis and hydrochemical characteristics groundwater samples were clustered into three clusters which revealed three basic representative water types freshwater cluster 1 moderate salinity cluster 2 and high salinity cluster 3 based on ionic ratio the source of soluble ions in the groundwater of the freshwater types was found to be the carbonate rock dissolution while evaporation and evapotranspiration were found to be the main factors affecting the chemistry of the groundwater characterized by the moderate and high salinity types respectively this study shows that the som approach can be successfully used to classify and characterize the groundwater in terms of quality graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater self organizing maps quality index ionic ratio drinking water irrigation water 1 introduction water quality below the surface displays the all processes and reactions that affect on the water from the moment it condenses in the atmosphere to the time it is abstracted from the wells arumugam and elangovan 2009 dissolution precipitation weathering ion exchange and various biological processes are main factors which influence water chemistry below the surface however in recent decades contaminations by domestic agricultural and industrial activities are serious problems which threated groundwater quality especially in developing countries groundwater quality assessment is gaining importance due to intense urbanization industrialization and agricultural activities putting the soil and groundwater to greater risk of contamination ackah et al 2011 sayyed and wagh 2011 belkhiri et al 2011 carol et al 2013 brindha et al 2017 generally monitoring groundwater quality develops large number of samples including chemical and physical parameters which large and high dimensional datasets because of the variety of variables observed as groundwater quality data and uncertainty involved in transport and reaction mechanism into groundwater systems it is necessary to implement a sophisticated knowledge extraction and diagnosis tool that can provide the analysis and visualization of multidimensional groundwater quality data srivastava and ramanathan 2008 hydrochemical study is a useful method to identify the mechanism controlling groundwater quality in a region rajesh et al 2012 however modelling of hydrochemical processes and assessing groundwater quality in high dimensional and long term datasets are complicated extraction of efficient information from the large monitoring datasets can play an important role to reduce high dimensional data into a lower dimension space with minimum loss of information choi et al 2014 which can reveal unknown patterns in complex hydrochemical data although many researchers principal component analysis pca as a classical approach for linear dimensionality reduction to reveal relationships between variables jeevanandam et al 2007 belkhiri and narany 2015 the results of method is sometime difficult to interpreted due to complexity and non linearity of large dataset recently some data driven approaches such as the projection pursuit technique and neural networks have been applied to groundwater quality assessment due to the rapid innovation of computer technology the artificial neural network technique particularly self organizing maps som has recently attracted considerable attention in analysis and diagnosis of dynamic systems the self organizing map som is introduced by kohonen et al 1984 as an unsupervised neural network algorithm which is capable of clustering classification prediction and data mining in large datasets kohonen and somervuo 2002 kalteh et al 2008 generally som is used in medical chemical biological and financial research there are limited studies have used som algorithm in water resources assessment peeters and dassargues 2006 compared pca a traditional multivariate statistical method to the som algorithm approach on groundwater chemistry data in central belgium the results revealed that although pca can quantify the mount of variance explained by each component som able to visualize the entire dataset in terms of the original variables and can detect non linear relationship between variables this study attempted to apply som for investigation of the spatial hydrochemical characteristic of the alluvial aquifer in el milia plain algeria to assess the quality of groundwater for drinking and agricultural purposes the paper is organized into four sections the first section introduces the general background and ideas used in this study the second section describes the study area the third section describes the methodology and focuses on the hydrochemical datasets used in this study how to som approach can be classified the hydrochemical groundwater data and hydrochemical assessment the final section summarizes the results and gives conclusions regarding the groundwater system in the area 2 study area el mila plain is located at the northeast of the province of jijel algeria the study area is situated at a few kilometers from the mediterranean sea and between eastern longitude of 6 10 6 20 e and northern latitude of 36 40 36 47 n fig 1 it is characterized by low to moderate topography and with an average altitude of 35 m this area is considered as the wettest regions of algeria with a hydrographic network converges to oued el kebir and its stream on the right bank oued bou siaba the study area is characterized by a sub humid mediterranean climate in september dry in may very dry during summer and wet from october until april the average annual of precipitation and temperature is 930 mm and 17 c respectively the evapotranspiration runoff and infiltration in this region are 536 mm 58 357 mm 38 and 37 mm 4 respectively the agricultural deficit is estimated at 331 mm and distributed from june to september nuibat and belkhiri 2015 groundwater resources in the study area were very important sources of water the mio plio quaternary aquifer alluvial aquifer is considered as one of these sources and an important reservoir the studied area is situated in this alluvial aquifer that showing a heterogeneous continental detrital sedimentation in the hydrogeological study thirty five wells were selected during the third week of april 2015 and all of them used for the domestic and agricultural purposes the depth of these wells was varied from 2 5 to 12 m the potentiometric study showed that the main axes of groundwater flow converge towards the center of el milia plain and geological boundaries of the study area generally have a synclinal form to hold water in permeable formations and the groundwater recharge is done primarily by the infiltration of precipitation waters direct infiltration and underground spill from massive of cambro ordovician cristallophyllians around the plain fig 1 the hydrodynamic study showed that the transmissivity 0 03 10 2 20 94 10 2 m2 s and permeability 0 15 10 3 8 05 10 3 m s are good in the study area 3 methodology 3 1 hydrochemical data and pre processing groundwater samples were collected from 35 observation wells in april 2015 using standard sampling procedures fig 1 american public health association apha 2005 international standards organisation iso 1993 groundwater samples were collected from pumping wells after minimum of several hours of pumping prior to sampling in order to remove any standing water from the wells the samples were collected in a 100 cm3 polyethylene bottle and filtered through a 0 45 µm membrane filter a sample for major cations was acidified with nitric acid hno3 until the ph reached 2 while samples for anion analyses were collected without being acidified the samples were stored below 4 c until the analysis was achieved immediately after sampling the physical parameters such as electrical conductivity ec and ph were measured in situ using a multi parameter wtw p3 multiline ph lf set however the chemical parameters such as calcium ca magnesium mg sodium na potassium k chloride cl sulfate so4 bicarbonate hco3 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 were analyzed in the laboratory ca and mg were estimated titrimetrically using 0 05n 0 01n edta hco3 and cl by h2so4 and agno3 titration respectively na and k were tested by flame photometer method model systronics flame photometer 128 and so4 by turbidimetric method clesceri et al 1998 no3 and no2 were analyzed by colorimetry with a uv visible spectrophotometer rowell 1994 the accuracy of the chemical analysis was verified by calculating ion balance errors where the errors were generally around 10 3 2 self organizing method the self organizing map algorithm som kohonen 1982 is an algorithm applied to visualize and interpret linear and nonlinear relationships in high dimensional datasets the construction of a som network consists of an input layer and an output layer a layer of neurons which are connected to each neuron in the output layer through a weight vector on a hexagonal grid wang et al 2015 in the typical structure of an som the kohonen layer neurons are connected to every neuron in the input layer through adjustable weights or network parameters therefore som is an unsupervised pattern recognition method similar to cluster analysis which has a goal to map high dimensional data onto a low dimensional array of neurons farmaki et al 2013 olkowska et al 2014 using the assumption that the neurons physically located close to each other in the output layer of the som have similar input patterns in general the som algorithm clusters the samples or patterns into predefined classes and also orders the classes into meaningful maps topology preservation or ordering property kalteh et al 2008 chon et al 1996 to pattern benthic communities in streams first applied som in the environmental studies however in the recent decade the som has proved as a practical tool in water studies mostly in assessing water quality choi et al 2014 olkowska et al 2014 in this study all calculations concerning som were performed by som toolbox 2 0 developed by helsinki university of technology vesanto et al 2000 from matlab r2016a and this method was selected as a suitable data analysis tool to help determine the spatial variation of groundwater samples 3 3 hydrochemical assessment 3 3 1 piper diagram piper diagram is a classic visualize representation of the chemistry of water samples from the study area hydrochemical facies reflect the effects of chemical reactions occurring between the minerals within the lithologic framework and groundwater a classic piper diagram includes the three parts two trilinear diagrams along the bottom and one diamond shaped diagram in the middle the hydrochemical facies of water can be interpreted and identify by plot the multiple analysis of water samples on the same diagram however the classic format of piper diagram does not simplify the geospatial assessment of groundwater quality therefore the new pattern diagram is required translate information from the piper diagram into a format that can be mapped spatially therefore tomaszkiewicz et al 2014 developed a groundwater quality index gqi specific to seawater intrusion which can be analyzed with geographic information system gis to visualize the spatiotemporal distribution of water chemistry in the study area 3 3 2 piper diagram groundwater quality indices six different domains can be recognized in the diamond field of the piper diagram including i ca hco3

in water quality assessment and their health implications when they have high concentration in water yidana and yidaa 2010 the minimum weight of 1 has been assigned to no2 due to the least importance in water quality assessment the groundwater quality classification based on wqi values showed in fig 9 the values of wqi ranged from 45 to 72 71 134 and 70 97 for cluster 1 cluster 2 and cluster 3 respectively fig 9 parameters showing good to significant correlation with wqi have been shown in table 6 wqi has a strong positive and significant correlation with ec so4 and no2 and good positive correlation with ca and hco3 from the table 7 77 57 and 100 of the groundwater samples showed good water quality in the three clusters respectively while 23 and 43 in the first and second cluster fell under excellent and poor water quality respectively this may be due to effective leaching of ions over exploitation of groundwater direct discharge of effluents agricultural impact dissolution process of rock salt and gypsum bearing rock formations thivya et al 2013 thilagavathi et al 2014 4 4 ionic ratio based on the scholler and piper diagrams results calcium and magnesium are the dominant cations and chloride is the dominant anion in the study area existence of carbonate rock can be the possible source of ca and mg in this area the ratio of ca mg represents that around 60 of samples have a ca mg ratio between 1 and 2 which indicated that the role of carbonate rocks dissolution on ca and mg concentrations in samples fig 10a around 22 8 of the samples have higher ratio than 2 which also indicate on the role of silicate minerals in contribute of calcium and magnesium in the groundwater of study area there are limited samples around 18 represents the ca mg ratio less than one which show the limited impact of dolomite dissolution on ca and my abundance in groundwater samples moreover the plot of ca mg vs hco3 so4 indicates that the majority of samples scattered along the 1 1 line fig 10b the average ratio of ca mg hco3 so4 is 1 34 097 and 1 40 for clusters 1 2 and 3 respectively the ratio near to equivalence line indicates the important role of calcite dolomite and gypsum dissolution on ca mg hco3 and so4 concentrations in groundwater samples however some samples in cluster 1 and 3 show the ratio greater above the 1 1 line which can be indicated that reverse ion exchanges are an active reaction in some areas if ion exchange is the process it will shift the points to right due to an excess of so4 hco3 salinity in the groundwater can come from different sources which could be identified by the relation between the na and cl in the groundwater fig 10c the average molar ratio of na cl is 0 28 in the study area which clearly indicate the higher cl values than na the na vs cl plot indicates that most all the groundwater samples except sample 9 lie below the equiline indicating that evaporation maybe the cause of addition of cl in the groundwater samples in the study area in the plot of na cl vs electrical conductivity in general showed a horizontal line to slightly increasing trend with increasing ec along with a higher ratio of na cl in the study area fig 10d however samples belong to cluster 1 and 2 show slightly decreasing trends in na cal ratio with increasing ec the results indicate the role of evaporation and evapotranspiration to increase sodium concentration in the groundwater samples however decreasing trends in cluster 1 and 2 can be related to silicate weathering process in some areas 4 5 irrigation water quality the suitability of groundwater quality for irrigation is mainly evaluated using electrical conductivity ec sodium percent na sodium adsorption ratio sar residual sodium carbonate rsc and permeability index pi which reflect groundwater quality al khashman and jaradat 2014 electrical conductivity ec is reflects of tds and is a good measure of salinity in water the salinity hazard is directly related to the concentration of ions in the water which also affects soils by enriching with a sodium concentration when sodium values are much higher than calcium in the water it can destroy the structure of soil due to the dispersion of clay particles and decrease the osmotic activity of plants usually water with ec values greater than 3000 µs cm is considered to be an unsuitable quality for irrigation purposes however only nine out of 35 samples show concentration above 1000 µs cm which are classified as moderate suitability for agricultural usage sodium absorption ratio sar is a measure of the suitability of groundwater for irrigation usage because sodium concentration can reduce the soil permeability and soil structure todd 2007 sar is a measure of alkali sodium hazard to crops and is calculated by the following formula karanth 1987 6 s a r n a c a 2 m g 2 2 where the concentrations of sodium calcium and magnesium are in meq l groundwater for irrigation with a sar value less than 10 are classified as excellent those with sar values between 10 and 18 are termed good and doubtful if the sar value is between 18 and 26 unsuitable refers to groundwater with a sar value greater than 26 todd 1980 sadashivaiah et al 2008 nishanthiny et al 2010 sar values varied from 0 27 to 1 03 meq l and all groundwater samples were less than 10 meq l indicating that all the groundwaters could be classified as excellent and would be suitable for irrigation a plot of groundwater samples on the us salinity diagram richards and redfield 1954 in which the ec is taken as salinity hazard and sar as alkalinity hazard fig 11 shows that all samples of the first cluster fall within the medium salinity low sodium type of water c2 s1 and all of samples belong to cluster 2 and 3 fall under the high salinity hazard low sodium hazard class c3 s1 groundwaters that fall within the c2 s1 can be used for irrigation on all types of soil with little danger of the development of harmful levels of exchangeable sodium however c3 s1 types of water could only be used to irrigate certain semi tolerant crops ahamed et al 2013 the sodium percentage na is an indication of the soluble sodium content of the groundwater and also used to evaluate na hazard excess sodium in water will change the soil structure and reduce soil permeability the sodium percent values are obtained using the following formula wilcox and mcdougald 1955 7 n a n a k 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a k where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l the wilcox and mcdougald 1955 diagram fig 12 relating sodium percent and ec shows that 34 of the groundwater samples belong to cluster 1 fall in excellent to good while 66 of the groundwater samples belong to clusters 2 and 3 are under good to permissible for agricultural activities this clearly indicates that groundwater quality is better for irrigation in the case of the first cluster than the second and third cluster the residual sodium carbonate rsc is a valuable parameter that has a significant effect on the suitability of water for irrigation uses which determine the hazardous effect of hco3 and co3 2 on the irrigation water quality rsc index of water samples in the study site is estimated by the equation eaton 1950 8 r s c c o 3 2 h c o 3 c a 2 m g 2 where all ionic concentrations are expressed in meq l lloyd and heathcote 1985 have classified irrigation water based on rsc as suitable 1 25 marginal 1 25 2 5 and not suitable 2 5 according to rsc values all groundwater samples are suitable for irrigation fig 13 the permeability index pi values also indicate that the groundwater is suitable for irrigation it is defined as follows raghunath 1987 9 p i n a h c o 3 100 c a 2 m g 2 n a where the concentrations are reported in meq l the pi ranges from 23 7 to 85 5 a doneen chart divides irrigation waters into three major types on the basis of the pi and total ions in solution in meq l class i waters present low pi values and are the best water types for irrigation class ii waters are acceptable for irrigation but lower in quality compared to class i class iii waters are unacceptable and may not be used for irrigation all the samples are classified in class i except well number 29 which classified in class iii fig 14 5 conclusion in this study the som approach was applied for clustering hydrochemical groundwater data from 35 observation wells to investigate the spatial hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater in the alluvial aquifer of el milia plain in addition hydrochemical facies water quality index and ionic ratio were also examined to elucidate the hydrochemical characteristics classified by the som the som approach classified the groundwater chemistry data into 3 clusters which revealed three basic representative water types characterized by the high salinity cluster 3 moderate salinity cluster 2 and freshwater cluster 1 samples of cluster 1 located in the recharge zone where calcium and magnesium mostly come from the carbonate rocks dissolution however samples of clusters 2 and 3 situated in the discharge zone where evaporation was the dominate processes based on wqi index most samples of the three clusters have good water quality for drinking purposes moreover cluster 1 showed excellent quality for agricultural purposes meanwhile cluster 3 and 2 represent good to permissible water type the som approach introduced in this study represents a cost effective way to classify spatially the groundwater chemistry data acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the

12349,over the last few decades contamination of groundwater and soil by non aqueous phase liquids napls has become a serious and wide spread problem for the environment in this research a light transmission visualization ltv method was used to observe the migration of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl and light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl in double porosity soil within a three fluid phase system air napl water the double porosity characteristics of the soil were created using a composition made up of local sand and sintered kaolin clay spheres arranged in a periodic manner toluene was used to simulate lnapl while tetrachloroethylene pce represented the dnapl both napls were dyed using oil red o for better visualization for comparison purposes the same experiments were carried out using just local silica sand acting as a type of single porosity soil a significant difference in the migration of the toluene and pce was observed as both the napl migration rates in the double porosity medium were much faster compared to the migration rates found in the single porosity medium this result is most likely due to the occurrence of inter aggregate pores in the double porosity soil that contribute to increasing velocity of fluids migration through porous media other factors such as the wettability of fluids and capillary pressure characteristics that exist in the soil pores were found to be influential factors in fluid migration within porous media in addition the results show that chemical properties have a significant influence on the napl migration in porous media it was found that the migration velocity of toluene was much faster compared to the migration velocity of the pce this observation is most likely caused by the fact that the distribution coefficient of toluene was higher than that of pce which in turn means that the retardation factor of toluene is lower than that of pce in the same porous media this paper proved that the ltv provides a non intrusive and non destructive technique for studying multiphase flow in double porosity soil media where rapid changes in fluid distribution in the entire flow domain is not easy to measure using conventional tools graphical abstract fx1 keywords light transmission visualization double porosity two dimensional three fluid phase flow non aqueous phase liquid image analysis 1 introduction contamination of groundwater and soil by non aqueous phase liquids napls has become a serious and wide spread problem for the environment luciano et al 2012 tick et al 2015 spills of petroleum products and leaks from underground storage tanks are examples of napl releases in the subsurface system generally napls are divided into two main types based on its density dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl which is denser than water and light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl which has density less than water chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are the most spread examples of dnapl whereas benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex are examples of lnapl sweijen et al 2014 when lnapl is released into the subsurface it will migrate downward until it reaches the water table mercer and cohen 1990 for dnapl it is behaviour is similar to lnapl in the unsaturated zone after being released into the subsurface but while lnapl tends to pool on groundwater it encountered dnapl will continue to migrate downward vertically into the saturated zone ngien 2012 it is very important to understand the migration of napls in subsurface systems in order to evaluate the contamination source zones as well as to design relevant remediation schemes zheng et al 2015 investigation of contaminant hydrological processes often relies on indirect measurements such as non invasive techniques werth et al 2010 non invasive techniques can easily investigate the behaviour of fluids flow in the soil samples without disturbing the samples such as x ray gamma ray and photographic methods alazaiza et al 2015 a substantial number of experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the behaviour of immiscible fluids in soils alazaiza et al 2017b pan et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 sa ari et al 2015 ngien et al 2012 bob et al 2008 darnault et al 1998 kechavarzi et al 2005 all these studies were carried out to investigate the behaviour of napl in one or two dimensional two phase napl water systems a few experimental studies on napl migration in three fluid phase systems were found but these were limited to sand being used as the single porosity media darnault et al 2001 kechavarzi et al 2000 schroth et al 1998 in the last few years several non destructive and non intrusive methods used to observe fluid saturation such as x ray attenuation tidwell and glass 1994 and gamma ray techniques høst madsen and jensen 1992 have been reported however these techniques do not allow the observation of dynamic fluid saturation in the whole flow domain at the same time other limitations include long counting times as well as only one point can be acquired at one time darnault et al 1998 due to the mentioned limitations light transmission visualization ltv technique has been gained more attention by several researchers alazaiza et al 2016 bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 zheng et al 2015 a review by alazaiza et al 2015 presented the usage of three types of photographic methods in napl experiments and showed that ltv is a viable method in napl saturation measurements the theory behind the ltv technique is the passing of electromagnetic energy into the test media where the distribution of liquid saturation is measured as variations in the light intensity field there is a linear relationship between saturation and light intensity due to closer matching between the refraction index of the porous media and water relative to the porous media and air glass et al 1989 in ltv systems the change in fluid content and fluid saturation can easily be measured instantaneously due to the utilization of cooled charged coupled device ccd cameras which provide a very high density array of spatial measurements over a very large dynamic range niemet and selker 2001 ltv was first developed by hoa 1981 to measure water content in a 2 d sand filled chamber after that tidwell and glass 1994 used the ltv technique to measure liquid saturation by correlating the number of pores filled with water to the total number of pores across the thickness of the model as well as to water saturation thereafter darnault et al 1998 applied the ltv method to investigate the relationship between hue and water content through full field in a two phase system water oil using the hue saturation and intensity hsi format they found that the major problem in measuring water and napl saturation in the system was due to the similar refraction indices of these liquids several years later darnault et al 2001 developed a method to measure fluid content in a three phase system napl water air after a few years a major contribution to the ltv technique was achieved by bob et al 2008 who studied the quantification of pce saturation in a two dimensional two fluid phase system in single porosity silica sand several characteristics influence the migration of contaminants in the subsurface system one of these characteristics is the soil structure in the natural state many types of soils have two distinct scales of porosity which lead to the term double porosity soil structure carminati et al 2008 double porosity is a natural phenomenon el zein et al 2006 found when two separate pore systems occur simultaneously in the structure of the soil rock aquifers pao and lewis 2002 compacted soils romero et al 1999 and agricultural top soil el zein et al 2006 are examples of geomaterials that potentially harbour double porosity characteristics the aim of this paper is to study the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil in a 2 d flow chamber in three fluid phase system air napl water using the ltv technique to the best knowledge of the authors studying the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil within a three fluid phase system using ltv technique has not been done before the ltv technique was used to qualitatively analyze the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil medium which is useful in designing the remediation methods to achieve the objective of this paper two 2 d laboratory experiments were conducted in order to observe the migration of lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil in three fluid phase system for comparison purpose the same experiments were carried out again but using sand as a single porosity in three fluid phase system section 2 presents the materials and methods that were used section 3 shows the results and the captured images for the behaviour of napls in all soil samples whereas section 4 presents the conclusion of the study and possible future work 2 materials and methods 2 1 double porosity creation the double porosity medium was created using solidified clay spheres and fine sand the solidified clay spheres were made from commercially available kaolin s300 lotte chemical titan malaysia while the sand used was commercial local silica sand lotte chemical titan malaysia physical chemical and mineralogical properties of the materials were characterized as presented in alazaiza et al 2017a double porosity in the soil samples was created following a previous study by lewandowska et al 2005 sintered clay spheres were made by hand where the kaolin powder was mixed with sufficient amount of water to form the spheres before being burned the clay spheres were then put inside the furnace and the temperature was increased gradually until it reached 1000 c this process was to make the kaolin spheres hard as well as to increase their ability to avoid disintegration in case of saturation the size of the spheres was almost similar by visually test the diameter of the sphere was 6 mm scanning electron microscopy sem was conducted with different magnification power to investigate the micro structure of kaolin spheres as shown in fig 1 the sand was washed with distilled water to remove all the fine residuals that might be present as an extra precaution the washing process continued until the absorption of the waste distilled water as measured by a spectrophotometer was similar to the clean rinsing distilled water at the same wavelength thereafter the sand was oven dried for 48 h at 45 c the packing procedure was conducted by pouring the clay spheres layer by layer in such a way that they were touching each other between each layer a 1 cm layer of sand was poured carefully which was then compacted by tapping the outer frame of the model using a plastic hammer the procedure was repeated to obtain the periodic arrangement the total porosity of the system was 0 41 2 2 experimental setup 2 d flow chambers packed with double porosity media were used in this research to study the migration of napls in double porosity media in three fluid phase system using ltv these flow chambers were constructed using 10 mm acrylic material with internal dimensions of 45 cm height 30 cm width 1 cm depth the flow chamber was kept in fixed position inside a steel frame fixed onto a stainless steel light box that contained a light source two ports attached to the bottom of the flow chamber allowed inflow and outflow of fluids the ports were connected to a water tank by plastic tube where a valve between the flow chamber and water tank was used to control the flow of water into the flow chamber the ltv system used in this study was described in detail by alazaiza et al 2017a it consisted mainly of a light source referred to as the light box that had five 18 w fluorescent tubes osram malaysia a holographic light shaping diffuser lsd luminit usa was placed behind the flow chamber and in front of the light source to homogenize the light intensity fig 2 shows a schematic diagram for the light box images were captured using a nikon d 7100 digital camera nikon malaysia which was kept at the same distance of 1 5 m from the light box during all the experiments the camera had a 12 bit dynamic range 4096 gy levels and produced 6000 by 4000 pixels resulting in a very high spatial resolution of 0 07 mm2 per pixel the image acquisition was controlled by connecting the camera to a laptop that was installed with special software nikon camera control pro used to capture the images all images were collected using a 600 nm center wavelength 10 nm band pass filter orientir inc china which was attached to a 67 mm lens nikkor 18 105 mmf 3 5 5 6g ed vr malaysia the aperture setting of the lens was adjusted in order to utilize most of the dynamic range of the camera using exposure times of a few seconds the aperture of the lens was fixed at f 5 6 for all images and the exposure time was 2 s the experiments were carried out inside a dark room constructed from steel bars and covered with a blue cloth as shown in fig 3 the ambient room temperature was kept constant during the experiments at 23 1 c 2 3 experimental procedures to study the napls migration in double porosity three fluid phase system by ltv two experiments were conducted one using dnapl and the second using lnapl both experiments were then repeated but using only sand as the single porosity media to compare the behaviour of the napl in both porous media dnapl movement in the porous media was investigated using tetrachloroethylene pce whereas toluene was used as the lnapl the napls were dyed with oil red o dye powder at a concentration of 0 1 g l this percentage is enough to facilitate a good visual observation of the pce and toluene migration through the acrylic wall of the flow chamber using a small amount of dye is enough as reported by kechavarzi et al 2000 table 1 illustrates the characteristics of both materials in each of the experiments the flow chamber was packed dry with the porous media after the chamber was fully packed with the porous media according to the packing procedure in section 2 1 the top frame of the flow chamber was attached and black silicon was used to seal all gaps after that the packed chamber was purged of air by co2 gas injection for a period of 40 min through the ports at the bottom of the flow chamber and then distilled water was slowly introduced into the flow chamber from the bottom ports under a positive pressure this procedure was carried out to minimize the amount of air entrapment during water imbibition it was assumed that any small quantity of trapped co2 would dissolve in the water from visual observation it was noted that no gas bubbles occurred in the packed flow chamber after water saturation which confirmed that there is no entrapped air in the porous media after 1 h of saturating the flow chamber with water the valve was opened and the water was allowed to drain creating a capillary fringe about 17 cm below the surface of the porous media following schroth et al 1998 the period of water drainage was 12 h prior to the release of the napl before releasing the napl into the flow chamber the camera captured an image for the flow chamber and this image was used as a reference image for the system this image was used later for image subtraction where images with the napl increments were then subtracted from the reference image thereafter in every experiment 20 ml of the napl was injected into the flow chamber using a syringe image acquisition was carried out based on the change of the napl movement and the frequency of image capturing was shown in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 dnapl migration in double porosity after opening the valve a visual observation for the change in the capillary fringe was conducted on the inclination of the water table during draining of the flow chamber from the differences in the transmitted light the areas that have higher water saturation within the porous media can be easily delineated from the areas that have lower water saturation the capillary fringe was clearly distinguished as a dry wet boundary the water continued draining until it reached approximately 35 cm from the top of the flow chamber the upper part is a simulation for three fluid phase system air napl water whereas the lower part is still two fluid phase system napl water as shown in fig 4 after releasing the pce into the flow chamber it started to move horizontally during the first three minutes before migrating vertically downward it was observed that the pce migration was very slow in the three fluid phase system zone compared to its migration velocity in the two fluid phase system zone the pce downward migration took about 176 min to reach the water table which translates to an average velocity of 3 3 10 2 mm s as shown in fig 5 however when the pce entered the two fluid phase system zone its migration rate increased substantially as compared to the velocity in the previous zone this observation was most likely due to the existence of air in the three fluid phase zone when three fluids are present in a subsurface system the largest pores are usually filled with air whereas the smallest pores are occupied by water napls fill the intermediate pores schroth et al 1998 in this experiment the pce migration was very slow in the three fluid phase zone because pce migrated through the intermediate pores and took more time to overcome the capillary pressure to enter the smallest and largest pores in addition another factor that probably influenced the pce migration between the two zones is the wettability of the fluids present in the physical model in the vadose zone simulated by the upper zone in this experiment water is usually a wetting fluid with respect to napl whereas napl is a wetting fluid with respect to air mitchell and soga 2005 at the pore level the capillary pressure forces the wetting fluid to enter the pore and displace the existing fluid inside the pore while the non wetting fluid will be repelled bear 1972 therefore when the pce was released into the flow chamber it would have migrated and infiltrated initially through the air filled pores since the pce is the wetting fluid with respect to air this explanation was validated by observations during the experiment it was noted that some air bubbles were observed at the surface of the flow chamber in the three fluid phase zone which verified the explanation this finding is in agreement with ngien et al 2012b in their study they observed the migration of lnapl in 1 d columns filled with unsaturated double porosity soil media using light reflection method they noted that the wettability has a major influence on the migration of lnapl in double porosity soil moreover they noted the occurrence of air bubbles at the surface of the column that proves the influence of the wettability of fluids on the other hand when the pce entered the two fluid phase zone it continued its migration until it reached the bottom of the flow chamber pce migration took roughly 28 min from the water table until it reached the bottom of the flow chamber with an average velocity of 5 9 10 2 mm s this observation emphasized the wettability influence on the migration of pce between the three fluid phase system and two fluid phase system zones the behaviour of the pce migration is shown in fig 5 3 2 dnapl migration in single porosity a similar experiment with the same conditions as in section 3 1 was conducted but using only silica sand as the single porosity media for comparison purpose similarly 20 ml of pce was injected into the flow chamber under the same flow rate when the valve was opened for water drainage following the same procedures the water level reached 13 cm from the bottom of the flow chamber which is approximately one third of the height of the flow chamber the behaviour of the pce in experiment 2 was almost similar to the behaviour of the pce in experiment 1 upon its release into the flow chamber the pce started to migrate horizontally along the top surface of the flow chamber before migrating vertically downward it was noted that the pce migration was very slow in the upper zone compared to experiment 1 at the same zone the time taken by the pce to reach the water table was 213 min which translates to an average speed of 2 5 10 2 mm s compared to 3 3 10 2 mm s in experiment 1 this observation was most likely due to the occurrence of inter aggregate pores in the double porosity soil media in experiment 1 that played a role in increasing the velocity of fluid through the soil media the presence of inter aggregate pores in double porosity media means that a larger pore volume was present it is known that the large pores contribute to reducing the capillary pressure that the napl need to overcome to go through these pores and thus migrate through the soil therefore the velocity of fluid in double porosity is much faster compared to single porosity this observation is in agreement with ngien et al 2012b in their study they compared the velocity of lnapl migration between single and double porosity soils using light reflection method and reported the same findings the material used to create the double porosity in their study was aggregated kaolin which is differing from the materials used in this study another study conducted by alazaiza et al 2017a confirmed the same results the authors carried out three laboratory experiments where the soil samples were double porosity with different volumetric fractions of inter aggregate pores and intra aggregate pores in each subsequent experiment the fraction of inter aggregate pores was increased by 5 to investigate its influence on dnapl migration for the first experiment the volumetric fraction of 50 inter aggregate pores and 50 of intra aggregate pores were used for the second experiment 55 inter aggregate pores and 45 intra aggregate pores were used while for the third experiment 60 of inter aggregate pores and 40 of intra aggregate pores were used they found that the dnapl migration was much faster in the third experiment which has higher inter aggregate volume which is in consistent with the result in this study furthermore the one way statistical analysis of variance anova p 0 05 was used to validate the accuracy of the experimental results the authors observed that the average velocities in the three experiments were 2 31 2 68 and 2 93 cm min for experiment 1 2 and 3 respectively which prove the same result in addition the pce exhibited the same behaviour in the two fluid phase zone as the pce migration was much faster in the two fluid phase zone compared to the three fluid phase zone in experiment 2 the duration of pce migration from the water table to the bottom of the flow chamber was 44 min which translates to an average speed of 4 9 10 2 mm s compared to 5 9 10 2 mm s in experiment 1 the explanation for this occurrence is basically the same as that given for experiment 1 fig 6 shows the distribution of pce migration during experiment 2 3 3 lnapl migration in double porosity following the same procedures as in the previous experiments 20 ml of toluene was injected into the flow chamber to investigate the behaviour of the lnapl migration in double porosity media in three fluid phase system after opening the valve for water drainage the water level gradually lowered until it reached 12 cm from the bottom of the flow chamber upon its release into the flow chamber the toluene moved horizontally during the first two minutes and then migrated vertically downward until it reached the water table the velocity of toluene migration was much faster compared to the pce migration velocity in the three fluid phase zone toluene took around 98 min to reach the water table compared to 176 min for pce this observation can be explained by the difference in the chemical characteristics between the two materials the significant factor influences the fluid transportation underground is the distribution coefficient kd of substances ruffino and zanetti 2009 the distribution coefficient of toluene and pce reported by ruffino and zanetti 2009 were 0 520 l kg and 0 963 l kg respectively this means that the retardation factor of toluene due to adsorption is lower than that for pce in the same porous media in addition the material solubility in water likely plays a significant role in contaminant migration for the case of existing soil moisture toluene will move faster as expected because it has higher water solubility compared to pce as shown in table 1 this result emphasizes the fact that chemical properties of the napl have considerable influence on their migration through porous media this result is in agreement with kamaruddin 2012 study in her study she observed that the benzene infiltrated deeper into the porous media as compared to toluene this is most likely due to the difference in the distribution coefficient between benzene and toluene where the distribution coefficient of benzene is 0 142 l kg consequently after toluene reached the water table it floated on the surface of the water table and the downward migration of the toluene ceased as expected fig 7 shows the distribution of toluene in double porosity soil during experiment 3 3 4 lnapl migration in single porosity in experiment 4 toluene was applied to investigate its migration in silica sand as a type of single porosity media the same procedures were followed as mentioned in the previous experiments toluene exhibited the same behaviour as in experiment 3 but the major difference was in the migration velocity when compared to the case of double porosity the explanation of this behaviour is the same as mentioned in section 3 2 this proves that the inter aggregate pores have a significant influence on the fluid migration in porous media through three fluid phase system the distribution of toluene during the experiment is shown in fig 8 from the results of all the experiments it can be summarized that several factors influenced the movement of napl in subsurface systems when three fluid phase existed such as soil types and fluid properties moreover the chemical properties of the napls have a considerable influence on the napl migration 4 conclusion this paper investigated the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil in 2 d experimental models in three fluid phase systems using ltv technique the experiments were repeated by filling the flow chamber with local silica sand as a single porosity soil for comparative purposes the findings show that the dnapl moved horizontally during the initial minutes of migration in double porosity soil before continuing its migration vertically downward to penetrate the water table and then enter the saturated zone the same behaviour was observed in the silica sand but the main difference was in the velocity of migration between the two porous media where the velocity of the dnapl migration in double porosity soil was much faster compared to that in single porosity soil this result is most likely due to the occurrence of inter aggregate pores in double porosity soil which contribute to the increase in fluid velocity through the porous media it was shown that capillary pressure and the wettability of the fluids that exist in the soil pores can also contributed to the results obtained similar behaviour to that of dnapl was seen during the lnapl migration in both types of porous media it was observed that the velocity of the lnapl migration was faster than the velocity of the dnapl migration in both porous media this observation is due to the difference in the chemical properties of the lnapl and dnapl the distribution coefficient of toluene was higher than that of pce which means in turn that the retardation factor of toluene is lower than the retardation factor of pce in the same porous media the study proves that the ltv is a non intrusive and non invasive technique which is able to observe the rapid napl distribution changes in three fluid phase systems in double porosity soil media acknowledgments this research was

phase system air napl water the double porosity characteristics of the soil were created using a composition made up of local sand and sintered kaolin clay spheres arranged in a periodic manner toluene was used to simulate lnapl while tetrachloroethylene pce represented the dnapl both napls were dyed using oil red o for better visualization for comparison purposes the same experiments were carried out using just local silica sand acting as a type of single porosity soil a significant difference in the migration of the toluene and pce was observed as both the napl migration rates in the double porosity medium were much faster compared to the migration rates found in the single porosity medium this result is most likely due to the occurrence of inter aggregate pores in the double porosity soil that contribute to increasing velocity of fluids migration through porous media other factors such as the wettability of fluids and capillary pressure characteristics that exist in the soil pores were found to be influential factors in fluid migration within porous media in addition the results show that chemical properties have a significant influence on the napl migration in porous media it was found that the migration velocity of toluene was much faster compared to the migration velocity of the pce this observation is most likely caused by the fact that the distribution coefficient of toluene was higher than that of pce which in turn means that the retardation factor of toluene is lower than that of pce in the same porous media this paper proved that the ltv provides a non intrusive and non destructive technique for studying multiphase flow in double porosity soil media where rapid changes in fluid distribution in the entire flow domain is not easy to measure

contamination of groundwater and soil by non aqueous phase liquids napls has become a serious and wide spread problem for the environment luciano et al 2012 tick et al 2015 spills of petroleum products and leaks from underground storage tanks are examples of napl releases in the subsurface system generally napls are divided into two main types based on its density dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl which is denser than water and light non aqueous phase liquid lnapl which has density less than water chlorinated solvents such as trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene are the most spread examples of dnapl whereas benzene toluene ethyl benzene and xylene btex are examples of lnapl sweijen et al 2014 when lnapl is released into the subsurface it will migrate downward until it reaches the water table mercer and cohen 1990 for dnapl it is behaviour is similar to lnapl in the unsaturated zone after being released into the subsurface but while lnapl tends to pool on groundwater it encountered dnapl will continue to migrate downward vertically into the saturated zone ngien 2012 it is very important to understand the migration of napls in subsurface systems in order to evaluate the contamination source zones as well as to design relevant remediation schemes zheng et al 2015 investigation of contaminant hydrological processes often relies on indirect measurements such as non invasive techniques werth et al 2010 non invasive techniques can easily investigate the behaviour of fluids flow in the soil samples without disturbing the samples such as x ray gamma ray and photographic methods alazaiza et al 2015 a substantial number of experimental studies have been conducted to investigate the behaviour of immiscible fluids in soils alazaiza et al 2017b pan et al 2016 zheng et al 2015 sa ari et al 2015 ngien et al 2012 bob et al 2008 darnault et al 1998 kechavarzi et al 2005 all these studies were carried out to investigate the behaviour of napl in one or two dimensional two phase napl water systems a few experimental studies on napl migration in three fluid phase systems were found but these were limited to sand being used as the single porosity media darnault et al 2001 kechavarzi et al 2000 schroth et al 1998 in the last few years several non destructive and non intrusive methods used to observe fluid saturation such as x ray attenuation tidwell and glass 1994 and gamma ray techniques høst madsen and jensen 1992 have been reported however these techniques do not allow the observation of dynamic fluid saturation in the whole flow domain at the same time other limitations include long counting times as well as only one point can be acquired at one time darnault et al 1998 due to the mentioned limitations light transmission visualization ltv technique has been gained more attention by several researchers alazaiza et al 2016 bob et al 2008 niemet and selker 2001 zheng et al 2015 a review by alazaiza et al 2015 presented the usage of three types of photographic methods in napl experiments and showed that ltv is a viable method in napl saturation measurements the theory behind the ltv technique is the passing of electromagnetic energy into the test media where the distribution of liquid saturation is measured as variations in the light intensity field there is a linear relationship between saturation and light intensity due to closer matching between the refraction index of the porous media and water relative to the porous media and air glass et al 1989 in ltv systems the change in fluid content and fluid saturation can easily be measured instantaneously due to the utilization of cooled charged coupled device ccd cameras which provide a very high density array of spatial measurements over a very large dynamic range niemet and selker 2001 ltv was first developed by hoa 1981 to measure water content in a 2 d sand filled chamber after that tidwell and glass 1994 used the ltv technique to measure liquid saturation by correlating the number of pores filled with water to the total number of pores across the thickness of the model as well as to water saturation thereafter darnault et al 1998 applied the ltv method to investigate the relationship between hue and water content through full field in a two phase system water oil using the hue saturation and intensity hsi format they found that the major problem in measuring water and napl saturation in the system was due to the similar refraction indices of these liquids several years later darnault et al 2001 developed a method to measure fluid content in a three phase system napl water air after a few years a major contribution to the ltv technique was achieved by bob et al 2008 who studied the quantification of pce saturation in a two dimensional two fluid phase system in single porosity silica sand several characteristics influence the migration of contaminants in the subsurface system one of these characteristics is the soil structure in the natural state many types of soils have two distinct scales of porosity which lead to the term double porosity soil structure carminati et al 2008 double porosity is a natural phenomenon el zein et al 2006 found when two separate pore systems occur simultaneously in the structure of the soil rock aquifers pao and lewis 2002 compacted soils romero et al 1999 and agricultural top soil el zein et al 2006 are examples of geomaterials that potentially harbour double porosity characteristics the aim of this paper is to study the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil in a 2 d flow chamber in three fluid phase system air napl water using the ltv technique to the best knowledge of the authors studying the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil within a three fluid phase system using ltv technique has not been done before the ltv technique was used to qualitatively analyze the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil medium which is useful in designing the remediation methods to achieve the objective of this paper two 2 d laboratory experiments were conducted in order to observe the migration of lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil in three fluid phase system for comparison purpose the same experiments were carried out again but using sand as a single porosity in three fluid phase system section 2 presents the materials and methods that were used section 3 shows the results and the captured images for the behaviour of napls in all soil samples whereas section 4 presents the conclusion of the study and possible future work 2 materials and methods 2 1 double porosity creation the double porosity medium was created using solidified clay spheres and fine sand the solidified clay spheres were made from commercially available kaolin s300 lotte chemical titan malaysia while the sand used was commercial local silica sand lotte chemical titan malaysia physical chemical and mineralogical properties of the materials were characterized as presented in alazaiza et al 2017a double porosity in the soil samples was created following a previous study by lewandowska et al 2005 sintered clay spheres were made by hand where the kaolin powder was mixed with sufficient amount of water to form the spheres before being burned the clay spheres were then put inside the furnace and the temperature was increased gradually until it reached 1000 c this process was to make the kaolin spheres hard as well as to increase their ability to avoid disintegration in case of saturation the size of the spheres was almost similar by visually test the diameter of the sphere was 6 mm scanning electron microscopy sem was conducted with different magnification power to investigate the micro structure of kaolin spheres as shown in fig 1 the sand was washed with distilled water to remove all the fine residuals that might be present as an extra precaution the washing process continued until the absorption of the waste distilled water as measured by a spectrophotometer was similar to the clean rinsing distilled water at the same wavelength thereafter the sand was oven dried for 48 h at 45 c the packing procedure was conducted by pouring the clay spheres layer by layer in such a way that they were touching each other between each layer a 1 cm layer of sand was poured carefully which was then compacted by tapping the outer frame of the model using a plastic hammer the procedure was repeated to obtain the periodic arrangement the total porosity of the system was 0 41 2 2 experimental setup 2 d flow chambers packed with double porosity media were used in this research to study the migration of napls in double porosity media in three fluid phase system using ltv these flow chambers were constructed using 10 mm acrylic material with internal dimensions of 45 cm height 30 cm width 1 cm depth the flow chamber was kept in fixed position inside a steel frame fixed onto a stainless steel light box that contained a light source two ports attached to the bottom of the flow chamber allowed inflow and outflow of fluids the ports were connected to a water tank by plastic tube where a valve between the flow chamber and water tank was used to control the flow of water into the flow chamber the ltv system used in this study was described in detail by alazaiza et al 2017a it consisted mainly of a light source referred to as the light box that had five 18 w fluorescent tubes osram malaysia a holographic light shaping diffuser lsd luminit usa was placed behind the flow chamber and in front of the light source to homogenize the light intensity fig 2 shows a schematic diagram for the light box images were captured using a nikon d 7100 digital camera nikon malaysia which was kept at the same distance of 1 5 m from the light box during all the experiments the camera had a 12 bit dynamic range 4096 gy levels and produced 6000 by 4000 pixels resulting in a very high spatial resolution of 0 07 mm2 per pixel the image acquisition was controlled by connecting the camera to a laptop that was installed with special software nikon camera control pro used to capture the images all images were collected using a 600 nm center wavelength 10 nm band pass filter orientir inc china which was attached to a 67 mm lens nikkor 18 105 mmf 3 5 5 6g ed vr malaysia the aperture setting of the lens was adjusted in order to utilize most of the dynamic range of the camera using exposure times of a few seconds the aperture of the lens was fixed at f 5 6 for all images and the exposure time was 2 s the experiments were carried out inside a dark room constructed from steel bars and covered with a blue cloth as shown in fig 3 the ambient room temperature was kept constant during the experiments at 23 1 c 2 3 experimental procedures to study the napls migration in double porosity three fluid phase system by ltv two experiments were conducted one using dnapl and the second using lnapl both experiments were then repeated but using only sand as the single porosity media to compare the behaviour of the napl in both porous media dnapl movement in the porous media was investigated using tetrachloroethylene pce whereas toluene was used as the lnapl the napls were dyed with oil red o dye powder at a concentration of 0 1 g l this percentage is enough to facilitate a good visual observation of the pce and toluene migration through the acrylic wall of the flow chamber using a small amount of dye is enough as reported by kechavarzi et al 2000 table 1 illustrates the characteristics of both materials in each of the experiments the flow chamber was packed dry with the porous media after the chamber was fully packed with the porous media according to the packing procedure in section 2 1 the top frame of the flow chamber was attached and black silicon was used to seal all gaps after that the packed chamber was purged of air by co2 gas injection for a period of 40 min through the ports at the bottom of the flow chamber and then distilled water was slowly introduced into the flow chamber from the bottom ports under a positive pressure this procedure was carried out to minimize the amount of air entrapment during water imbibition it was assumed that any small quantity of trapped co2 would dissolve in the water from visual observation it was noted that no gas bubbles occurred in the packed flow chamber after water saturation which confirmed that there is no entrapped air in the porous media after 1 h of saturating the flow chamber with water the valve was opened and the water was allowed to drain creating a capillary fringe about 17 cm below the surface of the porous media following schroth et al 1998 the period of water drainage was 12 h prior to the release of the napl before releasing the napl into the flow chamber the camera captured an image for the flow chamber and this image was used as a reference image for the system this image was used later for image subtraction where images with the napl increments were then subtracted from the reference image thereafter in every experiment 20 ml of the napl was injected into the flow chamber using a syringe image acquisition was carried out based on the change of the napl movement and the frequency of image capturing was shown in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 dnapl migration in double porosity after opening the valve a visual observation for the change in the capillary fringe was conducted on the inclination of the water table during draining of the flow chamber from the differences in the transmitted light the areas that have higher water saturation within the porous media can be easily delineated from the areas that have lower water saturation the capillary fringe was clearly distinguished as a dry wet boundary the water continued draining until it reached approximately 35 cm from the top of the flow chamber the upper part is a simulation for three fluid phase system air napl water whereas the lower part is still two fluid phase system napl water as shown in fig 4 after releasing the pce into the flow chamber it started to move horizontally during the first three minutes before migrating vertically downward it was observed that the pce migration was very slow in the three fluid phase system zone compared to its migration velocity in the two fluid phase system zone the pce downward migration took about 176 min to reach the water table which translates to an average velocity of 3 3 10 2 mm s as shown in fig 5 however when the pce entered the two fluid phase system zone its migration rate increased substantially as compared to the velocity in the previous zone this observation was most likely due to the existence of air in the three fluid phase zone when three fluids are present in a subsurface system the largest pores are usually filled with air whereas the smallest pores are occupied by water napls fill the intermediate pores schroth et al 1998 in this experiment the pce migration was very slow in the three fluid phase zone because pce migrated through the intermediate pores and took more time to overcome the capillary pressure to enter the smallest and largest pores in addition another factor that probably influenced the pce migration between the two zones is the wettability of the fluids present in the physical model in the vadose zone simulated by the upper zone in this experiment water is usually a wetting fluid with respect to napl whereas napl is a wetting fluid with respect to air mitchell and soga 2005 at the pore level the capillary pressure forces the wetting fluid to enter the pore and displace the existing fluid inside the pore while the non wetting fluid will be repelled bear 1972 therefore when the pce was released into the flow chamber it would have migrated and infiltrated initially through the air filled pores since the pce is the wetting fluid with respect to air this explanation was validated by observations during the experiment it was noted that some air bubbles were observed at the surface of the flow chamber in the three fluid phase zone which verified the explanation this finding is in agreement with ngien et al 2012b in their study they observed the migration of lnapl in 1 d columns filled with unsaturated double porosity soil media using light reflection method they noted that the wettability has a major influence on the migration of lnapl in double porosity soil moreover they noted the occurrence of air bubbles at the surface of the column that proves the influence of the wettability of fluids on the other hand when the pce entered the two fluid phase zone it continued its migration until it reached the bottom of the flow chamber pce migration took roughly 28 min from the water table until it reached the bottom of the flow chamber with an average velocity of 5 9 10 2 mm s this observation emphasized the wettability influence on the migration of pce between the three fluid phase system and two fluid phase system zones the behaviour of the pce migration is shown in fig 5 3 2 dnapl migration in single porosity a similar experiment with the same conditions as in section 3 1 was conducted but using only silica sand as the single porosity media for comparison purpose similarly 20 ml of pce was injected into the flow chamber under the same flow rate when the valve was opened for water drainage following the same procedures the water level reached 13 cm from the bottom of the flow chamber which is approximately one third of the height of the flow chamber the behaviour of the pce in experiment 2 was almost similar to the behaviour of the pce in experiment 1 upon its release into the flow chamber the pce started to migrate horizontally along the top surface of the flow chamber before migrating vertically downward it was noted that the pce migration was very slow in the upper zone compared to experiment 1 at the same zone the time taken by the pce to reach the water table was 213 min which translates to an average speed of 2 5 10 2 mm s compared to 3 3 10 2 mm s in experiment 1 this observation was most likely due to the occurrence of inter aggregate pores in the double porosity soil media in experiment 1 that played a role in increasing the velocity of fluid through the soil media the presence of inter aggregate pores in double porosity media means that a larger pore volume was present it is known that the large pores contribute to reducing the capillary pressure that the napl need to overcome to go through these pores and thus migrate through the soil therefore the velocity of fluid in double porosity is much faster compared to single porosity this observation is in agreement with ngien et al 2012b in their study they compared the velocity of lnapl migration between single and double porosity soils using light reflection method and reported the same findings the material used to create the double porosity in their study was aggregated kaolin which is differing from the materials used in this study another study conducted by alazaiza et al 2017a confirmed the same results the authors carried out three laboratory experiments where the soil samples were double porosity with different volumetric fractions of inter aggregate pores and intra aggregate pores in each subsequent experiment the fraction of inter aggregate pores was increased by 5 to investigate its influence on dnapl migration for the first experiment the volumetric fraction of 50 inter aggregate pores and 50 of intra aggregate pores were used for the second experiment 55 inter aggregate pores and 45 intra aggregate pores were used while for the third experiment 60 of inter aggregate pores and 40 of intra aggregate pores were used they found that the dnapl migration was much faster in the third experiment which has higher inter aggregate volume which is in consistent with the result in this study furthermore the one way statistical analysis of variance anova p 0 05 was used to validate the accuracy of the experimental results the authors observed that the average velocities in the three experiments were 2 31 2 68 and 2 93 cm min for experiment 1 2 and 3 respectively which prove the same result in addition the pce exhibited the same behaviour in the two fluid phase zone as the pce migration was much faster in the two fluid phase zone compared to the three fluid phase zone in experiment 2 the duration of pce migration from the water table to the bottom of the flow chamber was 44 min which translates to an average speed of 4 9 10 2 mm s compared to 5 9 10 2 mm s in experiment 1 the explanation for this occurrence is basically the same as that given for experiment 1 fig 6 shows the distribution of pce migration during experiment 2 3 3 lnapl migration in double porosity following the same procedures as in the previous experiments 20 ml of toluene was injected into the flow chamber to investigate the behaviour of the lnapl migration in double porosity media in three fluid phase system after opening the valve for water drainage the water level gradually lowered until it reached 12 cm from the bottom of the flow chamber upon its release into the flow chamber the toluene moved horizontally during the first two minutes and then migrated vertically downward until it reached the water table the velocity of toluene migration was much faster compared to the pce migration velocity in the three fluid phase zone toluene took around 98 min to reach the water table compared to 176 min for pce this observation can be explained by the difference in the chemical characteristics between the two materials the significant factor influences the fluid transportation underground is the distribution coefficient kd of substances ruffino and zanetti 2009 the distribution coefficient of toluene and pce reported by ruffino and zanetti 2009 were 0 520 l kg and 0 963 l kg respectively this means that the retardation factor of toluene due to adsorption is lower than that for pce in the same porous media in addition the material solubility in water likely plays a significant role in contaminant migration for the case of existing soil moisture toluene will move faster as expected because it has higher water solubility compared to pce as shown in table 1 this result emphasizes the fact that chemical properties of the napl have considerable influence on their migration through porous media this result is in agreement with kamaruddin 2012 study in her study she observed that the benzene infiltrated deeper into the porous media as compared to toluene this is most likely due to the difference in the distribution coefficient between benzene and toluene where the distribution coefficient of benzene is 0 142 l kg consequently after toluene reached the water table it floated on the surface of the water table and the downward migration of the toluene ceased as expected fig 7 shows the distribution of toluene in double porosity soil during experiment 3 3 4 lnapl migration in single porosity in experiment 4 toluene was applied to investigate its migration in silica sand as a type of single porosity media the same procedures were followed as mentioned in the previous experiments toluene exhibited the same behaviour as in experiment 3 but the major difference was in the migration velocity when compared to the case of double porosity the explanation of this behaviour is the same as mentioned in section 3 2 this proves that the inter aggregate pores have a significant influence on the fluid migration in porous media through three fluid phase system the distribution of toluene during the experiment is shown in fig 8 from the results of all the experiments it can be summarized that several factors influenced the movement of napl in subsurface systems when three fluid phase existed such as soil types and fluid properties moreover the chemical properties of the napls have a considerable influence on the napl migration 4 conclusion this paper investigated the migration of both lnapl and dnapl in double porosity soil in 2 d experimental models in three fluid phase systems using ltv technique the experiments were repeated by filling the flow chamber with local silica sand as a single porosity soil for comparative purposes the findings show that the dnapl moved horizontally during the initial minutes of migration in double porosity soil before continuing its migration vertically downward to penetrate the water table and then enter the saturated zone the same behaviour was observed in the silica sand but the main difference was in the velocity of migration between the two porous media where the velocity of the dnapl migration in double porosity soil was much faster compared to that in single porosity soil this result is most likely due to the occurrence of inter aggregate pores in double porosity soil which contribute to the increase in fluid velocity through the porous media it was shown that capillary pressure and the wettability of the fluids that exist in the soil pores can also contributed to the results obtained similar behaviour to that of dnapl was seen during the lnapl migration in both types of porous media it was observed that the velocity of the lnapl migration was faster than the velocity of the dnapl migration in both porous media this observation is due to the difference in the chemical properties of the lnapl and dnapl the distribution coefficient of toluene was higher than that of pce which means in turn that the retardation factor of toluene is lower than the retardation factor of pce in the same porous media the study proves that the ltv is a non intrusive and non invasive technique which is able to observe the rapid napl distribution changes in three fluid phase systems in double porosity soil media acknowledgments this research was
