university of technology jinan 250353 china substituted chlorobenzenes are the basic substructure of many surface water contaminants in this study the isotope fractionation and reaction mechanisms involved during the aqueous direct and indirect photodegradation of ch3 cl and no2 substituted chlorobenzenes were investigated in laboratory experiments only 4 nitrochlorobenzene showed slow but isotopically fractionating direct photolysis during indirect photodegradation using uv h2o2 generated oh radicals the pseudo first order reaction rate constants increased in the order of the no2 cl ch3 substituted chlorobenzenes the most pronounced carbon enrichment factors were observed for nitrochlorobenzenes up to 4 8 0 5 whereas the lowest were for chlorotoluenes 1 0 0 1 as the substituents became more electron withdrawing the activation energy barrier increased leading to slower reaction rates and the transition state changed to a more symmetrical or less reactant like structure resulting in larger apparent kinetic isotope effects the results suggest that the rate determining step in the reaction with oh radicals was the addition of the electrophile to the benzene ring even though further research is needed to quantify isotope fractionation during other transformation processes these results showed evidence that compound specific isotope analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for the fate of substituted chlorobenzenes in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords photodegradation water quality chlorobenzenes stable isotope oh radicals 1 introduction substituted chlorobenzenes are the basic chemical structure of many environmental contaminants such as herbicides 2 4 d dichlorprop chlortoluron and drugs and personal care products like triclosan and diclofenac in their simplest form substituted chlorobenzenes such as isomers of dichlorobenzene dcb chloromethylbenzene or chlorotoluene cmb and nitrochlorobenzene ncb are widely distributed in surface waters schwarzbauer and ricking 2010 in the low ng l 1 or μg l 1 range bester et al 1998 lekkas et al 2004 trova et al 1991 due to their use as chemical intermediates in the production of dyes solvents pesticides and pharmaceuticals they have all been listed as substances which could belong to list i of european council directive 76 464 eec european commission 1982 due to their known or suspected toxicity to aquatic organisms and mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials calamari et al 1983 oecd 2005 shimizu et al 1983 weisburger et al 1978 the dichlorobenzene isomers also belong to the u s epa list of priority pollutants usepa 1979 characterizing the transfer and transformation processes of substituted chlorobenzenes in surface waters is therefore essential to protect human and aquatic life and develop effective remediation strategies one method that can be used to evaluate in situ transformation compound specific isotope analysis csia is based on the faster reaction rates of molecules containing light e g 12c versus heavy e g 13c isotopes while csia is widely used to study the fate and removal of traditional groundwater contaminants to date its application to other environments such as sediments passeport et al 2016 and surface waters is limited e g elsayed et al 2014 hartenbach et al 2008 maier et al 2016 and ratti et al 2015a in some cases csia can help identify transformation processes that involve the breaking of chemical bonds it can also be used to quantify degradation and gain insight into contaminant reaction mechanisms without the need to identify transformation products hunkeler et al 2008 in natural environments such as lakes and rivers and in water treatment plants where uv h2o2 advanced oxidation processes are used organic compounds can be eliminated via direct photolysis and indirect photolysis induced by reactive species such as hydroxyl oh radicals boreen et al 2003 wols and hofman caris 2012 hydoxyl radicals are naturally generated in all surface water environments from the photolysis of dissolved organic vaughan and blough 1998 and inorganic compounds zafiriou 1974 therefore there is great potential to evaluate the attenuation of contaminants with oh radicals in various aquatic systems using csia which could be a promising tool for water quality monitoring and assessment one of the limitations of stable carbon isotope analysis is the need for about 0 2 20 ng of carbon to be injected on column giebel et al 2010 resulting in typically moderately high detection limits of 5 10 μg l dempster et al 1997 hunkeler and aravena 2000 zwank et al 2005 even though accurate carbon isotope analysis has been successfully conducted down to 0 1 1 μg l schreglmann et al 2013 the reaction mechanisms governing the direct and indirect photodegradation of substituted chlorobenzenes are not well understood in addition the potential of isotope fractionation during photodegradation reactions and the extent to which it can contribute to deciphering reaction pathways have not been the subject of many studies previous research showed that stable carbon enrichment factors ranged from negligible values to 5 e g during direct aqueous photolysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers rosenfelder et al 2011 organophosphorus pesticide dimethoate wu et al 2014 herbicide atrazine hartenbach et al 2008 and α hexachlorocyclohexane zhang et al 2014 previous studies showed that direct photolytic dechlorination of the three chloroaniline isomers was associated with highly variable carbon and nitrogen isotope effects which depended on ph and excited spin state populations ratti et al 2015b 2015c aqueous reactions of organic compounds with oh radicals also led to a similar range of stable carbon enrichment factors hartenbach et al 2008 ratti et al 2015a wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 2016 2015 for example a negligible carbon enrichment factor 0 5 was found during the reaction of oh radicals with atrazine hartenbach et al 2008 as well as for toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and anisole zhang et al 2016 moderate values were obtained for α hexachlorocyclohexane 1 9 zhang et al 2014 and fuel oxygenates 1 0 to 1 6 while larger values up to 3 9 were observed for anilines and nitrobenzene zhang et al 2016 in some cases the determination of isotope fractionation for two or more elements proved efficient to distinguish among degradation processes the apparent kinetic isotope effect values for carbon and nitrogen for the direct ratti et al 2015b 2015c and indirect ratti et al 2015a photodegradation of chloroanilines correlated differently showing potential for the use of csia to differentiate between these chemical degradation pathways however the variability of isotope fractionation during aqueous photodegradation as a function of environmental conditions such as the type of reactive species ph and oxygen concentration hartenbach et al 2008 ratti et al 2015a zhang et al 2015 makes it difficult to predict reaction mechanisms and isotope effect for new molecules the objectives of this study were 1 to estimate the extent of direct photolysis and indirect photolysis using oh radicals for substituted chlorobenzenes in aqueous solutions 2 to quantify stable carbon isotope fractionation during photodegradation 3 to evaluate the potential to use csia to differentiate aqueous photodegradation from other environmentally relevant processes such as biodegradation and 4 to propose reaction mechanisms based on isotopic and kinetics data 2 materials and

2000 nm l2175 hamamatsu japan was used with a filter to cut off radiations below 280 nm to better represent typical wavelengths at the earth s surface the lamp was placed 10 cm away from the reactor a schematic of the experimental system is provided in zhang et al 2016 each experiment was conducted with one of the studied compounds with initial concentrations ranging from 2 10 4 to 7 10 4 m similar to other studies maier et al 2016 ratti et al 2015a and sufficiently low for the solutions to be considered as optically dilute as per oecd guideline 316 oecd 2008 while guaranteeing proper quantification of parent compounds and potential degradation products and accurate determination of stable carbon isotope signatures each solution was prepared in a ph 7 3 aqueous phosphate buffer solution for the indirect photodegradation experiments 0 25 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the solution at the start of the experiment resulting in initial h2o2 concentrations of 12 5 mm and contaminant to h2o2 molar ratios ranging between 1 50 and 1 25 similar to former studies daifullah and mohamed 2004 zhang et al 2016 and approximately one order of magnitude higher than for typical uv h2o2 advanced oxidation treatment processes collins and bolton 2016 this ensured the formation of excess oh radials therefore guaranteeing that direct photolysis and reactions with oh radicals would dominate in the reactors a 200 ml volume of buffered solution was introduced in the reactor leaving an initial reactor headspace of 15 ml the solution was continuously stirred at 500 rpm during the experiment control dark experiments with 0 25 ml of 30 h2o2 were conducted for each compound without light and covering the reactor with aluminum foil to prevent light penetration at each time step 2

photodegradation experiments were analyzed after derivatization derivatization was conducted to identify potential phenolic products as follows 10 mg of nahco3 was mixed into 1 ml of aqueous sample and 5 μl of acetic anhydride 0 05 m was then added to acetylate phenolic groups the mixture was shaken for 20 min at 150 rpm and 0 5 ml of dichloromethane dcm was added before shaking again at 500 rpm for 1 h the dcm extracts were analyzed by gc ms selected samples collected before the last sampling time for concentration measurement of the parent products were also analyzed by gc ms without prior derivatization 2 4 hammett relationship a hammett plot was constructed using the pseudo first order rate constants with respect to the aromatic compound kx obtained from the indirect photodegradation experiments for each chlorobenzene with substituent x placed in meta or para positions i e x cl for 1 3 dcb and 1 4 dcb ch3 for the cmb isomers and no2 for ncbs the rate constants were normalized by the chlorobenzene indirect photodegradation pseudo first order rate constant kh 0 173 h 1 determined under the same experimental conditions by zhang et al 2016 the hammett equation log kx kh ρ σ was fitted to the data and parameter ρ expressing the effect of a substituent on the rate constant was determined graphically the hammett substituent constants σ for meta σ m and para σ p substituents representing the total polar effect exerted by a substituent on the reaction center when a positive charge is delocalized were obtained from hansch et al 1991 due to steric hindrance the hammett relationship is not applicable to ortho substituted compounds such as 1 2 dcb 2 5 isotope data analysis carbon enrichment factors εc were determined from the rayleigh equation eq 1 using the linear regression of ln r r0 as a function of ln f without forcing through zero where r and r0 are the isotopic compositions at any time t 0 and the initial time t0 and f is the fraction of remaining compound at time t calculated based on the stepwise correction method reported by buchner et al 2017 even though virtually no difference were observed in the enrichment factors when determined using the ratio of the concentrations at times t and t0 for f 1 r r 0 f ε c the enrichment factors represent carbon isotope effects for the whole molecule to characterize the isotope effect at the reactive position for each substituted chlorobenzene apparent kinetic isotope effect values for carbon akiec were calculated as in eq 2 elsner et al 2005 2 1 a k i e c z n ε c x 1000 1 where for a given postulated reaction mechanism n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule x is the number of carbon atoms at reactive positions and z is the number of carbon atoms at reactive positions with equal reactivity assuming negligible contribution from secondary kinetic isotope effects kiec i e the reactive positions are associated with primary isotope effect only x z 3 results 3 1 control dark experiments the control dark experiments were conducted for each of the studied chemicals in presence of h2o2 no significant concentration decrease was observed other than the expected headspace losses of 7 due to liquid gas phase re equilibration after each sampling si fig s2 this suggests that the sole presence of h2o2 does not induce degradation of the studied chemicals under the experimental conditions used 3 2 direct photolysis in general direct photolysis through uv light absorption for λ 280 nm did not significantly affect concentrations and isotope values 0 5 of most studied compounds with two exceptions si fig s3 direct photolysis of 1 4 dcb did not seem to produce significant concentration decrease except during the 4 h and 19 h sampling times fig s3 during which the light was off given that the subsequent samples showed constant concentrations and that the δ13c values were within 0 5 for times 0 h 19 h and 24 h this concentration decrease is not due to direct photolysis for the direct photolysis of 4 ncb the δ13c values remained within 0 5 of the initial value of 32 9 for 2 days however subsequently 4 ncb δ13c values became significantly enriched in 13c by up to 2 2 after 4 days when 34 of the initial concentration had disappeared si fig s3 d and s4 this is due to the potential of 4 ncb to partially absorb light at wavelengths higher than the cut off filter at 280 nm see si fig s1 with a maximum absorbance at 281 nm and a corresponding molar absorption coefficient ε 281nm of 3242 m 1 cm 1 applying the beer lambert law the 4 ncb direct photolysis was associated with a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0043 0 0003 h 1 r2 0 97 and an enrichment factor of 5 1 0 4 r2 0 96 over the reduction of 34 of the initial compound si fig s4 and table s2 3 3 indirect photolysis figure 1 presents the kinetics of indirect photodegradation of the studied compounds reacting with oh radicals the reactions followed pseudo first order kinetics with respect to each contaminant with r2 values greater than 0 94 and pseudo first order rate constants kx that increased in the order of ncbs 0 018 and 0 056 h 1 dcbs 0 44 0 66 h 1 and cmbs 1 57 and 3 58 h 1 see si table s2 this is in agreement with previously reported pseudo first order rate constants of related compounds at similar initial concentrations reacting in uv h2o2 systems with similar molar ratio and h2o2 initial concentrations such as substituted benzenes ghaly et al 2001 sundstrom et al 1989 weir et al 1987 e g with values ranging from 0 01 h 1 for nitrobenzene to 0 50 h 1 for n n dimethylaniline zhang et al 2016 the cmbs degraded at the fastest rates with concentrations reaching below detection limit levels after 2 h for 3 cmb and 3 5 h for 4 cmb the calculated indirect photodegradation half live ln 2 kx were 1 0 1 6 h for dcbs 0 2 h for 3 cmb and 0 4 h for 4 cmb and 39 and 12 h for 3 ncb and 4 ncb respectively the hammett plot is shown in fig 2 the linear relationship between log kx kh vs σ showed a good fit r2 0 85 and displayed a negative hammett ρ value of 2 1 suggesting that the reaction rate increases with electron donating groups this is in line with the observed lower half live of cmbs compared to dcbs and ncbs and with previous similar studies of the reaction of substituted benzenes with oh radicals mohan et al 1991 the rayleigh equation was applied as described in eq 1 to determine stable carbon isotope enrichment factors the cmb isotope enrichment factors were insignificant 1 0 0 1 those for the dcb isomers were 1 75 0 04 1 2 dcb 1 0 0 1 1 3 dcb and 1 7 0 2 1 4 dcb whereas those for the ncbs were the highest 3 9 0 3 3 ncb and 4 8 0 5 4 ncb si table s2 and fig 1 the εc values of ncbs were consistent with the 3 9 0 2 value obtained by zhang et al 2016 for nitrobenzene aqueous reaction with oh radicals 3 4 transformation products for each experiment selected samples were analyzed by gc ms to identify remaining degradation products si table s3 the analysis did not reveal any phenolic products except for the reaction of the two cmb isomers with oh radicals for which 2 chloro 6 or 5 methylphenol were detected these results are not consistent with the reported phenolic products obtained from oh radical reactions with substituted benzenes this is likely due to a combination of two factors first the samples that underwent derivatization prior to analysis were those from the last sampling points when the proportions of remaining parent contaminant and intermediate metabolites such as phenolic products were low second the samples collected at intermediate sampling points were analyzed without prior derivatization which would have limited the potential to detect phenolic compounds 4 discussion 4 1 substituted chlorobenzenes are subject to aqueous photodegradation the first finding of this research is that the complete disappearance of the compounds within 2 48 h up to 315 h for 3 ncb the generation of some phenolic degradation products in the case of the cmb isomers and the observed stable carbon isotope fractionation all demonstrate that substituted chlorobenzenes are able to react with photo induced oh radicals in aqueous solution the absence of significant amounts of degradation intermediates was partly explained by the absence of derivatization for intermediate samples but could also show that the degradation products further degrade as well the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of 2 4 dichlorophenol a potential product of the reaction of 1 3 dcb with oh radicals were found to be 3 1 h 1 in h2o2 uv processes and 3 0 and 10 4 h 1 during direct photolysis under similar initial concentration and ph conditions as those used in this study pera titus et al 2004 this is 5 16 times larger than that of 1 3 dcb at 0 66 0 02 h 1 measured here and therefore suggests that detection of phenolic products would have been difficult due to their fast degradation in the reactor the second finding of this study is that 4 ncb can also degrade directly via photolysis even in the absence of reactive species such as oh radicals however this process was much slower k 0 0043 0 0003 h 1 than the reaction of 4 ncb with oh radicals k 0 056 0 001 h 1 and therefore might not be relevant when both processes occur concurrently 4 2 insight into reaction mechanisms 4 2 1 hammett plot the kinetics results showed a linear relationship between log kx kh and σ with a good correlation coefficient r2 0 85 fig 2 this suggests that the reaction of substituted chlorinated benzenes with oh radicals involves one main rate determining step the relatively high magnitude of the proportionality constant ρ with an absolute value greater than 1 shows that the effect of the substituents on the reaction rate is significant the fact that the ρ value is negative 2 1 indicates that the reaction rates increase with electron donating groups ch3 and decrease with electron withdrawing groups cl no2 this is simply another way to note that the reaction rates increase in the order of no2 cl and ch3 substituted chlorobenzenes mohan et al 1991 studied oh radical addition to substituted chlorobenzenes with ch3 and och3 as electron donating groups and cf3 chcl2 and ch2cl as electron withdrawing groups using a similar hammett plot approach they also obtained a negative but smaller slope of 0 52 other studies reported ρ values of 0 41 and 0 5 for the reaction of monosubstituted benzenes with oh radicals anbar et al 1966 neta and dorfman 1968 a negative value for ρ suggests that a positive charge develops at the reaction center in the transition state of the rate determining step of the reaction of substituted chlorinated benzenes with oh radicals this is a characteristic of electrophilic aromatic substitution eas reactions it is well established that oh radical attack on aromatic compounds proceeds via a mechanism analogous to eas anbar et al 1966 for such reactions electron withdrawing groups e g cl no2 increase the energy barrier for the addition of an electrophile in this case the oh radical to the aromatic ring this is due to a combination of transition state destabilization and ground state stabilization and results in a decrease in the reaction rate electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions are a two step process for the reaction of substituted chlorobenzenes with oh radicals the first step is rate determining and involves the formation of a π complex transition state followed by the addition of the oh radical and results in the formation of a sigma complex hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical intermediate the second step consists of the fast elimination of a h atom from the ring to regain its aromaticity leaving a chlorophenolic product smith and norman 1963 the addition of oh radical to the ring and further elimination of a hydrogen atom to recover the ring s aromaticity have been observed during the aqueous reaction of chlorotoluene mohan et al 1991 and nitrochlorobenzene with oh radicals that produced phenolic intermediate compounds guittonneau et al 1990 zhang et al 2016 also identified phenolic intermediates in the reaction of substituted benzenes with oh radicals in the present study phenolic products were observed in the early stage 2 h of the reaction of 3 and 4 cmb with oh radicals with the production of 2 chloro 6 methylphenol and 2 chloro 5 methylphenol respectively this confirms that oh addition to the ring is the most likely rate determining step in the reaction of the studied substituted chlorobenzenes with oh radicals 4 2 2 isotope effects to further elucidate reaction mechanisms akiec values were calculated to characterize the isotope effect of the cleavage of the chemical bond at the reactive positions based on the kinetics results discussed above and former results on cmb and ncb guittonneau et al 1990 mohan et al 1991 oh radical aromatic substitution is expected to be the dominant mechanism for the indirect photodegradation of the substituted chlorobenzenes however zhang et al 2016 showed that the methyl group in toluene could also undergo h abstraction during reaction with oh radicals which could be expected for the cmb isomers however reaction products following attack on the methyl group such as 3 and 4 chlorobenzaldehyde and benzyl alcohols were not observed in the present study while chlorophenols were observed for 3 and 4 cmbs to further evaluate if h abstraction was significant in the akiec value calculations two main reaction pathways were hypothesized oh radical substitution to a h atom attached to one of the unsubstituted carbon atom of the benzene ring and h abstraction from the methyl group in the cmb isomers in addition instead of only considering all unsubstituted carbon atoms from the benzene ring as potential reactive positions the values for x and z in eq 2 for the calculation of the akiec values were determined by considering the substituents ortho meta or para directing effect and whether they were activating or deactivating substituents on the benzene ring see details in si section s5 the calculated akiec values are summarized in si table s2 by analogy with the conceptual framework developed for enzyme catalyzed reactions we can represent the reaction of the x substituted chlorobenzenes with oh radicals as shown in scheme 1 where a hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical intermediate is formed this let us introduce a commitment factor c such that c k2 k 1 in the expression of akiec 3 a k i e c k i e c c 1 c where kiec is the intrinsic kinetic isotope effect that depends only on the irreversible reaction step 4 k i e c k 2 l k 2 h equation 3 assumes that the first reversible step is associated with negligible isotope effects as it is not expected for k 1 to be significant i e the addition of the oh radical to the aromatic ring is not easily reversible k2 k 1 resulting in large values for c regardless of the substituent and its position with large c values equivalent to a very efficient enzymatic reaction the akiec values are reduced masked and tend to be closer to unity rather than representing the intrinsic kiec all akiec values showed normal kinetic isotope effects akiec 1 si table s2 under the assumption of oh radical electrophilic aromatic substitution the akiec values were very close to unity for the dcb and cmb isomers and somewhat higher for 3 ncb 1 024 0 004 and 4 ncb 1 030 0 004 the absolute magnitude of the enrichment factors and the akiec values for the meta substituted chlorobenzenes were always lower than those of their para substituted counterparts given that the meta substituted chlorobenzenes reacted faster than their para substituted counterparts c meta c para this resulted in the observed lower akiecmeta than akiecpara and therefore more masking of the intrinsic kiec in the meta substituted chlorobenzenes compared to their para substituted counterparts theoretical and experimental kiec values obtained for c o bond formation on alkenes typically range from 0 998 to 1 024 for chemical oxidations with permanganate and epoxidation reactions elsner et al 2005 singleton et al 1997 singleton and wang 2005 the oxidation on a ring can be expected to be associated with even larger kiec values due to the larger energy barrier of the reaction to break a ring s aromaticity indeed reported experimental akiec values for c o bond formation during ring hydroxylation ranged from 1 005 to 1 026 in biodegradation experiments and from 1 029 to 1 051 for abiotic experiments of gas phase oh radical addition to various aromatic compounds si table s4 to the best of our knowledge the only theoretical kiec values calculated for the ring addition of oh radicals are those reported in zhang et al 2016 for oh addition to the para position of various substituted benzenes and ranged from 1 0239 to 1 0316 while the akiec values of the two ncb isomers were within these ranges those for the cmb and the dcb isomers were lower 1 002 1 011 possibly due to a masking effect given that the reactor was continuously stirred the reaction rates were expected to be diffusion controlled possible explanations proposed for the masking of the kiec in substituted benzenes zhang et al 2016 could apply here as well such as the formation of the π complex transition state prior to oh radical addition in step 1 of scheme 1 and pre equilibrium between the substituted chlorobenzene and the oh radical prior to the rate determining step a recent study proposed that the creation of a water cage could account for masking of intrinsic kie kopinke and georgi 2017 this cage effect was explained by the trapping of the oh radical and substrate in the water shell formed by complex interaction of the hydrophobic solute with the surrounding water molecules the correlation between akiec values and molecules hydrophobicity log kow values was used to evaluate this assumption a good correlation r2 0 83 was found for the molecules studied in the present study si fig s5 however a poor correlation r2 0 46 was obtained when analyzing the dependency of akiec of substituted benzenes using data from zhang et al 2016 si fig s5 suggesting that the molecular structure of the organic substrate was the main factor driving fractionation the relationship between akiec values and substituents hammett constants suggests that the electronic structure of the organic molecules was the major factor governing isotope fractionation for radical reactions in water more research may be needed to validate the cage effect as a potential contributor to kiec masking in oh radical aqueous reactions under the scenario of oh radical addition to a substituted carbon atom involving the breaking of a c cl c n or c c bond the same values for akiec as those for oh radical addition to an unsubstituted carbon atom were obtained si section s5 however these akiec values were significantly lower than the theoretical kiec streitwieser limits for these cleavages i e 1 057 for c cl 1 060 for c n and 1 049 for c c elsner et al 2005 which were obtained under the assumption that the bond is broken during the transition state when considering a more realistic assumption e g that the bond is 50 broken half these limits can be considered even in this case the theoretical kiec values are still higher than the calculated akiec values except for c n cleavage in the ncb isomers confirming that the breaking of a c x bond in the rate determining step is unlikely finally akiec values of 1 002 and 1 007 for 3 and 4 cmb respectively were obtained when assuming h abstraction on the ch3 group of the cmb isomers these were lower than theoretical kiec values of 1 020 expected for c h bond cleavage elsner et al 2005 suggesting that oh radical addition to an unsubstituted carbon atom likely played a more dominant role than h abstraction in the reaction of the cmb isomers with oh radicals this is in line with the higher contribution of oh addition relative to h abstraction observed for toluene zhang et al 2016 it is also confirmed by the detection of phenol intermediates in the indirect photodegradation experiments with cmb isomers which supports a preferential attack of the oh radicals to the ring rather than the methyl group finally this is also the main reaction mechanism proposed for the reaction of chlorotoluene isomers with oh radicals in distilled water mohan et al 1991 the εc and akiec values increased with increasing hammett substituent constants σ fig 3 the most electron withdrawing substituents led to the highest carbon isotope fractionation this suggests that the transition state might be more symmetrical for the reaction of oh radicals with the ncb and dcb isomers than for the cmbs more data are needed to propose a quantitative relationship between isotope fractionation and substituent constants and to provide a mechanistic interpretation for such a relationship the influence of the electronic properties of aromatic substituents on isotope effects was observed for nitrogen isotope fractionation during the oxidation of substituted anilines ratti et al 2015a skarpeli liati et al 2011 skarpeli liati et al 2012 while no substituent effect was observed for the abiotic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds hofstetter et al 2008a based on these kinetics and isotope results the proposed dominant reaction pathway for the studied compounds involves the initial formation of a c o bond at one of the unsubstituted carbon atoms on the benzene ring during the rate determining step followed by the release of a h atom scheme 1 4 3 potential to use csia to distinguish between aqueous photodegradation and other processes the negligible isotope fractionation observed for the cmb isomers prevents stable carbon isotope analysis to be used as an identification tool for cmb aqueous photodegradation conversely the ncbs and to a lower extent the dcbs showed quantifiable carbon isotope fractionation during their reaction with oh radicals while transformation reactions may produce significant isotope fractionation typically negligible carbon isotope fractionation is associated with transfer mechanisms such as equilibrium adsorption harrington et al 1999 passeport et al 2014 diffusion passeport et al 2014 xu et al 2016 and volatilization harrington et al 1999 at least at scales relevant to most field sampling strategies xu et al 2016 2017 table s5 in si summarizes published carbon isotope enrichment factors for various transformation processes of substituted chlorobenzenes that could occur concurrently with indirect photodegradation e g microbial degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions abiotic processes and direct photodegradation because significant gaps still exist in the assessment of carbon isotope enrichment factors for these compounds those of related compounds were reported as well during anaerobic microbial degradation 1 3 dcb and 1 4 dcb produce significant isotope fractionation with εc values of 5 4 0 4 and 6 3 0 2 respectively while 1 2 dcb is associated with a low enrichment factor of 0 8 0 1 liang et al 2014 while the large εc values of 1 3 and 1 4 dcb would prevent the use of stable carbon isotope analysis to distinguish between anaerobic biodegradation and reaction with oh radicals situations where both processes occur simultaneously are rare indeed indirect aqueous photodegradation is only relevant in surface waters where oxygenated conditions dominate in aquatic surface environments such as rivers wetlands and oceans the concentrations in oxygen tao et al 2006 and oh radicals zhou and mopper 1990 decrease with depth and anaerobic zones are usually limited to the sediment phase or water depths at which reactions with oh radicals are not expected no carbon isotope enrichment factors have been reported for the aerobic biodegradation of dcb isomers however negligible carbon isotope fractionation 0 4 0 1 was observed for chlorobenzene kaschl et al 2005 and 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene griebler et al 2004 liang et al 2011 suggesting that dcbs might also be associated with small εc values during aerobic biodegradation there is therefore potential to use csia to identify indirect aqueous photodegradation of the dcb isomers for ncbs the only other published εc value 0 65 is that associated with the abiotic reduction of 4 ncb in suspensions of fe ii goethite hartenbach et al 2006 no information on stable carbon isotope fractionation exists for the aerobic or anaerobic biodegradation of ncb isomers however nitrobenzene was studied under aerobic conditions and exhibited εc values of 0 57 0 06 during aerobic partial reduction by pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain js45 hofstetter et al 2008b and between 3 5 0 2 and 3 9 0 2 for nitrobenzene aerobic oxidation with various bacteria strains cell extracts and enzymes hofstetter et al 2008b pati et al 2014 smaller εc values were obtained for the aerobic oxidation of 2 3 4 and 2 6 di nitrotoluene ranging from 0 4 0 2 and 1 4 0 4 pati et al 2014 2016 altogether these results suggest that the aerobic biodegradation of ncb isomers could produce stable carbon isotope fractionation within a similar range as that reported here for their reaction with oh radicals these effects should be evaluated in future studies before csia can be used as a diagnostic tool for ncb fate in surface water environments 5 conclusions results from i the hammett relationship ii the stable carbon isotope analysis iii degradation product analysis and iv former literature studies provided multiple lines of evidence that the reaction of oh radicals with substituted chlorobenzenes proceeds primarily via oh aromatic substitution involving first the rate determining c o bond formation followed by h release the substituents on the chlorobenzene structure affected both reactivity and stable carbon isotope fractionation while the carbon isotope enrichment factors obtained in this study were small they will likely be sufficient to identify indirect photodegradation of the ncb and potentially the dcb isomers provided that at least 40 of the ncbs and 70 87 of the dcbs degrade via reaction with oh radicals in order to conclusively assess the diagnostic capabilities of csia for substituted chlorobenzenes further research should be conducted with more complex water matrices acknowledgements this research has been financially supported by the european union under the 7th framework program

university of technology jinan 250353 china substituted chlorobenzenes are the basic substructure of many surface water contaminants in this study the isotope fractionation and reaction mechanisms involved during the aqueous direct and indirect photodegradation of ch3 cl and no2 substituted chlorobenzenes were investigated in laboratory experiments only 4 nitrochlorobenzene showed slow but isotopically fractionating direct photolysis during indirect photodegradation using uv h2o2 generated oh radicals the pseudo first order reaction rate constants increased in the order of the no2 cl ch3 substituted chlorobenzenes the most pronounced carbon enrichment factors were observed for nitrochlorobenzenes up to 4 8 0 5 whereas the lowest were for chlorotoluenes 1 0 0 1 as the substituents became more electron withdrawing the activation energy barrier increased leading to slower reaction rates and the transition state changed to a more symmetrical or less reactant like structure resulting in larger apparent kinetic isotope effects the results suggest that the rate determining step in the reaction with oh radicals was the addition of the electrophile to the benzene ring even though further research is needed to quantify isotope fractionation during other transformation processes these results showed evidence that compound specific isotope analysis can be used as a diagnostic tool for the fate of substituted chlorobenzenes in water graphical abstract image 1 keywords photodegradation water quality chlorobenzenes stable isotope oh radicals 1 introduction substituted chlorobenzenes are the basic chemical structure of many environmental contaminants such as herbicides 2 4 d dichlorprop chlortoluron and drugs and personal care products like triclosan and diclofenac in their simplest form substituted chlorobenzenes such as isomers of dichlorobenzene dcb chloromethylbenzene or chlorotoluene cmb and nitrochlorobenzene ncb are widely distributed in surface waters schwarzbauer and ricking 2010 in the low ng l 1 or μg l 1 range bester et al 1998 lekkas et al 2004 trova et al 1991 due to their use as chemical intermediates in the production of dyes solvents pesticides and pharmaceuticals they have all been listed as substances which could belong to list i of european council directive 76 464 eec european commission 1982 due to their known or suspected toxicity to aquatic organisms and mutagenic and carcinogenic potentials calamari et al 1983 oecd 2005 shimizu et al 1983 weisburger et al 1978 the dichlorobenzene isomers also belong to the u s epa list of priority pollutants usepa 1979 characterizing the transfer and transformation processes of substituted chlorobenzenes in surface waters is therefore essential to protect human and aquatic life and develop effective remediation strategies one method that can be used to evaluate in situ transformation compound specific isotope analysis csia is based on the faster reaction rates of molecules containing light e g 12c versus heavy e g 13c isotopes while csia is widely used to study the fate and removal of traditional groundwater contaminants to date its application to other environments such as sediments passeport et al 2016 and surface waters is limited e g elsayed et al 2014 hartenbach et al 2008 maier et al 2016 and ratti et al 2015a in some cases csia can help identify transformation processes that involve the breaking of chemical bonds it can also be used to quantify degradation and gain insight into contaminant reaction mechanisms without the need to identify transformation products hunkeler et al 2008 in natural environments such as lakes and rivers and in water treatment plants where uv h2o2 advanced oxidation processes are used organic compounds can be eliminated via direct photolysis and indirect photolysis induced by reactive species such as hydroxyl oh radicals boreen et al 2003 wols and hofman caris 2012 hydoxyl radicals are naturally generated in all surface water environments from the photolysis of dissolved organic vaughan and blough 1998 and inorganic compounds zafiriou 1974 therefore there is great potential to evaluate the attenuation of contaminants with oh radicals in various aquatic systems using csia which could be a promising tool for water quality monitoring and assessment one of the limitations of stable carbon isotope analysis is the need for about 0 2 20 ng of carbon to be injected on column giebel et al 2010 resulting in typically moderately high detection limits of 5 10 μg l dempster et al 1997 hunkeler and aravena 2000 zwank et al 2005 even though accurate carbon isotope analysis has been successfully conducted down to 0 1 1 μg l schreglmann et al 2013 the reaction mechanisms governing the direct and indirect photodegradation of substituted chlorobenzenes are not well understood in addition the potential of isotope fractionation during photodegradation reactions and the extent to which it can contribute to deciphering reaction pathways have not been the subject of many studies previous research showed that stable carbon enrichment factors ranged from negligible values to 5 e g during direct aqueous photolysis of polybrominated diphenyl ethers rosenfelder et al 2011 organophosphorus pesticide dimethoate wu et al 2014 herbicide atrazine hartenbach et al 2008 and α hexachlorocyclohexane zhang et al 2014 previous studies showed that direct photolytic dechlorination of the three chloroaniline isomers was associated with highly variable carbon and nitrogen isotope effects which depended on ph and excited spin state populations ratti et al 2015b 2015c aqueous reactions of organic compounds with oh radicals also led to a similar range of stable carbon enrichment factors hartenbach et al 2008 ratti et al 2015a wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 2016 2015 for example a negligible carbon enrichment factor 0 5 was found during the reaction of oh radicals with atrazine hartenbach et al 2008 as well as for toluene ethylbenzene xylenes and anisole zhang et al 2016 moderate values were obtained for α hexachlorocyclohexane 1 9 zhang et al 2014 and fuel oxygenates 1 0 to 1 6 while larger values up to 3 9 were observed for anilines and nitrobenzene zhang et al 2016 in some cases the determination of isotope fractionation for two or more elements proved efficient to distinguish among degradation processes the apparent kinetic isotope effect values for carbon and nitrogen for the direct ratti et al 2015b 2015c and indirect ratti et al 2015a photodegradation of chloroanilines correlated differently showing potential for the use of csia to differentiate between these chemical degradation pathways however the variability of isotope fractionation during aqueous photodegradation as a function of environmental conditions such as the type of reactive species ph and oxygen concentration hartenbach et al 2008 ratti et al 2015a zhang et al 2015 makes it difficult to predict reaction mechanisms and isotope effect for new molecules the objectives of this study were 1 to estimate the extent of direct photolysis and indirect photolysis using oh radicals for substituted chlorobenzenes in aqueous solutions 2 to quantify stable carbon isotope fractionation during photodegradation 3 to evaluate the potential to use csia to differentiate aqueous photodegradation from other environmentally relevant processes such as biodegradation and 4 to propose reaction mechanisms based on isotopic and kinetics data 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals hydrogen peroxide h2o2 30 w w n pentane and sodium chloride nacl were obtained from merck darmstadt germany the 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 dichlorobenzene 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 dcb 3 and 4 nitrochlorobenzene 3 and 4 ncb and 3 and 4 chloro methylbenzene 3 and 4 cmb isomers were purchased from sigma aldrich all chemicals were of analytical grade a solution of phosphate buffer 10 mm ph 7 3 was made with na2hpo4 and nah2po4 ultrapure water milli q system millipore gmbh schwalbach ts germany was used to prepare the standards and ph buffer 2 2 photodegradation experiments all experiments were conducted using a 215 ml pyrex cylindrical reactor vessel with a 28 cm2 quartz window the double layer reactor wall allowed for controlling the reactor temperature at 20 c a 150 w xenon lamp 185 2000 nm l2175 hamamatsu japan was used with a filter to cut off radiations below 280 nm to better represent typical wavelengths at the earth s surface the lamp was placed 10 cm away from the reactor a schematic of the experimental system is provided in zhang et al 2016 each experiment was conducted with one of the studied compounds with initial concentrations ranging from 2 10 4 to 7 10 4 m similar to other studies maier et al 2016 ratti et al 2015a and sufficiently low for the solutions to be considered as optically dilute as per oecd guideline 316 oecd 2008 while guaranteeing proper quantification of parent compounds and potential degradation products and accurate determination of stable carbon isotope signatures each solution was prepared in a ph 7 3 aqueous phosphate buffer solution for the indirect photodegradation experiments 0 25 ml of 30 h2o2 was added to the solution at the start of the experiment resulting in initial h2o2 concentrations of 12 5 mm and contaminant to h2o2 molar ratios ranging between 1 50 and 1 25 similar to former studies daifullah and mohamed 2004 zhang et al 2016 and approximately one order of magnitude higher than for typical uv h2o2 advanced oxidation treatment processes collins and bolton 2016 this ensured the formation of excess oh radials therefore guaranteeing that direct photolysis and reactions with oh radicals would dominate in the reactors a 200 ml volume of buffered solution was introduced in the reactor leaving an initial reactor headspace of 15 ml the solution was continuously stirred at 500 rpm during the experiment control dark experiments with 0 25 ml of 30 h2o2 were conducted for each compound without light and covering the reactor with aluminum foil to prevent light penetration at each time step 2 and 3 ml samples were collected for concentration and stable carbon isotope analysis respectively at the end of each experiment a 10 ml sample was collected for product identification by gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms the uv absorbance peaks of all studied compounds were determined using a uv vis nir lambda 900 spectrophotometer perkin elmer instruments supplemental

photodegradation experiments were analyzed after derivatization derivatization was conducted to identify potential phenolic products as follows 10 mg of nahco3 was mixed into 1 ml of aqueous sample and 5 μl of acetic anhydride 0 05 m was then added to acetylate phenolic groups the mixture was shaken for 20 min at 150 rpm and 0 5 ml of dichloromethane dcm was added before shaking again at 500 rpm for 1 h the dcm extracts were analyzed by gc ms selected samples collected before the last sampling time for concentration measurement of the parent products were also analyzed by gc ms without prior derivatization 2 4 hammett relationship a hammett plot was constructed using the pseudo first order rate constants with respect to the aromatic compound kx obtained from the indirect photodegradation experiments for each chlorobenzene with substituent x placed in meta or para positions i e x cl for 1 3 dcb and 1 4 dcb ch3 for the cmb isomers and no2 for ncbs the rate constants were normalized by the chlorobenzene indirect photodegradation pseudo first order rate constant kh 0 173 h 1 determined under the same experimental conditions by zhang et al 2016 the hammett equation log kx kh ρ σ was fitted to the data and parameter ρ expressing the effect of a substituent on the rate constant was determined graphically the hammett substituent constants σ for meta σ m and para σ p substituents representing the total polar effect exerted by a substituent on the reaction center when a positive charge is delocalized were obtained from hansch et al 1991 due to steric hindrance the hammett relationship is not applicable to ortho substituted compounds such as 1 2 dcb 2 5 isotope data analysis carbon enrichment factors εc were determined from the rayleigh equation eq 1 using the linear regression of ln r r0 as a function of ln f without forcing through zero where r and r0 are the isotopic compositions at any time t 0 and the initial time t0 and f is the fraction of remaining compound at time t calculated based on the stepwise correction method reported by buchner et al 2017 even though virtually no difference were observed in the enrichment factors when determined using the ratio of the concentrations at times t and t0 for f 1 r r 0 f ε c the enrichment factors represent carbon isotope effects for the whole molecule to characterize the isotope effect at the reactive position for each substituted chlorobenzene apparent kinetic isotope effect values for carbon akiec were calculated as in eq 2 elsner et al 2005 2 1 a k i e c z n ε c x 1000 1 where for a given postulated reaction mechanism n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule x is the number of carbon atoms at reactive positions and z is the number of carbon atoms at reactive positions with equal reactivity assuming negligible contribution from secondary kinetic isotope effects kiec i e the reactive positions are associated with primary isotope effect only x z 3 results 3 1 control dark experiments the control dark experiments were conducted for each of the studied chemicals in presence of h2o2 no significant concentration decrease was observed other than the expected headspace losses of 7 due to liquid gas phase re equilibration after each sampling si fig s2 this suggests that the sole presence of h2o2 does not induce degradation of the studied chemicals under the experimental conditions used 3 2 direct photolysis in general direct photolysis through uv light absorption for λ 280 nm did not significantly affect concentrations and isotope values 0 5 of most studied compounds with two exceptions si fig s3 direct photolysis of 1 4 dcb did not seem to produce significant concentration decrease except during the 4 h and 19 h sampling times fig s3 during which the light was off given that the subsequent samples showed constant concentrations and that the δ13c values were within 0 5 for times 0 h 19 h and 24 h this concentration decrease is not due to direct photolysis for the direct photolysis of 4 ncb the δ13c values remained within 0 5 of the initial value of 32 9 for 2 days however subsequently 4 ncb δ13c values became significantly enriched in 13c by up to 2 2 after 4 days when 34 of the initial concentration had disappeared si fig s3 d and s4 this is due to the potential of 4 ncb to partially absorb light at wavelengths higher than the cut off filter at 280 nm see si fig s1 with a maximum absorbance at 281 nm and a corresponding molar absorption coefficient ε 281nm of 3242 m 1 cm 1 applying the beer lambert law the 4 ncb direct photolysis was associated with a first order degradation rate constant of 0 0043 0 0003 h 1 r2 0 97 and an enrichment factor of 5 1 0 4 r2 0 96 over the reduction of 34 of the initial compound si fig s4 and table s2 3 3 indirect photolysis figure 1 presents the kinetics of indirect photodegradation of the studied compounds reacting with oh radicals the reactions followed pseudo first order kinetics with respect to each contaminant with r2 values greater than 0 94 and pseudo first order rate constants kx that increased in the order of ncbs 0 018 and 0 056 h 1 dcbs 0 44 0 66 h 1 and cmbs 1 57 and 3 58 h 1 see si table s2 this is in agreement with previously reported pseudo first order rate constants of related compounds at similar initial concentrations reacting in uv h2o2 systems with similar molar ratio and h2o2 initial concentrations such as substituted benzenes ghaly et al 2001 sundstrom et al 1989 weir et al 1987 e g with values ranging from 0 01 h 1 for nitrobenzene to 0 50 h 1 for n n dimethylaniline zhang et al 2016 the cmbs degraded at the fastest rates with concentrations reaching below detection limit levels after 2 h for 3 cmb and 3 5 h for 4 cmb the calculated indirect photodegradation half live ln 2 kx were 1 0 1 6 h for dcbs 0 2 h for 3 cmb and 0 4 h for 4 cmb and 39 and 12 h for 3 ncb and 4 ncb respectively the hammett plot is shown in fig 2 the linear relationship between log kx kh vs σ showed a good fit r2 0 85 and displayed a negative hammett ρ value of 2 1 suggesting that the reaction rate increases with electron donating groups this is in line with the observed lower half live of cmbs compared to dcbs and ncbs and with previous similar studies of the reaction of substituted benzenes with oh radicals mohan et al 1991 the rayleigh equation was applied as described in eq 1 to determine stable carbon isotope enrichment factors the cmb isotope enrichment factors were insignificant 1 0 0 1 those for the dcb isomers were 1 75 0 04 1 2 dcb 1 0 0 1 1 3 dcb and 1 7 0 2 1 4 dcb whereas those for the ncbs were the highest 3 9 0 3 3 ncb and 4 8 0 5 4 ncb si table s2 and fig 1 the εc values of ncbs were consistent with the 3 9 0 2 value obtained by zhang et al 2016 for nitrobenzene aqueous reaction with oh radicals 3 4 transformation products for each experiment selected samples were analyzed by gc ms to identify remaining degradation products si table s3 the analysis did not reveal any phenolic products except for the reaction of the two cmb isomers with oh radicals for which 2 chloro 6 or 5 methylphenol were detected these results are not consistent with the reported phenolic products obtained from oh radical reactions with substituted benzenes this is likely due to a combination of two factors first the samples that underwent derivatization prior to analysis were those from the last sampling points when the proportions of remaining parent contaminant and intermediate metabolites such as phenolic products were low second the samples collected at intermediate sampling points were analyzed without prior derivatization which would have limited the potential to detect phenolic compounds 4 discussion 4 1 substituted chlorobenzenes are subject to aqueous photodegradation the first finding of this research is that the complete disappearance of the compounds within 2 48 h up to 315 h for 3 ncb the generation of some phenolic degradation products in the case of the cmb isomers and the observed stable carbon isotope fractionation all demonstrate that substituted chlorobenzenes are able to react with photo induced oh radicals in aqueous solution the absence of significant amounts of degradation intermediates was partly explained by the absence of derivatization for intermediate samples but could also show that the degradation products further degrade as well the pseudo first order degradation rate constants of 2 4 dichlorophenol a potential product of the reaction of 1 3 dcb with oh radicals were found to be 3 1 h 1 in h2o2 uv processes and 3 0 and 10 4 h 1 during direct photolysis under similar initial concentration and ph conditions as those used in this study pera titus et al 2004 this is 5 16 times larger than that of 1 3 dcb at 0 66 0 02 h 1 measured here and therefore suggests that detection of phenolic products would have been difficult due to their fast degradation in the reactor the second finding of this study is that 4 ncb can also degrade directly via photolysis even in the absence of reactive species such as oh radicals however this process was much slower k 0 0043 0 0003 h 1 than the reaction of 4 ncb with oh radicals k 0 056 0 001 h 1 and therefore might not be relevant when both processes occur concurrently 4 2 insight into reaction mechanisms 4 2 1 hammett plot the kinetics results showed a linear relationship between log kx kh and σ with a good correlation coefficient r2 0 85 fig 2 this suggests that the reaction of substituted chlorinated benzenes with oh radicals involves one main rate determining step the relatively high magnitude of the proportionality constant ρ with an absolute value greater than 1 shows that the effect of the substituents on the reaction rate is significant the fact that the ρ value is negative 2 1 indicates that the reaction rates increase with electron donating groups ch3 and decrease with electron withdrawing groups cl no2 this is simply another way to note that the reaction rates increase in the order of no2 cl and ch3 substituted chlorobenzenes mohan et al 1991 studied oh radical addition to substituted chlorobenzenes with ch3 and och3 as electron donating groups and cf3 chcl2 and ch2cl as electron withdrawing groups using a similar hammett plot approach they also obtained a negative but smaller slope of 0 52 other studies reported ρ values of 0 41 and 0 5 for the reaction of monosubstituted benzenes with oh radicals anbar et al 1966 neta and dorfman 1968 a negative value for ρ suggests that a positive charge develops at the reaction center in the transition state of the rate determining step of the reaction of substituted chlorinated benzenes with oh radicals this is a characteristic of electrophilic aromatic substitution eas reactions it is well established that oh radical attack on aromatic compounds proceeds via a mechanism analogous to eas anbar et al 1966 for such reactions electron withdrawing groups e g cl no2 increase the energy barrier for the addition of an electrophile in this case the oh radical to the aromatic ring this is due to a combination of transition state destabilization and ground state stabilization and results in a decrease in the reaction rate electrophilic aromatic substitution reactions are a two step process for the reaction of substituted chlorobenzenes with oh radicals the first step is rate determining and involves the formation of a π complex transition state followed by the addition of the oh radical and results in the formation of a sigma complex hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical intermediate the second step consists of the fast elimination of a h atom from the ring to regain its aromaticity leaving a chlorophenolic product smith and norman 1963 the addition of oh radical to the ring and further elimination of a hydrogen atom to recover the ring s aromaticity have been observed during the aqueous reaction of chlorotoluene mohan et al 1991 and nitrochlorobenzene with oh radicals that produced phenolic intermediate compounds guittonneau et al 1990 zhang et al 2016 also identified phenolic intermediates in the reaction of substituted benzenes with oh radicals in the present study phenolic products were observed in the early stage 2 h of the reaction of 3 and 4 cmb with oh radicals with the production of 2 chloro 6 methylphenol and 2 chloro 5 methylphenol respectively this confirms that oh addition to the ring is the most likely rate determining step in the reaction of the studied substituted chlorobenzenes with oh radicals 4 2 2 isotope effects to further elucidate reaction mechanisms akiec values were calculated to characterize the isotope effect of the cleavage of the chemical bond at the reactive positions based on the kinetics results discussed above and former results on cmb and ncb guittonneau et al 1990 mohan et al 1991 oh radical aromatic substitution is expected to be the dominant mechanism for the indirect photodegradation of the substituted chlorobenzenes however zhang et al 2016 showed that the methyl group in toluene could also undergo h abstraction during reaction with oh radicals which could be expected for the cmb isomers however reaction products following attack on the methyl group such as 3 and 4 chlorobenzaldehyde and benzyl alcohols were not observed in the present study while chlorophenols were observed for 3 and 4 cmbs to further evaluate if h abstraction was significant in the akiec value calculations two main reaction pathways were hypothesized oh radical substitution to a h atom attached to one of the unsubstituted carbon atom of the benzene ring and h abstraction from the methyl group in the cmb isomers in addition instead of only considering all unsubstituted carbon atoms from the benzene ring as potential reactive positions the values for x and z in eq 2 for the calculation of the akiec values were determined by considering the substituents ortho meta or para directing effect and whether they were activating or deactivating substituents on the benzene ring see details in si section s5 the calculated akiec values are summarized in si table s2 by analogy with the conceptual framework developed for enzyme catalyzed reactions we can represent the reaction of the x substituted chlorobenzenes with oh radicals as shown in scheme 1 where a hydroxycyclohexadienyl radical intermediate is formed this let us introduce a commitment factor c such that c k2 k 1 in the expression of akiec 3 a k i e c k i e c c 1 c where kiec is the intrinsic kinetic isotope effect that depends only on the irreversible reaction step 4 k i e c k 2 l k 2 h equation 3 assumes that the first reversible step is associated with negligible isotope effects as it is not expected for k 1 to be significant i e the addition of the oh radical to the aromatic ring is not easily reversible k2 k 1 resulting in large values for c regardless of the substituent and its position with large c values equivalent to a very efficient enzymatic reaction the akiec values are reduced masked and tend to be closer to unity rather than representing the intrinsic kiec all akiec values showed normal kinetic isotope effects akiec 1 si table s2 under the assumption of oh radical electrophilic aromatic substitution the akiec values were very close to unity for the dcb and cmb isomers and somewhat higher for 3 ncb 1 024 0 004 and 4 ncb 1 030 0 004 the absolute magnitude of the enrichment factors and the akiec values for the meta substituted chlorobenzenes were always lower than those of their para substituted counterparts given that the meta substituted chlorobenzenes reacted faster than their para substituted counterparts c meta c para this resulted in the observed lower akiecmeta than akiecpara and therefore more masking of the intrinsic kiec in the meta substituted chlorobenzenes compared to their para substituted counterparts theoretical and experimental kiec values obtained for c o bond formation on alkenes typically range from 0 998 to 1 024 for chemical oxidations with permanganate and epoxidation reactions elsner et al 2005 singleton et al 1997 singleton and wang 2005 the oxidation on a ring can be expected to be associated with even larger kiec values due to the larger energy barrier of the reaction to break a ring s aromaticity indeed reported experimental akiec values for c o bond formation during ring hydroxylation ranged from 1 005 to 1 026 in biodegradation experiments and from 1 029 to 1 051 for abiotic experiments of gas phase oh radical addition to various aromatic compounds si table s4 to the best of our knowledge the only theoretical kiec values calculated for the ring addition of oh radicals are those reported in zhang et al 2016 for oh addition to the para position of various substituted benzenes and ranged from 1 0239 to 1 0316 while the akiec values of the two ncb isomers were within these ranges those for the cmb and the dcb isomers were lower 1 002 1 011 possibly due to a masking effect given that the reactor was continuously stirred the reaction rates were expected to be diffusion controlled possible explanations proposed for the masking of the kiec in substituted benzenes zhang et al 2016 could apply here as well such as the formation of the π complex transition state prior to oh radical addition in step 1 of scheme 1 and pre equilibrium between the substituted chlorobenzene and the oh radical prior to the rate determining step a recent study proposed that the creation of a water cage could account for masking of intrinsic kie kopinke and georgi 2017 this cage effect was explained by the trapping of the oh radical and substrate in the water shell formed by complex interaction of the hydrophobic solute with the surrounding water molecules the correlation between akiec values and molecules hydrophobicity log kow values was used to evaluate this assumption a good correlation r2 0 83 was found for the molecules studied in the present study si fig s5 however a poor correlation r2 0 46 was obtained when analyzing the dependency of akiec of substituted benzenes using data from zhang et al 2016 si fig s5 suggesting that the molecular structure of the organic substrate was the main factor driving fractionation the relationship between akiec values and substituents hammett constants suggests that the electronic structure of the organic molecules was the major factor governing isotope fractionation for radical reactions in water more research may be needed to validate the cage effect as a potential contributor to kiec masking in oh radical aqueous reactions under the scenario of oh radical addition to a substituted carbon atom involving the breaking of a c cl c n or c c bond the same values for akiec as those for oh radical addition to an unsubstituted carbon atom were obtained si section s5 however these akiec values were significantly lower than the theoretical kiec streitwieser limits for these cleavages i e 1 057 for c cl 1 060 for c n and 1 049 for c c elsner et al 2005 which were obtained under the assumption that the bond is broken during the transition state when considering a more realistic assumption e g that the bond is 50 broken half these limits can be considered even in this case the theoretical kiec values are still higher than the calculated akiec values except for c n cleavage in the ncb isomers confirming that the breaking of a c x bond in the rate determining step is unlikely finally akiec values of 1 002 and 1 007 for 3 and 4 cmb respectively were obtained when assuming h abstraction on the ch3 group of the cmb isomers these were lower than theoretical kiec values of 1 020 expected for c h bond cleavage elsner et al 2005 suggesting that oh radical addition to an unsubstituted carbon atom likely played a more dominant role than h abstraction in the reaction of the cmb isomers with oh radicals this is in line with the higher contribution of oh addition relative to h abstraction observed for toluene zhang et al 2016 it is also confirmed by the detection of phenol intermediates in the indirect photodegradation experiments with cmb isomers which supports a preferential attack of the oh radicals to the ring rather than the methyl group finally this is also the main reaction mechanism proposed for the reaction of chlorotoluene isomers with oh radicals in distilled water mohan et al 1991 the εc and akiec values increased with increasing hammett substituent constants σ fig 3 the most electron withdrawing substituents led to the highest carbon isotope fractionation this suggests that the transition state might be more symmetrical for the reaction of oh radicals with the ncb and dcb isomers than for the cmbs more data are needed to propose a quantitative relationship between isotope fractionation and substituent constants and to provide a mechanistic interpretation for such a relationship the influence of the electronic properties of aromatic substituents on isotope effects was observed for nitrogen isotope fractionation during the oxidation of substituted anilines ratti et al 2015a skarpeli liati et al 2011 skarpeli liati et al 2012 while no substituent effect was observed for the abiotic reduction of nitroaromatic compounds hofstetter et al 2008a based on these kinetics and isotope results the proposed dominant reaction pathway for the studied compounds involves the initial formation of a c o bond at one of the unsubstituted carbon atoms on the benzene ring during the rate determining step followed by the release of a h atom scheme 1 4 3 potential to use csia to distinguish between aqueous photodegradation and other processes the negligible isotope fractionation observed for the cmb isomers prevents stable carbon isotope analysis to be used as an identification tool for cmb aqueous photodegradation conversely the ncbs and to a lower extent the dcbs showed quantifiable carbon isotope fractionation during their reaction with oh radicals while transformation reactions may produce significant isotope fractionation typically negligible carbon isotope fractionation is associated with transfer mechanisms such as equilibrium adsorption harrington et al 1999 passeport et al 2014 diffusion passeport et al 2014 xu et al 2016 and volatilization harrington et al 1999 at least at scales relevant to most field sampling strategies xu et al 2016 2017 table s5 in si summarizes published carbon isotope enrichment factors for various transformation processes of substituted chlorobenzenes that could occur concurrently with indirect photodegradation e g microbial degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions abiotic processes and direct photodegradation because significant gaps still exist in the assessment of carbon isotope enrichment factors for these compounds those of related compounds were reported as well during anaerobic microbial degradation 1 3 dcb and 1 4 dcb produce significant isotope fractionation with εc values of 5 4 0 4 and 6 3 0 2 respectively while 1 2 dcb is associated with a low enrichment factor of 0 8 0 1 liang et al 2014 while the large εc values of 1 3 and 1 4 dcb would prevent the use of stable carbon isotope analysis to distinguish between anaerobic biodegradation and reaction with oh radicals situations where both processes occur simultaneously are rare indeed indirect aqueous photodegradation is only relevant in surface waters where oxygenated conditions dominate in aquatic surface environments such as rivers wetlands and oceans the concentrations in oxygen tao et al 2006 and oh radicals zhou and mopper 1990 decrease with depth and anaerobic zones are usually limited to the sediment phase or water depths at which reactions with oh radicals are not expected no carbon isotope enrichment factors have been reported for the aerobic biodegradation of dcb isomers however negligible carbon isotope fractionation 0 4 0 1 was observed for chlorobenzene kaschl et al 2005 and 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene griebler et al 2004 liang et al 2011 suggesting that dcbs might also be associated with small εc values during aerobic biodegradation there is therefore potential to use csia to identify indirect aqueous photodegradation of the dcb isomers for ncbs the only other published εc value 0 65 is that associated with the abiotic reduction of 4 ncb in suspensions of fe ii goethite hartenbach et al 2006 no information on stable carbon isotope fractionation exists for the aerobic or anaerobic biodegradation of ncb isomers however nitrobenzene was studied under aerobic conditions and exhibited εc values of 0 57 0 06 during aerobic partial reduction by pseudomonas pseudoalcaligenes strain js45 hofstetter et al 2008b and between 3 5 0 2 and 3 9 0 2 for nitrobenzene aerobic oxidation with various bacteria strains cell extracts and enzymes hofstetter et al 2008b pati et al 2014 smaller εc values were obtained for the aerobic oxidation of 2 3 4 and 2 6 di nitrotoluene ranging from 0 4 0 2 and 1 4 0 4 pati et al 2014 2016 altogether these results suggest that the aerobic biodegradation of ncb isomers could produce stable carbon isotope fractionation within a similar range as that reported here for their reaction with oh radicals these effects should be evaluated in future studies before csia can be used as a diagnostic tool for ncb fate in surface water environments 5 conclusions results from i the hammett relationship ii the stable carbon isotope analysis iii degradation product analysis and iv former literature studies provided multiple lines of evidence that the reaction of oh radicals with substituted chlorobenzenes proceeds primarily via oh aromatic substitution involving first the rate determining c o bond formation followed by h release the substituents on the chlorobenzene structure affected both reactivity and stable carbon isotope fractionation while the carbon isotope enrichment factors obtained in this study were small they will likely be sufficient to identify indirect photodegradation of the ncb and potentially the dcb isomers provided that at least 40 of the ncbs and 70 87 of the dcbs degrade via reaction with oh radicals in order to conclusively assess the diagnostic capabilities of csia for substituted chlorobenzenes further research should be conducted with more complex water matrices acknowledgements this research has been financially supported by the european union under the 7th framework program

19671,a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp was applied to a freshwater recirculating aquaculture system ras of danio rerio to improve the treatment of nitrogenous compounds the growth characteristics of the microalgae water quality parameters and bacterial communities were monitored for 73 days in the treatment ras the inoculated ettlia sp grew up to 1 26 g l and dominated 99 throughout the experiment whereas naturally occurring microalgae grew to 0 57 g l in the control ras the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the treatment ras were reduced by 50 1 73 3 and 24 2 respectively compared to the control ras a bacterial community analysis showed that rhodospirillales phycisphaerae chlorobiales and burkholderiales were the major bacterial groups in the later phase of the treatment ras meanwhile a network analysis among the ettlia sp bacterial groups and environmental parameters revealed that the bacterial groups played key roles in both water quality improvement and ettlia sp growth in conclusion the inoculation and growth of the ettlia sp and its associated bacteria in the ras produced beneficial effects on the water quality by reducing the nitrogenous compounds and providing a favorable environment for certain bacterial groups to further improve water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords recirculating aquaculture systems

sutherland et al 2015 microalgae are primary oxygen releasing photosynthetic microorganisms and have already been used in various applications these microorganisms can improve the water quality by reducing nitrogenous compounds and producing various beneficial compounds richmond and hu 2013 microalgae have also shown numerous positive effects on aquatic organisms such as improving their stress

several well known algal species such as chaetoceros sp isochrysis sp chlorella sp and spirulina sp have been applied in aquaculture systems borowitzka 1997 lananan et al 2014 sombatjinda et al 2014 however harvesting the microalgal biomass from water remains a major problem for the application of microalgae due to their small cell size and floatability therefore immobilization periphyton and bio

applied to a newly designed ras to investigate its effects on water quality and bacterial community structures this green alga which is morphologically spherical and or subspherical was originally isolated from freshwater and later reported to also inhabit terrestrial environments pegg et al 2015 yoo et al 2013 ettlia sp is known as a highly settleable microalga due to its autoflocculating

microorganisms form various ecological relationships ranging from mutualism to competition that reshape microbial community structures recently association network techniques have frequently been

bacteria exhibit relationships in the phycosphere may range from mutualism to parasitism ramanan et al 2016 for example microalgae can provide oxygen microalgae derived substances and a favorable environment for bacteria while bacteria can provide bacteria derived substances and nutrients for microalgae by decomposing organic polymers into small molecules that can be used by microalgae therefore when applying microalgae to aquaculture systems the effects of the microalgae on the bacterial community also need to be considered accordingly this study investigated the water quality

and 5 46 mg l respectively both of which were lower than those in the treatment mt the biomass productivity of ettlia sp in the mt was 19 83 mg dcw l d the chl a concentration and biomass showed a significant correlation r 0 99 p 0 01 suggesting that almost all the dcw consisted of microalgal species the microscopic observations revealed that the ettlia sp was the dominant microalgae species 99 in the treatment mt throughout the experiment fig s1b while diatoms dominated in the control mt fig s1a at the end of the experiment day 73 the pn contents were 1 7 0 1 mg n g dcw and 22 6 1 4 mg n g dcw in the control and treatment mt respectively 3 2 changes in water quality the water temperature ph and do were all monitored during the experiment fig s2 the water temperature was regulated at 24 26 c the do and ph ranged from 7 to 8 mg l and 8 0 8 3 respectively the turbidity in the rearing tanks remained under 0 1 ntu throughout the experiment for both the control and treatment systems the concentrations of inorganic compounds in both systems varied largely over the course of the experiment fig 3 therefore the experimental data were separated into three different phases based on the fluctuations phase 1 0 29 days phase 2 30 60 days and phase 3 61 73 days during phase 1 the ammonium concentrations increased rapidly within two days and reached maximum values of 0 44 mg l and 0 32 mg l in the control and treatment systems respectively fig 3a these ammonium concentrations then decreased sharply while the nitrite concentrations increased in both systems fig 3b the maximum nitrite concentration in the treatment system was approximately one fourth of that in the control system the nitrate concentration in the control system then gradually increased from day 16 until the end of the experiment with a final value of 19 05 mg l whereas the nitrate concentration in the treatment system increased from day 16 to day 36 8 95 mg l and was then maintained at the same level until the end of the experiment fig 3c thus the final nitrate concentration in the treatment system was only 50 of the control system to evaluate whether ettlia sp consumed the nitrogenous compounds in the treatment system we calculated both differences in the corresponding time points of the total dissolved nitrogen tdn and dcw between the control and the treatment and designated these differences as δtdn tdntreatment tdncontrol and δdcw dcwtreatment mt dcwcontrol mt respectively these two values significantly correlated with each other r 0 70 p 0 05 fig 4 at the end of the experiment day 73 pn concentrations were 0 51 0 04 mg n l and 6 69 0 41 mg n l in the control and treatment mt respectively δpn difference in pn between the control and treatment i e pntreatment mt pncontrol mt accounted for 65 of δtdn in ras the phosphate concentration increased steadily from phase 1 and peaked at an early stage of phase 2 with maximum values of 1 22 mg l and 0 86 mg l in the control and treatment systems respectively fig 3d similar to the nitrate concentrations the phosphate concentrations in the treatment system were lower approximately 30 than those in the control system the phosphate concentrations in both systems then declined gradually during phase 2 reaching final concentrations below 0 2 mg l after 60 days 3 3 dynamics of bacterial community compositions the shifts of the bacterial community structure in the three different components of the ras were determined using the illumina miseq sequencing approach a total of 891 264 sequence reads of the 16s rrna gene were obtained after trimming low quality sequences and removing chimeras and single doubletons these sequences were further divided into 4 801 otus 99 similarity cut off the bacterial community compositions showed a significant difference among the mt bsfs and rt and among the experimental phases fig 5 proteobacteria mainly xanthomonadales 19 3 caulobacterales 15 7 burkholderiales 12 0 rhizobiales 11 5 and oligoflexales 7 5 dominated the bacterial community in the ettlia sp seed among these 6 dominant groups xanthomonadales caulobacterales and burkholderiales decreased to 1 9 0 8 1 6 0 4 and 3 2 0 1 respectively at day 60 in the treatment mt while the relative abundance of some minor groups increased during the experiment for instance rhodospirillales phycisphaerae and cytophagales represented 12 8 1 5 14 3 4 8 and 12 5 7 6 respectively of the bacterial community in the treatment mt at day 60 in addition to these major bacterial groups nitrosomonadales and nitrospirales were observed in the treatment mt at day 60 as minor groups 0 1 but their proportions were approximately 6 times higher than those in the control system to evaluate whether the bacteria which were initially associated with ettlia sp seed could also contribute to the improvement of water quality a venn diagram was constructed to explore the shifts of the shared bacteria in the seed and those in the later phase of the experimental treatment fig s3 a total of 404 different otus were observed in the ettlia sp seed thus theoretically at least 404 different bacteria carried out the treatment in the ras the overlapping bacterial otus in the initial seed and in the later mt samples decreased during the experiment from 189 otus at day 29 133 otus at day 60 the bacterial community compositions in the control mts showed a high variation between the identical rass at day 60 where one control mt was dominated by aeromonadales 49 1 and alteromonadales 24 2 while the bacterial community composition in the other control mt closely resembled that in the treatment mts in addition the inoculation of the ettlia sp in the treatment system tended to increase the bacterial species richness chao1 and ace and diversity simpson s index and shannon s index in the mt compared to that in the control mt table s1 the bacterial community compositions did not vary greatly between the control and treatment bsfs after 29 days however clear differences appeared at day 60 chlorobiales 15 4 2 9 rhodospirillales 13 8 3 6 and rhodocyclales 9 9 4 0 were the major groups in the treatment bsfs while burkholderiales 16 3 0 4 planctomycetales 16 1 12 6 and sphingobacteriales 12 0 9 9 were the major groups in the control bsfs at day 60 fusobacteriales accounted for 28 7 9 8 of the bacterial community in both systems at day 29 but this decreased to 4 4 2 0 in the control which was approximately 3 times higher than that in the treatment system at day 60 the bacterial community in the tap water was dominated by proteobacteria mainly pseudomonadales 26 5 enterobacteriales 23 1 and rhizobiales 13 7 these groups gradually shifted to betaproteobacteria mainly burkholderiales which dominated at day 60 64 8 6 9 in the treatment rt fusobacteriales represented 21 9 10 1 of the bacteria in the control rt at day 60 which was approximately 3 times higher than that in the treatment rt the effect of the inoculated ettlia sp on the species richness and diversity in the treatment rt varied during the experiment all indices were higher in the treatment rt at day 29 but were lower at day 60 compared with the control rt table s1 an nmds 2 dimensional plot of the bacterial communities based on the metric of dissimilarity among the mt bsfs and rt in the control and treatment systems is shown in fig 6 along the first axis the samples were distinguished according to the sampling day samples from days 29 and 60 were separated from the samples from day 0 tap water and ettlia sp seed along the second axis the samples from the control system were separated from the samples from the treatment system in addition the treatment mt samples were separated from the rt and bsfs samples during the experiment the statistical significance of the above clustering was further confirmed with anosim tests p 0 001 3 4 network analysis based on ettlia sp water quality and bacterial community to reveal the interactions between the bacteria and the ettlia sp in the ras an associated network analysis was performed based on spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ several thousand significant correlations p 0 05 were found within the bacterial groups and among the bacteria ettlia sp and water quality parameters however this study focused on the correlations between the ettlia sp and directly connected bacterial groups and correlations between the water quality parameters and directly connected bacterial groups a total of 60 nodes and 87 edges were obtained based on the criteria described above fig 7 a total of 35 direct correlations 24 positive correlations and 11 negative correlation were established between the ettlia sp and 27 bacterial orders most of which belonged to gammaproteobacteria 25 7 and alphaproteobacteria 20 0 among these bacterial groups approximately half of the directly linked bacterial groups were from the mt samples and approximately one third were from the bsfs for instance in the mt the ettlia sp was positively correlated with nitrospirales rhodospirillales and acidobacteria subgroup 6 but was negatively correlated with xanthomonadales oligoflexales and caulobacterales meanwhile in the rt the ettlia sp was negatively correlated with pseudomonadales and enterobacteriales among the bacterial groups that directly correlated with ettlia sp approximately 40 of them were also observed in initial ettlia sp seed for phosphate six direct correlations with bacterial groups were found phosphate showed a strong negative correlation with obscuribacterales in the bsfs 4 discussion greenwater technology is referred to one of the photosynthetic suspended growth systems psgs in which animals are cultured in water containing high concentrations of microalgae this system has several advantages for instance it entails lower capital costs relative to other ras and offers increased control over stock management relative to conventional static ponds hargreaves 2006 however the main disadvantages of this system compared to other ras are the difficulties associated with controlling water quality and microalgae density metabolism and community composition hargreaves 2006 tseng et al 1991 in addition algae induced turbidity decreases water transparency and adversely affects the ability to capture free swimming prey under low light conditions carton 2005 naas et al 1996 to overcome these disadvantages we applied a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp to the ras to control and maintain the water quality without increasing algae induced turbidity the concept of integrating a microalga in an ras differs from other studies that have applied a microalga to the rearing tank the microalgal and rearing tanks were separated in this study due to the autoflocculating characteristic of ettlia sp the present study demonstrated that the sedimentation of the inoculated ettlia sp was not disturbed and that the microalgae remained in the mt the turbidity was under 0 1 ntu in the treatment a comparable grade to the control system further water in the treatment ras never turned green throughout the experiment even though dcw of the treatment mt was as high as 1 2 g l at the end of experiment the accumulation of high concentrations of nitrate is another serious problem in an ras recently even a low nitrate concentration was reported to be problematic camargo et al 2005 in addition the tan and nitrite concentrations in an ras are considered indispensable criteria for evaluating the success of an ras rojas tirado et al 2016 microalgae can utilize nitrogenous compounds which are byproducts of bacterial degradation and the ammonification of organic compounds li et al 2008 previous studies have already demonstrated that nitrogenous compounds could be reduced by up to 50 compared to the control when microalgae e g spirulina sp nostoc sp were applied to ras kamilya et al 2006 sombatjinda et al 2014 our results showed that after an initial stabilization period phase 1 an average of 34 4 of nitrogen remained in the control system which was consistent with the previous findings that approximately half of the input nitrogen remained in ras without water exchange hargreaves 1998 hu et al 2013 importantly the remaining nitrogen concentration was reduced by over 50 when ettlia sp was inoculated in the treatment system pn in the treatment mt mainly from ettlia sp and its associated bacteria accounted for 65 of δtdn in the ras in addition δdcw and δtdn were significantly correlated with each other these results imply that ettlia sp and its associated bacteria could be responsible through assimilation for the removal of nitrogenous compounds in ras with at least 65 of nitrogen assimilated to its biomass in this study in summary ettlia sp and its associated bacteria utilized the problematic nitrogenous compounds efficiently thereby improving the water quality in an aquaculture system ettlia sp flocs were also easily harvestable to prevent any nutrient release by microalgal death or degradation previous research and development in rass has been mostly focused on bacteria based systems qiu et al 2016 schreier et al 2010 it is already known that microalgae and their associated bacterial community develop a complex interaction network that forms a highly dynamic ecosystem ramanan et al 2016 however little information is available about the shift of the bacterial community during microalgal cultivation in an ras phycisphaerales and rhizobiales in the mt and burkholderiales e g rhizobacter in the rt which are alga associated and plant growth promoting bacteria fukunaga et al 2009 santoyo et al 2016 increased during the experiment in the treatment system fig 5b pseudoxanthomonas a well known bacterium involved in granule stability enhancement wan et al 2013 also appeared in the treatment mt these bacterial groups might have helped the inoculated ettlia sp to adapt to the new environment and maintain its flocculation structure during the experiment de bashan et al 2004 furthermore the inoculated ettlia sp might also induce the establishment of bacterial groups that are favorable for its survival fusobacteriia a fish feces related bacterial group decreased in the treatment rt compared to control rt indicating that undigested fish feces remained in the control water a sign of degenerating water quality roeselers et al 2011 nitrifying bacteria and microalgae have been applied to remove nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture systems where nitrifying bacteria convert tan to nitrate while microalgae convert nitrate to its biomass suantika et al 2015 we also found that nitrospirales and nitrosomonadales two well known nitrifying bacteria were more enriched in the treatment mt and tightly coupled with ettlia sp suggesting that these nitrifying bacteria act as efficient converters of ammonia to nitrate the more favorable form of nitrogen for ettlia sp isleten hosoglu et al 2013 which indicates a tight mutualistic interaction approximately 30 of the native bacterial otus in the ettlia sp seed which accounted for approximately 10 of total bacterial otus in the mt were still present at day 60 suggesting that ettlia sp could function as a vessel for supporting bacteria however the major bacterial groups in the seed became the minor groups at the end suggesting that the unique environment of the ras could reshape the bacterial community composition of the associated groups in a way that could help ettlia sp better adapt to the ras the phosphate concentrations decreased during phase 2 then maintained low concentrations in both the control and treatment systems being utilized by microalgae and other microbes in addition various polyphosphate accumulating organisms such as obscuribacterales can accumulate phosphorus in their cell which may also decrease the phosphate concentration oyserman et al 2017 in this study obscuribacterales was negatively correlated with the phosphate concentrations fig 7 further supporting this hypothesis in summary the newly designed microalgae based ras could remove at least 65 of nitrogen without increasing algae induced turbidity fig 8 the inoculated ettlia sp and its associated bacteria were tightly coupled and showed mutualistic interactions during the experiment the autoflocculation characteristic of ettlia sp made it easy to harvest the biomass which could be further used as high value products and sustainable feed source for aquaculture systems especially for freshwater shrimp and fish la et al 2016 this study used danio rerio a model vertebrate organism as an aquaculture organism no negative effects on the danio rerio were noted when the ettlia sp was inoculated in the mt indicating that the two organisms were able to co exist in the ras however danio rerio is not a commercial aquaculture species therefore other aquaculture organisms should be co cultured with the ettlia sp to further evaluate whether this microalga has any positive or negative effects on the growth health conditions and productivity of the target aquaculture organisms 5 conclusions this study produced four key results first a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp was applied to a newly designed ras and grew well without increasing the algae induced turbidity second the ettlia sp and its associated bacteria improved the water quality especially by reducing the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds which can be toxic to aquatic organisms in an ras third the ettlia sp induced a stable and favorable bacterial community structure for its survival and growth fourth more detailed relationships in the aquatic ecosystem structure were revealed using a network analysis method in summary the water quality was improved by the ettlia sp and its associated bacteria furthermore the ettlia sp could be applied to a conventional ras for additional beneficial effects and used as a new effective technique to control and maintain an ras acknowledgments this research was supported by the advanced biomass r d center a global frontier program funded

19671,a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp was applied to a freshwater recirculating aquaculture system ras of danio rerio to improve the treatment of nitrogenous compounds the growth characteristics of the microalgae water quality parameters and bacterial communities were monitored for 73 days in the treatment ras the inoculated ettlia sp grew up to 1 26 g l and dominated 99 throughout the experiment whereas naturally occurring microalgae grew to 0 57 g l in the control ras the nitrate nitrite and ammonium concentrations in the treatment ras were reduced by 50 1 73 3 and 24 2 respectively compared to the control ras a bacterial community analysis showed that rhodospirillales phycisphaerae chlorobiales and burkholderiales were the major bacterial groups in the later phase of the treatment ras meanwhile a network analysis among the ettlia sp bacterial groups and environmental parameters revealed that the bacterial groups played key roles in both water quality improvement and ettlia sp growth in conclusion the inoculation and growth of the ettlia sp and its associated bacteria in the ras produced beneficial effects on the water quality by reducing the nitrogenous compounds and providing a favorable environment for certain bacterial groups to further improve water quality graphical abstract image 1 keywords recirculating aquaculture systems

treatment and denitrification crab et al 2007 martins et al 2010 yang et al 2001 many studies have previously demonstrated the success of using microalgae as a biological purifier for water treatment sutherland et al 2015 microalgae are primary oxygen releasing photosynthetic microorganisms and have already been used in various applications these microorganisms can improve the water quality by reducing nitrogenous compounds and producing various beneficial compounds richmond and hu 2013 microalgae have also shown numerous positive effects on aquatic organisms such as improving their stress response physiological activity starvation tolerance and disease resistance borowitzka 1997 moreover harvested microalgal biomass can be used as sustainable feed for aquaculture hemaiswarya et al 2010 several well known algal species such as chaetoceros sp isochrysis sp chlorella sp and spirulina sp have been applied in aquaculture systems borowitzka 1997 lananan et al 2014 sombatjinda et al 2014 however harvesting the microalgal biomass from water remains a major problem for the application of microalgae due to their small cell size and floatability therefore immobilization periphyton and bio floc techniques have all been developed to overcome the harvesting problem of microalgae moreno garrido 2008 in this study an ettlia sp which has been assigned to the family chlorococcaceae was applied to a newly designed ras to investigate its effects on water quality and bacterial community structures this green alga which is morphologically spherical and or subspherical was originally isolated from freshwater and later reported to also inhabit terrestrial environments pegg et al 2015 yoo et al 2013 ettlia sp is known as a highly settleable microalga due to its autoflocculating property and is a suitable candidate for producing biodiesel and high value products e g lutein β carotenoid keto carotenoid photoprotective reagent lee et al 2016 salim et al 2014 yoo et al 2013 microorganisms form various ecological relationships ranging from mutualism to competition that reshape microbial community structures recently association network techniques have frequently been applied to microbial abundance data to detect significant patterns of mutual exclusion between taxa and to represent them as a network faust and raes 2012 it is generally known that microalgae bacteria exhibit relationships in the phycosphere may range from mutualism to parasitism ramanan et al 2016 for example microalgae can provide oxygen microalgae derived substances and a favorable environment for bacteria while bacteria can provide bacteria derived substances and nutrients for microalgae by decomposing organic polymers into small molecules that can be used by microalgae therefore when applying microalgae to aquaculture systems the effects of the microalgae on the bacterial community also need to be considered accordingly this study investigated the water quality parameters microalgae growth characteristics and bacterial communities in a newly designed ras to 1 uncover the effects of a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp on the water quality parameters especially on nitrogenous compounds 2 characterize the ettlia sp growth in the newly designed microalgal tank and 3 reveal the effects of the ettlia sp on the bacterial communities in the ras 2

harvested microalgae were washed 10 times with distilled water to remove any remaining medium cell detritus etc and added to the treatment mt after ettlia sp flocculated and stacked at the bottom of the mt the pump was started at a low speed and gradually increased to a final dilution rate of 0 25 min to determine the growth characteristics of the microalgae in the mt the dry cell weight dcw and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were measured in triplicate every 10 15 days using the following procedures the water circulation was turned off and following manual mixing 50 ml of the microalgal suspension was collected from the mt for comparison the control microalgal biomass was collected using a scraper to detach the microalgal biofilm the dcw was measured by filtering an aliquot of the

were operated for a total of 73 days the nutrient loading in the ras was completely dependent on the daily added feed where the feed supply was 0 88 0 26 g d that included approximately 46 6 13 8 mg d of nitrogen and 12 5 3 7 mg d of phosphorus the inoculated ettlia sp became flocculated and stacked at the bottom of the mt fig 1c in the control the naturally occurring microalgae mainly diatoms attached tightly and formed a microalgal biofilm on the bottom panel of the mt fig 1b the growth characteristics of the microalgae in both the control and treatment mt are shown in fig 2 in the treatment mt the biomass dcw and chl a concentration increased to 1 26 g l and 13 85 mg l respectively by the end of the experiment the dcw and chlorophyll a concentration in the control were 0 52 g l and 5 46 mg l respectively both of which were lower than those in the treatment mt the biomass productivity of ettlia sp in the mt was 19 83 mg dcw l d the chl a concentration and biomass showed a significant correlation r 0 99 p 0 01 suggesting that almost all the dcw consisted of microalgal species the microscopic observations revealed that the ettlia sp was the dominant microalgae species 99 in the treatment mt throughout the experiment fig s1b while diatoms dominated in the control mt fig s1a at the end of the experiment day 73 the pn contents were 1 7 0 1 mg n g dcw and 22 6 1 4 mg n g dcw in the control and treatment mt respectively 3 2 changes in water quality the water temperature ph and do were all monitored during the experiment fig s2 the water temperature was regulated at 24 26 c the do and ph ranged from 7 to 8 mg l and 8 0 8 3 respectively the turbidity in the rearing tanks remained under 0 1 ntu throughout the experiment for both the control and treatment systems the concentrations of inorganic compounds in both systems varied largely over the course of the experiment fig 3 therefore the experimental data were separated into three different phases based on the fluctuations phase 1 0 29 days phase 2 30 60 days and phase 3 61 73 days during phase 1 the ammonium concentrations increased rapidly within two days and reached maximum values of 0 44 mg l and 0 32 mg l in the control and treatment systems respectively fig 3a these ammonium concentrations then decreased sharply while the nitrite concentrations increased in both systems fig 3b the maximum nitrite concentration in the treatment system was approximately one fourth of that in the control system the nitrate concentration in the control system then gradually increased from day 16 until the end of the experiment with a final value of 19 05 mg l whereas the nitrate concentration in the treatment system increased from day 16 to day 36 8 95 mg l and was then maintained at the same level until the end of the experiment fig 3c thus the final nitrate concentration in the treatment system was only 50 of the control system to evaluate whether ettlia sp consumed the nitrogenous compounds in the treatment system we calculated both differences in the corresponding time points of the total dissolved nitrogen tdn and dcw between the control and the treatment and designated these differences as δtdn tdntreatment tdncontrol and δdcw dcwtreatment mt dcwcontrol mt respectively these two values significantly correlated with each other r 0 70 p 0 05 fig 4 at the end of the experiment day 73 pn concentrations were 0 51 0 04 mg n l and 6 69 0 41 mg n l in the control and treatment mt respectively δpn difference in pn between the control and treatment i e pntreatment mt pncontrol mt accounted for 65 of δtdn in ras the phosphate concentration increased steadily from phase 1 and peaked at an early stage of phase 2 with maximum values of 1 22 mg l and 0 86 mg l in the control and treatment systems respectively fig 3d similar to the nitrate concentrations the phosphate concentrations in the treatment system were lower approximately 30 than those in the control system the phosphate concentrations in both systems then declined gradually during phase 2 reaching final concentrations below 0 2 mg l after 60 days 3 3 dynamics of bacterial community compositions the shifts of the bacterial community structure in the three different components of the ras were determined using the illumina miseq sequencing approach a total of 891 264 sequence reads of the 16s rrna gene were obtained after trimming low quality sequences and removing chimeras and single doubletons these sequences were further divided into 4 801 otus 99 similarity cut off the bacterial community compositions showed a significant difference among the mt bsfs and rt and among the experimental phases fig 5 proteobacteria mainly xanthomonadales 19 3 caulobacterales 15 7 burkholderiales 12 0 rhizobiales 11 5 and oligoflexales 7 5 dominated the bacterial community in the ettlia sp seed among these 6 dominant groups xanthomonadales caulobacterales and burkholderiales decreased to 1 9 0 8 1 6 0 4 and 3 2 0 1 respectively at day 60 in the treatment mt while the relative abundance of some minor groups increased during the experiment for instance rhodospirillales phycisphaerae and cytophagales represented 12 8 1 5 14 3 4 8 and 12 5 7 6 respectively of the bacterial community in the treatment mt at day 60 in addition to these major bacterial groups nitrosomonadales and nitrospirales were observed in the treatment mt at day 60 as minor groups 0 1 but their proportions were approximately 6 times higher than those in the control system to evaluate whether the bacteria which were initially associated with ettlia sp seed could also contribute to the improvement of water quality a venn diagram was constructed to explore the shifts of the shared bacteria in the seed and those in the later phase of the experimental treatment fig s3 a total of 404 different otus were observed in the ettlia sp seed thus theoretically at least 404 different bacteria carried out the treatment in the ras the overlapping bacterial otus in the initial seed and in the later mt samples decreased during the experiment from 189 otus at day 29 133 otus at day 60 the bacterial community compositions in the control mts showed a high variation between the identical rass at day 60 where one control mt was dominated by aeromonadales 49 1 and alteromonadales 24 2 while the bacterial community composition in the other control mt closely resembled that in the treatment mts in addition the inoculation of the ettlia sp in the treatment system tended to increase the bacterial species richness chao1 and ace and diversity simpson s index and shannon s index in the mt compared to that in the control mt table s1 the bacterial community compositions did not vary greatly between the control and treatment bsfs after 29 days however clear differences appeared at day 60 chlorobiales 15 4 2 9 rhodospirillales 13 8 3 6 and rhodocyclales 9 9 4 0 were the major groups in the treatment bsfs while burkholderiales 16 3 0 4 planctomycetales 16 1 12 6 and sphingobacteriales 12 0 9 9 were the major groups in the control bsfs at day 60 fusobacteriales accounted for 28 7 9 8 of the bacterial community in both systems at day 29 but this decreased to 4 4 2 0 in the control which was approximately 3 times higher than that in the treatment system at day 60 the bacterial community in the tap water was dominated by proteobacteria mainly pseudomonadales 26 5 enterobacteriales 23 1 and rhizobiales 13 7 these groups gradually shifted to betaproteobacteria mainly burkholderiales which dominated at day 60 64 8 6 9 in the treatment rt fusobacteriales represented 21 9 10 1 of the bacteria in the control rt at day 60 which was approximately 3 times higher than that in the treatment rt the effect of the inoculated ettlia sp on the species richness and diversity in the treatment rt varied during the experiment all indices were higher in the treatment rt at day 29 but were lower at day 60 compared with the control rt table s1 an nmds 2 dimensional plot of the bacterial communities based on the metric of dissimilarity among the mt bsfs and rt in the control and treatment systems is shown in fig 6 along the first axis the samples were distinguished according to the sampling day samples from days 29 and 60 were separated from the samples from day 0 tap water and ettlia sp seed along the second axis the samples from the control system were separated from the samples from the treatment system in addition the treatment mt samples were separated from the rt and bsfs samples during the experiment the statistical significance of the above clustering was further confirmed with anosim tests p 0 001 3 4 network analysis based on ettlia sp water quality and bacterial community to reveal the interactions between the bacteria and the ettlia sp in the ras an associated network analysis was performed based on spearman s rank correlation coefficient ρ several thousand significant correlations p 0 05 were found within the bacterial groups and among the bacteria ettlia sp and water quality parameters however this study focused on the correlations between the ettlia sp and directly connected bacterial groups and correlations between the water quality parameters and directly connected bacterial groups a total of 60 nodes and 87 edges were obtained based on the criteria described above fig 7 a total of 35 direct correlations 24 positive correlations and 11 negative correlation were established between the ettlia sp and 27 bacterial orders most of which belonged to gammaproteobacteria 25 7 and alphaproteobacteria 20 0 among these bacterial groups approximately half of the directly linked bacterial groups were from the mt samples and approximately one third were from the bsfs for instance in the mt the ettlia sp was positively correlated with nitrospirales rhodospirillales and acidobacteria subgroup 6 but was negatively correlated with xanthomonadales oligoflexales and caulobacterales meanwhile in the rt the ettlia sp was negatively correlated with pseudomonadales and enterobacteriales among the bacterial groups that directly correlated with ettlia sp approximately 40 of them were also observed in initial ettlia sp seed for phosphate six direct correlations with bacterial groups were found phosphate showed a strong negative correlation with obscuribacterales in the bsfs 4 discussion greenwater technology is referred to one of the photosynthetic suspended growth systems psgs in which animals are cultured in water containing high concentrations of microalgae this system has several advantages for instance it entails lower capital costs relative to other ras and offers increased control over stock management relative to conventional static ponds hargreaves 2006 however the main disadvantages of this system compared to other ras are the difficulties associated with controlling water quality and microalgae density metabolism and community composition hargreaves 2006 tseng et al 1991 in addition algae induced turbidity decreases water transparency and adversely affects the ability to capture free swimming prey under low light conditions carton 2005 naas et al 1996 to overcome these disadvantages we applied a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp to the ras to control and maintain the water quality without increasing algae induced turbidity the concept of integrating a microalga in an ras differs from other studies that have applied a microalga to the rearing tank the microalgal and rearing tanks were separated in this study due to the autoflocculating characteristic of ettlia sp the present study demonstrated that the sedimentation of the inoculated ettlia sp was not disturbed and that the microalgae remained in the mt the turbidity was under 0 1 ntu in the treatment a comparable grade to the control system further water in the treatment ras never turned green throughout the experiment even though dcw of the treatment mt was as high as 1 2 g l at the end of experiment the accumulation of high concentrations of nitrate is another serious problem in an ras recently even a low nitrate concentration was reported to be problematic camargo et al 2005 in addition the tan and nitrite concentrations in an ras are considered indispensable criteria for evaluating the success of an ras rojas tirado et al 2016 microalgae can utilize nitrogenous compounds which are byproducts of bacterial degradation and the ammonification of organic compounds li et al 2008 previous studies have already demonstrated that nitrogenous compounds could be reduced by up to 50 compared to the control when microalgae e g spirulina sp nostoc sp were applied to ras kamilya et al 2006 sombatjinda et al 2014 our results showed that after an initial stabilization period phase 1 an average of 34 4 of nitrogen remained in the control system which was consistent with the previous findings that approximately half of the input nitrogen remained in ras without water exchange hargreaves 1998 hu et al 2013 importantly the remaining nitrogen concentration was reduced by over 50 when ettlia sp was inoculated in the treatment system pn in the treatment mt mainly from ettlia sp and its associated bacteria accounted for 65 of δtdn in the ras in addition δdcw and δtdn were significantly correlated with each other these results imply that ettlia sp and its associated bacteria could be responsible through assimilation for the removal of nitrogenous compounds in ras with at least 65 of nitrogen assimilated to its biomass in this study in summary ettlia sp and its associated bacteria utilized the problematic nitrogenous compounds efficiently thereby improving the water quality in an aquaculture system ettlia sp flocs were also easily harvestable to prevent any nutrient release by microalgal death or degradation previous research and development in rass has been mostly focused on bacteria based systems qiu et al 2016 schreier et al 2010 it is already known that microalgae and their associated bacterial community develop a complex interaction network that forms a highly dynamic ecosystem ramanan et al 2016 however little information is available about the shift of the bacterial community during microalgal cultivation in an ras phycisphaerales and rhizobiales in the mt and burkholderiales e g rhizobacter in the rt which are alga associated and plant growth promoting bacteria fukunaga et al 2009 santoyo et al 2016 increased during the experiment in the treatment system fig 5b pseudoxanthomonas a well known bacterium involved in granule stability enhancement wan et al 2013 also appeared in the treatment mt these bacterial groups might have helped the inoculated ettlia sp to adapt to the new environment and maintain its flocculation structure during the experiment de bashan et al 2004 furthermore the inoculated ettlia sp might also induce the establishment of bacterial groups that are favorable for its survival fusobacteriia a fish feces related bacterial group decreased in the treatment rt compared to control rt indicating that undigested fish feces remained in the control water a sign of degenerating water quality roeselers et al 2011 nitrifying bacteria and microalgae have been applied to remove nitrogenous compounds in aquaculture systems where nitrifying bacteria convert tan to nitrate while microalgae convert nitrate to its biomass suantika et al 2015 we also found that nitrospirales and nitrosomonadales two well known nitrifying bacteria were more enriched in the treatment mt and tightly coupled with ettlia sp suggesting that these nitrifying bacteria act as efficient converters of ammonia to nitrate the more favorable form of nitrogen for ettlia sp isleten hosoglu et al 2013 which indicates a tight mutualistic interaction approximately 30 of the native bacterial otus in the ettlia sp seed which accounted for approximately 10 of total bacterial otus in the mt were still present at day 60 suggesting that ettlia sp could function as a vessel for supporting bacteria however the major bacterial groups in the seed became the minor groups at the end suggesting that the unique environment of the ras could reshape the bacterial community composition of the associated groups in a way that could help ettlia sp better adapt to the ras the phosphate concentrations decreased during phase 2 then maintained low concentrations in both the control and treatment systems being utilized by microalgae and other microbes in addition various polyphosphate accumulating organisms such as obscuribacterales can accumulate phosphorus in their cell which may also decrease the phosphate concentration oyserman et al 2017 in this study obscuribacterales was negatively correlated with the phosphate concentrations fig 7 further supporting this hypothesis in summary the newly designed microalgae based ras could remove at least 65 of nitrogen without increasing algae induced turbidity fig 8 the inoculated ettlia sp and its associated bacteria were tightly coupled and showed mutualistic interactions during the experiment the autoflocculation characteristic of ettlia sp made it easy to harvest the biomass which could be further used as high value products and sustainable feed source for aquaculture systems especially for freshwater shrimp and fish la et al 2016 this study used danio rerio a model vertebrate organism as an aquaculture organism no negative effects on the danio rerio were noted when the ettlia sp was inoculated in the mt indicating that the two organisms were able to co exist in the ras however danio rerio is not a commercial aquaculture species therefore other aquaculture organisms should be co cultured with the ettlia sp to further evaluate whether this microalga has any positive or negative effects on the growth health conditions and productivity of the target aquaculture organisms 5 conclusions this study produced four key results first a highly settleable microalga ettlia sp was applied to a newly designed ras and grew well without increasing the algae induced turbidity second the ettlia sp and its associated bacteria improved the water quality especially by reducing the concentrations of nitrogenous compounds which can be toxic to aquatic organisms in an ras third the ettlia sp induced a stable and favorable bacterial community structure for its survival and growth fourth more detailed relationships in the aquatic ecosystem structure were revealed using a network analysis method in summary the water quality was improved by the ettlia sp and its associated bacteria furthermore the ettlia sp could be applied to a conventional ras for additional beneficial effects and used as a new effective technique to control and maintain an ras acknowledgments this research was supported by the advanced biomass r d center a global frontier program funded

19672,sites of wastewater discharge are hotspots for pollution of freshwaters with organic micropollutants and are often associated with adverse effects to aquatic organisms the assessment monitoring and managment of these hotspots is challenged by variations in the pollutant mixture composition due to season weather conditions and random spills in this study we unraveled temporal exposure patterns in organic micropollutant mixtures from wastewater discharge and analyzed respective acute and sublethal risks for aquatic organisms samples were taken from two components of a separate sewer system i a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and ii a rain sewer of a medium size town as well as from the receiving river in different seasons rain sewer samples were separately collected for rain and dry weather conditions we analyzed 149 compounds by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms by considering the pollution dynamics in the point sources we reduced the complexity of pollutant mixtures by k means clustering to a few emission groups representing temporal and weather related pollution patterns from these groups we derived biological quality element bqe specific risk patterns in most cases one main risk driving emission group and a few individual risk driving compounds were identified for each bqe while acute risk for fish was quite low algae were exposed to seasonally emitted herbicides terbuthylazine spiroxamine and crustaceans to randomly spilled insecticides diazinon dimethoate sublethal risks for all bqe were strongly influenced by constantly emitted pollutants above all pharmaceuticals variability of risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events overall the studied wwtp represented the major pollution source with a specific emission of agricultural compounds however the investigated rain sewer showed to be a constant pollution source due to illicit connections and was an important entry route for high loads of insecticides and biocides due to spills or incorrect disposal by considering these pollution and risk dynamics monitoring strategies may be optimized with a special focus on times of low flow conditions in the river rain events and seasonally emitted risk drivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords organic micropollutants wastewater treatment plant rain sewer pollutant patterns acute and sublethal risks seasonal and weather dynamics 1 introduction synthetic organic chemicals are essential for our modern lifestyle they are used as pharmaceuticals pesticides and biocides as well as in all types of industrial production and as components of everyday consumer products as organic micropollutants they are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and may be detected in great numbers and in complex and variable mixture compositions busch et al 2016 loos et al 2009 wastewater including urban stormwater is an important source for these pollutants potentially affecting aquatic organisms inostroza et al 2016 könig et al 2017 munz et al 2017 münze et al 2017 consequently a comprehensive characterization assessment monitoring and management of wastewater effluents and receiving waters is crucial this requires considering variations in the mixture composition due to season weather conditions and random spills petrie et al 2015 wittmer et al 2010 in small rivers wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents but also rain sewers may significantly contribute to the overall discharge and pollution load munz et al 2017 wittmer et al 2010 in separate sewer systems stormwater is discharged directly to rain storage reservoirs and receiving water bodies with less or no treatment consequently polycyclic aromatic compounds from atmospheric deposition or traffic as well as pesticides and biocides used for urban pest control in private or public settings may be washed off from surfaces at rain events and enter surface waters via rain sewers gasperi et al 2014 wittmer et al 2010 while for rain sewers only limited data are available there have been extensive studies on pollutants and pollutant mixtures emitted from wwtps e g kostich et al 2014 loos et al 2013 munz et al 2017 loos et al 2013 found 80 of their 156 target compounds in the effluents of 90 wwtps across europe munz et al 2017 detected 50 of 57 compounds at eight time points in the effluents of 24 swiss wwtps these studies suggest the occurrence of common baseline pollution patterns in addition the review by petrie et al 2015 summarizes knowledge on diurnal weekly seasonal and precipitation related patterns of individual compounds or compound classes entering or emitted from wwtps due to changing wwtp performance or consumption patterns season specific emission has been observed for the insect repellent deet nelson et al 2011 pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs e g castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 vieno et al 2005 and pesticides neumann et al 2002 it may be hypothesized that the complex contamination in receiving rivers reflects an overlay of constant baseline emission of municipal wastewater components via wwtps and seasonal and event driven pollution patterns from wwtps rain sewers agricultural runoff and other sources temporal pollution patterns and seasonal concentration peaks may result in temporal risk and survival patterns of aquatic organisms ashauer et al 2007 in order to enhance the efficiency and explanatory power of chemical monitoring priority mixtures and compounds may be identified on the basis of pollution and effect patterns altenburger et al 2015 simple indicators for risk by toxic chemicals are toxic units tu which are the ratio between a measured environmental concentration of a compound and its respective effect or lethal concentration sum tus characterize mixture effects to get a quick but holistic overview on the risk the water framework directive defined biological quality elements bqe as representative organisms groups for the aquatic community for monitoring and status assessment eea 2008 the objective of the present study was to unravel temporal exposure and risk patterns of chemical mixtures in wastewater discharge from a separate sewer system including a municipal wwtp and an associated rain sewer in detail four major questions were addressed 1 how can pollutants from wastewater discharge be grouped 2 can these groups be used to derive and discriminate risk patterns for different bqe 3 are there individual dominating drivers of risk or are the risks driven by the complex mixtures 4 to what extent do wwtp and rain sewer effluent contribute to bqe specific risks in the river finally this study should contribute to the discussion on future monitoring strategies and management of pollution hotspots 2 methods 2 1 study site the study was performed at the river holtemme saxony anhalt germany at a conventional wwtp 80 000 population equivalents which receives municipal and industrial wastewater from the municipality of wernigerode and nine villages in an area of intensive agriculture this catchment is connected by 180 km of sewers for biological wastewater treatment the wwtp uses activated sludge technology in its aeration tank with the addition of ferric salt for phosphorus removal the wwtp operates in a separate sewer system stormwater is drained via rain sewers consequently the wwtp is not strongly affected by rainfalls and has a hydraulic retention time of 72 h discharge and temperature data of the effluent during the sampling periods are shown in the supporting information table s1 the studied rain sewer discharges into the river approximately 6 km upstream of the wwtp effluent it serves the old town and a residential area of wernigerode with private houses gardens roads and commercial areas the discharge data of the rain sewer and precipitation data are presented in table s2 discharge data at the nearest river gauge was retrieved from the public database of the state office for flood protection and water management saxony anhalt lhw 2017 2 2 sampling from the wwtp effluent eight daily composite samples were taken during one week in may july august and october 2015 and february 2016 respectively each composite sample was compiled of sub samples taken every 2 min in total 32 samples 250 ml each were provided by the wwtp operators monthly composite samples from a rain sewer from april 2015 to april 2016 were provided by the environmental agency for saxony anhalt lau under dry conditions volume proportional samples were collected by an auto sampler equipped with an ultrasonic probe samples of 150 ml were collected after 16 m3 of water passed the sampling point rain samples were taken discharge proportionally every 2 min if discharge rates exceeded 30 l s 1 the samples were taken continuously over one month and immediately stored in separate 5 l containers placed in an onsite freezer connected to the auto sampler for each weather condition and month 1 l samples were sent to our laboratory the samples from may and june 2015 could not be analyzed due to transport damage monthly composite samples were also taken from the river approximately 1 2 km downstream of the wwtp effluent in hourly intervals sub samples of 500 ml were automatically collected using an on site large volume solid phase extraction lvspe device described by schulze et al 2017 since the monitoring station was not operable in the winter months due to possible frost damage lvspe samples could only be taken from april to november 2015 all samples were stored at 20 c until analysis 2 3 chemical analysis of samples in total 149 compounds were selected for target analysis of water samples by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the selection was based on previous knowledge of the occurrence of compounds in river water general consumption habits as well as specific industrial activities in the study area finally the list included pharmaceuticals pesticides biocides household and industrial compounds artificial sweeteners and important transformation products tp table s3 chemical analysis was performed on a 1260 infinity lc system agilent coupled to a qtrap 6500 ms ms absciex with an iondrive turbo v electrospray ion source system from each sample an aliquot of 1 ml was taken for chemical analysis for the wwtp samples a 1 10 dilution was additionally prepared details on sample preparation can be found in the supplementary information si 3 the target compounds were addressed with three lc ms methods according to ionization behavior table 1 details on lc ms ms settings are presented in tables s4 and s5 individual compound settings are provided in table s3 details on the preparation and analysis of lvspe samples are provided in the supplementary information si 4 2 4 statistical analysis in order to account for different discharge across the sampling periods the concentration data were converted into loads using discharge data provided by the operators of the wwtp and the lau statistical analysis was performed in r r core team 2016 data from the wwtp and the rain sewer were analyzed separately due to different system and sampling settings prior to statistical analysis the data was transformed by the natural logarithm scaled and centered to reduce skewness and ensure equal variance of all variables values below mdl were treated as zeroes due to several non detects in the data sets the glog function from the package fitar was used mcleod and zhang 2008 temporal patterns of all detected compounds and sampling days or months were displayed by a heatmap function heatmap 2 r package gplots warnes et al 2016 k means clustering was applied as an exploratory data analysis tool to identify emission groups among all chemicals in the wwtp and rain sewer effluent the factoextra package was used for k means clustering and the preparation of graphs kassambara and mundt 2016 the number of clusters was determined by the elbow method which calculates the within sum of squares for different numbers of k clusters wss method fviz nbclust function the clustering of wwtp compounds was based on the between week bv and within week wv variation of a compound s load calculated according to equations 1 and 2 from the wv

wwtp effluent and the rain sewer effluent and c for each weather condition in the rain sewer samples the mec95 was divided by acute effect concentrations ecs and lowest observable effect

target compounds were detected in the wwtp effluent table s10 in general concentrations of common target compounds e g carbamazepine tramadol benzotriazole terbuthylazine were in the same range as concentrations detected in europe wide surveys of wwtp effluents loos et al 2013 munz et al 2017 since the wwtp is part of a separate sewer system we observed slightly lower concentrations for insecticides that are used as outdoor biocides and for the turf herbicide mecoprop than munz et al 2017 those compounds were likely emitted via rain sewers during runoff and did not pass the wwtp on the other hand high concentrations of agricultural pesticides in may for example boscalid and mcpa max 962 ng l 1 and 17 836 ng l 1 respectively were in contrast to previous studies and suggested a strong influence of the surrounding agricultural activities on the wwtp emissions here stormwater runoff could not explain this input but rather incorrect disposal and cleaning practices even though seasonal pesticide peaks have been reported before in wwtp effluent munz et al 2017 neumann et al 2002 wittmer et al 2010 it was not expected that this wwtp contributed directly and to a great extent to the pesticide emissions in our case the wwtp was also an important entry route for fungicides such as propiconazole and epoxiconazole pharmaceutical industry in the investigated catchment might have been the source for high concentrations of amitriyptyline and pipamperone the concentrations of pipamperone were similar to those in a wwtp investigated by van de steene et al 2010 which received wastewater from a chemo pharmaceutical plant in other wwtps not connected to pharmaceutical industry the concentrations of pipamperone were at least two magnitudes lower van de steene et al 2010 in the rain sewer samples 67 of 149 target compounds were detected table s11 the samples shared 55 compounds with the wwtp effluent but at lower concentrations the presence of pharmaceuticals and most importantly the artificial sweetener cyclamate indicated the discharge of untreated wastewater from the rain sewer cyclamate is almost completely removed in wwtps thus it is a suitable tracer for raw wastewater buerge et al 2009 according to the operators of the local wastewater system the connection rate was about 98 but some households were still erroneously connected to the rain sewer system the rain sewer was also characterized by the emission of biocides and urban pesticides as described by wittmer et al 2010 by including both point sources in the study we were able to identify use and emission patterns of common wastewater pollutants from households as well as source specific pollutants from agriculture and private and urban pest control 3 2 temporal patterns in pollutant mixtures in the following temporal patterns in pollutant mixtures are discussed detailed concentration data for each compound and sample can be found in tables s10 and s11 3 2 1 wwtp effluent 3 2 1 1 temporal emission patterns the discharge volume of the wwtp fluctuated only by 14 over the whole sampling period the temperature in the biological treatment compartment i e aeration tank showed a minimum temperature of 11 1 c in february and a maximum temperature of 19 4 c in july august with mean temperatures of 15 9 c in may and of 17 7 c in october table s1 however we detected clear seasonal differences in the pollution load and composition fig 1 in general the lowest loads were emitted in july since we did not analyze the respective influent samples we cannot conclude on the removal efficiency of the wwtp rather we determined the overall patterns resulting from variations in treatment efficiencies and input however low pollutant loads in summer months were also detected in previous studies and were explained by increased biodegradation in the wwtp castiglioni et al 2006 munz et al 2017 vieno et al 2005 in contrast to other studies we detected highest loads in may especially for pharmaceuticals usually higher pharmaceutical concentrations and loads were observed in winter due to decreased biodegradation and increased consumption castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 vieno et al 2005 as we also detected the most diverse pollutant mixture in may the higher loads might have resulted from a higher burden on the microbial community thus reducing the efficiency of biodegradation in the system onesios et al 2009 seasonal differences were driven by month specific clusters of chemicals fig 1 for example high loads of herbicides were detected in may fungicide loads increased in october and february showed a specific emission of a few pharmaceuticals 3 2 1 2 emission groups in the pollutant mixture the target chemicals were separated into four emission groups fig 2 based on the variation of each compound load within a week eq 2 and among the weeks eq 1 in general the four groups were distinguished into two constant i e group 2 and group 4 and two seasonal emission groups i e group 1 and 3 compounds observed at constant levels were assigned to group 2 the lowest wv and bv was 17 and 14 respectively for lidocaine considering these minimum variations this group was neither affected by seasonal nor by great weekly fluctuations and thus reflected baseline emission most members of this group were pharmaceuticals for long term treatments e g carbamazepine beta blockers or daily used drugs e g diclofenac lidocaine for these substances our findings were in agreement with previous studies castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 munz et al 2017 vieno et al 2005 for antibiotics like sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim we also observed a rather constant emission in agreement with a study by marx et al 2015 indicating a joint prescription of these antibiotics in germany throughout the year in contrast seasonal peaks for sulfamethoxazole have been detected by castiglioni et al 2006 and golovko et al 2014 finally steady emission was observed for industrial compounds with wide and constant areas of application e g benzotriazole and for the legacy herbicide fenuron and the biocides carbendazim and fipronil those biocides are applied as a fungicide in outdoor paints and as an insecticide in fly traps respectively baua 2017 in contrast to group 2 group 4 compounds were characterized by a higher wv this variation was observed for high consumption compounds e g propiconazole saccharin or might have resulted from variations in the production process for example of the pharmaceuticals pipamerone and melperone from which medicines are formulated batch like in a local plant furthermore low concentrations around the mdl led to higher variation for the herbicide metabolites and low use fungicides seasonal compounds were characterized by a high bv and were covered in groups 1 and 3 group 3 included chemicals which were i constantly emitted within each sampling week however at significantly different loads among the weeks or ii were only found in one of the weeks most agricultural pesticides were among the seasonal compounds with peak application in may thus group 3 compounds were considered as season specific five pharmaceuticals were assigned to this group they had seasonal peaks in february i e sertraline and nitrendipin and in october i e loperamide respectively the occurrence of antihistamine cetirizine peak in may and the anti coughing agent ambroxol peak in february indicated season dependent consumption interestingly the artificial sweetener acesulfame was assigned to this group with a clear peak in the may week since acesulfame is rather persistent during wastewater treatment processes buerge et al 2009 an increased influent load was the only explanation however to our knowledge season dependent removal efficiencies of acesulfame and other sweeteners have not been studied yet group 1 contained seasonal compounds with high wv resulting from four phenomena 1 in case of the agricultural pesticide pethoxamide this was due to a short application peak in may indicating that the effluent directly reflected the agricultural activities of the surrounding area 2 for other compounds apparent seasonal emission resulted from non systematic consumption of privately used chemicals or accidental spills e g dimethoate diazinon or 3 from a few individual data points around the mdl e g the legacy pesticide tp deisopropylatrazine 4 additionally compounds such as 2 napthtalenesulfonic acid showed a large general variation most likely because of its wide area of application due to these diverse reasons for the higher wv this group was called seasonal random overlaps of the clusters confidence intervals may be reduced by repeated and extended sampling to clarify group membership furthermore the intervals indicated outliers e g p toluenesulfonamide tsa and mecoprop mcp which did not fit to any cluster 3 2 2 weather related emission patterns and emission groups in rain sewer effluent in the rain sewer samples the most prominent pattern was driven by rain and dry weather conditions fig 3 based on the chemical load profile dry weather samples were clearly separated from rain weather samples these dynamics were in agreement with wittmer et al 2010 the chemicals were assigned to two emission groups representing chemicals either related to wastewater i e illicit connections or surface runoff fig 4 the validity of cluster outcome was confirmed by famd and k means clustering with a reduced dataset figs s1 and s2 in general pharmaceuticals and legacy pesticides dominated the chemical profile under dry weather conditions indicating wastewater as a source group 1 pesticides and biocides correlated with wet weather conditions group 2 the legacy pesticide atrazine banned since 1991 and pesticide metabolites were detected only in dry weather samples due to their continuous low concentrations which were diluted below the mdl during rain events the input of these compounds occurs likely via infiltrating groundwater as atrazine is still often present after these years in aquifers and the vadose zone in germany and released in low concentrations into surface waters vonberg et al 2014 surface runoff group 2 was characterized by biocides fungicides insecticides and urban pesticides pollution with these compounds from urban areas is considerable due to comparably larger amounts of herbicides applied by urban users than by farmers blanchoud et al 2004 furthermore larger fractions of precipitation enter receiving waters as runoff from paved areas with impermeable materials than from areas with permeable soil biocides and fungicides are often applied on facades and other outdoor surfaces herbicides like mcpa and mecoprop are commonly applied on turf for weed control phillips and bode 2004 wittmer et al 2010 the runoff of terbuthylazine was unexpected as there is no agricultural area connected to the rain sewer outliers of both groups showed a random and precipitation independent emission behavior e g propiconazole or had concentrations close or below the mdl e g 2 octyl 4 isothiazolin deisopropylatrazine and n acetyl 4 aminoantipyrine showed correlation with dry weather discharge but were outliers due to many non detects in contrast to patterns in the wwtp effluent clear seasonal dynamics could not be confirmed in rain sewer discharge in general the pharmaceuticals found were associated with long term treatment and were therefore constantly emitted distinct high loads were only observed in october fig 3 which may have resulted from maintenance works in the sewer system for rain related emissions clear seasonal patterns were missing due to the lack of strong rain events discharge 30 l s 1 in most fall and winter months still privately used pesticides are not as systematically and efficiently applied as agricultural pesticides templeton et al 1998 inter seasonal presence of these compounds was observed in streams due to an extended application period and continuous runoff from urban areas phillips and bode 2004 moreover some non agricultural pesticides have a broad field of application as biocides e g in facade protection single peaks might be further due to spills and incorrect disposal phillips and bode 2004 wittmer et al 2010 this probably holds true for the high peak of dimethoate in the november dry weather sample the rain sewer system is quite sensitive to discharge variations and immediately reflects the activities in its catchment 3 3 risk estimation for temporal emissions and emission groups in order to understand temporal dynamics of risks for fish crustaceans and algae acute tuacute and sublethal risks tusub were associated with emission groups of chemicals as identified in chapter 3 2 the pie charts describe the contribution of each emission group eq 4 and the main drivers of each group eq 3 for each biological quality element bqe figs 5 and s6 3 3 1 risk patterns and risk driving compounds in wwtp effluent acute and sublethal risk from wastewater discharge of the wwtp was assessed per season and emission group concerning the sum toxicity of each sampling week similar seasonal patterns for acute and for sublethal risk were observed for all bqe fig 5a only sublethal risk for fish did not show any strong temporal dependency in general acute toxic risk for fish was lower compared to risks for other bqe and was driven by the seasonally emitted chemicals metolachlor and mcpa fig 5b the potential toxic effect of these two herbicides was mainly explained by their high maximum effluent concentrations i e 849 ng l 1 and 17 836 ng l 1 respectively the exceedence of tuacute by tusub by up to three orders of magnitude indicated the underestimation of risk for fish if only acute toxicity is considered fig 5a due to physiological similarities to mammals fish are potentially more susceptible to pharmaceuticals which are not designed to exhibit acute toxicity but to be biologically active substances corcoran et al 2010 in fact constantly emitted pharmaceuticals explained 90 of the tusub for fish fig 5e the main driver was citalopram 65 which was demonstrated to alter the swimming behavior of fish olsén et al 2014 this might be important for predator prey relations antidepressants have been reported to affect a number of physiological functions corcoran et al 2010 for example the second driver amitriptyline 19 decreased the body length of fish embryos yang et al 2014 yet long term consequences of exposure to these substances in wildlife and on population level are largely unknown for daphnia tuacute and tusub were driven by a diazinon peak in october fig 5c f however in agreement with munz et al 2017 diazinon also dominated the risk pattern in the absence of peak concentrations figs s3 and s4 diazinon is no longer approved for plant protection but is still registered as an insecticide in pet collars against fleas the application in private households might explain the rather random emissions wittmer et al 2010 due to the long hydraulic retention time of 72 h the diazinon concentrations detected during a few days in october likely resulted from a single spill the second driver for tuacute was fipronil 10 which was constantly emitted at low concentrations fig 5c like diazinon fipronil is registered for veterinary and indoor pest control both are neuroactive compounds busch et al 2016 due to their high acute toxicity to non target insects they have been banned as plant protection products however their continuous application in private households still poses an issue for aquatic ecosystems the temporal risk for algae was explained by the seasonal emission of agricultural pesticides fig 5d g the herbicide terbuthylazine 51 and the fungicide spiroxamine 21 explained most of the tuacute fig 5d both drivers were season specific for may while spiroxamine showed a short peak application in the may week and was thus assigned to group 1 a similar emission pattern was observed for mcpa which was the main driver for tusub fig 5g in addition to seasonal sublethal risk drivers daphnia and algae were constantly exposed to sublethal concentrations of diclofenac fig 5f g diclofenac may affect growth in daphnia and cell multiplication in algae dietrich et al 2010 lawrence et al 2012 the anti inflammatory agent was previously identified as a main risk driver in environmental mixtures busch et al 2016 munz et al 2017 and has been associated with risk to fish and mammals corcoran et al 2010 3 3 2 risk patterns and risk driving compounds in rain sewer effluent the chemical profiles in the rain sewer were mainly driven by the weather conditions but most compounds were present in both conditions therefore tus were calculated for dry and rain conditions based on the mec95 of each detected compound likewise the risk contribution of the two emission groups was evaluated for both weather conditions fig 6 higher tus were observed for fish during dry weather the tuacute in the rain sewer was similar to tuacute in may in the wwtp effluent the tuacute for algae was slightly higher during rain events for daphnia again an extraordinary peak was observed tuacute of 2 3 this peak was due to a high concentration 5161 ng l 1 of the neuroactive insecticide dimethoate in the november sample dimethoate is approved for private use as an insecticide in gardens the extraordinary peak in the dry sample in november likely resulted from incorrect disposal after the application period leading to acute risk at the effluent this peak strongly influenced the tuacute patterns for fish and daphnia dimethoate always dominated the acute toxicity for daphnia fig 6c while fipronil strongly contributed to tuacute in rain events and in the absence of the spill event fig s5c for fish dimethoate explained 59 of the tuacute in dry weather in the absence of this spill the risk pattern became more complex with carbendazim as the main driver also under dry weather conditions fig s5b carbendazim is classified as hazardous for human and environmental health echa 2017 for algae the herbicides diuron and terbuthlyazine were important acute risk drivers under both weather conditions fig 6d elevated concentrations of diuron and terbuthlyazine were observed during runoff events however they were still present in low concentrations during dry discharge fig 3 similarly to carbendazim diuron is used in biocides in outdoor paints baua 2017 often both compounds occur as constituents of the same product and are consequently washed off together overall tusub were lower than in wwtp effluent but were dominated by the same pharmaceuticals figs 5 and 6 additionally tusub for daphnia was driven by an exceptionally high metoprolol concentration in the september rain sample 3837 ng l 1 for algae tusub was similar in rain and dry conditions with diuron as main driver fig 6g four out of seven risk drivers in the rain sewer effluent were biocides similar to the patterns in the wwtp effluent randomly used and discarded insecticides posed high risk to aquatic organisms the assessment of both point sources implied that acute and sublethal risk was driven by mainly one emission group in all cases one or two dominating risk driving compounds could be identified lower total risk was often accompanied by a decreasing contribution of the main risk drivers and increasing importance of other compounds leading to a more complex risk pattern and highlighting the need for further investigations of mixture effects figs s3 and s4 3 4 exposure in the receiving river in order to assess the contribution of the studied wwtp and rain sewer to the risk in the receiving river we analyzed monthly composite lvspe samples from the river downstream of these two point sources here we focused on the main risk driving compounds identified in chapter 3 3 table s12 in general the tus increased from may with a peak in july and august fig 7 the discrepancy between the expected risk pattern based on the identified emission groups chapter 3 3 1 and the high summer risk can be explained by the low discharge volume in the river and thus lower dilution from june onwards fig 7 ankley et al 2007 this effect can be clearly seen for tusub for fish which was mostly driven by constantly emitted pharmaceuticals i e similar river discharge resulted in similar tusub fig 7b a season specific risk pattern due to seasonal application could still be deduced for algae higher dilution in spring and input from diffuse sources during summer rains contributed to elevated risk even after the main application period neumann et al 2002 thus these seasonally emitted pollutants require monitoring in higher temporal resolution during the respective peak times and rain events in the following months generally rain discharge calls for event based monitoring short peak emissions via the wwtp effluent and the rain sewer were averaged out in monthly composite samples and the rain sewer effluent was strongly diluted in the river for crustaceans average risk in the river was dominated by constantly emitted fipronil only the dimethoate spill in november was intense enough to be observed in the monthly composite river samples and contributed to the monthly average tuacute concerning the contribution of point sources to the discharge of the river the rain sewer played a minor role 0 01 2 3 still adverse acute and sublethal effects to organisms might be observed at the vicinity of the effluent moreover similar patterns and contributions may be assumed for other rain sewers discharging into the river and contributing to the pollution and risk patterns upstream of the wwtp the studied wwtp contributed up to 40 to the river discharge under low flow conditions and was the main contributor to the pollution with organic micropollutants in the river thus the final pollution and risk pattern in the river was mainly driven by the total river discharge ankley et al 2007 4 conclusions in this study clustering wwtp effluents according to temporal contamination patterns revealed a clear seasonality in the emission reflected by compounds such as agricultural pesticides in spring or fungicides in fall the concentrations of other compounds such as many pharmaceuticals were quite constant in the rain sewer the discrimination between rain and dry discharge dominated contamination patterns which were driven by surface runoff and illicit connections in addition to constantly and seasonally emitted pollutants there were randomly emitted non agricultural pesticide and biocide peaks in both wwtp effluent and rain sewer calling for management these patterns may be used for hypothesis testing in other catchments with similar and different wastewater systems e g concerning cso structures land use and hydraulic retention time characteristics chemical patterns could be directly translated to bqe specific risk patterns while fish were potentially most affected by sublethal effects of constantly emitted chemicals i e baseline emission algae were exposed to seasonal risks random emission of insecticides and biocides from private and urban sources were a strong potential threat for crustaceans high risks were typically related to one or few risk drivers while there may be more contributing chemicals at lower risks this particularly applied for algae and crustaceans which were under high risk during pesticide applications and spills variability of acute and sublethal risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events due to the lack of sublethal effect data for several compounds and endpoints the assessment provided only a rough estimate on the potential risks to aquatic organisms however this estimate already highlighted the importance of sublethal effects on growth behavior and reproduction in risk assessments and especially underlined the major role of constantly emitted pharmaceuticals in these effects for all bqe furthermore identified risk drivers and risk patterns should be tested in bioassays to confirm their effects and investigate mixture effects on the bqe despite the occurrence of occasionally high loads of insecticides and biocides in the rain sewer the wwtp was still the more important pollution source with a considerable emission of agricultural pesticides and compounds used and produced by local industries the risk posed by non agricultural pesticides and biocides may require rethinking of approval and stormwater management while input of agricultural pesticides may be reduced by awareness rising of professional users by considering pollution dynamics due to temporal and weather influences water authorities may optimize monitoring strategies suggesting high frequency monitoring during main emission times of pesticides and focusing on low water discharge seasons furthermore event based monitoring will support the identification of peak contamination triggered by rain events but will fail to capture random spills event sampling might be especially important for catchments with wwtps strongly affected by rainfall e g combined sewer systems

19672,sites of wastewater discharge are hotspots for pollution of freshwaters with organic micropollutants and are often associated with adverse effects to aquatic organisms the assessment monitoring and managment of these hotspots is challenged by variations in the pollutant mixture composition due to season weather conditions and random spills in this study we unraveled temporal exposure patterns in organic micropollutant mixtures from wastewater discharge and analyzed respective acute and sublethal risks for aquatic organisms samples were taken from two components of a separate sewer system i a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and ii a rain sewer of a medium size town as well as from the receiving river in different seasons rain sewer samples were separately collected for rain and dry weather conditions we analyzed 149 compounds by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms by considering the pollution dynamics in the point sources we reduced the complexity of pollutant mixtures by k means clustering to a few emission groups representing temporal and weather related pollution patterns from these groups we derived biological quality element bqe specific risk patterns in most cases one main risk driving emission group and a few individual risk driving compounds were identified for each bqe while acute risk for fish was quite low algae were exposed to seasonally emitted herbicides terbuthylazine spiroxamine and crustaceans to randomly spilled insecticides diazinon dimethoate sublethal risks for all bqe were strongly influenced by constantly emitted pollutants above all pharmaceuticals variability of risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events overall the studied wwtp represented the major pollution source with a specific emission of agricultural compounds however the investigated rain sewer showed to be a constant pollution source due to illicit connections and was an important entry route for high loads of insecticides and biocides due to spills or incorrect disposal by considering these pollution and risk dynamics monitoring strategies may be optimized with a special focus on times of low flow conditions in the river rain events and seasonally emitted risk drivers graphical abstract image 1 keywords organic micropollutants wastewater treatment plant rain sewer pollutant patterns acute and sublethal risks seasonal and weather dynamics 1 introduction synthetic organic chemicals are essential for our modern lifestyle they are used as pharmaceuticals pesticides and biocides as well as in all types of industrial production and as components of everyday consumer products as organic micropollutants they are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and may be detected in great numbers and in complex and variable mixture compositions busch et al 2016 loos et al 2009 wastewater including urban stormwater is an important source for these pollutants potentially affecting aquatic organisms inostroza et al 2016 könig et al 2017 munz et al 2017 münze et al 2017 consequently a comprehensive characterization assessment monitoring and management of wastewater effluents and receiving waters is crucial this requires considering variations in the mixture composition due to season weather conditions and random spills petrie et al 2015 wittmer et al 2010 in small rivers wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluents but also rain sewers may significantly contribute to the overall discharge and pollution load munz et al 2017 wittmer et al 2010 in separate sewer systems stormwater is discharged directly to rain storage reservoirs and receiving water bodies with less or no treatment consequently polycyclic aromatic compounds from atmospheric deposition or traffic as well as pesticides and biocides used for urban pest control in private or public settings may be washed off from surfaces at rain events and enter surface waters via rain sewers gasperi et al 2014 wittmer et al 2010 while for rain sewers only limited data are available there have been extensive studies on pollutants and pollutant mixtures emitted from wwtps e g kostich et al 2014 loos et al 2013 munz et al 2017 loos et al 2013 found 80 of their 156 target compounds in the effluents of 90 wwtps across europe munz et al 2017 detected 50 of 57 compounds at eight time points in the effluents of 24 swiss wwtps these studies suggest the occurrence of common baseline pollution patterns in addition the review by petrie et al 2015 summarizes knowledge on diurnal weekly seasonal and precipitation related patterns of individual compounds or compound classes entering or emitted from wwtps due to changing wwtp performance or consumption patterns season specific emission has been observed for the insect repellent deet nelson et al 2011 pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs e g castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 vieno et al 2005 and pesticides neumann et al 2002 it may be hypothesized that the complex contamination in receiving rivers reflects an overlay of constant baseline emission of municipal wastewater components via wwtps and seasonal and event driven pollution patterns from wwtps rain sewers agricultural runoff and other sources temporal pollution patterns and seasonal concentration peaks may result in temporal risk and survival patterns of aquatic organisms ashauer et al 2007 in order to enhance the efficiency and explanatory power of chemical monitoring priority mixtures and compounds may be identified on the basis of pollution and effect patterns altenburger et al 2015 simple indicators for risk by toxic chemicals are toxic units tu which are the ratio between a measured environmental concentration of a compound and its respective effect or lethal concentration sum tus characterize mixture effects to get a quick but holistic overview on the risk the water framework directive defined biological quality elements bqe as representative organisms groups for the aquatic community for monitoring and status assessment eea 2008 the objective of the present study was to unravel temporal exposure and risk patterns of chemical mixtures in wastewater discharge from a separate sewer system including a municipal wwtp and an associated rain sewer in detail four major questions were addressed 1 how can pollutants from wastewater discharge be grouped 2 can these groups be used to derive and discriminate risk patterns for different bqe 3 are there individual dominating drivers of risk or are the risks driven by the complex mixtures 4 to what extent do wwtp and rain sewer effluent contribute to bqe specific risks in the river finally this study should contribute to the discussion on future monitoring strategies and management of pollution hotspots 2 methods 2 1 study site the study was performed at the river holtemme saxony anhalt germany at a conventional wwtp 80 000 population equivalents which receives municipal and industrial wastewater from the municipality of wernigerode and nine villages in an area of intensive agriculture this catchment is connected by 180 km of sewers for biological wastewater treatment the wwtp uses activated sludge technology in its aeration tank with the addition of ferric salt for phosphorus removal the wwtp operates in a separate sewer system stormwater is drained via rain sewers consequently the wwtp is not strongly affected by rainfalls and has a hydraulic retention time of 72 h discharge and temperature data of the effluent during the sampling periods are shown in the supporting information table s1 the studied rain sewer discharges into the river approximately 6 km upstream of the wwtp effluent it serves the old town and a residential area of wernigerode with private houses gardens roads and commercial areas the discharge data of the rain sewer and precipitation data are presented in table s2 discharge data at the nearest river gauge was retrieved from the public database of the state office for flood protection and water management saxony anhalt lhw 2017 2 2 sampling from the wwtp effluent eight daily composite samples were taken during one week in may july august and october 2015 and february 2016 respectively each composite sample was compiled of sub samples taken every 2 min in total 32 samples 250 ml each were provided by the wwtp operators monthly composite samples from a rain sewer from april 2015 to april 2016 were provided by the environmental agency for saxony anhalt lau under dry conditions volume proportional samples were collected by an auto sampler equipped with an ultrasonic probe samples of 150 ml were collected after 16 m3 of water passed the sampling point rain samples were taken discharge proportionally every 2 min if discharge rates exceeded 30 l s 1 the samples were taken continuously over one month and immediately stored in separate 5 l containers placed in an onsite freezer connected to the auto sampler for each weather condition and month 1 l samples were sent to our laboratory the samples from may and june 2015 could not be analyzed due to transport damage monthly composite samples were also taken from the river approximately 1 2 km downstream of the wwtp effluent in hourly intervals sub samples of 500 ml were automatically collected using an on site large volume solid phase extraction lvspe device described by schulze et al 2017 since the monitoring station was not operable in the winter months due to possible frost damage lvspe samples could only be taken from april to november 2015 all samples were stored at 20 c until analysis 2 3 chemical analysis of samples in total 149 compounds were selected for target analysis of water samples by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms the selection was based on previous knowledge of the occurrence of compounds in river water general consumption habits as well as specific industrial activities in the study area finally the list included pharmaceuticals pesticides biocides household and industrial compounds artificial sweeteners and important transformation products tp table s3 chemical analysis was performed on a 1260 infinity lc system agilent coupled to a qtrap 6500 ms ms absciex with an iondrive turbo v electrospray ion source system from each sample an aliquot of 1 ml was taken for chemical analysis for the wwtp samples a 1 10 dilution was additionally prepared details on sample preparation can be found in the supplementary information si 3 the target compounds were addressed with three lc ms methods according to ionization behavior table 1 details on lc ms ms settings are presented in tables s4 and s5 individual compound settings are provided in table s3 details on the preparation and analysis of lvspe samples are provided in the supplementary information si 4 2 4 statistical analysis in order to account for different discharge across the sampling periods the concentration data were converted into loads using discharge data provided by the operators of the wwtp and the lau statistical analysis was performed in r r core team 2016 data from the wwtp and the rain sewer were analyzed separately due to different system and sampling settings prior to statistical analysis the data was transformed by the natural logarithm scaled and centered to reduce skewness and ensure equal variance of all variables values below mdl were treated as zeroes due to several non detects in the data sets the glog function from the package fitar was used mcleod and zhang 2008 temporal patterns of all detected compounds and sampling days or months were displayed by a heatmap function heatmap 2 r package gplots warnes et al 2016 k means clustering was applied as an exploratory data analysis tool to identify emission groups among all chemicals in the wwtp and rain sewer effluent the factoextra package was used for k means clustering and the preparation of graphs kassambara and mundt 2016 the number of clusters was determined by the elbow method which calculates the within sum of squares for different numbers of k clusters wss method fviz nbclust function the clustering of wwtp compounds was based on the between week bv and within week wv variation of a compound s load calculated according to equations 1 and 2 from the wv

wwtp effluent and the rain sewer effluent and c for each weather condition in the rain sewer samples the mec95 was divided by acute effect concentrations ecs and lowest observable effect concentrations loec respectively for fish green algae and daphnia as a representative for crustaceans the ecs were either based on the 5th percentile of the measured acute ecs retrieved from the us environmental protection agency s ecotox database according to busch et al 2016 or on predicted ecs read across or ecosar in case of missing effect data table s8 details on selected loecs retrieved

target compounds were detected in the wwtp effluent table s10 in general concentrations of common target compounds e g carbamazepine tramadol benzotriazole terbuthylazine were in the same range as concentrations detected in europe wide surveys of wwtp effluents loos et al 2013 munz et al 2017 since the wwtp is part of a separate sewer system we observed slightly lower concentrations for insecticides that are used as outdoor biocides and for the turf herbicide mecoprop than munz et al 2017 those compounds were likely emitted via rain sewers during runoff and did not pass the wwtp on the other hand high concentrations of agricultural pesticides in may for example boscalid and mcpa max 962 ng l 1 and 17 836 ng l 1 respectively were in contrast to previous studies and suggested a strong influence of the surrounding agricultural activities on the wwtp emissions here stormwater runoff could not explain this input but rather incorrect disposal and cleaning practices even though seasonal pesticide peaks have been reported before in wwtp effluent munz et al 2017 neumann et al 2002 wittmer et al 2010 it was not expected that this wwtp contributed directly and to a great extent to the pesticide emissions in our case the wwtp was also an important entry route for fungicides such as propiconazole and epoxiconazole pharmaceutical industry in the investigated catchment might have been the source for high concentrations of amitriyptyline and pipamperone the concentrations of pipamperone were similar to those in a wwtp investigated by van de steene et al 2010 which received wastewater from a chemo pharmaceutical plant in other wwtps not connected to pharmaceutical industry the concentrations of pipamperone were at least two magnitudes lower van de steene et al 2010 in the rain sewer samples 67 of 149 target compounds were detected table s11 the samples shared 55 compounds with the wwtp effluent but at lower concentrations the presence of pharmaceuticals and most importantly the artificial sweetener cyclamate indicated the discharge of untreated wastewater from the rain sewer cyclamate is almost completely removed in wwtps thus it is a suitable tracer for raw wastewater buerge et al 2009 according to the operators of the local wastewater system the connection rate was about 98 but some households were still erroneously connected to the rain sewer system the rain sewer was also characterized by the emission of biocides and urban pesticides as described by wittmer et al 2010 by including both point sources in the study we were able to identify use and emission patterns of common wastewater pollutants from households as well as source specific pollutants from agriculture and private and urban pest control 3 2 temporal patterns in pollutant mixtures in the following temporal patterns in pollutant mixtures are discussed detailed concentration data for each compound and sample can be found in tables s10 and s11 3 2 1 wwtp effluent 3 2 1 1 temporal emission patterns the discharge volume of the wwtp fluctuated only by 14 over the whole sampling period the temperature in the biological treatment compartment i e aeration tank showed a minimum temperature of 11 1 c in february and a maximum temperature of 19 4 c in july august with mean temperatures of 15 9 c in may and of 17 7 c in october table s1 however we detected clear seasonal differences in the pollution load and composition fig 1 in general the lowest loads were emitted in july since we did not analyze the respective influent samples we cannot conclude on the removal efficiency of the wwtp rather we determined the overall patterns resulting from variations in treatment efficiencies and input however low pollutant loads in summer months were also detected in previous studies and were explained by increased biodegradation in the wwtp castiglioni et al 2006 munz et al 2017 vieno et al 2005 in contrast to other studies we detected highest loads in may especially for pharmaceuticals usually higher pharmaceutical concentrations and loads were observed in winter due to decreased biodegradation and increased consumption castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 vieno et al 2005 as we also detected the most diverse pollutant mixture in may the higher loads might have resulted from a higher burden on the microbial community thus reducing the efficiency of biodegradation in the system onesios et al 2009 seasonal differences were driven by month specific clusters of chemicals fig 1 for example high loads of herbicides were detected in may fungicide loads increased in october and february showed a specific emission of a few pharmaceuticals 3 2 1 2 emission groups in the pollutant mixture the target chemicals were separated into four emission groups fig 2 based on the variation of each compound load within a week eq 2 and among the weeks eq 1 in general the four groups were distinguished into two constant i e group 2 and group 4 and two seasonal emission groups i e group 1 and 3 compounds observed at constant levels were assigned to group 2 the lowest wv and bv was 17 and 14 respectively for lidocaine considering these minimum variations this group was neither affected by seasonal nor by great weekly fluctuations and thus reflected baseline emission most members of this group were pharmaceuticals for long term treatments e g carbamazepine beta blockers or daily used drugs e g diclofenac lidocaine for these substances our findings were in agreement with previous studies castiglioni et al 2006 golovko et al 2014 munz et al 2017 vieno et al 2005 for antibiotics like sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim we also observed a rather constant emission in agreement with a study by marx et al 2015 indicating a joint prescription of these antibiotics in germany throughout the year in contrast seasonal peaks for sulfamethoxazole have been detected by castiglioni et al 2006 and golovko et al 2014 finally steady emission was observed for industrial compounds with wide and constant areas of application e g benzotriazole and for the legacy herbicide fenuron and the biocides carbendazim and fipronil those biocides are applied as a fungicide in outdoor paints and as an insecticide in fly traps respectively baua 2017 in contrast to group 2 group 4 compounds were characterized by a higher wv this variation was observed for high consumption compounds e g propiconazole saccharin or might have resulted from variations in the production process for example of the pharmaceuticals pipamerone and melperone from which medicines are formulated batch like in a local plant furthermore low concentrations around the mdl led to higher variation for the herbicide metabolites and low use fungicides seasonal compounds were characterized by a high bv and were covered in groups 1 and 3 group 3 included chemicals which were i constantly emitted within each sampling week however at significantly different loads among the weeks or ii were only found in one of the weeks most agricultural pesticides were among the seasonal compounds with peak application in may thus group 3 compounds were considered as season specific five pharmaceuticals were assigned to this group they had seasonal peaks in february i e sertraline and nitrendipin and in october i e loperamide respectively the occurrence of antihistamine cetirizine peak in may and the anti coughing agent ambroxol peak in february indicated season dependent consumption interestingly the artificial sweetener acesulfame was assigned to this group with a clear peak in the may week since acesulfame is rather persistent during wastewater treatment processes buerge et al 2009 an increased influent load was the only explanation however to our knowledge season dependent removal efficiencies of acesulfame and other sweeteners have not been studied yet group 1 contained seasonal compounds with high wv resulting from four phenomena 1 in case of the agricultural pesticide pethoxamide this was due to a short application peak in may indicating that the effluent directly reflected the agricultural activities of the surrounding area 2 for other compounds apparent seasonal emission resulted from non systematic consumption of privately used chemicals or accidental spills e g dimethoate diazinon or 3 from a few individual data points around the mdl e g the legacy pesticide tp deisopropylatrazine 4 additionally compounds such as 2 napthtalenesulfonic acid showed a large general variation most likely because of its wide area of application due to these diverse reasons for the higher wv this group was called seasonal random overlaps of the clusters confidence intervals may be reduced by repeated and extended sampling to clarify group membership furthermore the intervals indicated outliers e g p toluenesulfonamide tsa and mecoprop mcp which did not fit to any cluster 3 2 2 weather related emission patterns and emission groups in rain sewer effluent in the rain sewer samples the most prominent pattern was driven by rain and dry weather conditions fig 3 based on the chemical load profile dry weather samples were clearly separated from rain weather samples these dynamics were in agreement with wittmer et al 2010 the chemicals were assigned to two emission groups representing chemicals either related to wastewater i e illicit connections or surface runoff fig 4 the validity of cluster outcome was confirmed by famd and k means clustering with a reduced dataset figs s1 and s2 in general pharmaceuticals and legacy pesticides dominated the chemical profile under dry weather conditions indicating wastewater as a source group 1 pesticides and biocides correlated with wet weather conditions group 2 the legacy pesticide atrazine banned since 1991 and pesticide metabolites were detected only in dry weather samples due to their continuous low concentrations which were diluted below the mdl during rain events the input of these compounds occurs likely via infiltrating groundwater as atrazine is still often present after these years in aquifers and the vadose zone in germany and released in low concentrations into surface waters vonberg et al 2014 surface runoff group 2 was characterized by biocides fungicides insecticides and urban pesticides pollution with these compounds from urban areas is considerable due to comparably larger amounts of herbicides applied by urban users than by farmers blanchoud et al 2004 furthermore larger fractions of precipitation enter receiving waters as runoff from paved areas with impermeable materials than from areas with permeable soil biocides and fungicides are often applied on facades and other outdoor surfaces herbicides like mcpa and mecoprop are commonly applied on turf for weed control phillips and bode 2004 wittmer et al 2010 the runoff of terbuthylazine was unexpected as there is no agricultural area connected to the rain sewer outliers of both groups showed a random and precipitation independent emission behavior e g propiconazole or had concentrations close or below the mdl e g 2 octyl 4 isothiazolin deisopropylatrazine and n acetyl 4 aminoantipyrine showed correlation with dry weather discharge but were outliers due to many non detects in contrast to patterns in the wwtp effluent clear seasonal dynamics could not be confirmed in rain sewer discharge in general the pharmaceuticals found were associated with long term treatment and were therefore constantly emitted distinct high loads were only observed in october fig 3 which may have resulted from maintenance works in the sewer system for rain related emissions clear seasonal patterns were missing due to the lack of strong rain events discharge 30 l s 1 in most fall and winter months still privately used pesticides are not as systematically and efficiently applied as agricultural pesticides templeton et al 1998 inter seasonal presence of these compounds was observed in streams due to an extended application period and continuous runoff from urban areas phillips and bode 2004 moreover some non agricultural pesticides have a broad field of application as biocides e g in facade protection single peaks might be further due to spills and incorrect disposal phillips and bode 2004 wittmer et al 2010 this probably holds true for the high peak of dimethoate in the november dry weather sample the rain sewer system is quite sensitive to discharge variations and immediately reflects the activities in its catchment 3 3 risk estimation for temporal emissions and emission groups in order to understand temporal dynamics of risks for fish crustaceans and algae acute tuacute and sublethal risks tusub were associated with emission groups of chemicals as identified in chapter 3 2 the pie charts describe the contribution of each emission group eq 4 and the main drivers of each group eq 3 for each biological quality element bqe figs 5 and s6 3 3 1 risk patterns and risk driving compounds in wwtp effluent acute and sublethal risk from wastewater discharge of the wwtp was assessed per season and emission group concerning the sum toxicity of each sampling week similar seasonal patterns for acute and for sublethal risk were observed for all bqe fig 5a only sublethal risk for fish did not show any strong temporal dependency in general acute toxic risk for fish was lower compared to risks for other bqe and was driven by the seasonally emitted chemicals metolachlor and mcpa fig 5b the potential toxic effect of these two herbicides was mainly explained by their high maximum effluent concentrations i e 849 ng l 1 and 17 836 ng l 1 respectively the exceedence of tuacute by tusub by up to three orders of magnitude indicated the underestimation of risk for fish if only acute toxicity is considered fig 5a due to physiological similarities to mammals fish are potentially more susceptible to pharmaceuticals which are not designed to exhibit acute toxicity but to be biologically active substances corcoran et al 2010 in fact constantly emitted pharmaceuticals explained 90 of the tusub for fish fig 5e the main driver was citalopram 65 which was demonstrated to alter the swimming behavior of fish olsén et al 2014 this might be important for predator prey relations antidepressants have been reported to affect a number of physiological functions corcoran et al 2010 for example the second driver amitriptyline 19 decreased the body length of fish embryos yang et al 2014 yet long term consequences of exposure to these substances in wildlife and on population level are largely unknown for daphnia tuacute and tusub were driven by a diazinon peak in october fig 5c f however in agreement with munz et al 2017 diazinon also dominated the risk pattern in the absence of peak concentrations figs s3 and s4 diazinon is no longer approved for plant protection but is still registered as an insecticide in pet collars against fleas the application in private households might explain the rather random emissions wittmer et al 2010 due to the long hydraulic retention time of 72 h the diazinon concentrations detected during a few days in october likely resulted from a single spill the second driver for tuacute was fipronil 10 which was constantly emitted at low concentrations fig 5c like diazinon fipronil is registered for veterinary and indoor pest control both are neuroactive compounds busch et al 2016 due to their high acute toxicity to non target insects they have been banned as plant protection products however their continuous application in private households still poses an issue for aquatic ecosystems the temporal risk for algae was explained by the seasonal emission of agricultural pesticides fig 5d g the herbicide terbuthylazine 51 and the fungicide spiroxamine 21 explained most of the tuacute fig 5d both drivers were season specific for may while spiroxamine showed a short peak application in the may week and was thus assigned to group 1 a similar emission pattern was observed for mcpa which was the main driver for tusub fig 5g in addition to seasonal sublethal risk drivers daphnia and algae were constantly exposed to sublethal concentrations of diclofenac fig 5f g diclofenac may affect growth in daphnia and cell multiplication in algae dietrich et al 2010 lawrence et al 2012 the anti inflammatory agent was previously identified as a main risk driver in environmental mixtures busch et al 2016 munz et al 2017 and has been associated with risk to fish and mammals corcoran et al 2010 3 3 2 risk patterns and risk driving compounds in rain sewer effluent the chemical profiles in the rain sewer were mainly driven by the weather conditions but most compounds were present in both conditions therefore tus were calculated for dry and rain conditions based on the mec95 of each detected compound likewise the risk contribution of the two emission groups was evaluated for both weather conditions fig 6 higher tus were observed for fish during dry weather the tuacute in the rain sewer was similar to tuacute in may in the wwtp effluent the tuacute for algae was slightly higher during rain events for daphnia again an extraordinary peak was observed tuacute of 2 3 this peak was due to a high concentration 5161 ng l 1 of the neuroactive insecticide dimethoate in the november sample dimethoate is approved for private use as an insecticide in gardens the extraordinary peak in the dry sample in november likely resulted from incorrect disposal after the application period leading to acute risk at the effluent this peak strongly influenced the tuacute patterns for fish and daphnia dimethoate always dominated the acute toxicity for daphnia fig 6c while fipronil strongly contributed to tuacute in rain events and in the absence of the spill event fig s5c for fish dimethoate explained 59 of the tuacute in dry weather in the absence of this spill the risk pattern became more complex with carbendazim as the main driver also under dry weather conditions fig s5b carbendazim is classified as hazardous for human and environmental health echa 2017 for algae the herbicides diuron and terbuthlyazine were important acute risk drivers under both weather conditions fig 6d elevated concentrations of diuron and terbuthlyazine were observed during runoff events however they were still present in low concentrations during dry discharge fig 3 similarly to carbendazim diuron is used in biocides in outdoor paints baua 2017 often both compounds occur as constituents of the same product and are consequently washed off together overall tusub were lower than in wwtp effluent but were dominated by the same pharmaceuticals figs 5 and 6 additionally tusub for daphnia was driven by an exceptionally high metoprolol concentration in the september rain sample 3837 ng l 1 for algae tusub was similar in rain and dry conditions with diuron as main driver fig 6g four out of seven risk drivers in the rain sewer effluent were biocides similar to the patterns in the wwtp effluent randomly used and discarded insecticides posed high risk to aquatic organisms the assessment of both point sources implied that acute and sublethal risk was driven by mainly one emission group in all cases one or two dominating risk driving compounds could be identified lower total risk was often accompanied by a decreasing contribution of the main risk drivers and increasing importance of other compounds leading to a more complex risk pattern and highlighting the need for further investigations of mixture effects figs s3 and s4 3 4 exposure in the receiving river in order to assess the contribution of the studied wwtp and rain sewer to the risk in the receiving river we analyzed monthly composite lvspe samples from the river downstream of these two point sources here we focused on the main risk driving compounds identified in chapter 3 3 table s12 in general the tus increased from may with a peak in july and august fig 7 the discrepancy between the expected risk pattern based on the identified emission groups chapter 3 3 1 and the high summer risk can be explained by the low discharge volume in the river and thus lower dilution from june onwards fig 7 ankley et al 2007 this effect can be clearly seen for tusub for fish which was mostly driven by constantly emitted pharmaceuticals i e similar river discharge resulted in similar tusub fig 7b a season specific risk pattern due to seasonal application could still be deduced for algae higher dilution in spring and input from diffuse sources during summer rains contributed to elevated risk even after the main application period neumann et al 2002 thus these seasonally emitted pollutants require monitoring in higher temporal resolution during the respective peak times and rain events in the following months generally rain discharge calls for event based monitoring short peak emissions via the wwtp effluent and the rain sewer were averaged out in monthly composite samples and the rain sewer effluent was strongly diluted in the river for crustaceans average risk in the river was dominated by constantly emitted fipronil only the dimethoate spill in november was intense enough to be observed in the monthly composite river samples and contributed to the monthly average tuacute concerning the contribution of point sources to the discharge of the river the rain sewer played a minor role 0 01 2 3 still adverse acute and sublethal effects to organisms might be observed at the vicinity of the effluent moreover similar patterns and contributions may be assumed for other rain sewers discharging into the river and contributing to the pollution and risk patterns upstream of the wwtp the studied wwtp contributed up to 40 to the river discharge under low flow conditions and was the main contributor to the pollution with organic micropollutants in the river thus the final pollution and risk pattern in the river was mainly driven by the total river discharge ankley et al 2007 4 conclusions in this study clustering wwtp effluents according to temporal contamination patterns revealed a clear seasonality in the emission reflected by compounds such as agricultural pesticides in spring or fungicides in fall the concentrations of other compounds such as many pharmaceuticals were quite constant in the rain sewer the discrimination between rain and dry discharge dominated contamination patterns which were driven by surface runoff and illicit connections in addition to constantly and seasonally emitted pollutants there were randomly emitted non agricultural pesticide and biocide peaks in both wwtp effluent and rain sewer calling for management these patterns may be used for hypothesis testing in other catchments with similar and different wastewater systems e g concerning cso structures land use and hydraulic retention time characteristics chemical patterns could be directly translated to bqe specific risk patterns while fish were potentially most affected by sublethal effects of constantly emitted chemicals i e baseline emission algae were exposed to seasonal risks random emission of insecticides and biocides from private and urban sources were a strong potential threat for crustaceans high risks were typically related to one or few risk drivers while there may be more contributing chemicals at lower risks this particularly applied for algae and crustaceans which were under high risk during pesticide applications and spills variability of acute and sublethal risks in the river was mainly driven by water discharge of the river rather than by season or peak events due to the lack of sublethal effect data for several compounds and endpoints the assessment provided only a rough estimate on the potential risks to aquatic organisms however this estimate already highlighted the importance of sublethal effects on growth behavior and reproduction in risk assessments and especially underlined the major role of constantly emitted pharmaceuticals in these effects for all bqe furthermore identified risk drivers and risk patterns should be tested in bioassays to confirm their effects and investigate mixture effects on the bqe despite the occurrence of occasionally high loads of insecticides and biocides in the rain sewer the wwtp was still the more important pollution source with a considerable emission of agricultural pesticides and compounds used and produced by local industries the risk posed by non agricultural pesticides and biocides may require rethinking of approval and stormwater management while input of agricultural pesticides may be reduced by awareness rising of professional users by considering pollution dynamics due to temporal and weather influences water authorities may optimize monitoring strategies suggesting high frequency monitoring during main emission times of pesticides and focusing on low water discharge seasons furthermore event based monitoring will support the identification of peak contamination triggered by rain events but will fail to capture random spills event sampling might be especially important for catchments with wwtps strongly affected by rainfall e g combined sewer systems

19673,like many regions around the world new york state usa faces challenges in meeting wastewater treatment quality standards because of aging infrastructure limited funding shifting demographics and increasingly stringent environmental regulations in recent decades construction of new wastewater treatment and distribution infrastructure in ny has most often occurred in exurban communities and suburban developments that are less dense than traditional urban cores here we examine the role of size and capacity utilization on wastewater treatment effectiveness with respect to critical effluent parameters and additionally explore which common facility engineering controls influence water quality treatment using a unique dataset of descriptive information our results challenge conventional wisdom suggesting that the largest facilities 30 000 m3 d not the smallest 300 m3 d discharge tss bod and coliform at significantly higher relative effluent concentrations i e the ratio of discharged concentrations to allowable limits capacity utilization was also positively correlated to higher concentrations of tss bod and coliform effluent concentrations in larger facilities though those concentrations were often within regulated limits this implies that smaller sized facilities may perform better in terms of environmental quality but that the largest facilities demonstrate efficiency in the sense that they are not over treating wastewater while avoiding violations results from ny suggest that medium sized facilities 300 30 000 m3 d are sophisticated enough to incorporate appropriate unit processes and employ operators with sufficient training and oversight to reach treatment outcomes that are both reliable and of high quality keywords wastewater treatment water quality compliance infrastructure new york 1 introduction environmental and public health each rely on appropriate and effective water resources infrastructure wastewater treatment facilities are critical components in the infrastructure landscape that must treat sewage and stormwater derived organic material nutrients and pathogens to sufficient standards so as to protect receiving waters constructing and maintaining such facilities requires significant financial investment globally needed upgrades to aging and inadequate water infrastructure combined with construction associated with new infrastructure are projected to cost trillions of dollars deloitte 2012 it is incumbent upon engineers regulators and scientists among others to ensure that such investments are being made in an environmentally responsible manner in the united states us despite passage of the federal water pollution control act amendments to the clean water act in 1972 surface water quality is still at risk of impairment from inadequate municipal sewage and stormwater treatment maupin and ivahnenko 2011 moore et al 2011 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2009 at the same time funding needs associated with wastewater and stormwater collection and treatment infrastructure are calculated to be on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next twenty years usepa 2016 in many places critical infrastructure was initially built in the 1970 s during a time when higher levels of federal funding were available now those systems are due for replacement repair and upgrade and paying for such improvements has increasingly fallen to local municipalities vedachalam et al 2014 older cities particularly in the northeast and midwest us are additionally challenged with issues associated with declining or stagnant population and the migration of industry out of urban centers and or the region in new york state ny for example the combination of need lack of funding and pressure related to increasingly stringent water quality regulations has been described by state agencies as a gathering storm that threatens both surface water quality and the financial stability of ny s communities nysdec 2008 in 2014 the office of the ny state comptroller released a report describing the difficulty local governments face in addressing infrastructure investment needs new york state office of the comptroller nysoc 2014 the ny state environmental facilities corporation tasked with oversight of the state s clean water state revolving fund reported in 2017 that it was able to provide zero percent interest rate or low cost financing for approximately 830 million of projects costs which comprises approximately 25 of the identified demand nysdec efc 2017 in recent decades within the context of the funding constraints described above construction of new wastewater treatment and distribution infrastructure in ny has most often occurred in exurban communities and suburban developments that are relatively small and less dense than traditional urban cores rahm et al 2013 thus newly constructed facilities have likewise been smaller than the large facilities built in major cities in the past it is important to question whether this movement toward smaller more distributed wastewater treatment makes sense from a financial perspective conventional wisdom suggests that economies of scale exist when systems are larger thus making it more efficient per capita to maintain assets and fund needed construction how true is this for potws for both water supply and wastewater infrastructure research has suggested that costs are largely associated with distribution systems rather than treatment facilities themselves and that expansion of services in sparsely populated areas or in urban areas with low housing density does not achieve the economies of scale that many associate with expansion or consolidation boisvert and schmit 1997 carruthers and ulfarsson 2008 for drinking water supply and delivery in the us utilities exhibit economies of scale but outside of major cities increased population density does not result in cost savings aniket et al 2017 given the limited evidence it appears that financial economies of scale are by no means assured but rather conditional on the specific characteristics of any given system thus even without considering environmental quality implications there is an ongoing challenge to determine the optimum size of centralized wastewater treatment facilities and planning appropriate transitions from older systems to newer ones with respect to water quality there is reason for concern as the size of publicly owned wastewater treatment works potw decrease to the point of complete decentralization on site wastewater treatment systems have been criticized for their potential to fail ahmed et al 2005 their inability to reliably treat nutrients and emerging contaminants subedi et al 2015 oakley et al 2010 as well as challenges associated with regulation and maintenance withers et al 2014 mohamed 2009 all of which potentially threaten nearby ground and surface waters promises to transition small communities from onsite to centralized treatment systems rarely materialize due to concerns about costs and land development but when those transitions do happen the result is often a relatively small facility vedachalam et al 2015 in some cases small and or suburban communities must decide between constructing a new small potw or connecting to an existing larger potw in a nearby urban area the question then arises as a community chooses between smaller or larger facilities are there inherent water quality tradeoffs that ought to be explicitly considered it is this question of water quality tradeoffs that we focus on here from a water quality perspective recent studies have sought to develop insight into potw treatment performance and its relationship to facility characteristics such as size and capacity utilization using a national scale sample of potws weirich et al 2011 used a generalized linear model approach to predict effluent concentrations of four commonly regulated water quality parameters total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod fecal coliform coli and ammonia nh3 weirich et al 2011 they determined that small 40 m3 d wastewater treatment facilities were 10 times more likely to violate their discharge permits than the largest 400 000 m3 d facilities for tss bod and nh3 thus suggesting that small facilities potentially put receiving waters at greater risk of contamination meanwhile the largest facilities 40 000 m3 d were predicted to discharge effluent concentrations close to their permitted limits but at reduced violation rates for facilities below 40 000 m3 d they also observed that as facility size increased effluent concentrations of tss bod and nh3 decreased subsequent research added spatial variables to this modeling approach based on the hypothesis that geographic factors such as temperature and precipitation may affect potw performance on a local scale suchetana et al 2016 results suggested that treatment of tss and bod was susceptible to seasonal variability highlighting the possibility that conclusions regarding the drivers of effluent outcomes may be region specific other research has suggested that urban rural character and process parameters such as hydraulic retention time are important indicators of overall potw performance oliveira et al 2008 together these studies highlight the need to examine driving factors of potw treatment performance across size groups and within the context of regional demographic and financial challenges using data from potws in ny this study re examined the role of size and capacity utilization on potw effectiveness with respect to critical effluent parameters additionally we explored how common facility engineering controls influenced water quality treatment using a unique dataset of descriptive information gathered by the state environmental regulatory agency a goal of this work was to test conventional wisdom and the hypothesis that larger facilities have better water quality treatment outcomes due to their economies of scale an additional hypothesis was that facility operational and engineering processes would be important drivers of effluent water quality 2 methods 2 1 data data on water quality parameters flow regulatory constraints and facility identity were gathered on potws in the state of new york from facility discharge monitoring reports dmr compiled by the us environmental protection agency usepa and made available via the dmr pollutant loading tool usepa 2015 yearly datasets were acquired through the advanced search feature supplemental table s1 details the selection criteria used for querying the dmr database while supplemental table s2 delineates the output fields specified raw data was compiled and subject to cleaning and verification observations within the dataset were removed whenever they lacked data on facility flow rate or in cases where regulatory flow and effluent limits were not specified observations from facilities that split effluent flow between multiple outfalls were also removed from further analysis observations were included only from facilities that reported data on a monthly basis and for which there were at least one year of consecutive observations for water quality parameters observations below detection limits bdl were replaced with a numerical value equal to one half of the detection limit value to check the sensitivity of this assumption preliminary analyses using model 1 described below were conducted for each parameter in which bdl observations were replaced with either zero or a value corresponding to the detection limit results not shown in all cases the significance of comparative tests remained unchanged and coefficient variability was deemed de minimis operational and process control descriptive data for potws was obtained from the nysdec division of water nysdec 2004 it should be noted that such descriptive data was obtained via survey a limitation of this method is that some descriptive information was explicitly queried e g does a facility employ disinfection while other data was supplied on a voluntary basis e g a respondent could indicate nitrogen removal when asked about additional processes see supplemental information tables s2 and s3 for details regarding instances in which voluntarily supplied data were utilized 2 2 statistical analyses because of the potential performance differences between small and large facilities plants were assigned to size groups based on design flow in cubic meters per day m3 d 1 300 2 300 3 000 3 3000 30 000 and 4 30 000 we first explored how effluent water quality parameters table 1 dependent variables varied among these different groups by using mixed effects models since multiple measurements were made at each facility facility was the random effect while design flow group was the fixed effect due to evidence of heteroscedasticity relative concentration values for these parameters were natural log transformed prior to statistical analysis post hoc tukey hsd tests determined which design flow groups were significantly different using the lsmeans package in r the mixed effects model adjusts the group mean based on the non balanced design i e different number of observations per group therefore the adjusted mean may be numerically different than the actual group mean where every observation was given equal weight the mixed effects model controls for the variability within individual potw with multiple observations such that the adjusted mean controls for the variability within specific potw this keeps individual potw and individual observations from having a large effect on the adjusted group mean consequently comparisons between these adjusted means are advantageous and correctly allow multiple observations per potw without assuming each observation is independent from the next mixed effects models were similarly used to describe trends in relative effluent water quality as a function of various independent variables in both small group 1 and large groups 2 through 4 size facilities separately 2 2 1 variables and model development dependent variables used in modeling included four commonly measured and reported effluent water quality parameters table 1 parameter concentrations were normalized by their regulated limits measured mg l 1 allowable effluent concentration mg l 1 in order to create relative concentration values for easier comparison amongst facilities all observations represent monthly averages as reported by individual facilities and span the time period between january 2011 and may 2015 thus a single facility may have up to 53 total observations per parameter independent explanatory variables included in our analysis were chosen to reflect general facility characteristics such as design flow and capacity utilization rate as well as operational and engineering process controls that were hypothesized to be important drivers of effluent water quality general variables meant to reflect economies of scale and efficiency included flow design flow and util capacity utilization design flow captured the hypothesis that larger facilities may be able to achieve economies of scale and thus better or more efficient treatment outcomes than smaller facilities capacity utilization indicated the extent to which a facility was operating at full load facilities operating near their capacity may be more efficiently utilizing their engineering processes however high util values may also indicate that facilities are over capacity and or frequently inundated with stormwater possibly leading to poorer treatment outcomes previous research has shown high util to be correlated to increased violations for bod and ammonia particularly in small facilities weirich et al 2015 variables related to operational and process controls were derived from descriptive facility data nysdec 2004 the variable class had four levels that described the overall sophistication of the facility and thus the certification required of its operators greater levels of facility sophistication and associated operator certification were hypothesized to lead to improved effluent water quality activated sludge as processes are designed to remove biodegradable organic material and were hypothesized to lead to improved bod treatment fil mem indicated the presence of filter or membrane based processes which are used to remove suspended solids and thus likely to drive tss levels for smaller facilities in particular the presence of a dedicated primary settling process coded as pset was hypothesized to lead to improved removal of suspended solids and thus be an important driver of treatment effectiveness other descriptive data related to waste screening grit removal processes and processes entered as pretreatment were not included in this analysis finally the variable dis was included to represent utilization of disinfection processes which was hypothesized to be an important driver of coli the presence or absence of unit processes was identified with a binary code for example facilities reporting use of disinfection processes of any kind were assigned a value of 1 while those reporting no disinfection process were assigned a value of 0 in some cases specific processes known to influence effluent water quality parameters were explored in greater detail for example coli concentrations were expected to decrease if facilities had disinfection processes but specific disinfection methods may impact coli concentrations differently thus the effect of the type of disinfection process uv chlorine or none on coli was tested with mixed effects models on small group 1 and large groups 2 through 4 facilities separately supplemental table s3 additional nitrogen n treatment processes were thought to reduce ammonia concentrations this was tested using mixed effects models where additional n treatment was coded as 1 and no additional treatment was coded as 0 then this variable was set as the fixed effect and facility was set as the random effect supplemental table s4 3 results discussion in total we analyzed 24 917 monthly observations originating from 494 potw mean actual flow recorded increased by roughly an order of magnitude as group size increased table 2 mean capacity utilization also increased as facility size increased table 2 provides summary information on four effluent parameters and their mean absolute values values relative to their regulated limit and average violation frequency for all statistical comparisons we focused on relative effluent concentrations a measure of a facility s ability to meet its regulatory obligations limit thresholds for all facilities were assumed to have been set appropriately during the permitting process there was no correlation between flow and effluent limits for parameters studied here with the exception of nh3 where group 4 facilities had a higher limit generally data not shown limit thresholds are dictated by facility location and the status and assimilative capacity of the receiving waterbody differences in absolute effluent concentrations thus do not necessarily reflect impacts on environmental water quality note that there are more observations for tss and bod than for coli and nh3 which were regulated and thus measured less frequently and or on a seasonal basis 3 1 analysis of relative effluent concentrations tss was the parameter most often regulated and measured in our sample 22 214 observations facilities generally discharged effluent with tss concentrations between a quarter and a third of their regulated limits table 2 group 2 had the lowest mean absolute and relative tss values as well as the lowest median relative tss value while group 4 had the highest group 4 had a significantly higher tukey hsd p 0 05 rtss value than all other groups fig 1 median rtss for group 4 was approximately 45 higher than for group 2 violation rates were similar between groups 2 through 4 with higher violation rates observed in group 1 for bod we analyzed 14 031 observations facilities generally discharged effluent with bod concentrations one third to one half of regulated limits table 2 as with tss group 2 discharged the lowest mean concentrations of both absolute and relative bod as well as median relative bod while group 4 discharged the highest group 2 also discharged significantly lower mean rbod than groups 3 and 4 tukey hsd p 0 05 while group 1 mean rbod discharge was not significantly different from any other group fig 1 median rbod for group 4 was twice as high as groups 1 and 2 violation rates were similar between groups 2 through 4 with higher violation rates observed in group 1 fecal coliform observations numbered 13 112 with performance ranging more widely by group from below 20 of regulated limits to over 40 table 2 coli differed from the previous parameters in that group 2 was observed to discharge the highest mean concentrations of both absolute and relative coliform while group 4 discharged the lowest mean concentrations fig 1 however shows that group 2 rcoli concentrations were comparable to group 1 and 3 while group 4 relative concentrations were significantly higher this is reflected in a comparison of median value which was three times higher in group 4 than in groups 1 and 2 lsmeans and tukey hsd comparisons between groups showed that group 4 effluent rcoli was significantly higher p 0 05 than any other group fig 1 this suggests that the variability in rcoli discharge concentrations within the groups did not allow differentiation between group 2 even though it had the highest actual mean discharge concentration in table 2 and groups 1 or 3 because the mixed effects model controls for repeated measures at each potw these adjusted means differ from the actual means in table 2 however the model correctly controls for these repeated measures and selects which group is significantly different than the others the high mean rcoli value for group 2 the result of high value outliers was also reflected in higher rates of violation for that group compared to others table 2 ammonia observations numbered 3 907 far fewer than for the other parameters but still enough for a useful analysis groups 2 through 4 discharged effluent well below regulated limits averages 0 21 0 31 while group 1 effluent averaged 0 53 group 2 discharged the lowest mean absolute nh3 value while group 4 had the lowest relative value group 1 discharged effluent with the highest mean absolute and relative nh3 values median rnh3 for group 1 was approximately 173 higher than for group 2 violation rates were particularly high for group 1 and relatively low for group 4 3 2 trends and mixed effects modeling of small group 1 and large groups 2 4 potws for each parameter significant differences were observed between groups so size indeed seems to be an important driver for effluent concentration in fact for rtss rbod and rcoli median values were lowest in group 2 and successively increased in group 3 and group 4 which had significantly higher median concentrations than other groups to varying degrees fig 1 trends in groups 2 through 4 were also observed for both absolute and mean relative values of tss bod and coli table 2 for each of these parameters group 1 observations did not follow the pattern established by the other groups previous research sought to uncover relationships between facility size and effluent water quality using linear models fit to all data for each parameter we followed this approach for modeling rnh3 data since there were no general trends in this data across our groupings however for modeling rtss rbod and rcoli and because of the observations laid out above we modeled data from large groups 2 3 and 4 and small group 1 facilities separately these data suggested there may be a relationship between size and effluent quality but that this relationship changes when plants are small in the following sections each parameter is explored individually by modeling both large and small facilities and discussing potentially important driving variables 3 2 1 rtss table 3 displays results of our analysis of rtss for large facilities model 1 is our basic model and incorporated data on design flow and capacity utilization variables that have been used in the past to try and predict facility performance model 2 added general facility operation controls plant class as and the interaction of these terms plant class is a rough reflection of facility sophistication based on the unit processes it employs e g plant class 4 is most sophisticated while plant class 1 is the least and dictates the certification level operators must possess facilities were also described by a binary variable that reflects whether it utilized activated sludge or not a treatment process directed toward bod but also likely to impact other parameters examined here model 3 introduced additional controlling binary variables fil mem pset and dis that describe more specific unit processes and is our final model equation 1 describes this final model which was used for each of the four dependent variables 1 rtss α β 1 flow β 2 util β 3 class β 4 as β 5 class as β 6 fil mem β 7 pset β 8 dis ε results suggest that design flow and capacity utilization remained significant for each model and that as design flow and utilization increased rtss increased model 2 variables related to plant class and activated sludge indicated significant decreases in rtss associated with use of activated sludge processes but significant increases in rtss for class 4 facilities relative to class 2 model 3 additionally indicated that filter membrane and disinfection processes when employed were associated with significantly decreased rtss of all parameters as and fil mem were the most significant predictors of lower rtss while class 4 was an indicator of increased rtss table 4 shows rtss model results for small facilities unlike for large facilities design flow and capacity utilization were not significant for any model but addition of model 2 variables did suggest that use of activated sludge processes were significantly correlated with decreased rtss model 3 indicated that filter membrane processes when employed were associated with significantly lower rtss overall model results suggest that regardless of facility size lower rtss is strongly associated with use of filter membrane processes this makes sense as such processes are designed to remove suspended solids biological processes employing activated sludge which are also designed to remove at least some suspended solids were also associated with decreased rtss consistent with previous reports niku and schroeder 1981 oliveira et al 2008 for large facilities rtss was also impacted by a variable related to operator certification and plant sophistication interestingly unlike results reported previously for a national scale dataset weirich et al 2011 rtss actually increased as plant class increased in complexity class 1 least complex and class 4 most sophisticated this is shown in table 4 where the significant positive coefficient for plant class 4 0 43 indicates this plant class has a greater rtss than the reference class 2 group this may reflect the idea that progressively more sophisticated facilities are able to confidently manage their effluent concentrations closer to their regulatory limits such facilities may have operational and process technologies that allow for slimmer margins of error or through physical attributes of their collection systems or in plant flow equilibration abilities they may have increased resilience to changes in flow caused by weather and other events 3 2 2 rbod results with rbod as the dependent variable show that capacity utilization but not design flow was significant for each model of large facilities table 5 as with rtss higher capacity utilization was associated with increased rbod the addition of model 2 variables suggested that plant class 4 was also associated with higher rbod model 3 indicates that activated sludge filter membrane and disinfection processes were all associated with decreased rbod of these three process variables activated sludge had the largest coefficient suggesting its importance in driving rbod values for small facilities as with rtss neither capacity utilization nor design flow were significant predictors of rbod table 6 model 2 variables were also not significant in model 3 as pset and dis were significant predictors of decreased rbod overall results implied that activated sludge processes were important controls on rbod in both small and large facilities this was expected since activated sludge is designed to remove bod regardless of facility size interestingly disinfection was shown to be a significant indicator of lower rbod in both sets of models one possible conclusion is that regardless of treatment design disinfection processes help to oxidize organic material just prior to facility water quality testing given previous findings weirich et al 2015 it was surprising that util was not a significant variable particularly in small facilities it is possible that this reflects differences between our state level dataset and the nation more generally other previous reports have suggested that temperature was a significant driver of effluent bod niku and schroeder 1981 but our efforts to introduce season and thus temperature as an independent variable did not indicate it as a significant variable here results not shown 3 2 3 rcoli mixed effects model results for large facilities using rcoli as the dependent variable showed that design flow and capacity utilization remained significant for each model suggesting that as facility size and capacity utilization increased rcoli also increased table 7 the addition of model 2 variables suggested that activated sludge processes were associated with increased rcoli except in class 1 facilities where activated sludge was associated with decreased rcoli model 3 indicated that filter membrane processes when employed were associated with significantly decreased rcoli while primary settling was associated with increased rcoli for small facilities capacity utilization was the only significant variable and was positively correlated with rcoli table 8 for rcoli as with rtss modeling large facilities showed that relative effluent concentrations increased as size increased again this supports the idea that larger facilities are able to confidently manage their effluent concentrations closer to regulatory limits as expected the use of filter membrane processes is correlated with lower rcoli as bacteria are likely to be associated with the suspended solids that these technologies are designed to remove why activated sludge or primary settling should be associated with increased rcoli in larger facilities is not clear if anything one would expect the lower concentrations of organic matter and suspended solids associated with use of such processes to increase the effectiveness of disinfection it was surprising to us that disinfection was not significant in our models of either large or small facilities one might expect disinfection processes to be the main controlling variable for rcoli to test this expectation further a mixed effects model approach was used with rcoli as the dependent variable and specific disinfection process as the independent variable results supported initial model results with no significant difference detected between process types and facilities which reported no disinfection processes at all fig 2 it is possible that this analysis is confounded by the fact that use of disinfection processes is correlated with the reporting of coli data facilities that are not required to collect data on coli often do not report disinfection process use still the available data is puzzling in this regard 3 2 4 rnh3 relative to the parameters discussed above there were fewer observations in our dataset containing both nh3 effluent data and descriptive facility data because of this modeling large and small facilities separately was not possible instead we modeled all available data across all 4 size groups table 9 results indicate that neither design flow nor capacity utilization were significant drivers of rnh3 and that none of the specific unit processes included in model 3 were significant model 2 variables related to plant class and activated sludge usage generally supported conclusions drawn from fig 1 relative to class 2 class 1 had higher rnh3 activated sludge processes were associated with decreased rnh3 except in class 1 facilities ammonia was interesting because it was the parameter for which facilities received the greatest rates of violations three groups 1 through 3 had average nh3 violation rates higher than 4 table 2 we decided to model ammonia violations using independent variables selected from table 2 first with ammonia violations as the dependent variable each potential independent variable was tested for significance using a generalized linear model approach with probit regression the resulting significant independent variables included flow util and class all of which were incorporated into our final generalized linear model for ammonia violations equation 2 results indicate that the probabilities of exceeding ammonia limits varied significantly by group with group 1 facilities having the highest 11 8 and group 4 facilities having the smallest 0 9 groups 2 and 3 had exceedance probabilities of 4 3 and 4 8 respectively 2 nh 3 v i o l a t i o n α β 1 flow β 2 util β 3 class ε in general the most noteworthy result of our ammonia analysis was that smaller facilities had higher probabilities of exceedance than larger facilities consistent with previous analyses of national scale data weirich et al 2011 that being said it was not clear why that should be the case although it was consistent with the idea discussed previously that larger facilities have a greater degree of control over effluent concentrations to explore this result further information on additional treatment was utilized from the descriptive information database this was a column in which facilities could report unit processes not explicitly queried elsewhere in some cases facilities reported use of nitrogen removal processes we modeled rnh3 using additional nitrogen removal as the independent variable expecting additional treatment to be associated with lower rnh3 values however as fig 3 demonstrates reported nitrogen removal processes did not significantly impact rnh3 values this was surprising although many facilities use their biological unit processes to control nh3 concentrations it is possible that such information was not captured in the survey 3 3 implications of results our goal was first to test the hypothesis that potw facility size impacts treatment effectiveness and that larger facilities are able to capture economies of scale to deliver improved water quality performance secondly we sought to use a unique dataset of descriptive information to isolate the effect of specific operational and unit processes on treatment outcomes for specific parameters we found that in ny size and capacity utilization have significant impacts on effluent concentrations for some parameters studied here fig 1 table 10 for tss bod and fecal coliforms our results suggested that it was the largest facilities not the smallest that discharged significantly higher relative effluent concentrations than other size groups these differences represented relative concentration changes of between 45 and 200 while the actual environmental impact of such differences in concentration would depend on the status and assimilative capacity of the receiving waterbody it seems reasonable to speculate that they could have an impact and so would be of concern to any plant operator regulator or resource manager thus bigger was not necessarily better this differs in some sense from previous analyses of national scale data in which model results suggested that larger and less utilized facilities discharged lower relative effluent concentrations weirich et al 2011 our finding that facilities sized between 300 and 3000 m3 d often outperformed other size groups was also novel and suggests caution when applying conclusions based on national datasets to regional systems capacity utilization was positively linked to higher relative parameter concentrations supporting previous analyses showing that both small and large facilities could struggle to meet effluent concentration limits when operating above their designed capacity weirich et al 2015 suchetana et al 2016 however as table 2 demonstrates increased utilization rates do not necessarily lead to increased numbers of violations in fact for ammonia there is an inverse relationship between the two therefore while increased utilization is linked to higher relative effluent concentrations of tss bod and fecal coliforms particularly in large facilities these facilities are often meeting their regulated limits so do larger wastewater treatment facilities deliver economies of scale with respect to effluent water quality there are at least two ways to interpret our results first if the goal is to minimize release of contaminants into the environment then larger facilities are not performing particularly well compared to smaller facilities the largest facilities studied here have the highest median effluent values for rtss rbod and rcoli in this regard facilities between 300 and 3000 m3 d actually outperform other size groups a second interpretation is that larger facilities are able to most efficiently treat contaminants according to regulated guidelines an idea that was forwarded in previous research on a national scale dataset weirich et al 2011 in this interpretation the largest facilities outperform other groups in the sense that they are not over treating wastewater and thus are more efficiently utilizing their resources while avoiding violations indeed the largest facilities studied here registered the lowest violation percentage for bod fecal coliform and ammonia compared to other size groups for each parameter excluding rnh3 our results did suggest that the smallest facilities group 1 did not fit the trend established by larger facilities groups 2 4 this implies that controls on performance for small facilities are different than for larger facilities not necessarily that treatment outcomes are worse according to our results table 10 small facilities can potentially improve tss treatment outcomes through usage of activated sludge and filter membrane processes improved bod treatment may be achieved through use of activated sludge primary settling and disinfection processes effective fecal coliform management may be a matter of avoiding high utilization rates which may in part be achieved through better stormwater management in the collection system ammonia treatment is rarely required for small facilities but when it is increased facility sophistication and operator certification combined with usage of activated sludge may lead to better treatment outcomes for large facilities improved tss and bod performance is linked to usage of activated sludge filter and membrane and disinfection processes though this conclusion must be tempered with the observation that the largest facilities routinely discharge higher relative concentrations of tss and fecal coliform than others table 10 while class 4 facilities are associated with higher discharge of rtss and rbod one caveat of this analysis is that we did not explicitly account for combined sewer and stormwater collection systems which are common in larger facilities in new york state since combined systems are subject to flow variation associated with precipitation events it is reasonable to hypothesize that such systems may be at risk of violating effluent limits during peak flow however our analysis demonstrates that despite this risk the largest facilities reliably avoid violations at least with respect to monthly average observations recorded in dmr reports future work might consider a more focused analysis of combined systems how do peak flows and resulting changes in effluent quality change our understanding of what otherwise seem like efficient reliable systems the implication of our analysis is not straightforward in some ways these results are encouraging if the goal of wastewater treatment is to produce effluent with relatively low contaminant concentrations the trend toward smaller facilities in new york is not necessarily a bad thing though it certainly appears that medium sized facilities with a modicum of sophistication and operator training is preferable to the smallest and simplest on the other hand if the goal is to meet regulatory thresholds while minimizing violations proliferation of small facilities presents a concern that our infrastructure is not achieving the economies of scale with respect to water quality that the largest facilities can offer ideally treatment would lead to reliably low effluent contaminant concentrations while being resilient to system perturbations that lead to violations this provokes an interesting set of questions what can be done to reduce violation occurrence in small facilities that are otherwise treating effluent to high standards conversely is it possible to reduce effluent concentrations at large facilities without disrupting their reliability both approaches seem worthy of exploration and future work should clearly lay out the available mechanisms for achieving these outcomes while assessing their feasibility policy makers should consider whether it is prudent to incentivize infrastructure development in constructive ways likewise infrastructure financing institutions in cooperation with environmental regulatory agencies may place conditions on projects of various sizes for example municipalities seeking financing for a small facility may be incentivized to include specific treatment processes or to build in a higher level of sophistication in order to both secure financial assistance and guard against possible effluent violations in the future of course decisions to build expand improve and or abandon wastewater infrastructure are not made solely on the basis of environmental impact though this is a necessary consideration as some research has recently suggested using life cycle assessment methods eg lorenzo toja et al 2015 and resilience theory juan garcía et al 2017 how infrastructure development progresses is influenced by resident ability and willingness to pay regulatory changes perhaps related to emerging contaminants or new understanding of classical contaminants additional tradeoffs related to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions perceptions of risk and resilience as well as economic considerations related for example to governance and job retention and creation how to best develop wastewater infrastructure is a complex question that academics professionals and elected officials should be asking with vigor and frequency the answer depends greatly on local conditions and values should be informed by engineering and financial good sense and should reflect the state of the art in our knowledge of environmental and public health 4 conclusion it seems worthwhile overall to revisit some of the previous conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of small potws in new york our results suggest that the smallest facilities are usually achieving relative effluent concentrations rtss rbod and rcoli that are lower than the largest facilities that being said it is medium sized plants that routinely perform the best in terms of water quality unlike previous findings it is medium to large plants for which utilization rates positively correlate to increased rtss and rbod in addition our results suggest that the drivers of performance for small facilities may be different than for larger facilities and that conclusions with respect to unit process effectiveness may not apply across size groups from a management perspective the largest facilities harness economies of scale in the sense that they do not over treat wastewater and are able to maintain effluent concentrations close to but not over their regulated limits from an environmental quality perspective however we argue that there is cause for concern at both the small and large end of the size and utilization spectrums medium sized facilities 300 30 000 m3 d are perhaps sophisticated enough to incorporate appropriate unit processes and employ operators with sufficient training and certification to reach treatment outcomes that are both reliable and of high quality

19673,like many regions around the world new york state usa faces challenges in meeting wastewater treatment quality standards because of aging infrastructure limited funding shifting demographics and increasingly stringent environmental regulations in recent decades construction of new wastewater treatment and distribution infrastructure in ny has most often occurred in exurban communities and suburban developments that are less dense than traditional urban cores here we examine the role of size and capacity utilization on wastewater treatment effectiveness with respect to critical effluent parameters and additionally explore which common facility engineering controls influence water quality treatment using a unique dataset of descriptive information our results challenge conventional wisdom suggesting that the largest facilities 30 000 m3 d not the smallest 300 m3 d discharge tss bod and coliform at significantly higher relative effluent concentrations i e the ratio of discharged concentrations to allowable limits capacity utilization was also positively correlated to higher concentrations of tss bod and coliform effluent concentrations in larger facilities though those concentrations were often within regulated limits this implies that smaller sized facilities may perform better in terms of environmental quality but that the largest facilities demonstrate efficiency in the sense that they are not over treating wastewater while avoiding violations results from ny suggest that medium sized facilities 300 30 000 m3 d are sophisticated enough to incorporate appropriate unit processes and employ operators with sufficient training and oversight to reach treatment outcomes that are both reliable and of high quality keywords wastewater treatment water quality compliance infrastructure new york 1 introduction environmental and public health each rely on appropriate and effective water resources infrastructure wastewater treatment facilities are critical components in the infrastructure landscape that must treat sewage and stormwater derived organic material nutrients and pathogens to sufficient standards so as to protect receiving waters constructing and maintaining such facilities requires significant financial investment globally needed upgrades to aging and inadequate water infrastructure combined with construction associated with new infrastructure are projected to cost trillions of dollars deloitte 2012 it is incumbent upon engineers regulators and scientists among others to ensure that such investments are being made in an environmentally responsible manner in the united states us despite passage of the federal water pollution control act amendments to the clean water act in 1972 surface water quality is still at risk of impairment from inadequate municipal sewage and stormwater treatment maupin and ivahnenko 2011 moore et al 2011 united states environmental protection agency usepa 2009 at the same time funding needs associated with wastewater and stormwater collection and treatment infrastructure are calculated to be on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next twenty years usepa 2016 in many places critical infrastructure was initially built in the 1970 s during a time when higher levels of federal funding were available now those systems are due for replacement repair and upgrade and paying for such improvements has increasingly fallen to local municipalities vedachalam et al 2014 older cities particularly in the northeast and midwest us are additionally challenged with issues associated with declining or stagnant population and the migration of industry out of urban centers and or the region in new york state ny for example the combination of need lack of funding and pressure related to increasingly stringent water quality regulations has been described by state agencies as a gathering storm that threatens both surface water quality and the financial stability of ny s communities nysdec 2008 in 2014 the office of the ny state comptroller released a report describing the difficulty local governments face in addressing infrastructure investment needs new york state office of the comptroller nysoc 2014 the ny state environmental facilities corporation tasked with oversight of the state s clean water state revolving fund reported in 2017 that it was able to provide zero percent interest rate or low cost financing for approximately 830 million of projects costs which comprises approximately 25 of the identified demand nysdec efc 2017 in recent decades within the context of the funding constraints described above construction of new wastewater treatment and distribution infrastructure in ny has most often occurred in exurban communities and suburban developments that are relatively small and less dense than traditional urban cores rahm et al 2013 thus newly constructed facilities have likewise been smaller than the large facilities built in major cities in the past it is important to question whether this movement toward smaller more distributed wastewater treatment makes sense from a financial perspective conventional wisdom suggests that economies of scale exist when systems are larger thus making it more efficient per capita to maintain assets and fund needed construction how true is this for potws for both water supply and wastewater infrastructure research has suggested that costs are largely associated with distribution systems rather than treatment facilities themselves and that expansion of services in sparsely populated areas or in urban areas with low housing density does not achieve the economies of scale that many associate with expansion or consolidation boisvert and schmit 1997 carruthers and ulfarsson 2008 for drinking water supply and delivery in the us utilities exhibit economies of scale but outside of major cities increased population density does not result in cost savings aniket et al 2017 given the limited evidence it appears that financial economies of scale are by no means assured but rather conditional on the specific characteristics of any given system thus even without considering environmental quality implications there is an ongoing challenge to determine the optimum size of centralized wastewater treatment facilities and planning appropriate transitions from older systems to newer ones with respect to water quality there is reason for concern as the size of publicly owned wastewater treatment works potw decrease to the point of complete decentralization on site wastewater treatment systems have been criticized for their potential to fail ahmed et al 2005 their inability to reliably treat nutrients and emerging contaminants subedi et al 2015 oakley et al 2010 as well as challenges associated with regulation and maintenance withers et al 2014 mohamed 2009 all of which potentially threaten nearby ground and surface waters promises to transition small communities from onsite to centralized treatment systems rarely materialize due to concerns about costs and land development but when those transitions do happen the result is often a relatively small facility vedachalam et al 2015 in some cases small and or suburban communities must decide between constructing a new small potw or connecting to an existing larger potw in a nearby urban area the question then arises as a community chooses between smaller or larger facilities are there inherent water quality tradeoffs that ought to be explicitly considered it is this question of water quality tradeoffs that we focus on here from a water quality perspective recent studies have sought to develop insight into potw treatment performance and its relationship to facility characteristics such as size and capacity utilization using a national scale sample of potws weirich et al 2011 used a generalized linear model approach to predict effluent concentrations of four commonly regulated water quality parameters total suspended solids tss biochemical oxygen demand bod fecal coliform coli and ammonia nh3 weirich et al 2011 they determined that small 40 m3 d wastewater treatment facilities were 10 times more likely to violate their discharge permits than the largest 400 000 m3 d facilities for tss bod and nh3 thus suggesting that small facilities potentially put receiving waters at greater risk of contamination meanwhile the largest facilities 40 000 m3 d were predicted to discharge effluent concentrations close to their permitted limits but at reduced violation rates for facilities below 40 000 m3 d they also observed that as facility size increased effluent concentrations of tss bod and nh3 decreased subsequent research added spatial variables to this modeling approach based on the hypothesis that geographic factors such as temperature and precipitation may affect potw performance on a local scale suchetana et al 2016 results suggested that treatment of tss and bod was susceptible to seasonal variability highlighting the possibility that conclusions regarding the drivers of effluent outcomes may be region specific other research has suggested that urban rural character and process parameters such as hydraulic retention time are important indicators of overall potw performance oliveira et al 2008 together these studies highlight the need to examine driving factors of potw treatment performance across size groups and within the context of regional demographic and financial challenges using data from potws in ny this study re examined the role of size and capacity utilization on potw effectiveness with respect to critical effluent parameters additionally we explored how common facility engineering controls influenced water quality treatment using a unique dataset of descriptive information gathered by the state environmental regulatory agency a goal of this work was to test conventional wisdom and the hypothesis that larger facilities have better water quality treatment outcomes due to their economies of scale an additional hypothesis was that facility operational and engineering processes would be important drivers of effluent water quality 2 methods 2 1 data data on water quality parameters flow regulatory constraints and facility identity were gathered on potws in the state of new york from facility discharge monitoring reports dmr compiled by the us environmental protection agency usepa and made available via the dmr pollutant loading tool usepa 2015 yearly datasets were acquired through the advanced search feature supplemental table s1 details the selection criteria used for querying the dmr database while supplemental table s2 delineates the output fields specified raw data was compiled and subject to cleaning and verification observations within the dataset were removed whenever they lacked data on facility flow rate or in cases where regulatory flow and effluent limits were not specified observations from facilities that split effluent flow between multiple outfalls were also removed from further analysis observations were included only from facilities that reported data on a monthly basis and for which there were at least one year of consecutive observations for water quality parameters observations below detection limits bdl were replaced with a numerical value equal to one half of the detection limit value to check the sensitivity of this assumption preliminary analyses using model 1 described below were conducted for each parameter in which bdl observations were replaced with either zero or a value corresponding to the detection limit results not shown in all cases the significance of comparative tests remained unchanged and coefficient variability was deemed de minimis operational and process control descriptive data for potws was obtained from the nysdec division of water nysdec 2004 it should be noted that such descriptive data was obtained via survey a limitation of this method is that some descriptive information was explicitly queried e g does a facility employ disinfection while other data was supplied on a voluntary basis e g a respondent could indicate nitrogen removal when asked about additional processes see supplemental information tables s2 and s3 for details regarding instances in which voluntarily supplied data were utilized 2 2 statistical analyses because of the potential performance differences between small and large facilities plants were assigned to size groups based on design flow in cubic meters per day m3 d 1 300 2 300 3 000 3 3000 30 000 and 4 30 000 we first explored how effluent water quality parameters table 1 dependent variables varied among these different groups by using mixed effects models since multiple measurements were made at each facility facility was the random effect while design flow group was the fixed effect due to evidence of heteroscedasticity relative concentration values for these parameters were natural log transformed prior to statistical analysis post hoc tukey hsd tests determined which design flow groups were significantly different using the lsmeans package in r the mixed effects model adjusts the group mean based on the non balanced design i e different number of observations per group therefore the adjusted mean may be numerically different than the actual group mean where every observation was given equal weight the mixed effects model controls for the variability within individual potw with multiple observations such that the adjusted mean controls for the variability within specific potw this keeps individual potw and individual observations from having a large effect on the adjusted group mean consequently comparisons between these adjusted means are advantageous and correctly allow multiple observations per potw without assuming each observation is independent from the next mixed effects models were similarly used to describe trends in relative effluent water quality as a function of various independent variables in both small group 1 and large groups 2 through 4 size facilities separately 2 2 1 variables and model development dependent variables used in modeling included four commonly measured and reported effluent water quality parameters table 1 parameter concentrations were normalized by their regulated limits measured mg l 1 allowable effluent concentration mg l 1 in order to create relative concentration values for easier comparison amongst facilities all observations represent monthly averages as reported by individual facilities and span the time period between january 2011 and may 2015 thus a single facility may have up to 53 total observations per parameter independent explanatory variables included in our analysis were chosen to reflect general facility characteristics such as design flow and capacity utilization rate as well as operational and engineering process controls that were hypothesized to be important drivers of effluent water quality general variables meant to reflect economies of scale and efficiency included flow design flow and util capacity utilization design flow captured the hypothesis that larger facilities may be able to achieve economies of scale and thus better or more efficient treatment outcomes than smaller facilities capacity utilization indicated the extent to which a facility was operating at full load facilities operating near their capacity may be more efficiently utilizing their engineering processes however high util values may also indicate that facilities are over capacity and or frequently inundated with stormwater possibly leading to poorer treatment outcomes previous research has shown high util to be correlated to increased violations for bod and ammonia particularly in small facilities weirich et al 2015 variables related to operational and process controls were derived from descriptive facility data nysdec 2004 the variable class had four levels that described the overall sophistication of the facility and thus the certification required of its operators greater levels of facility sophistication and associated operator certification were hypothesized to lead to improved effluent water quality activated sludge as processes are designed to remove biodegradable organic material and were hypothesized to lead to improved bod treatment fil mem indicated the presence of filter or membrane based processes which are used to remove suspended solids and thus likely to drive tss levels for smaller facilities in particular the presence of a dedicated primary settling process coded as pset was hypothesized to lead to improved removal of suspended solids and thus be an important driver of treatment effectiveness other descriptive data related to waste screening grit removal processes and processes entered as pretreatment were not included in this analysis finally the variable dis was included to represent utilization of disinfection processes which was hypothesized to be an important driver of coli the presence or absence of unit processes was identified with a binary code for example facilities reporting use of disinfection processes of any kind were assigned a value of 1 while those reporting no disinfection process were assigned a value of 0 in some cases specific processes known to influence effluent water quality parameters were explored in greater detail for example coli concentrations were expected to decrease if facilities had disinfection processes but specific disinfection methods may impact coli concentrations differently thus the effect of the type of disinfection process uv chlorine or none on coli was tested with mixed effects models on small group 1 and large groups 2 through 4 facilities separately supplemental table s3 additional nitrogen n treatment processes were thought to reduce ammonia concentrations this was tested using mixed effects models where additional n treatment was coded as 1 and no additional treatment was coded as 0 then this variable was set as the fixed effect and facility was set as the random effect supplemental table s4 3 results discussion in total we analyzed 24 917 monthly observations originating from 494 potw mean actual flow recorded increased by roughly an order of magnitude as group size increased table 2 mean capacity utilization also increased as facility size increased table 2 provides summary information on four effluent parameters and their mean absolute values values relative to their regulated limit and average violation frequency for all statistical comparisons we focused on relative effluent concentrations a measure of a facility s ability to meet its regulatory obligations limit thresholds for all facilities were assumed to have been set appropriately during the permitting process there was no correlation between flow and effluent limits for parameters studied here with the exception of nh3 where group 4 facilities had a higher limit generally data not shown limit thresholds are dictated by facility location and the status and assimilative capacity of the receiving waterbody differences in absolute effluent concentrations thus do not necessarily reflect impacts on environmental water quality note that there are more observations for tss and bod than for coli and nh3 which were regulated and thus measured less frequently and or on a seasonal basis 3 1 analysis of relative effluent concentrations tss was the parameter most often regulated and measured in our sample 22 214 observations facilities generally discharged effluent with tss concentrations between a quarter and a third of their regulated limits table 2 group 2 had the lowest mean absolute and relative tss values as well as the lowest median relative tss value while group 4 had the highest group 4 had a significantly higher tukey hsd p 0 05 rtss value than all other groups fig 1 median rtss for group 4 was approximately 45 higher than for group 2 violation rates were similar between groups 2 through 4 with higher violation rates observed in group 1 for bod we analyzed 14 031 observations facilities generally discharged effluent with bod concentrations one third to one half of regulated limits table 2 as with tss group 2 discharged the lowest mean concentrations of both absolute and relative bod as well as median relative bod while group 4 discharged the highest group 2 also discharged significantly lower mean rbod than groups 3 and 4 tukey hsd p 0 05 while group 1 mean rbod discharge was not significantly different from any other group fig 1 median rbod for group 4 was twice as high as groups 1 and 2 violation rates were similar between groups 2 through 4 with higher violation rates observed in group 1 fecal coliform observations numbered 13 112 with performance ranging more widely by group from below 20 of regulated limits to over 40 table 2 coli differed from the previous parameters in that group 2 was observed to discharge the highest mean concentrations of both absolute and relative coliform while group 4 discharged the lowest mean concentrations fig 1 however shows that group 2 rcoli concentrations were comparable to group 1 and 3 while group 4 relative concentrations were significantly higher this is reflected in a comparison of median value which was three times higher in group 4 than in groups 1 and 2 lsmeans and tukey hsd comparisons between groups showed that group 4 effluent rcoli was significantly higher p 0 05 than any other group fig 1 this suggests that the variability in rcoli discharge concentrations within the groups did not allow differentiation between group 2 even though it had the highest actual mean discharge concentration in table 2 and groups 1 or 3 because the mixed effects model controls for repeated measures at each potw these adjusted means differ from the actual means in table 2 however the model correctly controls for these repeated measures and selects which group is significantly different than the others the high mean rcoli value for group 2 the result of high value outliers was also reflected in higher rates of violation for that group compared to others table 2 ammonia observations numbered 3 907 far fewer than for the other parameters but still enough for a useful analysis groups 2 through 4 discharged effluent well below regulated limits averages 0 21 0 31 while group 1 effluent averaged 0 53 group 2 discharged the lowest mean absolute nh3 value while group 4 had the lowest relative value group 1 discharged effluent with the highest mean absolute and relative nh3 values median rnh3 for group 1 was approximately 173 higher than for group 2 violation rates were particularly high for group 1 and relatively low for group 4 3 2 trends and mixed effects modeling of small group 1 and large groups 2 4 potws for each parameter significant differences were observed between groups so size indeed seems to be an important driver for effluent concentration in fact for rtss rbod and rcoli median values were lowest in group 2 and successively increased in group 3 and group 4 which had significantly higher median concentrations than other groups to varying degrees fig 1 trends in groups 2 through 4 were also observed for both absolute and mean relative values of tss bod and coli table 2 for each of these parameters group 1 observations did not follow the pattern established by the other groups previous research sought to uncover relationships between facility size and effluent water quality using linear models fit to all data for each parameter we followed this approach for modeling rnh3 data since there were no general trends in this data across our groupings however for modeling rtss rbod and rcoli and because of the observations laid out above we modeled data from large groups 2 3 and 4 and small group 1 facilities separately these data suggested there may be a relationship between size and effluent quality but that this relationship changes when plants are small in the following sections each parameter is explored individually by modeling both large and small facilities and discussing potentially important driving variables 3 2 1 rtss table 3 displays results of our analysis of rtss for large facilities model 1 is our basic model and incorporated data on design flow and capacity utilization variables that have been used in the past to try and predict facility performance model 2 added general facility operation controls plant class as and the interaction of these terms plant class is a rough reflection of facility sophistication based on the unit processes it employs e g plant class 4 is most sophisticated while plant class 1 is the least and dictates the certification level operators must possess facilities were also described by a binary variable that reflects whether it utilized activated sludge or not a treatment process directed toward bod but also likely to impact other parameters examined here model 3 introduced additional controlling binary variables fil mem pset and dis that describe more specific unit processes and is our final model equation 1 describes this final model which was used for each of the four dependent variables 1 rtss α β 1 flow β 2 util β 3 class β 4 as β 5 class as β 6 fil mem β 7 pset β 8 dis ε results suggest that design flow and capacity utilization remained significant for each model and that as design flow and utilization increased rtss increased model 2 variables related to plant class and activated sludge indicated significant decreases in rtss associated with use of activated sludge processes but significant increases in rtss for class 4 facilities relative to class 2 model 3 additionally indicated that filter membrane and disinfection processes when employed were associated with significantly decreased rtss of all parameters as and fil mem were the most significant predictors of lower rtss while class 4 was an indicator of increased rtss table 4 shows rtss model results for small facilities unlike for large facilities design flow and capacity utilization were not significant for any model but addition of model 2 variables did suggest that use of activated sludge processes were significantly correlated with decreased rtss model 3 indicated that filter membrane processes when employed were associated with significantly lower rtss overall model results suggest that regardless of facility size lower rtss is strongly associated with use of filter membrane processes this makes sense as such processes are designed to remove suspended solids biological processes employing activated sludge which are also designed to remove at least some suspended solids were also associated with decreased rtss consistent with previous reports niku and schroeder 1981 oliveira et al 2008 for large facilities rtss was also impacted by a variable related to operator certification and plant sophistication interestingly unlike results reported previously for a national scale dataset weirich et al 2011 rtss actually increased as plant class increased in complexity class 1 least complex and class 4 most sophisticated this is shown in table 4 where the significant positive coefficient for plant class 4 0 43 indicates this plant class has a greater rtss than the reference class 2 group this may reflect the idea that progressively more sophisticated facilities are able to confidently manage their effluent concentrations closer to their regulatory limits such facilities may have operational and process technologies that allow for slimmer margins of error or through physical attributes of their collection systems or in plant flow equilibration abilities they may have increased resilience to changes in flow caused by weather and other events 3 2 2 rbod results with rbod as the dependent variable show that capacity utilization but not design flow was significant for each model of large facilities table 5 as with rtss higher capacity utilization was associated with increased rbod the addition of model 2 variables suggested that plant class 4 was also associated with higher rbod model 3 indicates that activated sludge filter membrane and disinfection processes were all associated with decreased rbod of these three process variables activated sludge had the largest coefficient suggesting its importance in driving rbod values for small facilities as with rtss neither capacity utilization nor design flow were significant predictors of rbod table 6 model 2 variables were also not significant in model 3 as pset and dis were significant predictors of decreased rbod overall results implied that activated sludge processes were important controls on rbod in both small and large facilities this was expected since activated sludge is designed to remove bod regardless of facility size interestingly disinfection was shown to be a significant indicator of lower rbod in both sets of models one possible conclusion is that regardless of treatment design disinfection processes help to oxidize organic material just prior to facility water quality testing given previous findings weirich et al 2015 it was surprising that util was not a significant variable particularly in small facilities it is possible that this reflects differences between our state level dataset and the nation more generally other previous reports have suggested that temperature was a significant driver of effluent bod niku and schroeder 1981 but our efforts to introduce season and thus temperature as an independent variable did not indicate it as a significant variable here results not shown 3 2 3 rcoli mixed effects model results for large facilities using rcoli as the dependent variable showed that design flow and capacity utilization remained significant for each model suggesting that as facility size and capacity utilization increased rcoli also increased table 7 the addition of model 2 variables suggested that activated sludge processes were associated with increased rcoli except in class 1 facilities where activated sludge was associated with decreased rcoli model 3 indicated that filter membrane processes when employed were associated with significantly decreased rcoli while primary settling was associated with increased rcoli for small facilities capacity utilization was the only significant variable and was positively correlated with rcoli table 8 for rcoli as with rtss modeling large facilities showed that relative effluent concentrations increased as size increased again this supports the idea that larger facilities are able to confidently manage their effluent concentrations closer to regulatory limits as expected the use of filter membrane processes is correlated with lower rcoli as bacteria are likely to be associated with the suspended solids that these technologies are designed to remove why activated sludge or primary settling should be associated with increased rcoli in larger facilities is not clear if anything one would expect the lower concentrations of organic matter and suspended solids associated with use of such processes to increase the effectiveness of disinfection it was surprising to us that disinfection was not significant in our models of either large or small facilities one might expect disinfection processes to be the main controlling variable for rcoli to test this expectation further a mixed effects model approach was used with rcoli as the dependent variable and specific disinfection process as the independent variable results supported initial model results with no significant difference detected between process types and facilities which reported no disinfection processes at all fig 2 it is possible that this analysis is confounded by the fact that use of disinfection processes is correlated with the reporting of coli data facilities that are not required to collect data on coli often do not report disinfection process use still the available data is puzzling in this regard 3 2 4 rnh3 relative to the parameters discussed above there were fewer observations in our dataset containing both nh3 effluent data and descriptive facility data because of this modeling large and small facilities separately was not possible instead we modeled all available data across all 4 size groups table 9 results indicate that neither design flow nor capacity utilization were significant drivers of rnh3 and that none of the specific unit processes included in model 3 were significant model 2 variables related to plant class and activated sludge usage generally supported conclusions drawn from fig 1 relative to class 2 class 1 had higher rnh3 activated sludge processes were associated with decreased rnh3 except in class 1 facilities ammonia was interesting because it was the parameter for which facilities received the greatest rates of violations three groups 1 through 3 had average nh3 violation rates higher than 4 table 2 we decided to model ammonia violations using independent variables selected from table 2 first with ammonia violations as the dependent variable each potential independent variable was tested for significance using a generalized linear model approach with probit regression the resulting significant independent variables included flow util and class all of which were incorporated into our final generalized linear model for ammonia violations equation 2 results indicate that the probabilities of exceeding ammonia limits varied significantly by group with group 1 facilities having the highest 11 8 and group 4 facilities having the smallest 0 9 groups 2 and 3 had exceedance probabilities of 4 3 and 4 8 respectively 2 nh 3 v i o l a t i o n α β 1 flow β 2 util β 3 class ε in general the most noteworthy result of our ammonia analysis was that smaller facilities had higher probabilities of exceedance than larger facilities consistent with previous analyses of national scale data weirich et al 2011 that being said it was not clear why that should be the case although it was consistent with the idea discussed previously that larger facilities have a greater degree of control over effluent concentrations to explore this result further information on additional treatment was utilized from the descriptive information database this was a column in which facilities could report unit processes not explicitly queried elsewhere in some cases facilities reported use of nitrogen removal processes we modeled rnh3 using additional nitrogen removal as the independent variable expecting additional treatment to be associated with lower rnh3 values however as fig 3 demonstrates reported nitrogen removal processes did not significantly impact rnh3 values this was surprising although many facilities use their biological unit processes to control nh3 concentrations it is possible that such information was not captured in the survey 3 3 implications of results our goal was first to test the hypothesis that potw facility size impacts treatment effectiveness and that larger facilities are able to capture economies of scale to deliver improved water quality performance secondly we sought to use a unique dataset of descriptive information to isolate the effect of specific operational and unit processes on treatment outcomes for specific parameters we found that in ny size and capacity utilization have significant impacts on effluent concentrations for some parameters studied here fig 1 table 10 for tss bod and fecal coliforms our results suggested that it was the largest facilities not the smallest that discharged significantly higher relative effluent concentrations than other size groups these differences represented relative concentration changes of between 45 and 200 while the actual environmental impact of such differences in concentration would depend on the status and assimilative capacity of the receiving waterbody it seems reasonable to speculate that they could have an impact and so would be of concern to any plant operator regulator or resource manager thus bigger was not necessarily better this differs in some sense from previous analyses of national scale data in which model results suggested that larger and less utilized facilities discharged lower relative effluent concentrations weirich et al 2011 our finding that facilities sized between 300 and 3000 m3 d often outperformed other size groups was also novel and suggests caution when applying conclusions based on national datasets to regional systems capacity utilization was positively linked to higher relative parameter concentrations supporting previous analyses showing that both small and large facilities could struggle to meet effluent concentration limits when operating above their designed capacity weirich et al 2015 suchetana et al 2016 however as table 2 demonstrates increased utilization rates do not necessarily lead to increased numbers of violations in fact for ammonia there is an inverse relationship between the two therefore while increased utilization is linked to higher relative effluent concentrations of tss bod and fecal coliforms particularly in large facilities these facilities are often meeting their regulated limits so do larger wastewater treatment facilities deliver economies of scale with respect to effluent water quality there are at least two ways to interpret our results first if the goal is to minimize release of contaminants into the environment then larger facilities are not performing particularly well compared to smaller facilities the largest facilities studied here have the highest median effluent values for rtss rbod and rcoli in this regard facilities between 300 and 3000 m3 d actually outperform other size groups a second interpretation is that larger facilities are able to most efficiently treat contaminants according to regulated guidelines an idea that was forwarded in previous research on a national scale dataset weirich et al 2011 in this interpretation the largest facilities outperform other groups in the sense that they are not over treating wastewater and thus are more efficiently utilizing their resources while avoiding violations indeed the largest facilities studied here registered the lowest violation percentage for bod fecal coliform and ammonia compared to other size groups for each parameter excluding rnh3 our results did suggest that the smallest facilities group 1 did not fit the trend established by larger facilities groups 2 4 this implies that controls on performance for small facilities are different than for larger facilities not necessarily that treatment outcomes are worse according to our results table 10 small facilities can potentially improve tss treatment outcomes through usage of activated sludge and filter membrane processes improved bod treatment may be achieved through use of activated sludge primary settling and disinfection processes effective fecal coliform management may be a matter of avoiding high utilization rates which may in part be achieved through better stormwater management in the collection system ammonia treatment is rarely required for small facilities but when it is increased facility sophistication and operator certification combined with usage of activated sludge may lead to better treatment outcomes for large facilities improved tss and bod performance is linked to usage of activated sludge filter and membrane and disinfection processes though this conclusion must be tempered with the observation that the largest facilities routinely discharge higher relative concentrations of tss and fecal coliform than others table 10 while class 4 facilities are associated with higher discharge of rtss and rbod one caveat of this analysis is that we did not explicitly account for combined sewer and stormwater collection systems which are common in larger facilities in new york state since combined systems are subject to flow variation associated with precipitation events it is reasonable to hypothesize that such systems may be at risk of violating effluent limits during peak flow however our analysis demonstrates that despite this risk the largest facilities reliably avoid violations at least with respect to monthly average observations recorded in dmr reports future work might consider a more focused analysis of combined systems how do peak flows and resulting changes in effluent quality change our understanding of what otherwise seem like efficient reliable systems the implication of our analysis is not straightforward in some ways these results are encouraging if the goal of wastewater treatment is to produce effluent with relatively low contaminant concentrations the trend toward smaller facilities in new york is not necessarily a bad thing though it certainly appears that medium sized facilities with a modicum of sophistication and operator training is preferable to the smallest and simplest on the other hand if the goal is to meet regulatory thresholds while minimizing violations proliferation of small facilities presents a concern that our infrastructure is not achieving the economies of scale with respect to water quality that the largest facilities can offer ideally treatment would lead to reliably low effluent contaminant concentrations while being resilient to system perturbations that lead to violations this provokes an interesting set of questions what can be done to reduce violation occurrence in small facilities that are otherwise treating effluent to high standards conversely is it possible to reduce effluent concentrations at large facilities without disrupting their reliability both approaches seem worthy of exploration and future work should clearly lay out the available mechanisms for achieving these outcomes while assessing their feasibility policy makers should consider whether it is prudent to incentivize infrastructure development in constructive ways likewise infrastructure financing institutions in cooperation with environmental regulatory agencies may place conditions on projects of various sizes for example municipalities seeking financing for a small facility may be incentivized to include specific treatment processes or to build in a higher level of sophistication in order to both secure financial assistance and guard against possible effluent violations in the future of course decisions to build expand improve and or abandon wastewater infrastructure are not made solely on the basis of environmental impact though this is a necessary consideration as some research has recently suggested using life cycle assessment methods eg lorenzo toja et al 2015 and resilience theory juan garcía et al 2017 how infrastructure development progresses is influenced by resident ability and willingness to pay regulatory changes perhaps related to emerging contaminants or new understanding of classical contaminants additional tradeoffs related to energy use and greenhouse gas emissions perceptions of risk and resilience as well as economic considerations related for example to governance and job retention and creation how to best develop wastewater infrastructure is a complex question that academics professionals and elected officials should be asking with vigor and frequency the answer depends greatly on local conditions and values should be informed by engineering and financial good sense and should reflect the state of the art in our knowledge of environmental and public health 4 conclusion it seems worthwhile overall to revisit some of the previous conclusions with respect to the effectiveness of small potws in new york our results suggest that the smallest facilities are usually achieving relative effluent concentrations rtss rbod and rcoli that are lower than the largest facilities that being said it is medium sized plants that routinely perform the best in terms of water quality unlike previous findings it is medium to large plants for which utilization rates positively correlate to increased rtss and rbod in addition our results suggest that the drivers of performance for small facilities may be different than for larger facilities and that conclusions with respect to unit process effectiveness may not apply across size groups from a management perspective the largest facilities harness economies of scale in the sense that they do not over treat wastewater and are able to maintain effluent concentrations close to but not over their regulated limits from an environmental quality perspective however we argue that there is cause for concern at both the small and large end of the size and utilization spectrums medium sized facilities 300 30 000 m3 d are perhaps sophisticated enough to incorporate appropriate unit processes and employ operators with sufficient training and certification to reach treatment outcomes that are both reliable and of high quality

19674,sulfate radical s o 4 induced oxidation is an important technology in advanced oxidation processes aops for the removal of pollutants to date few studies have assessed the effects of dissolved oxygen do on the s o 4 induced oxidation of organic micro pollutants in the present work a quantum chemical calculation was used to investigate the influence of the external oxygen molecule on the gibbs free energy g p o l l u t a n t and homo lumo gap δ e of 15 organic micro pollutants representing four chemical categories several thermodynamic and statistical models were combined with the data from the quantum chemical calculation to illustrate the impact of do on the oxidation of organic micro pollutants by s o 4 results indicated that the external oxygen molecule increased g p o l l u t a n t of all studied chemicals which implies do has the potential to decrease the energy barrier of the s o 4 induced oxidation and shift the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products from the perspective of kinetics do can accelerate the oxidation by decreasing δ e of organic micro pollutants in addition changes of g p o l l u t a n t and δ e of the s o 4 induced oxidation were both significantly different between open chain and aromatic chemicals and these differences were partially attributed to the difference of polarizability of these two types of chemicals furthermore we revealed that all changes of g p o l l u t a n t and δ e induced by do were dependent on the do content our study emphasizes the significance of do on the oxidation of organic micro pollutants by s o 4 and also provides a theoretical method to study the effect of components in wastewater on removal of organic pollutants in aops graphical abstract image keywords sulfate radical advanced oxidation process dissolved oxygen organic micro pollutants quantum chemical calculation thermodynamics and kinetics 1 introduction due to insufficient removal during treatment of wastewater released from industry and households a large number of diverse organic micro pollutants are frequently detected in effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps boyd et al 2003 gavrilescu et al 2015 heeb et al 2012 law et al 2013 paxéus 1996 schaider et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and receiving waters the occurrence of these micro pollutants has become a worldwide issue of increasing environmental concern due to their various adverse effects on human health and ecosystem functioning for instance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs with carcinogenic characteristics boström et al 2002 have been widely detected in sources of drinking water in various parts of the world ma et al 2008 menzie et al 1992 sarria villa et al 2016 stackelberg et al 2007 in addition several aryl halide pollutants which have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system have been reported in drinking water sources colborn et al 1993 ibhazehiebo et al 2011 miyagawa et al 2014 from an ecosystem perspective these chemicals can lead to a decrease in biodiversity and a loss of important functions galic et al 2012 scha fer et al 2012 a field investigation in hesse germany revealed that organic micro pollutants from treated wastewater could change the macroinvertebrate community significantly and threaten the health of stream ecosystems bunzel et al 2013 sulfate radical s o 4 induced oxidation rastogi et al 2009 anipsitakis et al 2006 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 one of the predominant technologies for advanced oxidation processes aops rozas et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 has been proposed to degrade or remove organic micro pollutants during wastewater treatment to overcome the challenges of their release s o 4 possesses a redox potential 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 comparable to that of the hydroxyl radical 1 9 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 which makes s o 4 theoretically capable of degrading most organic pollutants to a variety of small molecule organic acids s o 4 reacts with the organic pollutants via electron transfer predominantly hydrogen abstraction and addition mechanisms lutze et al 2015 numerous studies have demonstrated that s o 4 can oxidize a wide range of contaminants including alcohols carboxylic acids polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps perfluoroalkyl compounds pfcs and azo dyes clifton and huie 1989 fang et al 2012 feng et al 2017 grgić et al 2007 lee et al 2009 xu and li 2010 more recent studies have evaluated the influence of co existing components in water on the s o 4 induced aops to degrade different types of micro pollutants lian et al 2017 reported that inorganic ions and k2s2o8 could scavenge s o 4 thereby decreasing the actual reaction rate of s o 4 mediated oxidation zhou et al 2017a found that co existing phenoxyl radicals influenced the orientation of the s o 4 reaction degradation pathway for the β2 adrenoceptor agonists salbutamol and terbutaline and that chloride was the most effective scavenger for s o 4 several studies have also evaluated the significance of nanomaterials during s o 4 generation guan et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 they found that fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic porous cufe2o4 could effectively catalyze the formation of s o 4 to accelerate the degradation rate of recalcitrant organic contaminants although dissolved oxygen do is one of the most important components in natural waters to our knowledge there are no studies that have assessed its influence on s o 4 mediated oxidation of organic micro pollutants the limited studies available regarding the influence of do on s o 4 induced aops were concerned solely with the generation of s o 4 fang et al 2013a liu et al 2013 xie et al 2017 determined by an electron paramagnetic resonance technique eibenberger et al 1978 generally the effects of do on the generation of s o 4 in water are dependent on oxidants such as persulfate fang et al 2013a peroxymonosulfate liu et al 2013 and sulfite xie et al 2017 and activators such as radiation mark et al 1990 heat lutze et al 2015 base furman et al 2010 ozone yang et al 2015 organic compounds fang et al 2013b ahmad et al 2013 and transition metal catalysis anipsitakis et al 2006 fang et al 2013a investigated the activation of persulfate by magnetite nanoparticles mnps for the degradation of 2 4 4 cb pcb28 they found that increasing the do concentration led to the generation of more o 2 thereby activating the persulfate to produce more s o 4 by mnps which favored the degradation of pcb28 xie et al 2017 also found that increasing the do concentration favored the generation of s o 4 in the fe0 sulfite system to degrade organic pollutants because the formation of s o 5 via oxidation of s o 3 by oxygen is necessary to produce s o 4 however liu et al 2013 found that a decrease in do concentration benefitted the yield of s o 4 in the uv peroxymonosulfate system these studies indicate that the influence of do on the generation of s o 4 in aqueous solution depends on the specific oxidation system thus experimental methods can help elucidate the effects of do on the degradation of organic micro pollutants in wastewater but it is difficult to determine if those effects are also mediated by influencing the process of s o 4 induced oxidation in water given the limitation of current experimental methods theoretical methods represent a useful alternative to address the challenges identified above many quantum chemical calculations have been performed to study the degradation of organic micro pollutants during the process of sewage treatment liu et al calculated the frontier electron densities feds of benzophenone 4 to predict the possible reaction sites for electron extraction with sulfate radicals liu et al 2016 moreover zhou et al proposed the oxidation pathways of the phenoxyl radicals of salbutamol and terbutaline through molecular orbital calculations zhou et al 2017a in order to analyze pathways qualitatively quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate parameters involved in the degradation e g rate constants recently some studies used homo lumo gap δ e to explain the degradation of organic contaminants during the process of sewage treatment cooke et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 homo represents the highest occupied molecular orbital and lumo represents the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital here δ e is defined as the energy difference between homo and lumo 1 δ e e l u m o e h o m o where e h o m o and e l u m o are the corresponding values of energy to understand the degradation of organic micro pollutants quantum chemical calculations such as δ e can be used along with additional theoretical models to characterize the role of do on s o 4 induced oxidation in the present study we evaluated the influence of do on the chemical equilibrium and kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation fifteen chemicals belonging to four main categories alcohols carboxylic acids aromatic hydrocarbons and aryl halides were selected as representative organic micro pollutants their gibbs free energy g p o l l u t a n t and δ e with and without interaction with do were calculated using quantum chemistry different models were used with the obtained thermodynamic data to illustrate the effect of do on oxidation observed variability in the influence of do on different chemicals was partially attributed to differences of polarizability furthermore the influence of do on s o 4 induced oxidation of chemicals was associated with do content despite variable trends across different molecules 2 methods 2 1 chemicals four categories of chemicals alcohols carboxylic acids aromatic hydrocarbons and aryl halides were included in the present study these categories cover a majority of organic micro pollutants therefore the results obtained in the present study can be applied to additional organic micro pollutants the alcohol category included methanol ethanol 1 propanol and 1 butanol while formic acid acetic acid oxalic acid and propanoic acid represented the carboxylic acids benzene phenanthrene phenol and toluene represented the aromatic hydrocarbons and the aryl halide category comprised 4 bromophenol 4 chlorotoluene and dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt the chemical structures of the 15 study chemicals are presented in fig 1 2 2 computational details to evaluate the influence of do on g p o l l u t a n t and δ e it was necessary to compare g p o l l u t a n t and δ e in the absence of the external oxygen molecule g 0 and δ e 0 respectively with g p o l l u t a n t and δ e in the presence of the external oxygen molecule g 1 and δ e 1 respectively g 0 and δ e 0 for individual chemicals were calculated based on their structures and respective vibrational frequencies to calculate g 1 and δe 1 we optimized the structure to include an oxygen molecule initially and then removed the oxygen molecule and performed vibrational frequency analysis on the corresponding organic chemicals the schematic of the procedure is shown in fig 2 and benzene is included as a representative chemical g 0 δ e 0 g 1 and δ e 1 for all chemicals were calculated at 25 c to examine the dependence on do content the values of g p o l l u t a n t and δ e for 4 chemicals ethanol formic acid benzene and ddt one from each category impacted by 2 oxygen molecules were calculated i e g 2 and δ e 2 these values were subsequently compared with g 0 δ e 0 g 1 and δ e 1 the polarizabilities of all chemicals were calculated to explain the degree of change induced by the oxygen molecule all of the optimization and analysis of vibrational frequencies were performed using gaussian 09 with b3lyp 6 31g the solvation effect was adopted by using the implicit water model barone and cossi 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of dissolved oxygen on the thermodynamics of reactions before analyzing the effect of do the physical chemistry involved in s o 4 induced oxidation is introduced here the oxidation can be presented as 2 o r g a n i c p o l l u t a n t s o 4 o t h e r p r o d u c t s s o 4 2 the reaction reaches equilibrium when equation 3 occurs 3 g p o l l u t a n t g s o 4 g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 here g p o l l u t a n t is the gibbs free energy of the chemical and it can be g 0 or g 1 g s o 4 g p r o d u c t and g s o 4 2 are gibbs free energy values of s o 4 other products and so 4 2 respectively before reaching equilibrium all chemicals will experience a transition state based on these basic concepts a diagram of the gibbs free energy profile along the reaction coordinate is shown in fig 3 for all reactions g s o 4 and g s o 4 2 have unique but fixed values that are independent of the pollutant and therefore these values are not discussed and we only focus on the chemicals g t s refers to the gibbs free energy of chemicals at the transition state g p r o d u c t represents the gibbs free energy of the products δ g 0 g t s g 0 and δ g 1 g t s g 1 are the values of the energy barrier δ g o 2 refers to the difference between g 1 and g 0 δ g o 2 g 1 g 0 g 0 and g 1 values for each chemical were calculated table 1 g 1 is systematically larger than g 0 and it demonstrates that do may affect the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction induced by s o 4 the external oxygen molecule can decrease the energy barrier of the s o 4 induced reaction however δ g 0 δ g 1 regardless of the value of g t s this is explained by the following equation 4 δ g 0 δ g 1 g t s g 0 g t s g 1 g 1 g 0 δ g o 2 0 δ g o 2 values for all chemicals were positive fig 4 a smaller energy barrier means that reactions can occur more easily as a result do shifts the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products in other words greater concentrations of chemicals can be degraded by the same amount of s o 4 when do is present this point can be elucidated by analyzing the change of equilibrium constant k which can be written as follows 5 k s o 4 2 b 0 p r o d u c t 1 b 1 p r o d u c t 2 b 2 p r o d u c t n b n s o 4 a 0 organic pollutant a 1 where x represents the concentration of x namely p r o d u c t s o 4 2 s o 4 or organic pollutant a and b are the stoichiometry of reactants and products respectively the equilibrium constant from the perspective of statistical physics can be defined by 6 k exp g p r r t where g p r denotes the difference between the gibbs free energy of products and reactants defined as g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 0 g s o 4 or g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 1 g s o 4 r represents the gas constant and t is the temperature in kelvin the exact value of g p r o d u c t for each chemical cannot be calculated because the final products of these chemicals are unknown however regardless of the g p r o d u c t and g s o 4 2 g s o 4 values the value of exp g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 1 g s o 4 r t is always greater than exp g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 0 g s o 4 r t because 7 g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 1 g s o 4 g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 0 g s o 4 g 1 g 0 δ g o 2 0 therefore the equilibrium constant in the presence of do is larger than that in the absence of do as shown in fig 4 δ g o 2 values for aromatic chemicals aromatic hydrocarbons and aryl halides with the exception of 4 bromophenol are higher than those for open chain chemicals alcohols and carboxylic acids δ g o 2 values for ddt phenol and toluene are the greatest in the present study 7 462 kj mol 6 864 kj mol and 5 603 kj mol respectively all of these chemicals have at least one benzene ring in contrast all of the open chain chemicals in this study have low δ g o 2 values 2 kj mol indicating that do can affect the chemical equilibrium of s o 4 induced oxidation of cyclic compounds more significantly than open chain chemicals the results are helpful for designing innovative aops to treat different kinds of organic micro pollutants in wastewater 3 2 homo lumo gap and the kinetics the effect of do on the kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation is studied in this section we confirmed that the external oxidation molecule can make the process of oxidation faster by decreasing δ e of organic micro pollutants according to the frontier molecular orbital theory fukui et al 1952 δ e can be used to predict the stability of chemicals xiao et al 2014 revealed that the second order rate constants of s o 4 induced oxidation k s o 4 were linearly related to the value of δ e in the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model the relationship between k s o 4 and δ e can be described by equation 8 8 k s o 4 26 8 3 97 o c 0 746 δe where o c is the ratio of oxygen to carbon atoms for an individual chemical o c remains unchanged so equation 8 suggests that k s o 4 becomes larger if δ e decreases all of the values for δ e o 2 δ e 1 δ e 0 were negative table 1 fig 5 indicating that do can decrease δ e of all 15 chemicals included in this study furthermore do increases the efficiency of s o 4 induced oxidation the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons by s o 4 can be accelerated by the presence of oxygen more significantly than the other chemical categories δ e o 2 values for benzene toluene phenanthrene and 4 chlorotoluene all of which are aromatic hydrocarbons were the greatest 17 342 kj mol 16 588 kj mol 15 262 kj mol and 13 728 kj mol fig 5 especially toluene has a high value of δ e o 2 ranked second table 1 as well as a high value of δ g o 2 ranked third table 1 it means do retains a significant influence on both of kinetics and thermodynamic of toluene thus increasing the do content represents a useful method to promote the s o 4 induced oxidation of toluene in contrast to other chemicals possessing a benzene ring 4 bromophenol was the only chemical resistant to the influence of do in the present study its δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 values were 0 2834 kj mol and 1 404 kj mol respectively this finding might be explained by the bromine atom which could render the molecule more stable and counteract the interaction with external molecules e g oxygen molecule to further explore the influence of the bromine atom on s o 4 induced oxidation under different do concentrations δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 of bromoethane and bromobenzene were calculated the values were 0 273 and 0 78 kj mol and 0 0104 and 0 208 kj mol for bromoethane and bromobenzene respectively indicating that similar to 4 bromophenol other bromine containing molecules were resistant to the influence of do all of the open chain chemicals assessed in this study had low δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 values less negative indicating that they would be less affected by do during the process of s o 4 induced oxidation more experimental evidence is needed to validate this theoretical inference 3 3 polarizability determines the degree of influence of dissolved oxygen changes in the thermodynamics and kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation are significantly different for open chain chemicals and aromatic chemicals when the oxygen molecule is present this result may be attributed to the significant difference of polarizability which determines the dynamic response of a system to external fields zhou et al 2003 between these two chemical families the oxidation reduction reaction is a process involving electron transfer marcus 1956 and therefore both the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxidation reactions are related to the distribution of charges in reactant molecules the polarizability of each chemical is shown in fig 6 the polarizability of aromatic chemicals is systematically larger than open chain chemicals this is consistent with the fact that both δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 values of aromatic chemicals are larger than those of open chain chemicals the cause of this consistency is also clear s o 4 is a strong electron acceptor when it reacts with organic micro pollutants malato et al 1998 under the influence of an oxygen molecule aromatic chemicals which have a larger polarizability redistribute their charges consequently the ability of electron transfer becomes stronger and the oxidation can take place more easily and faster however the relationship between polarizability and δ g o 2 or δ e o 2 values was neither linear nor monotonous therefore the influence of do on s o 4 induced oxidation of organic micro pollutants can only partly be attributed to the polarizability difference of chemicals and further research addressing the importance of other factors is warranted 3 4 dependence of content of dissolved oxygen g p o l l u t a n t and δ e of ethanol formic acid benzene and ddt in the presence of two external oxygen molecules g 2 and δ e 2 were calculated table 1 in fig 7 these values were compared with g 0 δ e 0 g 1 and δ e 1 for all molecules g 2 g 0 and δ e 2 δ e 0 which indicates do would always result in more productive and faster s o 4 induced oxidation however changes to g p o l l u t a n t and δ e along the do content present variable trends for different molecules for ethanol g 2 g 1 g 0 and δ e 2 δ e 1 δ e 0 fig 7a and b changes of both g p o l l u t a n t and δ e are monotonous which suggests that increasing the do content will make the s o 4 induced oxidation of ethanol more productive and faster it can be expected that these values will not increase infinitely thus both g p o l l u t a n t and δ e have a maximum value at a point with a specific amount of do for formic acid g 1 g 2 g 0 and δ e 1 δ e 2 δ e 0 fig 7c and d these trends can be described by quadratic functions to promote effective s o 4 induced oxidation of ethanol or alcohols the do content should be maintained within a suitable range for benzene and ddt fig 7e h g p o l l u t a n t and δ e have different trends the change of g p o l l u t a n t was monotonous as observed for ethanol while the change of δ e was similar to that of formic acid the results showed that the trends of g p o l l u t a n t along the number of oxygen molecules are the same for ethanol benzene and ddt while the trend for formic acid is different the trends of δ e are the same for formic acid benzene and ddt while ethanol is the exception these differences may be attributed to the differences of many factors such as oxidation degree functional groups dipole moment and so on but unfortunately no study has been reported to date on the relationship between these variables and the values of g p o l l u t a n t or δ e numerous researches are therefore required in future to resolve this puzzle in general these results suggested the effects of do on s o 4 induced oxidation are dependent on its content while the dependencies are variable for different molecules additional studies are essential to examine if the rules based on these 4 representative chemicals also apply to other chemicals belonging to the same categories 3 5 environmental significance sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes sr aops are gaining increasing scientific attention as effective solutions for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and are regarded as supplements to wwtps costanza et al 2010 guan et al 2013 lee et al 2009 yen et al 2011 in recent years environmental scientists have published numerous papers on such applications of sr aops many of these studies determined the impacts of natural water components including ions such as chloride bromide carbonate and natural organic matter humic or fulvic substances guan et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017b 2017c on the degradation of organic micro pollutants in sr aops do is also an important component in natural water and wastewaters however to the best of our knowledge little attention has been paid to its influence on the oxidation efficiency of sr aops in principle the involvement of do in the subsequent reactions with the radicals or intermediates would occur after the initial electron transfer between sulfate radical and target compound the present work for the first time investigated the impacts of do on the degradation of 15 different chemicals in sr aops by using a theoretical strategy our results demonstrated that the presence of do was beneficial for the degradation of selected contaminants by s o 4 via decreasing the energy barrier of the s o 4 induced oxidation and δ e of organic micro pollutants in sr aops thus do content was an important parameter to consider with respect to the efficiency of s o 4 induced oxidation according to our theoretical research when sulfate radicals are used for in situ restoration of contaminated soils and groundwater the input of oxygen into these hypoxic conditions would significantly increase the efficiency of s o 4 mediated oxidation this finding provides useful information for developing new in situ remediation strategies for contaminated soils and waters in addition the involvement of do may affect the oxidation mechanisms distribution of oxidation products and the toxicity of reaction intermediates the effect of do on oxidation pathways is an interesting topic and deserves further investigation taken together the results of the current study can provide a novel way to understand the significance and importance of do in s o 4 mediated oxidation 4 conclusion in summary we used a theoretical method combining a quantum chemical calculation thermodynamic models and statistical models to illustrate the influence of do on the oxidation of organic micro pollutants by s o 4 the external oxygen molecule increased g p o l l u t a n t and decreased δ e of organic chemicals which would theoretically lead to more productive and efficient s o 4 induced oxidation changes of thermodynamics and kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation were different between open chain and aromatic chemicals due to the significant difference of polarizability of these two chemical families furthermore we demonstrated that all of the influences were dependent on the content of oxygen molecules additional studies are warranted to understand this dependence more clearly from the perspective of methodology the present paper is the first to assess the influence of one specific component in wastewater on the process of oxidation induced by s o 4 our innovative method could help further understand the effects of other components and types of aops for use in wastewater treatment and pollutant removal of course experimental studies are still important to explore related questions and validate results from our

19674,sulfate radical s o 4 induced oxidation is an important technology in advanced oxidation processes aops for the removal of pollutants to date few studies have assessed the effects of dissolved oxygen do on the s o 4 induced oxidation of organic micro pollutants in the present work a quantum chemical calculation was used to investigate the influence of the external oxygen molecule on the gibbs free energy g p o l l u t a n t and homo lumo gap δ e of 15 organic micro pollutants representing four chemical categories several thermodynamic and statistical models were combined with the data from the quantum chemical calculation to illustrate the impact of do on the oxidation of organic micro pollutants by s o 4 results indicated that the external oxygen molecule increased g p o l l u t a n t of all studied chemicals which implies do has the potential to decrease the energy barrier of the s o 4 induced oxidation and shift the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products from the perspective of kinetics do can accelerate the oxidation by decreasing δ e of organic micro pollutants in addition changes of g p o l l u t a n t and δ e of the s o 4 induced oxidation were both significantly different between open chain and aromatic chemicals and these differences were partially attributed to the difference of polarizability of these two types of chemicals furthermore we revealed that all changes of g p o l l u t a n t and δ e induced by do were dependent on the do content our study emphasizes the significance of do on the oxidation of organic micro pollutants by s o 4 and also provides a theoretical method to study the effect of components in wastewater on removal of organic pollutants in aops graphical abstract image keywords sulfate radical advanced oxidation process dissolved oxygen organic micro pollutants quantum chemical calculation thermodynamics and kinetics 1 introduction due to insufficient removal during treatment of wastewater released from industry and households a large number of diverse organic micro pollutants are frequently detected in effluents of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps boyd et al 2003 gavrilescu et al 2015 heeb et al 2012 law et al 2013 paxéus 1996 schaider et al 2014 wang et al 2017 and receiving waters the occurrence of these micro pollutants has become a worldwide issue of increasing environmental concern due to their various adverse effects on human health and ecosystem functioning for instance polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs with carcinogenic characteristics boström et al 2002 have been widely detected in sources of drinking water in various parts of the world ma et al 2008 menzie et al 1992 sarria villa et al 2016 stackelberg et al 2007 in addition several aryl halide pollutants which have the potential to disrupt the endocrine system have been reported in drinking water sources colborn et al 1993 ibhazehiebo et al 2011 miyagawa et al 2014 from an ecosystem perspective these chemicals can lead to a decrease in biodiversity and a loss of important functions galic et al 2012 scha fer et al 2012 a field investigation in hesse germany revealed that organic micro pollutants from treated wastewater could change the macroinvertebrate community significantly and threaten the health of stream ecosystems bunzel et al 2013 sulfate radical s o 4 induced oxidation rastogi et al 2009 anipsitakis et al 2006 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 one of the predominant technologies for advanced oxidation processes aops rozas et al 2016 xiao et al 2014 has been proposed to degrade or remove organic micro pollutants during wastewater treatment to overcome the challenges of their release s o 4 possesses a redox potential 2 5 3 1 v neta et al 1988 comparable to that of the hydroxyl radical 1 9 2 7 v buxton et al 1988 which makes s o 4 theoretically capable of degrading most organic pollutants to a variety of small molecule organic acids s o 4 reacts with the organic pollutants via electron transfer predominantly hydrogen abstraction and addition mechanisms lutze et al 2015 numerous studies have demonstrated that s o 4 can oxidize a wide range of contaminants including alcohols carboxylic acids polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps perfluoroalkyl compounds pfcs and azo dyes clifton and huie 1989 fang et al 2012 feng et al 2017 grgić et al 2007 lee et al 2009 xu and li 2010 more recent studies have evaluated the influence of co existing components in water on the s o 4 induced aops to degrade different types of micro pollutants lian et al 2017 reported that inorganic ions and k2s2o8 could scavenge s o 4 thereby decreasing the actual reaction rate of s o 4 mediated oxidation zhou et al 2017a found that co existing phenoxyl radicals influenced the orientation of the s o 4 reaction degradation pathway for the β2 adrenoceptor agonists salbutamol and terbutaline and that chloride was the most effective scavenger for s o 4 several studies have also evaluated the significance of nanomaterials during s o 4 generation guan et al 2013 zhao et al 2015 they found that fe3o4 magnetic nanoparticles and magnetic porous cufe2o4 could effectively catalyze the formation of s o 4 to accelerate the degradation rate of recalcitrant organic contaminants although dissolved oxygen do is one of the most important components in natural waters to our knowledge there are no studies that have assessed its influence on s o 4 mediated oxidation of organic micro pollutants the limited studies available regarding the influence of do on s o 4 induced aops were concerned solely with the generation of s o 4 fang et al 2013a liu et al 2013 xie et al 2017 determined by an electron paramagnetic resonance technique eibenberger et al 1978 generally the effects of do on the generation of s o 4 in water are dependent on oxidants such as persulfate fang et al 2013a peroxymonosulfate liu et al 2013 and sulfite xie et al 2017 and activators such as radiation mark et al 1990 heat lutze et al 2015 base furman et al 2010 ozone yang et al 2015 organic compounds fang et al 2013b ahmad et al 2013 and transition metal catalysis anipsitakis et al 2006 fang et al 2013a investigated the activation of persulfate by magnetite nanoparticles mnps for the degradation of 2 4 4 cb pcb28 they found that increasing the do concentration led to the generation of more o 2 thereby activating the persulfate to produce more s o 4 by mnps which favored the degradation of pcb28 xie et al 2017 also found that increasing the do concentration favored the generation of s o 4 in the fe0 sulfite system to degrade organic pollutants because the formation of s o 5 via oxidation of s o 3 by oxygen is necessary to produce s o 4 however liu et al 2013 found that a decrease in do concentration benefitted the yield of s o 4 in the uv peroxymonosulfate system these studies indicate that the influence of do on the generation of s o 4 in aqueous solution depends on the specific oxidation system thus experimental methods can help elucidate the effects of do on the degradation of organic micro pollutants in wastewater but it is difficult to determine if those effects are also mediated by influencing the process of s o 4 induced oxidation in water given the limitation of current experimental methods theoretical methods represent a useful alternative to address the challenges identified above many quantum chemical calculations have been performed to study the degradation of organic micro pollutants during the process of sewage treatment liu et al calculated the frontier electron densities feds of benzophenone 4 to predict the possible reaction sites for electron extraction with sulfate radicals liu et al 2016 moreover zhou et al proposed the oxidation pathways of the phenoxyl radicals of salbutamol and terbutaline through molecular orbital calculations zhou et al 2017a in order to analyze pathways qualitatively quantum chemical calculations have been used to elucidate parameters involved in the degradation e g rate constants recently some studies used homo lumo gap δ e to explain the degradation of organic contaminants during the process of sewage treatment cooke et al 2017 xiao et al 2015 homo represents the highest occupied molecular orbital and lumo represents the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital here δ e is defined as the energy difference between homo and lumo 1 δ e e l u m o e h o m o where e h o m o and e l u m o are the corresponding values of energy to understand the degradation of organic micro pollutants quantum chemical calculations such as δ e can be used along with additional theoretical models to characterize the role of do on s o 4 induced oxidation in the present study we evaluated the influence of do on the chemical equilibrium and kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation fifteen chemicals belonging to four main categories alcohols carboxylic acids aromatic hydrocarbons and aryl halides were selected as representative organic micro pollutants their gibbs free energy g p o l l u t a n t and δ e with and without interaction with do were calculated using quantum chemistry different models were used with the obtained thermodynamic data to illustrate the effect of do on oxidation observed variability in the influence of do on different chemicals was partially attributed to differences of polarizability furthermore the influence of do on s o 4 induced oxidation of chemicals was associated with do content despite variable trends across different molecules 2 methods 2 1 chemicals four categories of chemicals alcohols carboxylic acids aromatic hydrocarbons and aryl halides were included in the present study these categories cover a majority of organic micro pollutants therefore the results obtained in the present study can be applied to additional organic micro pollutants the alcohol category included methanol ethanol 1 propanol and 1 butanol while formic acid acetic acid oxalic acid and propanoic acid represented the carboxylic acids benzene phenanthrene phenol and toluene represented the aromatic hydrocarbons and the aryl halide category comprised 4 bromophenol 4 chlorotoluene and dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt the chemical structures of the 15 study chemicals are presented in fig 1 2 2 computational details to evaluate the influence of do on g p o l l u t a n t and δ e it was necessary to compare g p o l l u t a n t and δ e in the absence of the external oxygen molecule g 0 and δ e 0 respectively with g p o l l u t a n t and δ e in the presence of the external oxygen molecule g 1 and δ e 1 respectively g 0 and δ e 0 for individual chemicals were calculated based on their structures and respective vibrational frequencies to calculate g 1 and δe 1 we optimized the structure to include an oxygen molecule initially and then removed the oxygen molecule and performed vibrational frequency analysis on the corresponding organic chemicals the schematic of the procedure is shown in fig 2 and benzene is included as a representative chemical g 0 δ e 0 g 1 and δ e 1 for all chemicals were calculated at 25 c to examine the dependence on do content the values of g p o l l u t a n t and δ e for 4 chemicals ethanol formic acid benzene and ddt one from each category impacted by 2 oxygen molecules were calculated i e g 2 and δ e 2 these values were subsequently compared with g 0 δ e 0 g 1 and δ e 1 the polarizabilities of all chemicals were calculated to explain the degree of change induced by the oxygen molecule all of the optimization and analysis of vibrational frequencies were performed using gaussian 09 with b3lyp 6 31g the solvation effect was adopted by using the implicit water model barone and cossi 1998 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of dissolved oxygen on the thermodynamics of reactions before analyzing the effect of do the physical chemistry involved in s o 4 induced oxidation is introduced here the oxidation can be presented as 2 o r g a n i c p o l l u t a n t s o 4 o t h e r p r o d u c t s s o 4 2 the reaction reaches equilibrium when equation 3 occurs 3 g p o l l u t a n t g s o 4 g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 here g p o l l u t a n t is the gibbs free energy of the chemical and it can be g 0 or g 1 g s o 4 g p r o d u c t and g s o 4 2 are gibbs free energy values of s o 4 other products and so 4 2 respectively before reaching equilibrium all chemicals will experience a transition state based on these basic concepts a diagram of the gibbs free energy profile along the reaction coordinate is shown in fig 3 for all reactions g s o 4 and g s o 4 2 have unique but fixed values that are independent of the pollutant and therefore these values are not discussed and we only focus on the chemicals g t s refers to the gibbs free energy of chemicals at the transition state g p r o d u c t represents the gibbs free energy of the products δ g 0 g t s g 0 and δ g 1 g t s g 1 are the values of the energy barrier δ g o 2 refers to the difference between g 1 and g 0 δ g o 2 g 1 g 0 g 0 and g 1 values for each chemical were calculated table 1 g 1 is systematically larger than g 0 and it demonstrates that do may affect the thermodynamic equilibrium of the reaction induced by s o 4 the external oxygen molecule can decrease the energy barrier of the s o 4 induced reaction however δ g 0 δ g 1 regardless of the value of g t s this is explained by the following equation 4 δ g 0 δ g 1 g t s g 0 g t s g 1 g 1 g 0 δ g o 2 0 δ g o 2 values for all chemicals were positive fig 4 a smaller energy barrier means that reactions can occur more easily as a result do shifts the chemical equilibrium of the reaction towards the side of products in other words greater concentrations of chemicals can be degraded by the same amount of s o 4 when do is present this point can be elucidated by analyzing the change of equilibrium constant k which can be written as follows 5 k s o 4 2 b 0 p r o d u c t 1 b 1 p r o d u c t 2 b 2 p r o d u c t n b n s o 4 a 0 organic pollutant a 1 where x represents the concentration of x namely p r o d u c t s o 4 2 s o 4 or organic pollutant a and b are the stoichiometry of reactants and products respectively the equilibrium constant from the perspective of statistical physics can be defined by 6 k exp g p r r t where g p r denotes the difference between the gibbs free energy of products and reactants defined as g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 0 g s o 4 or g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 1 g s o 4 r represents the gas constant and t is the temperature in kelvin the exact value of g p r o d u c t for each chemical cannot be calculated because the final products of these chemicals are unknown however regardless of the g p r o d u c t and g s o 4 2 g s o 4 values the value of exp g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 1 g s o 4 r t is always greater than exp g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 0 g s o 4 r t because 7 g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 1 g s o 4 g p r o d u c t g s o 4 2 g 0 g s o 4 g 1 g 0 δ g o 2 0 therefore the equilibrium constant in the presence of do is larger than that in the absence of do as shown in fig 4 δ g o 2 values for aromatic chemicals aromatic hydrocarbons and aryl halides with the exception of 4 bromophenol are higher than those for open chain chemicals alcohols and carboxylic acids δ g o 2 values for ddt phenol and toluene are the greatest in the present study 7 462 kj mol 6 864 kj mol and 5 603 kj mol respectively all of these chemicals have at least one benzene ring in contrast all of the open chain chemicals in this study have low δ g o 2 values 2 kj mol indicating that do can affect the chemical equilibrium of s o 4 induced oxidation of cyclic compounds more significantly than open chain chemicals the results are helpful for designing innovative aops to treat different kinds of organic micro pollutants in wastewater 3 2 homo lumo gap and the kinetics the effect of do on the kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation is studied in this section we confirmed that the external oxidation molecule can make the process of oxidation faster by decreasing δ e of organic micro pollutants according to the frontier molecular orbital theory fukui et al 1952 δ e can be used to predict the stability of chemicals xiao et al 2014 revealed that the second order rate constants of s o 4 induced oxidation k s o 4 were linearly related to the value of δ e in the quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model the relationship between k s o 4 and δ e can be described by equation 8 8 k s o 4 26 8 3 97 o c 0 746 δe where o c is the ratio of oxygen to carbon atoms for an individual chemical o c remains unchanged so equation 8 suggests that k s o 4 becomes larger if δ e decreases all of the values for δ e o 2 δ e 1 δ e 0 were negative table 1 fig 5 indicating that do can decrease δ e of all 15 chemicals included in this study furthermore do increases the efficiency of s o 4 induced oxidation the oxidation of aromatic hydrocarbons by s o 4 can be accelerated by the presence of oxygen more significantly than the other chemical categories δ e o 2 values for benzene toluene phenanthrene and 4 chlorotoluene all of which are aromatic hydrocarbons were the greatest 17 342 kj mol 16 588 kj mol 15 262 kj mol and 13 728 kj mol fig 5 especially toluene has a high value of δ e o 2 ranked second table 1 as well as a high value of δ g o 2 ranked third table 1 it means do retains a significant influence on both of kinetics and thermodynamic of toluene thus increasing the do content represents a useful method to promote the s o 4 induced oxidation of toluene in contrast to other chemicals possessing a benzene ring 4 bromophenol was the only chemical resistant to the influence of do in the present study its δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 values were 0 2834 kj mol and 1 404 kj mol respectively this finding might be explained by the bromine atom which could render the molecule more stable and counteract the interaction with external molecules e g oxygen molecule to further explore the influence of the bromine atom on s o 4 induced oxidation under different do concentrations δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 of bromoethane and bromobenzene were calculated the values were 0 273 and 0 78 kj mol and 0 0104 and 0 208 kj mol for bromoethane and bromobenzene respectively indicating that similar to 4 bromophenol other bromine containing molecules were resistant to the influence of do all of the open chain chemicals assessed in this study had low δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 values less negative indicating that they would be less affected by do during the process of s o 4 induced oxidation more experimental evidence is needed to validate this theoretical inference 3 3 polarizability determines the degree of influence of dissolved oxygen changes in the thermodynamics and kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation are significantly different for open chain chemicals and aromatic chemicals when the oxygen molecule is present this result may be attributed to the significant difference of polarizability which determines the dynamic response of a system to external fields zhou et al 2003 between these two chemical families the oxidation reduction reaction is a process involving electron transfer marcus 1956 and therefore both the thermodynamics and kinetics of oxidation reactions are related to the distribution of charges in reactant molecules the polarizability of each chemical is shown in fig 6 the polarizability of aromatic chemicals is systematically larger than open chain chemicals this is consistent with the fact that both δ g o 2 and δ e o 2 values of aromatic chemicals are larger

an oxygen molecule aromatic chemicals which have a larger polarizability redistribute their charges consequently the ability of electron transfer becomes stronger and the oxidation can take place more

micro pollutants can only partly be attributed to the polarizability difference of chemicals and further research addressing the importance of other factors is warranted 3 4 dependence of content of dissolved oxygen g p o l l u t a n t and δ e of ethanol formic acid benzene and ddt in the presence of two external oxygen molecules g 2 and δ e 2 were calculated table 1 in fig 7 these values were compared with g 0 δ e 0 g 1 and δ e 1 for all molecules g 2 g 0 and δ e 2 δ e 0 which indicates do would always result in more productive and faster s o 4 induced oxidation however changes to g p o l

monotonous which suggests that increasing the do content will make the s o 4 induced oxidation of ethanol more productive and faster it can be expected that these values will not increase infinitely thus both g p o l l u t a n t and δ e have a maximum value at a point with a specific amount of do for formic acid g 1 g 2 g 0 and δ e 1 δ e 2 δ e 0 fig 7c and d these trends can be described by quadratic functions to promote effective s o 4 induced oxidation of ethanol or alcohols the do content should be maintained within a suitable range for benzene and ddt fig 7e h g p o l l u t a n t and δ e have different trends the change of g p o l l u t a n t was monotonous as observed for ethanol while the change of δ e was similar to that of formic acid the results showed that the trends of g p

has been reported to date on the relationship between these variables and the values of g p o l l u t a n t or δ e numerous researches are therefore required in future to resolve this puzzle in general these results suggested the effects of do on s o 4 induced oxidation are dependent on its content while the dependencies are variable for different molecules additional studies are essential to examine if the rules based on these 4 representative chemicals also apply to other chemicals belonging to the same categories 3 5 environmental significance sulfate radical advanced oxidation processes sr aops are gaining increasing scientific attention as effective solutions for the degradation of recalcitrant pollutants and are regarded as supplements to wwtps costanza et al 2010 guan et al 2013 lee et al 2009 yen et al 2011 in recent years environmental scientists have published numerous papers on such applications of sr aops many of these studies determined the impacts of natural water components including ions such as chloride bromide carbonate and natural organic matter humic or fulvic substances guan et al 2013 yang et al 2014 zhou et al 2017b 2017c on the degradation of organic micro pollutants in sr aops do is also an important component in natural water and wastewaters however to the best of our knowledge little attention has been paid to its influence on the oxidation efficiency of sr aops in principle the involvement of do in the subsequent reactions with the radicals or intermediates would occur after the initial electron transfer between sulfate radical and target compound the present work for the first time investigated the impacts of do on the degradation of 15 different chemicals in sr aops by using a theoretical strategy our results demonstrated that the presence of do was beneficial for the degradation of selected contaminants by s o 4 via decreasing the energy barrier of the s o 4 induced oxidation and δ e of organic micro pollutants in sr aops thus do content was an important parameter to consider with respect to the efficiency of s o 4 induced oxidation according to our theoretical research when sulfate radicals are used for in situ restoration of contaminated soils and groundwater the input of oxygen into these hypoxic conditions would significantly increase the efficiency of s o 4 mediated oxidation this finding provides useful information for developing new in situ remediation strategies for contaminated soils and waters in addition the involvement of do may affect the oxidation mechanisms distribution of oxidation products and the toxicity of reaction intermediates the effect of do on oxidation pathways is an interesting topic and deserves further investigation taken together the results of the current study can provide a novel way to understand the significance and importance of do in s o 4 mediated oxidation 4 conclusion in summary we used a theoretical method combining a quantum chemical calculation thermodynamic models and statistical models to illustrate the influence of do on the oxidation of organic micro pollutants by s o 4 the external oxygen molecule increased g p o l l u t a n t and decreased δ e of organic chemicals which would theoretically lead to more productive and efficient s o 4 induced oxidation changes of thermodynamics and kinetics of s o 4 induced oxidation were different between open chain and aromatic chemicals due to the significant difference of polarizability of these two chemical families furthermore we demonstrated that all of the influences were dependent on the content of oxygen molecules additional studies are warranted to understand this dependence more clearly from the perspective of methodology the present paper is the first to assess the influence of one specific component in wastewater on the process of oxidation induced by s o 4 our innovative method could help further understand the effects of other components and types of aops for use in wastewater treatment and pollutant removal of course experimental studies are still important to explore related questions and validate results from our
