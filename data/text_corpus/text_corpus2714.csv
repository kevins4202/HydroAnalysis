13570,when microplastics mps pass through wastewater treatment plants equipped with advanced oxidation systems they might be oxidized thus changing their surface characteristics and adsorption behavior this work evaluated if ozone o3 and the association of o3 and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are capable of changing the adsorption potential of three plastics present in water polyethylene pe polypropylene pp and polystyrene ps mps were characterized by x ray diffractometry xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir analyses to perform this study the sorption of two pesticides chlorpyrifos cpf and dichlorvos ddvp onto pe pp and ps was analyzed using different kinetic and isotherm models the sorption capacity follows the trend of pe pp ps the second order kinetic model described the sorption kinetics of ddvp and cpf with an r2 higher than 0 99 for cpf in all plastics and ranging from 0 96 to 0 98 for ddvp in all plastics freundlich and henry isotherm models described the adsorption mechanism of ddvp and cpf respectively o3 and o3 h2o2 oxidation were able to modify the adsorption behavior by the formation of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups in mps thus changing chemical interactions between adsorbate adsorbent this study demonstrated that mps might have their adsorption characteristics changed if submitted to oxidation processes used in wastewater treatment plants thus changing their interaction with micropollutants when released into the environment keywords advanced oxidation processes wastewater treatment polyethylene polystyrene polypropylene 1 introduction microplastics mps are small particles of polymeric materials with a size smaller than 5 mm their size lower limit is still debatable 1 they can be categorized into primary and secondary mps 2 primary mps have the proper size classification since their origin 3 examples of primary mps are plastics beads used in facial cleansers as exfoliators and in toothpaste as abrasives 4 secondary mps are particles that result from the abrasion and wear of larger pieces of plastics 5 plastics fragmentation can occur due to factors such as photodegradation mechanical chemical or biological interactions 3 both primary and secondary mps can pass through wastewater treatment plants wwtps and be transported by urban canals and rivers and finally reach fresh and seawater environments 6 7 once in aquatic environments mps can be ingested by organisms harming several species such as turtles crustaceans marine mammals and birds 8 being virtually present in all trophic levels 9 it is well known that mps can release chemical additives such as flame retardants 10 uv stabilizers and pigments 11 at the same time they can adsorb several pollutants among them polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbde s 12 13 polychlorinated biphenyls pcb s 14 19 several metals 15 17 lubricant oils 18 19 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 20 and antibiotics 21 when adsorption takes place desorption can occur and increase toxicity potential by exposing organisms to the adsorbed toxic compounds 22 for example one study evaluated that the desorption of persistent organic pollutants can occur at a rate of 30 times more inside organisms gut low ph than the desorption phenomena in seawater 23 an extensive review concluded that wwtps had been estimated to receive mp contaminated influents with amounts of mps varying from 1 to 3160 particles per liter 24 the mps removal efficiency in wwtps varies according to the type of treatment being more efficient the wwtps that use membrane bioreactor and granular sand filtration as tertiary treatments 25 they can reach mps removal rates up to 99 26 despite the high removal rate for those treatments wwtps constitute a significant contributor to mps presence in the environment due to the large volumes discharged 27 for example carr and colleagues 28 calculated a discharge of 0 93 106 mps per day from a wwtp treating 1 06 106 m3 of wastewater d 1 while talvitie et al 26 estimated amounts of mps ranging between 1 7 106 and 1 4 108 particles d 1 for different days of the week in the effluents of a finnish wtp treating 270 000 m3 wastewater per day to improve disinfection and the removal of emerging contaminants wwtps have been upgraded by the implementation of advanced tertiary treatment technologies before discharge into the environment 29 systems with ozone o3 or advanced oxidation processes aop are in the group of alternative technologies for this purpose since mps are not totally removed during secondary treatments these particles can undergo further oxidation in wwtps that use aop as tertiary treatment which may result in chemical modification 30 31 of their surface and changing of their adsorption capacities 30 31 furthermore mps can act as a shield for adsorbed organic contaminants decreasing tertiary treatment efficiency 32 33 mps oxidation by several pathways has been described as a factor that can alter mps surface and adsorption potential 34 however studies focusing on wastewater treatment processes are lacking the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of aop oxidation on the mps adsorption potential for this purpose the adsorption of chlorpyrifos cpf and dichlorvos ddvp was assessed for three types of mps subjected to o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments these model compounds have been selected due to i their prevalence and threat for water environments 35 36 ii their reported accumulation on mps via sorption mechanisms 37 as well as iii their significant difference in hydrophobicity with octanol water partition coefficient log kow cpf 4 31 log kow ddvp 1 47 38 several techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffractometry xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem were used for mps characterization adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were also used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials micronized polyethylene pe was purchased from a specialized cosmetic shop casa das essências brazil with a report of compliance polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp plastics were supplied by the university of wuppertal germany ps and pp were micronized with a blender and passed through sieves to reach sizes between 200 600 μm fig s2 ddvp and cpf pure standards were acquired from sigma aldrich germany all solvents used were hplc grade cyclohexane was acquired from carl roth chemicals germany while methanol and ethyl acetate were acquired from vwr chemicals france hydrogen peroxide solution 30 w w was acquired from sigma aldrich germany 2 2 oxidation treatments the oxidation of mps was carried out by applying o3 and o3 h2o2 in 500 ml of ultrapure milli q water containing 1 g of mps inside a 1 l reactor the reactor had a recirculation system to efficiently mix and accordingly make mps have adequate contact with the water and the pollutants ozone was generated by an ozonizer labor ozonisator tmt 500af germany with an oxygen flow of 4 l min 1 ozone gas flow rate was 8 8 mg min 1 and applied for 10 min giving an ozone dose of 88 mg l 1 the treatment of mps with o3 h2o2 was performed by the addition of h2o2 at the beginning of the ozonation using an o3 h2o2 molar ratio of 0 5 after those treatments mps were filtered with a glass fiber filter and dried under vacuum 2 3 mps characterization mps characterization was carried out before and after o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments crystallinity 21 was analyzed by an x ray diffractometer xpert powder instrument panalytical uk the results were obtained using the powder method θ 2θ geometry at room temperature 25 c ni filter and cu kα radiation with a wavelength of 0 15406 nm a voltage of 45 kv and a current of 40 ma the measured angular interval was between 5 and 90 with a counting time of 10 s and an angular step of 0 008 to perform sem analysis 39 40 the mps sample was settled in a glass blade secured in a stub with a double sided adhesive carbon tape and subjected to gold spraying treatment using a sputter coater polaron instrument vg microtech uk the surface characteristics were evaluated using an sem instrument leo electron microscopy uk with an acceleration voltage of 15 kv and a current of 15 pa images acquired had amplifications of 100 300 1 000 3 000 and 6 000 times particle size was analyzed with the software imagej attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ft ir analyses 40 were performed in an agilent technologies equipment usa the ftir spectra were collected in the range 4000 400 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 of resolution 2 4 batch sorption experiments 2 4 1 sorption kinetics experiments ddvp and cpf solution containing both pesticides with 100 mg l 1 were prepared in methanol and stored at 6 c in amber vials methanol was used as a base solvent as it has a high solubility in water making the contaminants available for adsorption within the media in previous experiments using solvents such as ethyl acetate or hexane adsorption occurred poorly due to the lower solubility of the solvents in water and the contaminants retention on the organic phase adsorption experiments were performed in 15 ml glass tubes with a ptfe teflon bottom capped screw 10 ml of water and 100 μl of the solution were added to each tube and stirred for 1 min in a mechanical laboratory stirrer 170 rpm afterwards 0 1 g of mps particles pe pp or ps were added a quantity commonly used in previous studies 12 15 41 the tubes were shaken in horizontal position at the laboratory stirrer 170 rpm all adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted in triplicate at room temperature 25 c adsorption was assessed at 1 3 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 min in the experiments used for the kinetic study 2 4 2 adsorption isotherm experiments to assess the adsorption isotherms of ddvp and cpf onto pe pp and ps 10 ml of water and 100 μl of the work solution were added to each tube to achieve solution concentrations of 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 then solutions were stirred for 1 min in a mechanical laboratory shaker platform 170 rpm and 0 1 g of mp particles pe pp or ps were added the experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c the tubes were shaken for 1 5 h in horizontal position on the mechanical shaker platform 170 rpm and performed in triplicate 2 5 adsorption models 2 5 1 kinetic models the kinetic data for the simultaneous adsorption of ddvp and cpf on mps were fitted to the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models the expressions for the applied models are shown in table 1 2 5 2 isothermal models the isotherms for simultaneous adsorption of dpvv and cpf on mps were fitted to the langmuir freundlich temkin henry and dubinin radushkevish models expressions are shown in table 2 2 6 pesticides quantification 2 6 1 extraction procedure after adsorption experiments the pesticides were extracted from the solution and the adsorbed amount was calculated as the difference between initial and final solution concentration using a volumetric glass pipette 5 ml of the sample was taken from the glass tube and released into another tube containing 2 ml of a solvent mixture composed of cyclohexane ethyl acetate at a 5 2 ratio v v the tubes were shaken for 1 min in a vortex apparatus and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 6 min 1 ml of the supernatant was taken and placed into 2 ml vials for gc gc ms analysis 2 6 2 chromatographic analysis pesticides identification and quantification were performed using a gc gc ms from shimadzu japan model gcms qp2010 equipped with an aoc i autosampler zebron zb 5msplus 30 m length x0 25 mm internal diameter x1 μm film thickness and zebron zb wax 10 m length x0 1 mm internal diameter x0 1 μm film thickness columns were used both pesticides were determined using selective ion monitoring sim table s1 supplementary material presents the instrumental conditions used in this study calibration curves were performed using 8 standard solutions at 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 mg l 1 in ethyl acetate all solutions were injected in triplicate 2 7 quality assurance and statistical analysis procedural blanks using 10 ml of ultrapure water and 10 ml of ultrapure water with mps were performed at every batch of 10 extractions for quality assurance the targeted pesticides were not detected in any batch recovery for ddvp was 72 2 and 75 1 for concentrations of 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 while cpf had 69 1 and 75 5 for concentrations of 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 respectively this loss is attributed to the pesticide adsorption on the tubes glass wall 42 and taking into account on isotherm and kinetics calculations the method quantification limits mqls were calculated as ten times the signal to noise ratio and it was 2 0 and 7 6 μg l 1 for ddvp and cpf while the method detection limits mdl were calculated as three times the signal to noise ratio and it was 0 6 and 2 2 μg l 1 for ddvp and cpf respectively anova statistical analysis was performed using the excel software the data sets pesticide adsorbed quantities on virgin and oxidized microplastic from the same type were therefore compared using anova and the statistical significance was obtained when f f critical 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics characterization the xrd diffraction patterns are used as an indicator of the crystallinity degree of the materials 43 polymers with high crystallinity degrees have xrd diffraction patterns characterized by having sharp diffraction peaks whilst polymers with low crystallinity degrees exhibit broader peaks 37 the xrd patterns of mps evaluated in this study are shown in fig s1 the calculated crystallinity degree of mps followed the trend pe pp ps the oxidative treatments did not considerably alter mps crystallinity table s2 to evaluate possible changes in mps surface after oxidation treatments the surface morphology was analyzed by sem microscopy as shown in fig 1 sem images show that pe has a rugged and crumpled surface whereas pp and ps have a smoother surface mps in this study presented a deformed form without micropores fig s2 sem images suggest that the oxidation treatments did not physically alter mps surface analysis by imagej software indicated that pe pp and ps presented average sizes of 294 μm 300 μm and 276 μm with a relative standard deviation of 9 6 10 1 and 7 6 respectively ftir analyses were carried out to investigate the effect of o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments in the mp s surface fig 2 a and b show the ftir spectra of pe and pp mps before and after the oxidation treatments there were no evident changes in the intensity of the bands at 2915 and 2845 cm 1 which correspond to ch stretching and at 1463 cm 1 that can be attributed to the ch2 vibration 40 spectra of pe treated with o3 and o3 h2o2 and pp subjected to o3 show a new band around 1712 cm 1 to pe and 1708 cm 1 to pp which was related to the presence of co groups indicating the oxidation of the polymers bands around 1700 1725 cm 1 are attributed to the presence of carboxylic acid and ketone functional groups however it is not possible to observe in the ftir spectra of oxidized pe and pp a broad band between 2800 and 3500 cm 1 which is attributed to oh stretching it indicates the presence of ketones groups on the surface of oxidized pe and pp ftir spectrum of pp treated with o3 h2o2 did not show major differences in relation with virgin pp fig 2c shows ftir spectra of ps mps before and after oxidation treatments virgin ps matches the typical ps spectrum reported in the literature 44 with bands at 3024 cm 1 corresponding to the aromatic ch stretching and at 1491 cm 1 corresponding to the aromatic ring stretching ftir spectra of ps treated with o3 and o3 h2o2 show a new broad band around 3426 cm 1 which can be attributed to hydroxyl group oh stretch similarly to pe and pp a new band at 1712 cm 1 corresponding to the co functional groups was observed however the presence of hydroxyl bands in the oxidized ps spectra suggests the formation of carboxyl acids and alcohols after analyzing ftir spectra of pet pp and ps it is possible to affirm that o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments can generate oxygenated groups in the polymers surface for example one study demonstrated that a higher ozone dosage was necessary to modify polypropylene surface 45 as a consequence of having only single bonds in their chain pe and pp have greater oxidation resistance than ps nonetheless pe and pp reactions with o3 and o3 h2o2 are well known to form carbonyl groups 45 47 ps has been reported to form e co and oh groups after reaction with o3 30 ps has aromatic rings a group that is more susceptible to chemical attack in comparison with ch2 and ch3 groups of pe and pp the aromatic rings are assumed as the preferential site for o3 attack rather than by activation of the saturated hydrocarbon chain during ozonation 48 the insertion of oxygen functional groups onto polymers surface occurred probably due to the reaction with ozone itself and reactive species e g hydroxyl radicals derived from the reaction of ozone and hydrogen peroxide 31 therefore ftir spectra for oxidized ps show recognizable peaks matching the group frequencies of both co and oh 3 2 sorption kinetics the kinetic study was carried out to evaluate the time dependent behavior of cpf and ddvp adsorption on mps virgin and oxidized mps were evaluated as adsorbents adsorption of pesticides was a rapid process in the initial stage and the adsorption rate slowed gradually until complete equilibrium was reached cpf and ddvp equilibrium time was achieved around 15 and 20 min respectively for all the evaluated mps comparing the obtained results with other studies described in the literature the mps from this study showed faster adsorption 49 50 this behavior can be attributed to the size of the mps particles a study demonstrated that when adsorption of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene was assessed with polystyrene on sizes of 170 μm 102 μm 50 μm 30 μm 800 nm 235 nm and 50 nm the smaller particles presented a shorter equilibrium time when compared with larger particles 50 another study evaluated the adsorption behavior of five pesticides on pe particles with 4 mm of size reaching the sorption equilibrium in 120 min 41 the particle size of mps in the present study was about 400 μm thus the reached equilibrium time is consistent with their sizes in order to investigate the mechanism of adsorption and potential rate controlling steps the pseudo first order 51 pseudo second order 52 and intra particle diffusion 53 models were used to interpret the obtained data concerning cpf and ddvp removal from water media adsorption kinetics of cpf and ddvp onto the three mps before and after oxidation treatments are shown in figs s3 and s4 calculated parameters for pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models for cpf and ddvp are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively kinetic data did not present significant differences between virgin and oxidized mps tables 3 and 4 regarding the results obtained for the kinetic models of pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion low correlation coefficients r2 calculated to cpf table 3 and ddvp table 4 indicated the non adequacy of the models to the experimental data the intraparticle diffusion model which was used strictly for porous materials was applied with an expectation to observe a mathematical result for weathering or an increased porosity caused by oxidation the pseudo first order kinetic model is associated with the model of one site occupancy adsorption kinetics governed by the rate of surface reaction 54 therefore these results present a disagreement with the one site occupancy model and of a porous material on the order hand the obtained data successfully fitted the pseudo second order model with r2 values higher than 0 9519 for both pesticides the calculated adsorption capacities qe were also closest to the experimental qe these results indicate that the cpf and ddvp adsorption onto mps followed the pseudo second order kinetic model this model represents several adsorption processes over time while the first order model generally best fits adsorption systems after 20 30 min 55 the pseudo second order model was used before to explain the kinetic of ddvp adsorption onto coconut fiber biochar 56 biowaste 57 and indian soils 58 cpf uptake best fitted to pseudo second order kinetic when silanized cellulose nanofibers cds nanoparticles 59 and graphene oxide electrospun cellulose 60 were used as adsorbents 3 3 adsorption isotherms isotherm studies can help to explain the mechanism by which the pollutant interacts with the adsorbent and provide insights regarding the adsorption capacity 61 thus to assess how the different oxidation conditions can affect the mps interactions with pesticides and what are the possible mechanisms involved in the interactive process the langmuir freundlich tempkin henry and dubinin radushkevish isothermal models were adjusted to experimental data the calculated parameters for each model are shown in tables 5 and 6 for ddvp and cpf respectively analyzing the plot of qe versus ce figs s5 and s6 for ddvp and cpf adsorption it is possible to observe that with the increase in pesticide concentrations the adsorption sites in pe ps and pp were quickly occupied culminating in a decrease in the sorption efficiency of the pesticides this behavior indicates that the system at a given concentration of the pesticide achieved the dynamic equilibrium regarding the accordance of the isothermal models to the ddvp adsorption equilibrium data onto virgin mps and those treated with o3 h2o2 were best adjusted to the freundlich isotherm model indicating that the adsorption was due to the heterogeneity of the material 62 table 5 these results suggested that minor chemical modification was promoted by the o3 h2o2 oxidation on the surface of pe pp and ps and consequently virgin mps and those oxidized with o3 h2o2 followed a similar mechanism in the ddvp uptake on the other hand o3 treated mps had a more evident surface modification as indicated by the isotherm models addressed since unlike virgin mps and those treated with o3 h2o2 the best curve fit was the langmuir isotherm table 5 in general this model indicates that the adsorption of pesticide ddvp on mps treated with o3 occurred through monolayer coverage 63 the result suggests that the polymers hydrophilicity increased after o3 process due to the presence of oxygen containing groups which favors electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate and culminating in a monolayer formation langmuir s model this translates into the basic principle of chemical polarity in which polar substances will have higher interactions with other polar compounds and lower interactions with apolar substances with the opposite being true for apolar compounds 64 the exception to this tendency was o3 treated pp which followed the same mechanism freundlich for virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps this probably occurred due to the slight oxidation of pp during ozonation when compared to other mps corroborating ftir analyses thus the surface of pp treated with o3 is quite similar to those of virgin and o3 h2o2 treated pp and so they followed the same adsorption mechanism with regard to cpf adsorption on pe pp and ps virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps followed similar mechanisms fig s6 the same behavior verified to ddvp uptake virgin and o3 h2o2 treated pe and pp best fitted to henry isotherm model table 6 while virgin and o3 h2o2 treated ps were better adjusted to langmuir model r2 0 9894 and 0 9999 respectively as verified to ddvp adsorption the results indicate that the o3 h2o2 treatment provided low mp surface modification while o3 h2o2 treated mps followed the same mechanism as the virgin mp to cpf adsorption on the other hand the tempkin isotherm model provided a better theoretical correlation to the cpf adsorption equilibrium data of all o3 treated mps indicating adsorption by monolayer mechanism this result is in agreement with another study 58 that reported that the tempkin isotherm model best described the ddvp adsorption process in indian soils therefore according to the results obtained from the isotherm studies it is possible to suggest that the o3 h2o2 treated mps have a low surface modification since for both pesticides ddvp and cpf the adsorption mechanism of these contaminants for virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps were similar expressed by the same isotherm models o3 treated mps presented different interaction mechanisms compared to virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps presenting distinct isothermal models in addition to the superficial modification of the mps the physicochemical properties of the pesticides also influence the interactions between adsorbent adsorbate as indicated by the different best isothermal adjustments observed for ddvp and cpf tables 5 and 6 thus according to the indicated isothermal model the mechanisms between virgin treated mps and the target contaminants are explained below in more detail in the freundlich isotherm model kf is the freundlich constant l 1 μg and 1 nf is the heterogeneity factor 62 the more heterogeneous the adsorbent surface the closer the values of 1 n f approach zero in all evaluated adsorption systems 1 n f values were below unity and calculated kf were very high indicating a high degree of non linearity between the concentration of pesticide solution and adsorption 63 table 6 and favorable sorption of pesticides onto mp s 12 65 as reported in the literature ddvp heterogeneous adsorption onto modified montmorillonite mmt cuo composites 66 lanimno6 perovskite nanoparticles 67 various indian soils followed the freundlich isotherm model langmuir isotherm model assumes that the surface of adsorbent is homogeneous containing binding sites that are energetically equivalent which can hold only one adsorbate molecule langmuir isotherm usually indicates the ﬂat adsorption of molecules on the surface of the adsorbent 68 considering the eighteen different adsorbent adsorbent systems performed in this study 9 for each ddvp and cpf only four best fitted to langmuir model due mainly to the heterogeneity of the mps surface similarly binh et al 56 and alka and anita 69 studied the ddvp uptake by coconut fiber biowaste and paramagnetic poly styrene co acrylic acid hydrogel respectively and the langmuir isotherm model best fitted to experimental data in addition as verified in the present study cpf adsorption data onto silanized cellulose nanofibers cds nanoparticles 59 hydrocalumite iron oxide magnetic 70 graphene oxide silica coated magnetic nanoparticles 71 best fitted to langmuir isotherm model henry isotherm model is indicated to systems with linear behaviors of the equilibrium data at low solute concentrations 12 assuming that all adsorbed molecules are isolated from their nearest neighbors it infers that the affinity of the solute by the adsorbent is greater than the affinity for the solvent suggesting that the adsorption capacity is proportional to the solute concentration 68 high values of henry constant from 969 to 4608 were found to cpf adsorption in virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mp s indicating favorable sorption of pesticides tempkin isotherm assumes that the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the adsorbent surface decreases linearly with coverage due to adsorbate adsorbate interactions 72 and indicates that adsorption happens in a monolayer process 12 all the obtained data to cpf uptake by o3 treated mp s showed high tempkin constant values which were between 379 and 1653 l μg 1 suggesting high adsorption potentials the bt values calculated for o3 treated pe pp and ps were 0 07567 0 07582 and 0 1673 kj mol respectively table 5 and indicate weak interactions between cpf and mp s the dubinin radushkevish isotherm model considers that porous size affect the adsorption potential of the adsorbent 68 it supposes that the surface of the material is heterogeneous and the adsorption potential is not constant 73 suggesting that the adsorption process occurs by micropore volume filling unlike other models in which adsorption occurs layer by layer on pore walls 74 however this isotherm model did not provide good theoretical correlation to the pesticides adsorption onto mps due to the lack of porosity of the adsorbents 3 4 effect of o3 and o3 h2o2 on mps adsorption potential as observed in ftir analyses the oxidation process involving o3 and o3 h2o2 is capable of changing the surface of mps the presence of ketones in the surface of all evaluated mps was observed along with the hydrophobicity decrease of the adsorbents which also reflects the mps polarity change however the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups was verified only in ps surface thus the potential cpf and ddvp adsorption in virgin and oxidized mps were investigated the results of cpf and ddvp uptake are presented in figs 3 and 5 respectively higher cpf adsorption capacities were achieved by virgin pe pp and ps reaching 98 97 and 86 μg g respectively fig 3 virgin mps are hydrophobic polymers and cpf is a hydrophobic pesticide 75 which suggests that hydrophobic interactions are the main adsorption mechanism between virgin mp s and cpf 76 fig 4a among the three evaluated polymers pe was the best adsorbent to cpf similarly polychlorinated byphenyls and anthracene were reported to have a higher tendency to adsorb onto pe 77 78 regarding the cpf adsorption in oxidized mps o3 or o3 h2o2 treated pe pp and ps lower adsorption capacities were observed fig 3 an explanation for this is the hydrophobicity decrease of mps surface which reduced hydrophobic interactions between adsorbent and cpf and thus giving rise to electrostatic interactions between oδ pδ of adsorbent adsorbate respectively 79 fig 4b the electrostatic interactions between oδ pδ are weaker when compared to hydrophobic forces 80 81 additionally ps provided lower adsorption efficiency for cpf which can be due to the presence π π interactions between the aromatic rings of the adsorbent and pesticide this type of mechanism requires a specific orientation of both entities that can compromise other interactions 82 therefore with π π interactions stronger interactions that could reflect in better adsorption as hydrogen bonding do not occur 82 in relation to o3 and o3 h2o2 treated ps it is highly probable the presence of hydrogen bonding between the oxygen in the cpf phosphate and oh groups of the adsorbent as reported by binh and kajitvichyanukul 56 another reason for higher adsorption of pesticides on ps than on pp pe could be the difference between rubbery pe and pp and glassy ps plastics 83 glassy plastics have a more condensed structure than rubbery 83 thus the structure of rubbery plastics leads to higher contaminant mobility and faster diffusivity rates than those observed in glassy plastics resulting in higher adsorption capacities 77 moreover according to anova analyses table s3 supplementary material differences in adsorption capacities between treatments for a same type of mps were significant being in accordance with the relative level of surface change indicated in the ftir spectra fig 2 the ddvp adsorption onto mps was lower than for cpf since this pesticide is less hydrophobic than cpf 84 diminishing the hydrophobic interactions between adsorbent adsorbate fig 4 regarding the oxidation process pe and ps treated by o3 h2o2 demonstrated to adsorb greater amounts of ddvp fig 5 it was observed that o3 h2o2 caused insertion of ketones on both mps surface and hydroxyl and carboxylic acid on ps thus the oxidation step allowed weak electrostatic interactions and in the case of ps hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent and ddvp fig 4 thus the mechanism involved in ddvp adsorption onto oxidized mp s results from a subtle balance between hydrophobic electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding the ddvp adsorption capacities achieved to virgin and oxidized pp were statically equivalent whereas to virgin and oxidized pe and ps differences were found according to anova analyses table s3 supplementary material 4 conclusions this study investigated the adsorption behavior of two commonly used pesticides on pe pp and ps mps before and after o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments both pesticides can adsorb on mps mainly based on hydrophobic interactions especially for cpf the adsorption process was quick for both pesticides on all mps probably due to the low particle size used in this study the adsorption fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model for both pesticides adsorption isotherm of ddvp was best explained by freundlich model in most of scenarios indicating that adsorption was mostly a multilayer process adsorption isotherm of cpf was best explained by henry model indicating that adsorbed molecules are isolated from their nearest neighbors o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments can modify adsorption behavior by inserting carbonyl and hydroxyl groups onto mps surface thus altering interactions between adsorbate adsorbent the results of this study illustrated that o3 and o3 h2o2 used in wastewater treatments could change the surface of mps prior to discharge into the environment thus it is possible that the adsorption or desorption potential of mps also change an increase in polarity and hydrophilicity of mps suggests that mps can adsorb more polar and hydrophilic compounds after o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments this would be a major issue for example if heavy metals cations would be adsorbed and carried along ecosystems on the contrary hydrophobic and apolar compounds would be less adsorbed the interaction between mps and organic contaminants is still a broad field to study especially regards oxidation processes applied for water treatment the possibility of research regards to other contaminants and contaminants mixtures other different oxidation treatments and flow studies make an example of the necessity of more studies in this area declaration of competing interest the authors

all trophic levels 9 it is well known that mps can release chemical additives such as flame retardants 10 uv stabilizers and pigments 11 at the same time they can adsorb several pollutants among them polybrominated diphenyl ethers pbde s 12 13 polychlorinated biphenyls pcb s 14 19 several metals 15 17 lubricant oils 18 19 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 20 and antibiotics 21 when adsorption takes place desorption can occur and increase toxicity potential by exposing organisms to the adsorbed toxic compounds 22 for example one study evaluated that the desorption of persistent organic pollutants can occur at a rate of 30 times more inside organisms gut low ph than the desorption phenomena in seawater 23 an extensive review concluded that wwtps had been estimated to receive mp contaminated influents with amounts of mps varying from 1 to 3160 particles per liter 24 the mps removal efficiency in wwtps varies according to the type of treatment being more efficient the wwtps that use membrane bioreactor and granular sand filtration as tertiary treatments 25 they can reach mps removal rates up to 99 26 despite the high removal rate for those treatments wwtps constitute a significant contributor to mps presence in the environment due to the large volumes discharged 27 for example carr and colleagues 28 calculated a discharge of 0 93 106 mps per day from a wwtp treating 1 06 106 m3 of wastewater d 1 while talvitie et al 26 estimated amounts of mps ranging between 1 7 106 and 1 4 108 particles d 1 for different days of the week in the effluents of a finnish wtp treating 270 000 m3 wastewater per day to improve disinfection and the removal of emerging contaminants wwtps have been upgraded by the implementation of advanced tertiary treatment technologies before discharge into the environment 29 systems with ozone o3 or advanced oxidation processes aop are in the group of alternative technologies for this purpose since mps are not totally removed during secondary treatments these particles can undergo further oxidation in wwtps that use aop as tertiary treatment which may result in chemical modification 30 31 of their surface and changing of their adsorption capacities 30 31 furthermore mps can act as a shield for adsorbed organic contaminants decreasing tertiary treatment efficiency 32 33 mps oxidation by several pathways has been described as a factor that can alter mps surface and adsorption potential 34 however studies focusing on wastewater treatment processes are lacking the objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of aop oxidation on the mps adsorption potential for this purpose the adsorption of chlorpyrifos cpf and dichlorvos ddvp was assessed for three types of mps subjected to o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments these model compounds have been selected due to i their prevalence and threat for water environments 35 36 ii their reported accumulation on mps via sorption mechanisms 37 as well as iii their significant difference in hydrophobicity with octanol water partition coefficient log kow cpf 4 31 log kow ddvp 1 47 38 several techniques such as fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir x ray diffractometry xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem were used for mps characterization adsorption isotherms and kinetic models were also used to elucidate the adsorption mechanisms 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials micronized polyethylene pe was purchased from a specialized cosmetic shop casa das essências brazil with a report of compliance polystyrene ps and polypropylene pp plastics were supplied by the university of wuppertal germany ps and pp were micronized with a blender and passed through sieves to reach sizes between 200 600 μm fig s2 ddvp and cpf pure standards were acquired from sigma aldrich germany all solvents used were hplc grade cyclohexane was acquired from carl roth chemicals germany while methanol and ethyl acetate were acquired from vwr chemicals france hydrogen peroxide solution 30 w w was acquired from sigma aldrich germany 2 2 oxidation treatments the oxidation of mps was carried out by applying o3 and o3 h2o2 in 500 ml of ultrapure milli q water containing 1 g of mps inside a 1 l reactor the reactor had a recirculation system to efficiently mix and accordingly make mps have adequate contact with the water and the pollutants ozone was generated by an ozonizer labor ozonisator tmt 500af germany with an oxygen flow of 4 l min 1 ozone gas flow rate was 8 8 mg min 1 and applied for 10 min giving an ozone dose of 88 mg l 1 the treatment of mps with o3 h2o2 was performed by the addition of h2o2 at the beginning of the ozonation using an o3 h2o2 molar ratio of 0 5 after those treatments mps were filtered with a glass fiber filter and dried under vacuum 2 3 mps characterization mps characterization was carried out before and after o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments crystallinity 21 was analyzed by an x ray diffractometer xpert powder

a current of 40 ma the measured angular interval was between 5 and 90 with a counting time of 10 s and an angular step of 0 008 to perform sem analysis 39 40 the mps sample was settled in a glass blade secured in a stub with a double sided adhesive carbon tape and subjected to gold spraying treatment using a sputter coater polaron instrument vg microtech uk the surface characteristics were evaluated using an sem instrument leo electron microscopy uk with an acceleration voltage of 15 kv and a current of 15 pa images acquired had amplifications of 100 300 1 000 3 000 and 6 000 times particle size was analyzed with the software imagej attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectroscopy atr ft ir analyses 40 were performed in an agilent technologies equipment usa the ftir spectra were collected in the range 4000 400 cm 1 with 4 cm 1 of resolution 2 4 batch sorption experiments 2 4 1 sorption kinetics experiments ddvp and cpf solution containing both pesticides with 100 mg l 1 were prepared in methanol and stored at 6 c in amber vials methanol was used as a base solvent as it has a high solubility in water making the contaminants available for adsorption within the media in previous experiments using solvents such as ethyl acetate or hexane adsorption occurred poorly due to the lower solubility of the solvents in water and the contaminants retention on the organic phase adsorption experiments were performed in 15 ml glass tubes with a ptfe teflon bottom capped screw 10 ml of water and 100 μl of the solution were added to each tube and stirred for 1 min in a mechanical laboratory stirrer 170 rpm afterwards 0 1 g of mps particles pe pp or ps were added a quantity commonly used in previous studies 12 15 41 the tubes were shaken in horizontal position at the laboratory stirrer 170 rpm all adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted in triplicate at room temperature 25 c adsorption was assessed at 1 3 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 min in the experiments used for the kinetic study 2 4 2 adsorption isotherm experiments to assess the adsorption isotherms of ddvp and cpf onto pe pp and ps 10 ml of water and 100 μl of the work solution were added to each tube to achieve solution concentrations of 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 then solutions were stirred for 1 min in a mechanical laboratory shaker platform 170 rpm and 0 1 g of mp particles pe pp or ps were added the experiments were carried out at room temperature 25 1 c the tubes were shaken for 1 5 h in horizontal position on the mechanical shaker platform 170 rpm and performed in triplicate 2 5 adsorption models 2 5 1 kinetic models the kinetic data for the simultaneous adsorption of ddvp and cpf on mps were fitted to the pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models the expressions for the applied models are shown in table 1 2 5 2 isothermal models the isotherms for simultaneous adsorption of dpvv and cpf on mps were fitted to the langmuir freundlich temkin henry and dubinin radushkevish models expressions are shown in table 2 2 6 pesticides quantification 2 6 1 extraction procedure after adsorption experiments the pesticides were extracted from the solution and the adsorbed amount was calculated as the difference between initial and final solution concentration using a volumetric glass pipette 5 ml of the sample was taken from the glass tube and released into another tube containing 2 ml of a solvent mixture composed of cyclohexane ethyl acetate at a 5 2 ratio v v the tubes were shaken for 1 min in a vortex apparatus and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 6 min 1 ml of the supernatant was taken and placed into 2 ml vials for gc gc ms analysis 2 6 2 chromatographic analysis pesticides identification and quantification were performed using a gc gc ms from shimadzu japan model gcms qp2010 equipped with an aoc i autosampler zebron zb 5msplus 30 m length x0 25 mm internal diameter x1 μm film thickness and zebron zb wax 10 m length x0 1 mm internal diameter x0 1 μm film thickness columns were used both pesticides were determined using selective ion monitoring sim table s1 supplementary material presents the instrumental conditions used in this study calibration curves were performed using 8 standard solutions at 0 025 0 05 0 1 0 25 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 mg l 1 in ethyl acetate all solutions were injected in triplicate 2 7 quality assurance and statistical analysis procedural blanks using 10 ml of ultrapure water and 10 ml of ultrapure water with mps were performed at every batch of 10 extractions for quality assurance the targeted pesticides were not detected in any batch recovery for ddvp was 72 2 and 75 1 for concentrations of 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 while cpf had 69 1 and 75 5 for concentrations of 0 5 and 1 mg l 1 respectively this loss is attributed to the pesticide adsorption on the tubes glass wall 42 and taking into account on isotherm and kinetics calculations the method quantification limits mqls were calculated as ten times the signal to noise ratio and it was 2 0 and 7 6 μg l 1 for ddvp and cpf while the method detection limits mdl were calculated as three times the signal to noise ratio and it was 0 6 and 2 2 μg l 1 for ddvp and cpf respectively anova statistical analysis was performed using the excel software the data sets pesticide adsorbed quantities on virgin and oxidized microplastic from the same type were therefore compared using anova and the statistical significance was obtained when f f critical 3 results and discussion 3 1 microplastics characterization the xrd diffraction patterns are used as an indicator of the crystallinity degree of the materials 43 polymers with high crystallinity degrees have xrd diffraction patterns characterized by having sharp diffraction peaks whilst polymers with low crystallinity degrees exhibit broader peaks 37 the xrd patterns of mps evaluated in this study are shown in fig s1 the calculated crystallinity degree of mps followed the trend pe pp ps the oxidative treatments did not considerably alter mps crystallinity table s2 to evaluate possible changes in mps surface after oxidation treatments the surface morphology was analyzed by sem microscopy as shown in fig 1 sem images show that pe has a rugged and crumpled surface whereas pp and ps have a smoother surface mps in this study presented a deformed form without micropores fig s2 sem images suggest that the oxidation treatments did not physically alter mps surface analysis by imagej software indicated that pe pp and ps presented average sizes of 294 μm 300 μm and 276 μm with a relative standard deviation of 9 6 10 1 and 7 6 respectively ftir analyses were carried out to investigate the effect of o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments in the mp s surface fig 2 a and b show the ftir spectra of pe and pp mps before and after the oxidation treatments there were no evident changes in the intensity of the bands at 2915 and 2845 cm 1 which correspond to ch stretching and at 1463 cm 1 that can be attributed to the ch2 vibration 40 spectra of pe treated with o3 and o3 h2o2 and pp subjected to o3 show a new band around 1712 cm 1 to pe and 1708 cm 1 to pp which was related to the presence of co groups indicating the oxidation of the polymers bands around 1700 1725 cm 1 are attributed to the presence of carboxylic acid and ketone functional groups however it is not possible to observe in the ftir spectra of oxidized pe and pp a broad band between 2800 and 3500 cm 1 which is attributed to oh stretching it indicates the presence of ketones groups on the surface of oxidized pe and pp ftir spectrum of pp treated with o3 h2o2 did not show major differences in relation with virgin pp fig 2c shows ftir spectra of ps mps before and after oxidation treatments virgin ps matches the typical ps spectrum reported in the literature 44 with bands at 3024 cm 1 corresponding to the aromatic ch stretching and at 1491 cm 1 corresponding to the aromatic ring stretching ftir spectra of ps treated with o3 and o3 h2o2 show a new broad band around 3426 cm 1 which can be attributed to hydroxyl group oh stretch similarly to pe and pp a new band at 1712 cm 1 corresponding to the co functional groups was observed however the presence of hydroxyl bands in the oxidized ps spectra suggests the formation of carboxyl acids and alcohols after analyzing ftir spectra of pet pp and ps it is possible to affirm that o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments can generate oxygenated groups in the polymers surface for example one study demonstrated that a higher ozone dosage was necessary to modify polypropylene surface 45 as a consequence of having only single bonds in their chain pe and pp have greater oxidation resistance than ps nonetheless pe and pp reactions with o3 and o3 h2o2 are well known to form carbonyl groups 45 47 ps has been reported to form e co and oh groups after reaction with o3 30 ps has aromatic rings a group that is more susceptible to chemical attack in comparison with ch2 and ch3 groups of pe and pp the aromatic rings are assumed as the preferential site for o3 attack rather than by activation of the saturated hydrocarbon chain during ozonation 48 the insertion of oxygen functional groups onto polymers surface occurred probably due to the reaction with ozone itself and reactive species e g hydroxyl radicals derived from the reaction of ozone and hydrogen peroxide 31 therefore ftir spectra for oxidized ps show recognizable peaks matching the group frequencies of both co and oh 3 2 sorption kinetics the kinetic study was carried out to evaluate the time dependent behavior of cpf and ddvp adsorption on mps virgin and oxidized mps were evaluated as adsorbents adsorption of pesticides was a rapid process in the initial stage and the adsorption rate slowed gradually until complete equilibrium was reached cpf and ddvp equilibrium time was achieved around 15 and 20 min respectively for all the evaluated mps comparing the obtained results with other studies described in the literature the mps from this study showed faster adsorption 49 50 this behavior can be attributed to the size of the mps particles a study demonstrated that when adsorption of phenanthrene and nitrobenzene was assessed with polystyrene on sizes of 170 μm 102 μm 50 μm 30 μm 800 nm 235 nm and 50 nm the smaller particles presented a shorter equilibrium time when compared with larger particles 50 another study evaluated the adsorption behavior of five pesticides on pe particles with 4 mm of size reaching the sorption equilibrium in 120 min 41 the particle size of mps in the present study was about 400 μm thus the reached equilibrium time is consistent with their sizes in order to investigate the mechanism of adsorption and potential rate controlling steps the pseudo first order 51 pseudo second order 52 and intra particle diffusion 53 models were used to interpret the obtained data concerning cpf and ddvp removal from water media adsorption kinetics of cpf and ddvp onto the three mps before and after oxidation treatments are shown in figs s3 and s4 calculated parameters for pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models for cpf and ddvp are shown in tables 3 and 4 respectively kinetic data did not present significant differences between virgin and oxidized mps tables 3 and 4 regarding the results obtained for the kinetic models of pseudo first order and intraparticle diffusion low correlation coefficients r2 calculated to cpf table 3 and ddvp table 4 indicated the non adequacy of the models to the experimental data the intraparticle diffusion model which was used strictly for porous materials was applied with an expectation to observe a mathematical result for weathering or an increased porosity caused by oxidation the pseudo first order kinetic model is associated with the model of one site occupancy adsorption kinetics governed by the rate of surface reaction 54 therefore these results present a disagreement with the one site occupancy model and of a porous material on the order hand the obtained data successfully fitted the pseudo second order model with r2 values higher than 0 9519 for both pesticides the calculated adsorption capacities qe were also closest to the experimental qe these results indicate that the cpf and ddvp adsorption onto mps followed the pseudo second order kinetic model this model represents several adsorption processes over time while the first order model generally best fits adsorption systems after 20 30 min 55 the pseudo second order model was used before to explain the kinetic of ddvp adsorption onto coconut fiber biochar 56 biowaste 57 and indian soils 58 cpf uptake best fitted to pseudo second order kinetic when silanized cellulose nanofibers cds nanoparticles 59 and graphene oxide electrospun cellulose 60 were used as adsorbents 3 3 adsorption isotherms isotherm studies can help to explain the mechanism by which the pollutant interacts with the adsorbent and provide insights regarding the adsorption capacity 61 thus to assess how the different oxidation conditions can affect the mps interactions with pesticides and what are the possible mechanisms involved in the interactive process the langmuir freundlich tempkin henry and dubinin radushkevish isothermal models were adjusted to experimental data the calculated parameters for each model are shown in tables 5 and 6 for ddvp and cpf respectively analyzing the plot of qe versus ce figs s5 and s6 for ddvp and cpf adsorption it is possible to observe that with the increase in pesticide concentrations the adsorption sites in pe ps and pp were quickly occupied culminating in a decrease in the sorption efficiency of the pesticides this behavior indicates that the system at a given concentration of the pesticide achieved the dynamic equilibrium regarding the accordance of the isothermal models to the ddvp adsorption equilibrium data onto virgin mps and those treated with o3 h2o2 were best adjusted to the freundlich isotherm model indicating that the adsorption was due to the heterogeneity of the material 62 table 5 these results suggested that minor chemical modification was promoted by the o3 h2o2 oxidation on the surface of pe pp and ps and consequently virgin mps and those oxidized with o3 h2o2 followed a similar mechanism in the ddvp uptake on the other hand o3 treated mps had a more evident surface modification as indicated by the isotherm models addressed since unlike virgin mps and those treated with o3 h2o2 the best curve fit was the langmuir isotherm table 5 in general this model indicates that the adsorption of pesticide ddvp on mps treated with o3 occurred through monolayer coverage 63 the result suggests that the polymers hydrophilicity increased after o3 process due to the presence of oxygen containing groups which favors electrostatic interactions between adsorbent and adsorbate and culminating in a monolayer formation langmuir s model this translates into the basic principle of chemical polarity in which polar substances will have higher interactions with other polar compounds and lower interactions with apolar substances with the opposite being true for apolar compounds 64 the exception to this tendency was o3 treated pp which followed the same mechanism freundlich for virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps this probably occurred due to the slight oxidation of pp during ozonation when compared to other mps corroborating ftir analyses thus the surface of pp treated with o3 is quite similar to those of virgin and o3 h2o2 treated pp and so they followed the same adsorption mechanism with regard to cpf adsorption on pe pp and ps virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps followed similar mechanisms fig s6 the same behavior verified to ddvp uptake virgin and o3 h2o2 treated pe and pp best fitted to henry isotherm model table 6 while virgin and o3 h2o2 treated ps were better adjusted to langmuir model r2 0 9894 and 0 9999 respectively as verified to ddvp adsorption the results indicate that the o3 h2o2 treatment provided low mp surface modification while o3 h2o2 treated mps followed the same mechanism as the virgin mp to cpf adsorption on the other hand the tempkin isotherm model provided a better theoretical correlation to the cpf adsorption equilibrium data of all o3 treated mps indicating adsorption by monolayer mechanism this result is in agreement with another study 58 that reported that the tempkin isotherm model best described the ddvp adsorption process in indian soils therefore according to the results obtained from the isotherm studies it is possible to suggest that the o3 h2o2 treated mps have a low surface modification since for both pesticides ddvp and cpf the adsorption mechanism of these contaminants for virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps were similar expressed by the same isotherm models o3 treated mps presented different interaction mechanisms compared to virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mps presenting distinct isothermal models in addition to the superficial modification of the mps the physicochemical properties of the pesticides also influence the interactions between adsorbent adsorbate as indicated by the different best isothermal adjustments observed for ddvp and cpf tables 5 and 6 thus according to the indicated isothermal model the mechanisms between virgin treated mps and the target contaminants are explained below in more detail in the freundlich isotherm model kf is the freundlich constant l 1 μg and 1 nf is the heterogeneity factor 62 the more heterogeneous the adsorbent surface the closer the values of 1 n f approach zero in all evaluated adsorption systems 1 n f values were below unity and calculated kf were very high indicating a high degree of non linearity between the concentration of pesticide solution and adsorption 63 table 6 and favorable sorption of pesticides onto mp s 12 65 as reported in the literature ddvp heterogeneous adsorption onto modified montmorillonite mmt cuo composites 66 lanimno6 perovskite nanoparticles 67 various indian soils followed the freundlich isotherm model langmuir isotherm model assumes that the surface of adsorbent is homogeneous containing binding sites that are energetically equivalent which can hold only one adsorbate molecule langmuir isotherm usually indicates the ﬂat adsorption of molecules on the surface of the adsorbent 68 considering the eighteen different adsorbent adsorbent systems performed in this study 9 for each ddvp and cpf only four best fitted to langmuir model due mainly to the heterogeneity of the mps surface similarly binh et al 56 and alka and anita 69 studied the ddvp uptake by coconut fiber biowaste and paramagnetic poly styrene co acrylic acid hydrogel respectively and the langmuir isotherm model best fitted to experimental data in addition as verified in the present study cpf adsorption data onto silanized cellulose nanofibers cds nanoparticles 59 hydrocalumite iron oxide magnetic 70 graphene oxide silica coated magnetic nanoparticles 71 best fitted to langmuir isotherm model henry isotherm model is indicated to systems with linear behaviors of the equilibrium data at low solute concentrations 12 assuming that all adsorbed molecules are isolated from their nearest neighbors it infers that the affinity of the solute by the adsorbent is greater than the affinity for the solvent suggesting that the adsorption capacity is proportional to the solute concentration 68 high values of henry constant from 969 to 4608 were found to cpf adsorption in virgin and o3 h2o2 treated mp s indicating favorable sorption of pesticides tempkin isotherm assumes that the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the adsorbent surface decreases linearly with coverage due to adsorbate adsorbate interactions 72 and indicates that adsorption happens in a monolayer process 12 all the obtained data to cpf uptake by o3 treated mp s showed high tempkin constant values which were between 379 and 1653 l μg 1 suggesting high adsorption potentials the bt values calculated for o3 treated pe pp and ps were 0 07567 0 07582 and 0 1673 kj mol respectively table 5 and indicate weak interactions between cpf and mp s the dubinin radushkevish isotherm model considers that porous size affect the adsorption potential of the adsorbent 68 it supposes that the surface of the material is heterogeneous and the adsorption potential is not constant 73 suggesting that the adsorption process occurs by micropore volume filling unlike other models in which adsorption occurs layer by layer on pore walls 74 however this isotherm model did not provide good theoretical correlation to the pesticides adsorption onto mps due to the lack of porosity of the adsorbents 3 4 effect of o3 and o3 h2o2 on mps adsorption potential as observed in ftir analyses the oxidation process involving o3 and o3 h2o2 is capable of changing the surface of mps the presence of ketones in the surface of all evaluated mps was observed along with the hydrophobicity decrease of the adsorbents which also reflects the mps polarity change however the presence of carboxyl and hydroxyl groups was verified only in ps surface thus the potential cpf and ddvp adsorption in virgin and oxidized mps were investigated the results of cpf and ddvp uptake are presented in figs 3 and 5 respectively higher cpf adsorption capacities were achieved by virgin pe pp and ps reaching 98 97 and 86 μg g respectively fig 3 virgin mps are hydrophobic polymers and cpf is a hydrophobic pesticide 75 which suggests that hydrophobic interactions are the main adsorption mechanism between virgin mp s and cpf 76 fig 4a among the three evaluated polymers pe was the best adsorbent to cpf similarly polychlorinated byphenyls and anthracene were reported to have a higher tendency to adsorb onto pe 77 78 regarding the cpf adsorption in oxidized mps o3 or o3 h2o2 treated pe pp and ps lower adsorption capacities were observed fig 3 an explanation for this is the hydrophobicity decrease of mps surface which reduced hydrophobic interactions between adsorbent and cpf and thus giving rise to electrostatic interactions between oδ pδ of adsorbent adsorbate respectively 79 fig 4b the electrostatic interactions between oδ pδ are weaker when compared to hydrophobic forces 80 81 additionally ps provided lower adsorption efficiency for cpf which can be due to the presence π π interactions between the aromatic rings of the adsorbent and pesticide this type of mechanism requires a specific orientation of both entities that can compromise other interactions 82 therefore with π π interactions stronger interactions that could reflect in better adsorption as hydrogen bonding do not occur 82 in relation to o3 and o3 h2o2 treated ps it is highly probable the presence of hydrogen bonding between the oxygen in the cpf phosphate and oh groups of the adsorbent as reported by binh and kajitvichyanukul 56 another reason for higher adsorption of pesticides on ps than on pp pe could be the difference between rubbery pe and pp and glassy ps plastics 83 glassy plastics have a more condensed structure than rubbery 83 thus the structure of rubbery plastics leads to higher contaminant mobility and faster diffusivity rates than those observed in glassy plastics resulting in higher adsorption capacities 77 moreover according to anova analyses table s3 supplementary material differences in adsorption capacities between treatments for a same type of mps were significant being in accordance with the relative level of surface change indicated in the ftir spectra fig 2 the ddvp adsorption onto mps was lower than for cpf since this pesticide is less hydrophobic than cpf 84 diminishing the hydrophobic interactions between adsorbent adsorbate fig 4 regarding the oxidation process pe and ps treated by o3 h2o2 demonstrated to adsorb greater amounts of ddvp fig 5 it was observed that o3 h2o2 caused insertion of ketones on both mps surface and hydroxyl and carboxylic acid on ps thus the oxidation step allowed weak electrostatic interactions and in the case of ps hydrogen bonding between the adsorbent and ddvp fig 4 thus the mechanism involved in ddvp adsorption onto oxidized mp s results from a subtle balance between hydrophobic electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding the ddvp adsorption capacities achieved to virgin and oxidized pp were statically equivalent whereas to virgin and oxidized pe and ps differences were found according to anova analyses table s3 supplementary material 4 conclusions this study investigated the adsorption behavior of two commonly used pesticides on pe pp and ps mps before and after o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments both pesticides can adsorb on mps mainly based on hydrophobic interactions especially for cpf the adsorption process was quick for both pesticides on all mps probably due to the low particle size used in this study the adsorption fitted the pseudo second order kinetic model for both pesticides adsorption isotherm of ddvp was best explained by freundlich model in most of scenarios indicating that adsorption was mostly a multilayer process adsorption isotherm of cpf was best explained by henry model indicating that adsorbed molecules are isolated from their nearest neighbors o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments can modify adsorption behavior by inserting carbonyl and hydroxyl groups onto mps surface thus altering interactions between adsorbate adsorbent the results of this study illustrated that o3 and o3 h2o2 used in wastewater treatments could change the surface of mps prior to discharge into the environment thus it is possible that the adsorption or desorption potential of mps also change an increase in polarity and hydrophilicity of mps suggests that mps can adsorb more polar and hydrophilic compounds after o3 and o3 h2o2 treatments this would be a major issue for example if heavy metals cations would be adsorbed and carried along ecosystems on the contrary hydrophobic and apolar compounds would be less adsorbed the interaction between mps and organic contaminants is still a broad field to study especially regards oxidation processes applied for water treatment the possibility of research regards to other contaminants and contaminants mixtures other different oxidation treatments and flow studies make an example of the necessity of more studies in this area declaration of competing interest the authors

conditions for sulfate reducing bacteria srb ni retention was likely mainly governed by sorption mechanisms on organic matter or on fe oxy hydroxides low temperatures combined with salinity may explain the lack of srb growth in the reactors and the absence of so4 2 treatment the treatment of cu was not affected by the low temperatures and the primary mechanism of fe removal in the pbr amd reactor was precipitation in the form of oxy hydroxides keywords mine drainage passive biochemical reactor northern climate salinity nickel 1 introduction the mining industry is considered an essential component of canada s economy with a gross domestic product of 97 billion i e 5 in 2018 1 however despite its socio economic benefits exploitation of mineral resources involves significant risks for the environment such as the contamination of water from mine tailings or waste rock leachate 2 in this context mine water contamination results from chemical and biological reactions that occur when sulfide minerals contained in the solid waste are exposed to both water and oxygen 3 in several cases these biogeochemical reactions generate mine drainage with high metal metalloid and sulfate concentrations that can significantly affect the natural environment including aquatic ecosystems 4 thus once generated mine drainage must be collected and treated prior to its discharge into the environment depending on ore composition and enrichment methods mine drainage can be classified according to its ph as either acid mine drainage amd with ph 6 or neutral mine drainage nmd with ph values mostly between 6 and 9 5 removal mechanisms may differ depending on the quality of the mine drainage in general amd treatment is based on increasing the ph and promoting precipitation co precipitation of metals metalloids while nmd treatment is based on sorption 3 however regardless of the mine drainage quality sulfates can be removed by precipitation reduction and or sorption 3 in closed reclaimed and or abandoned mine sites passive treatment systems are considered a more sustainable alternative and a more attractive economic and environment friendly approach for amd and nmd treatment than active systems 6 7 they consume little energy use natural or residual materials and require little supervision and maintenance in general passive treatment technologies can be classified based on their governing physicochemical and or biochemical processes and include passive biochemical reactors pbrs anoxic oxic limestone drains permeable reactive barriers dispersed alkaline substrates and wetlands 7 8 pbrs are treatment systems that use solid reactive mixtures for the removal of metals and sulfates and in the case of amd increase the ph 9 10 the preferred treatment mechanism in pbrs is the precipitation of metals in the form of metal sulfides following the reduction of sulfate to sulfides hydrogen sulfide under the action of sulfate reducing bacteria srb 10 however metal sulfide precipitation is not the only treatment mechanism involved in pbrs depending on the ph redox conditions metals can also precipitate in the form of carbonates or hydroxides 8 10 sorption ion exchange and complexation with the organic substrate are also other metal removal processes that can occur in a pbr 7 11 besides metal sulfides sulfate can be removed in the form of gypsum and native sulfur 11 14 in general mixtures in pbrs are composed of an inoculum of srb a substrate i e a source of organic carbon as well as nitrogen phosphorous and other nutrients for microorganisms electron donors structural agents for microbial attachment and porosity enhancement and neutralizing agents to increase ph and to produce alkalinity 7 whether applied for amd or nmd treatment the performance of pbrs depends on the substrate depletion rate clogging rates e g biofouling or precipitation and on the specific contaminant removal mechanisms 8 15 for better pbr performance and longevity suitable reactive mixtures must be carefully selected depending on material availability at the mine site mine drainage quality and operating conditions 16 in temperate or semi arid climates pbrs constitute a promising biotechnology for amd and nmd treatment 6 however despite several pbrs installed at various mine sites in northern climates undesirable processes such as decreases in biological activity i e slower growth of srb as well as the formation of water ice have often been encountered 6 17 20 in some cases the sulfate reduction rates via srb were up to 20 times greater at 20 c than at 0 1 c 21 likewise amd treatment at the nickel rim mine site ontario canada showed that sulfate treatment in summer t 16 c was nearly twice as high as in winter t 2 c 22 overall impacts of low temperature on the efficiency of pbrs are caused by the lack of substrate or so4 2 for srb 20 23 25 in addition to the inhibition of so4 2 treatment similar observations have also been noted for metal removal which also decreased at lower temperatures 20 for example zn and cd removal decreased from 90 in summer t 14 18 c to between 20 9 and 39 in winter t 5 c 24 however low temperatures do not systematically reduce the performance of pbrs since other treatment mechanisms such as adsorption on organic matter and on metal oxides as well as precipitation e g as oxides or oxyhydroxides or co precipitation can also lead to metal removal 19 26 in addition it is worth noting that freeze thaw cycles and low temperatures can also control the solubility of secondary minerals particularly carbonates and oxy hydroxides 27 hence due to the growing interest in pbrs for the treatment of mine drainage several studies have been carried out to develop efficient systems at low temperatures some of these studies have recommended the occasional addition of an easily degradable source of organic carbon e g molasses as a substrate for srb 20 24 however in this case pbrs are no longer fully passive but become semi passive other studies suggest installing pbrs at a depth below the freezing point of the soil and covering them with an insulating material to minimize the effects of low temperatures and water freezing on srb activity 17 28 other recommendations have included the use of cold adapted microorganisms such as psychrophiles or cryophiles to maintain srb activity 29 30 for mines operating in northern regions ions contributing to salinity e g na ca2 and cl which are generated while using salts e g nacl and cacl2 as de icing agents could also affect the efficiency of pbrs 6 indeed high salinity can negatively affect the rate of sulfate reduction and metal precipitation because of the increase in osmotic stress on bacterial cells and because of the increase in ion toxicity 31 32 in addition high salinity can also affect the sorption of contaminants on organic matter by creating competition between metals and major ions na ca2 k etc 33 nevertheless under arid semi arid conditions treatment of saline acidic groundwater using pbrs has been shown effective to remove so4 2 and metals 34 35 although the effect of salinity on pbr treatment efficiency is well known in arid semi arid climates its effect in northern climates has not been well documented furthermore the combined effects of high salinity and low temperature on sulfate and metal removal through pbrs are poorly known and need more investigation in addition although biogeochemical processes within pbrs have been well studied under controlled lab scale conditions practical applications of pbrs in cold climates have been limited hence the present work builds on earlier studies that evaluated the potential removal of contaminants from saline nmd and amd at the lab scale using pbrs at low temperature 36 37 using batch tests these past experiments evaluated different reactive mixtures for the treatment of synthetic amd and nmd the results made it possible to select the most efficient reactive mixtures which produced ni and so4 2 removal efficiencies of 91 36 column tests were also carried out with the aim of evaluating the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt and salinity on the treatment efficiency of amd and nmd these column experiments allowed to fix hrts at 2 5 days for the treatment of amd and 1 day for nmd the lab scale testing showed promising results when using pbrs to treat high ni 27 6 5 6 vs 23 9 10 1 mg l and sulfate 3186 616 mg l vs 587 205 mg l concentrations in amd and nmd respectively it is then assumed that the efficiency of laboratory experiments could be transferred to an in situ pilot scale system operating under similar conditions in terms of hrt and reactive mixture under cold climate conditions to treat real amd and nmd building on knowledge gained through the laboratory experiments the current study is a continuation of the investigation through field testing the main objective is to evaluate the performance of experimental field pbrs installed in a northern environment at the raglan glencore mine in northern quebec canada to treat ni rich amd and nmd 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling the raglan mine is a nickel mining complex located in northern québec canada in the nunavik region 61 41 15 n 073 40 41 w fig 1 the mine is situated in a subarctic continuous permafrost zone within the cape smith belt with an average annual temperature of 15 c 5 f a total annual rainfall of 350 mm and 500 cm of snow four underground mines are presently in operation where residues from the concentrators are deposited in a tailings storage facility the waste rocks are temporarily placed in a waste rock pile before being disposed drainage water from certain waste rock piles before treatment has ph values and ni concentrations that do not always meet the environmental standards 38 39 indeed amd from the tailings is collected in a primary basin and treated by active lime neutralization prior to treatment fe cu and ni concentrations in the collected amd exceed the regulation criteria as specified in the quebec provincial regulation d019 and the metal and diamond mining effluent regulations mdmer fe 3 mg l ni 0 5 mg l and cu 0 3 mg l 38 39 the treated water is then pumped to a second basin in which nmd is also collected when the ph and ni concentrations comply with the standards 38 39 water from the second basin is treated to respect regulatory criteria before being released to the environment in addition the mine water pumped from underground to the surface has neutral ph values 6 9 7 4 high salinity and high nickel concentrations up to 68 1 mg l hence the pbrs in this project will be tested to treat two types of contaminated water i e amd and nmd collected in summer 2017 and summer 2018 table 1 2 2 preparation of the reactive mixtures because of on site access difficulties fig 1 reactive mixtures were transported to the raglan mine by plane only wood ash and sewage sludge were collected directly from the mine the reactive mixtures were prepared according to the approach of ben ali et al 36 37 table 2 mixing of materials was done manually in 20 l buckets fig s1 after being prepared the reactive pbr amd mixture was saturated with amd and incubated at room temperature 22 c for one week to initiate acclimatization and establishment of the srb 37 2 3 set up of the on site pbrs and instrumentation four pilot bioreactors 220 l were set up at the mine the first two reactors pbr1 amd and pbr2 amd were installed in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively which aimed to treat the amd however clogging problems due to precipitates from the amd occurred frequently in the feed system of bioreactor pbr1 amd thus data collected from this bioreactor were inconsistent and inaccurate therefore only results from reactor pbr2 amd will be presented and referred to hereafter as pbr amd fig 2 the two other reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd were set up in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively for the treatment of nmd fig 2 field experiments were conducted during summer for 30 120 days during optimal conditions e g when sufficient volumes of water to be treated were available supplying the pilot pbrs in the field with mine drainage amd or nmd was initially planned to be done passively however during construction it turned out that the configuration of the topography was not favorable to the establishment of an efficient upstream gravity feed for the pbrs this situation led to the installation of peristaltic pumps in order to supply the bioreactors with mine drainage the primary constraint encountered during the field tests was the limited available time at the raglan mine the water thaws relatively late in the season during june and freezes relatively early mid september the short thaw period had the effect of limiting the duration of the tests a 5 cm layer of gravel was placed at the bottom of each reactor barrel to prevent possible clogging problems in each reactor barrel the layer of gravel was covered with a geotextile on which was deposited the appropriate reactive mixture fig 2 the bioreactors were fed using masterflex peristaltic pumps with downward vertical flow using the hydraulic parameters described in table 3 2 4 analytical methods leachate collected from the three bioreactors was analyzed for ph electric conductivity ec redox potential orp alkalinity acidity temperature sulfate sulfides and total metals 40 41 the ph was measured using a fisherbrand accumet multimeter equipped with a single junction electrode and an ag agcl reference cell measurements of the orp were carried out using a portable redox tester orptestr 10 with a double junction ag agcl polymer sensor alkalinity and acidity were determined by titration with a fully automated metrohm mati07 titrator combined with an aquatrode ph electrode 41 temperatures were measured and recorded with probes connected to a decagon em50 log data logger box installed in the center of the bioreactors sulfate method 8051 and sulfide method 10254 concentrations were determined with a hach dr900 portable multi parameter colorimeter total metal concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes perkin elmer 3000 dv on filtered 0 45 μm and acidified with 2 v v of hno3 samples the phreeqc v3 geochemical code with the wateq4f database was used to evaluate the eventual metal and sulfate removal mechanisms based on treated water chemistry from the pbr amd and pbr2 nmd reactors further details including characterization of the initial materials treatment efficiency and experiment parameters are provided elsewhere 36 37 at the end of the tests the reactors were dismantled fig s2 and the spent reactive mixtures were stored in hermetically sealed bags at 4 c prior to characterization mineralogy and microstructure of the spent reactive mixtures pbr amd and pbr2 nmd were then analyzed with a hitachi s 3500 n scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds x ray probe 20 kv 140 a 25 kpa and 15 mm prior to their analysis with sem edx the solids were dehydrated at 40 c for 48 h then deposited on supports metal studs using double sided adhesive tape and metallized chemical and mineralogical compositions were then analyzed with the sem edx inca oxford energy 450 equipped with a data processor total metal concentrations of the spent reactive mixtures were analyzed by icp aes after acidic hno3 br2 hf hcl digestion bacteriological analyses were carried out on the reactive mixtures before and after the treatment of amd and nmd enumeration of srb in the solids was performed using the most probable number method d4412 84 42 a detailed description of this method is presented in the supplementary material a statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric spearman s rho test significance level was p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 amd treatment 3 1 1 physicochemical analyses t ph orp ec acidity and alkalinity results showed a significant and rapid increase of ph to 7 0 8 0 at the outlet of the pbr amd reactor over the entire monitoring period despite the initial low ph values of the inflow amd 3 3 4 2 fig 3 overall ph values respected the canadian discharge limits ph of 6 0 9 5 as specified in the mdmer 39 the increase in alkalinity up to 160 mg l caco3 rs 0 89 p value 0 040 and ph were due to neutralization through wood ash which contains high amounts of carbonates i e calcite and dolomite 78 and portlandite 2 and which also has a high paste ph 11 6 12 4 fig 3 table s1 as expected acidity was relatively low in the pbr amd reactor during the experiment 20 mg l caco3 with an exception on day 42 when a particularly high acidity was observed 133 mg l caco3 fig 3 orp values decreased from a range of 368 424 mv in the amd inflow to slightly lower values of 86 185 mv in reactor pbr amd which still indicated oxidizing conditions the ec values slightly increased in reactor pbr amd up to 2 5 ms cm which could probably be explained by the increase of the total dissolved solids originating from the reactive mixture nonetheless this range of ec was comparable to what was found in the literature 43 finally temperatures fluctuated over the monitoring period between 0 2 and 12 0 c with an average of 5 3 c in reactor pbr amd and tended to decrease over time 3 1 2 evolution of ni fe cu al and sulfate concentrations 3 1 2 1 sulfates almost no difference was observed in so4 2 concentrations between the inflowing amd 2 000 4 800 mg l and outflow from the pbr amd reactor 2 700 4 400 mg l suggesting limited or no effective so4 2 treatment limited increases of so4 2 concentrations were noted in the pbr amd reactor in comparison with the amd inflow which could probably be attributed to leaching of the so4 2 initially present in the reaction mixture fig 4 in addition so4 2 variation has almost the same tendency as ec rs 0 87 p value 0 010 limited or no so4 2 removal and the positive orp values suggest that a sulfate reducing mechanism was not favored and therefore metal sulfide minerals could not precipitate this observation was consistent with the s2 concentrations in reactor pbr amd not presented that were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l during the experiment these findings are probably due to the low hrt and the low temperatures recorded during the test period indeed similar observations were also recently noted during lab scale tests where so4 2 removal was almost absent when the temperature was lowered to 5 c while so4 2 removal 99 was high when the initial temperature of 22 c was maintained for three months before decreasing to 5 c 37 in other studies tests performed at room temperature 22 c showed srb activity after 42 days indicating relatively high so4 2 and metal treatment efficiency relative to the results when the srb were incubated at 10 c and 4 c 44 this highlights the importance of the initial temperature of the pbr and the incubation period of the inoculum to trigger and promote the sulfate reducing process finally at the end of the experiment the slight decrease of so4 2 concentrations could be due to precipitation in the form of gypsum favored by the particularly high so4 2 concentrations in amd up to 4 800 mg l fig 4 3 1 2 2 iron the fe removal rate in the pbr amd reactor was greater than 95 rs 0 74 p value 0 056 over the entire monitoring period from initial concentrations of 1 5 50 6 mg l to the final 0 06 0 30 mg l fig 4 under the ph 7 0 8 0 and orp 86 185 mv conditions in the same reactor fe removal mechanisms are more related to precipitation as hydroxides and oxy hydroxides resulting from the increase of ph rs 0 74 p value 0 056 than to the precipitation in the form of fe sulfides 11 sorption onto the surface of organic matter sawdust and compost and wood ash could also contribute to fe removal 30 45 47 3 1 2 3 copper cu concentrations in the amd were high 1 2 3 0 mg l over the entire follow up period but were 400 1000 times lower in the pbr amd reactor rs 0 71 fig 4 indeed the cu removal rate was greater than 99 7 leaving cu concentrations compliant with the monthly limits of mdmer 0 3 mg l as ph increases cu is likely to precipitate in the form of hydroxides similar findings were reported where cu removal was not affected by temperature 5 c vs 22 c with a removal rate of 97 37 similar to fe cu removal was probably due to co precipitation and sorption mechanisms moreover fe hydroxide could promote the removal of cu by co precipitation and by sorption the ability of fe hydroxides to co precipitate with other metals and act as a secondary sorbent phase of cu has been reported previously 48 it is noted that sorption onto the compost surface is a well known mechanism for cu removal under non sulfate reducing conditions 49 50 3 1 2 4 nickel results showed significant ni removal 91 95 at the beginning of the experiment where ni concentrations were between 1 3 and 3 2 mg l vs 20 mg l in amd fig 4 these findings were consistent with column lab tests where ni removal remained high 97 even at 5 c 37 however despite high ni removal ni concentrations from the pbr amd reactor were above the acceptable limit 0 5 mg l over the entire monitoring period since sulfate reduction was not favored in the pbr amd reactor ni removal in the form of sulfide is therefore not expected to occur hence the probable main mechanism of ni removal is precipitation at high ph rs 0 90 p value 0 006 in addition sorption on organic matter and co precipitation with fe hydroxides could also be potential mechanisms for ni retention indeed ni removal could be controlled by fe oxy hydroxides via sorption mechanisms 51 and co precipitation or substitution of fe in fe oxy hydroxide crystalline structures 52 moreover ni could also be sorbed onto wood ash 53 and peat surfaces 54 the ni removal rate decreased over time rs 0 82 p value 0 023 with a noticeable drop observed on day 39 53 56 competition between fe cu and ni ions for sorption sites could also explain the less efficient treatment of ni compared to fe and cu 55 the decrease in system temperature could explain this decline as the ni adsorption process on organic matter is endothermic and therefore less favorable at low temperature 56 3 1 2 5 aluminum despite its high concentration up to 12 mg l in amd high al removal rates 95 7 99 2 were observed during the test the lowest al concentration 0 01 mg l was noted at neutral to slightly alkaline ph 7 0 8 0 rs 0 85 p value 0 014 reflecting its precipitation overall al retention was mainly related to the precipitation of amorphous hydroxides at ph 5 12 it is worth noting that over the entire duration of the experiment no system clogging was observed i e with almost no change of inflow and outflow fluxes 3 1 3 saturation indices and potential metal removal mechanisms saturation indices si on days 4 25 and 45 indicated oversaturation of the leachate with respect to fe oxy hydroxide minerals such as fe oh 3 goethite α feooh hematite α fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 during the entire period table s2 results were consistent with high fe removal 95 through the pbr amd reactor however negative saturation indices with respect to fe sulfides such as pyrite fes2 greigite fe3s4 and mackinawite fes indicated that these minerals did not reach saturation and results were thus consistent with the low or negligible rates of so4 2 removal table s2 these observations were expected since conditions for promoting srb activity were not favorable at the same time the si of gypsum was very close to 0 suggesting a metastable phase table s2 for ni ni oh 2 was oversaturated during the entire period with an increasing trend in addition the contribution of sorption mechanisms for ni i e onto organic matter or fe oxy hydroxide surfaces especially at the start of the treatment when sorption sites are more available could also be considered as for the case of fe the si of millerite nis was undersaturated which suggested the absence of ni sulfide bearing minerals for cu regardless of the type of the precipitates oxides hydroxides sulfides etc all cu bearing minerals were undersaturated and therefore cu retention could only be attributed to sorption mechanisms al could be removed as basaluminite al4 so4 oh 105 h2o alunite kal3 so4 2 oh 6 boehmite alo oh or gibbsite al oh 3 notably precipitation of these al bearing minerals had also been reported during amd treatment 13 14 57 3 1 4 characteristics of the spent residues the results of the srb enumeration showed markedly lower bacterial densities 40 180 103 cells 100 ml in the spent reactive mixture compared to published lab scale tests where significantly higher srb densities were observed 1600 103 cells 100 ml 37 the observed differences between the column tests and the pilot field scale test suggest that establishment of the srb was favored only in the columns indeed the 22 c starting temperature of the columns had been maintained for 3 months and would have favored the establishment of srb while in the case of the pilot field test temperatures were low over the entire testing period mean t 5 3 c except for the first week overall results of the srb densities in the field test were consistent with the so4 2 and orp data which suggests that sulfate reduction was not favoured in the pbr amd reactor due to the high fe concentrations in the amd source water up to 50 6 mg l table 1 fe content was 1 4 times higher in the top than in the middle and bottom of the pbr amd reactor with an increase of 30 compared to the initial reactive mixture a retention of fe in the form of oxy hydroxides as predicted by the geochemical modeling can explain these observations in addition cu content was twice as high in the top of the pbr amd reactor as in the middle and bottom respectively with an increase of 50 compared to the initial reactive mixture similar observations were also found for ni which was 4 to 6 times higher at the top than in the middle and bottom respectively with an increase of 50 with respect to the initial reactive mixture the final ni content in the middle and bottom layers of the pbr amd reactor was lower than its initial content leaching of ni could probably explain these findings the increase of ca and s content in the pbr amd reactor could probably be explained by their precipitation in the form of gypsum as previously predicted by the geochemical modeling overall high metal content in the top layer of this reactor could be due to inflow of the contaminant loaded amd while feeding the treatment unit mineralogical investigations using meb eds showed precipitation of fe oxides hydroxides fig 5 as the ph increased fe precipitates assumed to be ferric hydroxides were visible as yellow and yellow brown mineral staining in the pbr amd reactor as predicted by the geochemical modeling fig s3 findings were in agreement with previous pbr experiments conducted under oxidizing and reducing conditions where fe oxides and oxy hydroxides were in the form of hematite goethite and magnetite 13 14 calcite and silicates were also present and originate from the reactive mixture 3 2 nmd treatment 3 2 1 physicochemical analyses t ph orp conductivity acidity and alkalinity results showed no significant change in ph between the nmd source water and effluent from the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors where values were near neutral to slightly basic 6 9 7 4 fig 6 the slight decrease in ph values from the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors in summer 2018 is probably explained by the high amount of sphagnum peat moss 55 w w in the reactive mixtures which could naturally acidify the water 58 similar trends were also observed for orp where almost no differences were noted between the source nmd 228 17 mv and outflow from reactors pbr1 nmd 212 7 mv and pbr2 nmd 222 23 mv which indicated the presence of oxidizing conditions 170 260 mv ec values remained very similar and tended to increase in summer 2017 rs 0 82 p value 0 09 but were still slightly higher in the pbr1 nmd reactor compared to the initial nmd fig 6 this trend could be explained by the increase of the total dissolved solids originating from the reactive mixture however in summer 2018 ec values in the nmd were only high up to 25 ms cm at the start of the experiment and showed a downward trend over time rs 0 75 p value 0 01 between 70 90 days ec values remained lower 7 8 ms cm than those observed in reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd up to 18 ms cm alkalinity values increased over time and were higher in the pbr1 nmd rs 0 75 p value 0 05 and pbr2 nmd reactors rs 0 99 p value 0 compared to the initial nmd fig 6 for the case of the pbr amd reactor the increase in the alkalinity compared to reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd is attributed to the wood ash which contains a high amount of calcite 77 9 table s1 acidity values were only low for the initial nmd and for reactor pbr2 nmd 60 mg l caco3 rs 0 83 p value 0 003 while high values were noted in reactor pbr1 nmd in summer 2018 with a sharp increase up to 220 mg l caco3 leaching of decomposed organic matter after several freezing thawing cycles between summer 2017 and summer 2018 could probably account for these results finally temperatures fluctuated between 0 7 c and 11 8 c average 5 1 c over the monitoring period and tended to decrease over time rs 0 40 p value 6e 05 fig 6 the low recorded temperatures in the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors could have inhibited the activity of srb thus preventing reducing conditions from developing 3 2 2 evolution of ni ca and sulfate concentrations since fe and cu concentrations in the nmd source water were low and close to detection limits 0 003 0 1 mg l only concentrations of ca ni and so4 2 are presented in this section 3 2 2 1 sulfate in summer 2017 results showed that so4 2 concentrations in water from the pbr1 nmd reactor were slightly higher 400 710 mg l than those from the nmd source 190 560 mg l the increase of so4 2 concentrations from the pbr1 nmd reactor rs 0 70 p value 0 188 can be attributed to the leaching of so4 2 contained in the reaction mixture i e peat in summer 2018 almost the same trends were observed for reactor pbr2 nmd rs 0 90 p value 0 0004 in addition some so4 2 retention was observed at day 60 fig 7 given its low concentration 600 700 mg l so4 2 sorption on the limestone could be the probable retention mechanism 59 overall results showed that almost no retention of so4 2 was observed in the treatment system indicating the absence of metal sulfide bearing minerals high orp values 190 mv fig 6 low recorded temperatures fig 6 and a low hrt 1 day table 3 could probably account for these findings which had the effect of inhibiting the srb activity and therefore the establishment of reducing conditions in the reactors for so4 2 treatment these results were inconsistent with previous studies that showed so4 2 removal attributed to sulfate reduction during nmd treatment in cold climates 23 24 in the study by 24 several conditions were met to promote the activity of srb 1 native srb had already been established in the system 2 the high hrt 14 days and 3 the use of a liquid carbon source molasses to support srb activity 3 2 2 2 calcium in general ca concentration trends were very similar to ec rs 0 97 p value 0 fig 7 high ca concentrations in the reactive mixture of reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd were attributed to the dissolution of calcite which was present in the wood ash and which increased ph 3 2 2 3 nickel except for the first sample i e at day 4 the ni removal rate in reactor pbr1 nmd was greater than 99 over the entire follow up period rs 0 60 p value 0 4 summer 2017 fig 7 until day 4 the hrt of the effluent in reactor pbr1 nmd was clearly less than 1 day which could probably explain the low ni removal rate at day 4 26 8 fig 7 despite high ni concentrations in the nmd 4 2 45 6 mg l low values were observed from day 4 in the pbr1 nmd reactor and which met the regulatory criteria mdmer 0 5 mg l in parallel with increasing ph and absence of sulfate removal ni is likely to precipitate in the form of oxides hydroxides in the summer of 2018 after restarting the pbr1 nmd reactor the ni removal rate was low 26 6 fig 7 the alteration of the reactive mixture in reactor pbr1 nmd due to freeze thaw action could potentially explain the drop in ni removal efficiency observed just after the restart in summer 2018 in parallel when reactor pbr1 nmd was restarted in the summer of 2018 the reactive mixture in the reactor was not yet fully thawed since the center of the reactor had remained frozen and therefore not accessible for the nmd fig s4 hence preferential flow paths could probably be created then at day 82 ni was released 29 from the reactor pbr1 nmd indeed the increase of ni leaching from this reactor was consistent with the increase of ca concentrations fig 7 the dissolution of calcite could probably account for these findings since calcite could adsorb divalent metals on its surface in particular ni 60 at the end of the experiment an increase in the ni removal rate 82 8 was observed in reactor pbr1 nmd but it remained lower than the removal rates observed in summer 2017 in summer 2018 ni concentrations were above the threshold fixed by the mdmer 0 5 mg l for reactor pbr2 nmd ni concentrations fluctuated at the start of the test 0 3 2 0 mg l but increased over time until the end of the monitoring period and did not meet the regulation limits fig 7 overall since srb activity was not favorable as previously discussed ni retention in reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd was probably due to sorption 3 2 3 saturation indices and potential metal removal mechanisms calculated sis on days 4 26 and 46 indicated that except for day 46 all ni bearing minerals carbonates hydroxides sulfides etc were undersaturated and therefore ni retention could be primarily attributed to sorption on organic matter at day 46 ni oh 2 was oversaturated table s4 and therefore was likely to precipitate in reactor pbr2 nmd for gypsum similar to the case of reactor pbr amd its si was very close to 0 indicating that its formation and dissolution rates were quasi similar 3 2 4 characteristics of the spent residues the srb counts showed low bacterial densities 7 5 x 103 cells 100 ml table s5 in the spent reactive mixture that reflected limited or no sulfate reduction results were consistent with the high orp values and low so4 2 concentrations which also suggested negligible srb activity the combined effect of the high salinity of nmd the low temperatures and the low hrt would explain why srb did not develop in the bioreactors s content was 1 7 1 9 times higher in the top than in the middle and bottom of reactor pbr1 nmd respectively with an increase of 30 compared to the initial content similar trends were also observed in reactor pbr2 nmd where the s content was 1 6 times higher in the top than in the middle and bottom with an increase of 38 4 compared to the initial content a probable retention of s in the form of gypsum as predicted by the geochemical modeling can explain these observations ca content slightly decreased in the top of reactors pbr1 nmd 12 2 and pbr2 nmd 3 1 in comparison with the initial values 56 1 56 3 g kg in addition ca content was lower at the top of reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd 50 g kg and 54 6 g kg respectively than in the middle 57 5 g kg for both and bottom 59 9 g kg and 71 3 g kg layers table s5 the decrease of ca content in the top layers of the reactors can be explained by the consumption of calcite to neutralize the slight acidity 6 1 27 1 mg l caco3 table 1 of the nmd which hence increased ph therefore the increase of ca content in both the middle and bottom layers could probably be explained by the precipitation of ca bearing minerals e g gypsum in addition despite low cu content in the nmd 0 003 mg l table 1 a significant increase was observed in both reactors pbr1 nmd 62 5 and pbr2 nmd 80 respectively likewise similar trends were also observed for the ni content which also increased significantly in the top layers 93 9 for reactor pbr1 nmd and 20 4 for reactor pbr2 nmd respectively sem eds analyses showed the presence of c o ca na al si cl fe and ti originating from the peat other metals e g ni and cu were immobilized in this peat probably via sorption since precipitation was unlikely to occur as predicted by the geochemical modeling sorption of cu and ni onto the peat has already been discussed previously 50 58 high magnification images fig 8 highlight the presence of a hollow porous structure of hyaline cells in the form of arrows that confer good sorption and cation exchange capacities in addition amorphous minerals of ca o and fe were also found which contained small amounts of ni and cu 3 3 general discussion all three bioreactors failed to meet amd and nmd treatment objectives at the raglan mine in reactor pbr amd high ni removal 82 94 was observed at the beginning while lower values 53 56 were found at the end table s6 moreover ni removal produced a cumulative precipitation of 1 700 mg ni in pbr amd at a rate 480 mg ni d except for the period between 15 08 30 08 similar trends were also observed for reactor pbr2 nmd but with a higher removal efficiency where 92 97 of the ni removal occurred at the beginning while lower values 42 78 were found at the end table s6 ni removal gave a cumulative precipitation of 65 500 mg ni in reactor pbr2 nmd at a rate 1200 mg ni d except for the period between 31 07 and 13 08 since fe and cu concentrations were low in the nmd only fe and cu removal rates for reactor pbr amd were presented in table s6 high fe 99 0 and cu 99 9 removal efficiencies were observed during the treatment period which corresponds to 19 800 mg fe at a rate of up to 1000 mg fe d and up to 2 150 mg cu at a mean rate of 51 mg cu d respectively overall none of the reactors pbr amd pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd developed favorable conditions for srb activity the absence of so4 2 removal and the persistent oxidizing conditions suggest that the sulfate reduction process did not occur in these bioreactors or at least was negligible and hence the removal of metals as metal sulfides was unlikely to occur because of the low recorded temperatures 5 c on average in the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors the high salinity of the nmd could also have had a negative impact on the srb population growth the low hrts the low temperatures and the presence of salinity for the nmd may explain the reasons for which the establishment and the development of srb were not favored in the absence of srb activity the primary mechanisms governing the removal of metals in the pbr amd reactor are 1 precipitation as oxy hydroxides and carbonates related to ph changes 2 co precipitation with oxy hydroxides and 3 sorption on organic matter the lower removal efficiency of ni in the pbr amd reactor compared to fe and cu removal can be explained by the competition between ca fe cu and ni for the sorption sites of organic matter since the bonds formed between cu and fe with organic matter are stronger than ni which is still more mobile 54 in the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors ni removal is mainly governed by sorption mechanisms on the organic matter of the reactive mixture e g peat and wood ash the decrease in the ni removal rate in all bioreactors over time can be attributed to the gradual saturation of the active sorption sites despite the absence of s srb can grow and form syntrophic associations with methanogens or hydrogen scavengers to improve their survival even at low sulfate concentrations 61 in addition most srb have optimal growth conditions in the ph range 6 ph 8 hence outside this range a deterioration in srb activity and metal removal capacity is usually noted and an addition of alkaline materials during amd treatment would be required 61 however some acidophilic srb acclimated at ph 3 6 have been shown to improve the rate of metal removal 61 hence the use of acidophilic srb could be an option for the treatment of amd in pbrs under near neutral to basic ph and in the absence of srb activity metals can be removed in the form of oxides and carbonates depending on the orp 10 in addition as temperature decreases srb activity is inhibited and therefore the sulfate reduction rate becomes very low 61 furthermore sulfate and metal concentrations also played an important role during the treatment of mine drainage via srb increases of sulfate and metal concentrations could lead to the inhibition of srb activity and therefore the performance of the treatment could be significantly impaired 61 the main limitation of the application of srb in the treatment of amd and nmd is the sensitivity of srb to low ph and to salinity and temperature which affects the growth of srb and impairs bioreactor performance hence all these aforementioned parameters have to be taken into account while sizing a pbr in addition since mine drainage treatment requires a regular supply of biomass e g c n and p to the reactors for srb activity enhancement especially under low temperature reactive mixtures have to be carefully selected and adequately supplied before the installation of each treatment process to improve the probable use of pbrs to treat ni contaminated nmd in cold climates hrts 1d should be tested and the bioreactors should be allowed to run for at least 2 summers complementary characterizations of nutrient sources including total carbon nitrogen and phosphorus should be carried out to avoid an eventual deficit or decrease over time the use of an engineered srb consortium has also been suggested as a possible option to adapt to adverse environmental conditions at mining sites including conditions of flow temperature and acidity 43 4 conclusion performance of pbrs for the treatment of amd and saline nmd was evaluated in a northern mining context results from the pilot scale field trials showed that despite the high ni removal through reactors pbr amd pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd effluent ni concentrations did not meet environmental requirements however high removal rates of fe and cu were observed and did satisfy the thresholds and cu removal was not affected by the temperature a decrease in ni removal was observed over time for all reactors geochemical equilibrium modeling showed that fe is likely to precipitate in the form of oxides hydroxides and oxy hydroxides while ni was likely to occur in the form of ni oh 2 in the pbr amd reactor sorption onto fe oxy hydroxides for reactor pbr amd and organic matter could also be considered as an important mechanism for ni removal however metal removal in the form of metal sulfides was unlikely to occur in all bioreactors likewise very limited so4 2 was removed from the bioreactors which likely precipitated in the form of gypsum overall the limited performance of the reactors might have been due to the lack of srb activity the use of native srb in the reactive mixtures already adapted to low temperatures and high salinity could be a solution to enhance the development and activity of srb in pbrs which should therefore increase their performance finally the results of this study combined with additional tests will allow optimizing design criteria including selection of minimum operating temperatures and maximum salinity for large scale passive treatment systems at the raglan mine and

13571,efficiency of passive bioreactors pbrs to treat mine drainage acid amd and neutral nmd in northern climates is evaluated using pilot scale pbrs installed at the raglan mine quebec canada three reactors pbr amd pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd were filled with reactive mixtures and operated at hydraulic retention times of 2 5d and 1d for amd and nmd for 48 days 94 days and 44 days respectively the amd quality was 27 6 mg l ni 23 7 mg l fe 2 4 mg l cu and 3186 mg l so4 2 at ph 3 6 while the nmd quality was 23 9 mg l ni 0 06 mg l fe 0 003 mg l cu and 587 mg l so4 2 at ph 7 2 removal efficiencies of the pbr amd reactor were 93 95 vs 53 56 ni at the beginning and end of the tests respectively 96 99 fe and 99 cu in the pbr1 nmd reactor 99 vs 83 ni in 2017 and 2018 respectively was removed while in the pbr2 nmd reactor 95 99 vs 61 83 ni at the beginning vs at the end respectively was removed however all bioreactors failed to meet environmental criteria none of the bioreactors developed favorable conditions for sulfate reducing bacteria srb ni retention was likely mainly governed by sorption mechanisms on organic matter or on fe oxy hydroxides low temperatures combined with salinity may explain the lack of srb growth in the reactors and the absence of so4 2 treatment the treatment of cu was not affected by the low temperatures and the primary mechanism of fe removal in the pbr amd reactor was precipitation in the form of oxy hydroxides keywords mine drainage passive biochemical reactor northern climate salinity nickel 1 introduction the mining industry is considered an essential component of canada s economy with a gross domestic product of 97 billion i e 5 in 2018 1 however despite its socio economic benefits exploitation of mineral resources involves significant risks for the environment such as the contamination of water from mine tailings or waste rock leachate 2 in this context mine water contamination results from chemical and biological reactions that occur when sulfide minerals contained in the solid waste are exposed to both water and oxygen 3 in several cases these biogeochemical reactions generate mine drainage with high metal metalloid and sulfate concentrations that can significantly affect the natural environment including aquatic ecosystems 4 thus once generated mine drainage must be collected and treated prior to its discharge into the environment depending on ore composition and enrichment methods mine drainage can be classified according to its ph as either acid mine drainage amd with ph 6 or neutral mine drainage nmd with ph values mostly between 6 and 9 5 removal mechanisms may differ depending on the quality of the mine drainage in general amd treatment is based on increasing the ph and promoting precipitation co precipitation of metals metalloids while nmd treatment is based on sorption 3 however regardless of the mine drainage quality sulfates can be removed by precipitation reduction and or sorption 3 in closed reclaimed and or abandoned mine sites passive treatment systems are considered a more sustainable alternative and a more attractive economic and environment friendly approach for amd and nmd treatment than active systems 6 7 they consume little energy use natural or residual materials and require little supervision and maintenance in general passive treatment technologies can be classified based on their governing physicochemical and or biochemical processes and include passive biochemical reactors pbrs anoxic oxic limestone drains permeable reactive barriers dispersed alkaline substrates and wetlands 7 8 pbrs are treatment systems that use solid reactive mixtures for the removal of metals and sulfates and in the case of amd increase the ph 9 10 the preferred treatment mechanism in pbrs is the precipitation of metals in the form of metal sulfides following the reduction of sulfate to sulfides hydrogen sulfide under the action of sulfate reducing bacteria srb 10 however metal sulfide precipitation is not the only treatment mechanism involved in pbrs depending on the ph redox conditions metals can also precipitate in the form of carbonates or hydroxides 8 10 sorption ion exchange and complexation with the organic substrate are also other metal removal processes that can occur in a pbr 7 11 besides metal sulfides sulfate can be removed in the form of gypsum and native sulfur 11 14 in general mixtures in pbrs are composed of an inoculum of srb a substrate i e a source of organic carbon as well as nitrogen phosphorous and other nutrients for microorganisms electron donors structural agents for microbial attachment and porosity enhancement and neutralizing agents to increase ph and to produce alkalinity 7 whether applied for amd or nmd treatment the performance of pbrs depends on the substrate depletion rate clogging rates e g biofouling or precipitation and on the specific contaminant removal mechanisms 8 15 for better pbr performance and longevity suitable reactive mixtures must be carefully selected depending on material availability at the mine site mine drainage quality and operating conditions 16 in temperate or semi arid climates pbrs constitute a promising biotechnology for amd and nmd treatment 6 however despite several pbrs installed at various mine sites in northern climates undesirable processes such as decreases in biological activity i e slower growth of srb as well as the formation of water ice have often been encountered 6 17 20 in some cases the sulfate reduction rates via srb were up to 20 times greater at 20 c than at 0 1 c 21 likewise amd treatment at the nickel rim mine site ontario canada showed that sulfate treatment in summer t 16 c was nearly twice as high as in winter t 2 c 22 overall impacts of low temperature on the efficiency of pbrs are caused by the lack of substrate or so4 2 for srb 20 23 25 in addition to the inhibition of so4 2 treatment similar observations have also been noted for metal removal which also decreased at lower temperatures 20 for example zn and cd removal decreased from 90 in summer t 14 18 c to between 20 9 and 39 in winter t 5 c 24 however low temperatures do not systematically reduce the performance of pbrs since other treatment mechanisms such as adsorption on organic matter and on metal oxides as well as precipitation e g as oxides or oxyhydroxides or co precipitation can also lead to metal removal 19 26 in addition it is worth noting that freeze thaw cycles and low temperatures can also control the solubility of secondary minerals particularly carbonates and oxy hydroxides 27 hence due to the growing interest in pbrs for the treatment of mine drainage several studies have been carried out to develop efficient systems at low temperatures some of these studies have recommended the occasional addition of an easily degradable source of organic carbon e g molasses as a substrate for srb 20 24 however in this case pbrs are no longer fully passive but become semi passive other studies suggest installing pbrs at a depth below the freezing point of the soil and covering them with an insulating material to minimize the effects of low temperatures and water freezing on srb activity 17 28 other recommendations have included the use of cold adapted microorganisms such as psychrophiles or cryophiles to maintain srb activity 29 30 for mines operating in northern regions ions contributing to salinity e g na ca2 and cl which are generated while using salts e g nacl and cacl2 as de icing agents could also affect the efficiency of pbrs 6 indeed high salinity can negatively affect the rate of sulfate reduction and metal precipitation because of the increase in osmotic stress on bacterial cells and because of the increase in ion toxicity 31 32 in addition high salinity can also affect the sorption of contaminants on organic matter by creating competition between metals and major ions na ca2 k etc 33 nevertheless under arid semi arid conditions treatment of saline acidic groundwater using pbrs has been shown effective to remove so4 2 and metals 34 35 although the effect of salinity on pbr treatment efficiency is well known in arid semi arid climates its effect in northern climates has not been well documented furthermore the combined effects of high salinity and low temperature on sulfate and metal removal through pbrs are poorly known and need more investigation in addition although biogeochemical processes within pbrs have been well studied under controlled lab scale conditions practical applications of pbrs in cold climates have been limited hence the present work builds on earlier studies that evaluated the potential removal of contaminants from saline nmd and amd at the lab scale using pbrs at low temperature 36 37 using batch tests these past experiments evaluated different reactive mixtures for the treatment of synthetic amd and nmd the results made it possible to select the most efficient reactive mixtures which produced ni and so4 2 removal efficiencies of 91 36 column tests were also carried out with the aim of evaluating the effect of hydraulic retention time hrt and salinity on the treatment efficiency of amd and nmd these column experiments allowed to fix hrts at 2 5 days for the treatment of amd and 1 day for nmd the lab scale testing showed promising results when using pbrs to treat high ni 27 6 5 6 vs 23 9 10 1 mg l and sulfate 3186 616 mg l vs 587 205 mg l concentrations in amd and nmd respectively it is then assumed that the efficiency of laboratory experiments could be transferred to an in situ pilot scale system operating under similar conditions in terms of hrt and reactive mixture under cold climate conditions to treat real amd and nmd building on knowledge gained through the laboratory experiments the current study is a continuation of the investigation through field testing the main objective is to evaluate the performance of experimental field pbrs installed in a northern environment at the raglan glencore mine in northern quebec canada to treat ni rich amd and nmd 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and sampling the raglan mine is a nickel mining complex located in northern québec canada in the nunavik region 61 41 15 n 073 40 41 w fig 1 the mine is situated in a subarctic continuous permafrost zone within the cape smith belt with an average annual temperature of 15 c 5 f a total annual rainfall of 350 mm and 500 cm of snow four underground mines are presently in operation where residues from the concentrators are deposited in a tailings storage facility the waste rocks are temporarily placed in a waste rock pile before being disposed drainage water from certain waste rock piles before treatment has ph values and ni concentrations that do not always meet the environmental standards 38 39 indeed amd from the tailings is collected in a primary basin and treated by active lime neutralization prior to treatment fe cu and ni concentrations in the collected amd exceed the regulation criteria as specified in the quebec provincial regulation d019 and the metal and diamond mining effluent regulations mdmer fe 3 mg l ni 0 5 mg l and cu 0 3 mg l 38 39 the treated water is then pumped to a second basin in which nmd is also collected when the ph and ni concentrations comply with the standards 38 39 water from the second basin is treated to respect regulatory criteria before being released to the environment in addition the mine water pumped from underground to the surface has neutral ph values 6 9 7 4 high salinity and high nickel concentrations up to 68 1 mg l hence the pbrs in this project will be tested to treat two types of contaminated water i e amd and nmd collected in summer 2017 and summer 2018 table 1 2 2 preparation of the reactive mixtures because of on site access difficulties fig 1 reactive mixtures were transported to the raglan mine by plane only wood ash and sewage sludge were collected directly from the mine the reactive mixtures were prepared according to the approach of ben ali et al 36 37 table 2 mixing of materials was done manually in 20 l buckets fig s1 after being prepared the reactive pbr amd mixture was saturated with amd and incubated at room temperature 22 c for one week to initiate acclimatization and establishment of the srb 37 2 3 set up of the on site pbrs and instrumentation four pilot bioreactors 220 l were set up at the mine the first two reactors pbr1 amd and pbr2 amd were installed in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively which aimed to treat the amd however clogging problems due to precipitates from the amd occurred frequently in the feed system of bioreactor pbr1 amd thus data collected from this bioreactor were inconsistent and inaccurate therefore only results from reactor pbr2 amd will be presented and referred to hereafter as pbr amd fig 2 the two other reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd were set up in summer 2017 and 2018 respectively for the treatment of nmd fig 2 field experiments were conducted during summer for 30 120 days during optimal conditions e g when sufficient volumes of water to be treated were available supplying the pilot pbrs in the field with mine drainage amd or nmd was initially planned to be done passively however during construction it turned out that the configuration of the topography was not favorable to the establishment of an efficient upstream gravity feed for the pbrs this situation led to the installation of peristaltic pumps in order to supply the bioreactors with mine drainage the primary constraint encountered during the field tests was the limited available time at the raglan mine the water thaws relatively late in the season during june and freezes relatively early mid september the short thaw period had the effect of limiting the duration of the tests a 5 cm layer of gravel was placed at the bottom of each reactor barrel to prevent possible clogging problems in each reactor barrel the layer of gravel was covered with a geotextile on which was deposited the appropriate reactive mixture fig 2 the bioreactors were fed using masterflex peristaltic pumps with downward vertical flow using the hydraulic parameters described in table 3 2 4 analytical methods leachate collected from the three bioreactors was analyzed for ph electric conductivity ec redox potential orp alkalinity acidity temperature sulfate sulfides and total metals 40 41 the ph was measured using a fisherbrand accumet multimeter equipped with a single junction electrode and an ag agcl reference cell measurements of the orp were carried out using a portable redox tester orptestr 10 with a double junction ag agcl polymer sensor alkalinity and acidity were determined by titration with a fully automated metrohm mati07 titrator combined with an aquatrode ph electrode 41 temperatures were measured and recorded with probes connected to a decagon em50 log data logger box installed in the center of the bioreactors sulfate method 8051 and sulfide method 10254 concentrations were determined with a hach dr900 portable multi parameter colorimeter total metal concentrations were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes perkin elmer 3000 dv on filtered 0 45 μm and acidified with 2 v v of hno3 samples the phreeqc v3 geochemical code with the wateq4f database was used to evaluate the eventual metal and sulfate removal mechanisms based on treated water chemistry from the pbr amd and pbr2 nmd reactors further details including characterization of the initial materials treatment efficiency and experiment parameters are provided elsewhere 36 37 at the end of the tests the reactors were dismantled fig s2 and the spent reactive mixtures were stored in hermetically sealed bags at 4 c prior to characterization mineralogy and microstructure of the spent reactive mixtures pbr amd and pbr2 nmd were then analyzed with a hitachi s 3500 n scanning electron microscope sem equipped with an energy dispersive spectroscopy eds x ray probe 20 kv 140 a 25 kpa and 15 mm prior to their analysis with sem edx the solids were dehydrated at 40 c for 48 h then deposited on supports metal studs using double sided adhesive tape and metallized chemical and mineralogical compositions were then analyzed with the sem edx inca oxford energy 450 equipped with a data processor total metal concentrations of the spent reactive mixtures were analyzed by icp aes after acidic hno3 br2 hf hcl digestion bacteriological analyses were carried out on the reactive mixtures before and after the treatment of amd and nmd enumeration of srb in the solids was performed using the most probable number method d4412 84 42 a detailed description of this method is presented in the supplementary material a statistical analysis was performed using the nonparametric spearman s rho test significance level was p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 amd treatment 3 1 1 physicochemical analyses t ph orp ec acidity and alkalinity results showed a significant and rapid increase of ph to 7 0 8 0 at the outlet of the pbr amd reactor over the entire monitoring period despite the initial low ph values of the inflow amd 3 3 4 2 fig 3 overall ph values respected the canadian discharge limits ph of 6 0 9 5 as specified in the mdmer 39 the increase in alkalinity up to 160 mg l caco3 rs 0 89 p value 0 040 and ph were due to neutralization through wood ash which contains high amounts of carbonates i e calcite and dolomite 78 and portlandite 2 and which also has a high paste ph 11 6 12 4 fig 3 table s1 as expected acidity was relatively low in the pbr amd reactor during the experiment 20 mg l caco3 with an exception on day 42 when a particularly high acidity was observed 133 mg l caco3 fig 3 orp values decreased from a range of 368 424 mv in the amd inflow to slightly lower values of 86 185 mv in reactor pbr amd which still indicated oxidizing conditions the ec values slightly increased in reactor pbr amd up to 2 5 ms cm which could probably be explained by the increase of the total dissolved solids originating from the reactive mixture nonetheless this range of ec was comparable to what was found in the literature 43 finally temperatures fluctuated over the monitoring period between 0 2 and 12 0 c with an average of 5 3 c in reactor pbr amd and tended to decrease over time 3 1 2 evolution of ni fe cu al and sulfate concentrations 3 1 2 1 sulfates almost no difference was observed in so4 2 concentrations between the inflowing amd 2 000 4 800 mg l and outflow from the pbr amd reactor 2 700 4 400 mg l suggesting limited or no effective so4 2 treatment limited increases of so4 2 concentrations were noted in the pbr amd reactor in comparison with the amd inflow which could probably be attributed to leaching of the so4 2 initially present in the reaction mixture fig 4 in addition so4 2 variation has almost the same tendency as ec rs 0 87 p value 0 010 limited or no so4 2 removal and the positive orp values suggest that a sulfate reducing mechanism was not favored and therefore metal sulfide minerals could not precipitate this observation was consistent with the s2 concentrations in reactor pbr amd not presented that were below the detection limit 0 01 mg l during the experiment these findings are probably due to the low hrt and the low temperatures recorded during the test period indeed similar observations were also recently noted during lab scale tests where so4 2 removal was almost absent when the temperature was lowered to 5 c while so4 2 removal 99 was high when the initial temperature of 22 c was maintained for three months before decreasing to 5 c 37 in other studies tests performed at room temperature 22 c showed srb activity after 42 days indicating relatively high so4 2 and metal treatment efficiency relative to the results when the srb were incubated at 10 c and 4 c 44 this highlights the importance of the initial temperature of the pbr and the incubation period of the inoculum to trigger and promote the sulfate reducing process finally at the end of the experiment the slight decrease of so4 2 concentrations could be due to precipitation in the form of gypsum favored by the particularly high so4 2 concentrations in amd up to 4 800 mg l fig 4 3 1 2 2 iron the fe removal rate in the pbr amd reactor was greater than 95 rs 0 74 p value 0 056 over the entire monitoring period from initial concentrations of 1 5 50 6 mg l to the final 0 06 0 30 mg l fig 4 under the ph 7 0 8 0 and orp 86 185 mv conditions in the same reactor fe removal mechanisms are more related to precipitation as hydroxides and oxy hydroxides resulting from the increase of ph rs 0 74 p value 0 056 than to the precipitation in the form of fe sulfides 11 sorption onto the surface of organic matter sawdust and compost and wood ash could also contribute to fe removal 30 45 47 3 1 2 3 copper cu concentrations in the amd were high 1 2 3 0 mg l over the entire follow up period but were 400 1000 times lower in the pbr amd reactor rs 0 71 fig 4 indeed the cu removal rate was greater than 99 7 leaving cu concentrations compliant with the monthly limits of mdmer 0 3 mg l as ph increases cu is likely to precipitate in the form of hydroxides similar findings were reported where cu removal was not affected by temperature 5 c vs 22 c with a removal rate of 97 37 similar to fe cu removal was probably due to co precipitation and sorption mechanisms moreover fe hydroxide could promote the removal of cu by co precipitation and by sorption the ability of fe hydroxides to co precipitate with other metals and act as a secondary sorbent phase of cu has been reported previously 48 it is noted that sorption onto the compost surface is a well known mechanism for cu removal under non sulfate reducing conditions 49 50 3 1 2 4 nickel results showed significant ni removal 91 95 at the beginning of the experiment where ni concentrations were between 1 3 and 3 2 mg l vs 20 mg l in amd fig 4 these findings were consistent with column lab tests where ni removal remained high 97 even at 5 c 37 however despite high ni removal ni concentrations from the pbr amd reactor were above the acceptable limit 0 5 mg l over the entire monitoring period since sulfate reduction was not favored in the pbr amd reactor ni removal in the form of sulfide is therefore not expected to occur hence the probable main mechanism of ni removal is precipitation at high ph rs 0 90 p value 0 006 in addition sorption on organic matter and co precipitation with fe hydroxides could also be potential mechanisms for ni retention indeed ni removal could be controlled by fe oxy hydroxides via sorption mechanisms 51 and co precipitation or substitution of fe in fe oxy hydroxide crystalline structures 52 moreover ni could also be sorbed onto wood ash 53 and peat surfaces 54 the ni removal rate decreased over time rs 0 82 p value 0 023 with a noticeable drop observed on day 39 53 56 competition between fe cu and ni ions for sorption sites could also explain the less efficient treatment of ni compared to fe and cu 55 the decrease in system temperature could explain this decline as the ni adsorption process on organic matter is endothermic and therefore less favorable at low temperature 56 3 1 2 5 aluminum despite its high concentration up to 12 mg l in amd high al removal rates 95 7 99 2 were observed during the test the lowest al concentration 0 01 mg l was noted at neutral to slightly alkaline ph 7 0 8 0 rs 0 85 p value 0 014 reflecting its precipitation overall al retention was mainly related to the precipitation of amorphous hydroxides at ph 5 12 it is worth noting that over the entire duration of the experiment no system clogging was observed i e with almost no change of inflow and outflow fluxes 3 1 3 saturation indices and potential metal removal mechanisms saturation indices si on days 4 25 and 45 indicated oversaturation of the leachate with respect to fe oxy hydroxide minerals such as fe oh 3 goethite α feooh hematite α fe2o3 and magnetite fe3o4 during the entire period table s2 results were consistent with high fe removal 95 through the pbr amd reactor however negative saturation indices with respect to fe sulfides such as pyrite fes2 greigite fe3s4 and mackinawite fes indicated that these minerals did not reach saturation and results were thus consistent with the low or negligible rates of so4 2 removal table s2 these observations were expected since conditions for promoting srb activity were not favorable at the same time the si of gypsum was very close to 0 suggesting a metastable phase table s2 for ni ni oh 2 was oversaturated during the entire period with an increasing trend in addition the contribution of sorption mechanisms for ni i e onto organic matter or fe oxy hydroxide surfaces especially at the start of the treatment when sorption sites are more available could also be considered as for the case of fe the si of millerite nis was undersaturated which suggested the absence of ni sulfide bearing minerals for cu regardless of the type of the precipitates oxides hydroxides sulfides etc all cu bearing minerals were undersaturated and therefore cu retention could only be attributed to sorption mechanisms al could be removed as basaluminite al4 so4 oh 105 h2o alunite kal3 so4 2 oh 6 boehmite alo oh or gibbsite al oh 3 notably precipitation of these al bearing minerals had also been reported during amd treatment 13 14 57 3 1 4 characteristics of the spent residues the results of the srb enumeration showed markedly lower bacterial densities 40 180 103 cells 100 ml in the spent reactive mixture compared to published lab scale tests where significantly higher srb densities were observed 1600 103 cells 100 ml 37 the observed differences between the column tests and the pilot field scale test suggest that establishment of the srb was favored only in the columns indeed the 22 c starting temperature of the columns had been maintained for 3 months and would have favored the establishment of srb while in the case of the pilot field test temperatures were low over the entire testing period mean t 5 3 c except for the first week overall results of the srb densities in the field test were consistent with the so4 2 and orp data which suggests that sulfate reduction was not favoured in the pbr amd reactor due to the high fe concentrations in the amd source water up to 50 6 mg l table 1 fe content was 1 4 times higher in the top than in the middle and bottom of the pbr amd reactor with an increase of 30 compared to the initial reactive mixture a retention of fe in the form of oxy hydroxides as predicted by the geochemical modeling can explain these observations in addition cu content was twice as high in the top of the pbr amd reactor as in the middle and bottom respectively with an increase of 50 compared to the initial reactive mixture similar observations were also found for ni which was 4 to 6 times higher at the top than in the middle and bottom respectively with an increase of 50 with respect to the initial reactive mixture the final ni content in the middle and bottom layers of the pbr amd reactor was lower than its initial content leaching of ni could probably explain these findings the increase of ca and s content in the pbr amd reactor could probably be explained by their precipitation in the form of gypsum as previously predicted by the geochemical modeling overall high metal content in the top layer of this reactor could be due to inflow of the contaminant loaded amd while feeding the treatment unit mineralogical investigations using meb eds showed precipitation of fe oxides hydroxides fig 5 as the ph increased fe precipitates assumed to be ferric hydroxides were visible as yellow and yellow brown mineral staining in the pbr amd reactor as predicted by the geochemical modeling fig s3 findings were in agreement with previous pbr experiments conducted under oxidizing and reducing conditions where fe oxides and oxy hydroxides were in the form of hematite goethite and magnetite 13 14 calcite and silicates were also present and originate from the reactive mixture 3 2 nmd treatment 3 2 1 physicochemical analyses t ph orp conductivity acidity and alkalinity results showed no significant change in ph between the nmd source water and effluent from the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors where values were near neutral to slightly basic 6 9 7 4 fig 6 the slight decrease in ph values from the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors in summer 2018 is probably explained by the high amount of sphagnum peat moss 55 w w in the reactive mixtures which could naturally acidify the water 58 similar trends were also observed for orp where almost no differences were noted between the source nmd 228 17 mv and outflow from reactors pbr1 nmd 212 7 mv and pbr2 nmd 222 23 mv which indicated the presence of oxidizing conditions 170 260 mv ec values remained very similar and tended to increase in summer 2017 rs 0 82 p value 0 09 but were still slightly higher in the pbr1 nmd reactor compared to the initial nmd fig 6 this trend could be explained by the increase of the total dissolved solids originating from the reactive mixture however in summer 2018 ec values in the nmd were only high up to 25 ms cm at the start of the experiment and showed a downward trend over time rs 0 75 p value 0 01 between 70 90 days ec values remained lower 7 8 ms cm than those observed in reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd up to 18 ms cm alkalinity values increased over time and were higher in the pbr1 nmd rs 0 75 p value 0 05 and pbr2 nmd reactors rs 0 99 p value 0 compared to the initial nmd fig 6 for the case of the pbr amd reactor the increase in the alkalinity compared to reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd is attributed to the wood ash which contains a high amount of calcite 77 9 table s1 acidity values were only low for the initial nmd and for reactor pbr2 nmd 60 mg l caco3 rs 0 83 p value 0 003 while high values were noted in reactor pbr1 nmd in summer 2018 with a sharp increase up to 220 mg l caco3 leaching of decomposed organic matter after several freezing thawing cycles between summer 2017 and summer 2018 could probably account for these results finally temperatures fluctuated between 0 7 c and 11 8 c average 5 1 c over the monitoring period and tended to decrease over time rs 0 40 p value 6e 05 fig 6 the low recorded temperatures in the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors could have inhibited the activity of srb thus preventing reducing conditions from developing 3 2 2 evolution of ni ca and sulfate concentrations since fe and cu concentrations in the nmd source water were low and close to detection limits 0 003 0 1 mg l only concentrations of ca ni and so4 2 are presented in this section 3 2 2 1 sulfate in summer 2017 results showed that so4 2 concentrations in water from the pbr1 nmd reactor were slightly higher 400 710 mg l than those from the nmd source 190 560 mg l the increase of so4 2 concentrations from the pbr1 nmd reactor rs 0 70 p value 0 188 can be attributed to the leaching of so4 2 contained in the reaction mixture i e peat in summer 2018 almost the same trends were observed for reactor pbr2 nmd rs 0 90 p value 0 0004 in addition some so4 2 retention was observed at day 60 fig 7 given its low concentration 600 700 mg l so4 2 sorption on the limestone could be the probable retention mechanism 59 overall results showed that almost no retention of so4 2 was observed in the treatment system indicating the absence of metal sulfide bearing minerals high orp values 190 mv fig 6 low recorded temperatures fig 6 and a low hrt 1 day table 3 could probably account for these findings which had the effect of inhibiting the srb activity and therefore the establishment of reducing conditions in the reactors for so4 2 treatment these results were inconsistent with previous studies that showed so4 2 removal attributed to sulfate reduction during nmd treatment in cold climates 23 24 in the study by 24 several conditions were met to promote the activity of srb 1 native srb had already been established in the system 2 the high hrt 14 days and 3 the use of a liquid carbon source molasses to support srb activity 3 2 2 2 calcium in general ca concentration trends were very similar to ec rs 0 97 p value 0 fig 7 high ca concentrations in the reactive mixture of reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd were attributed to the dissolution of calcite which was present in the wood ash and which increased ph 3 2 2 3 nickel except for the first sample i e at day 4 the ni removal rate in reactor pbr1 nmd was greater than 99 over the entire follow up period rs 0 60 p value 0 4 summer 2017 fig 7 until day 4 the hrt of the effluent in reactor pbr1 nmd was clearly less than 1 day which could probably explain the low ni removal rate at day 4 26 8 fig 7 despite high ni concentrations in the nmd 4 2 45 6 mg l low values were observed from day 4 in the pbr1 nmd reactor and which met the regulatory criteria mdmer 0 5 mg l in parallel with increasing ph and absence of sulfate removal ni is likely to precipitate in the form of oxides hydroxides in the summer of 2018 after restarting the pbr1 nmd reactor the ni removal rate was low 26 6 fig 7 the alteration of the reactive mixture in reactor pbr1 nmd due to freeze thaw action could potentially explain the drop in ni removal efficiency observed just after the restart in summer 2018 in parallel when reactor pbr1 nmd was restarted in the summer of 2018 the reactive mixture in the reactor was not yet fully thawed since the center of the reactor had remained frozen and therefore not accessible for the nmd fig s4 hence preferential flow paths could probably be created then at day 82 ni was released 29 from the reactor pbr1 nmd indeed the increase of ni leaching from this reactor was consistent with the increase of ca concentrations fig 7 the dissolution of calcite could probably account for these findings since calcite could adsorb divalent metals on its surface in particular ni 60 at the end of the experiment an increase in the ni removal rate 82 8 was observed in reactor pbr1 nmd but it remained lower than the removal rates observed in summer 2017 in summer 2018 ni concentrations were above the threshold fixed by the mdmer 0 5 mg l for reactor pbr2 nmd ni concentrations fluctuated at the start of the test 0 3 2 0 mg l but increased over time until the end of the monitoring period and did not meet the regulation limits fig 7 overall since srb activity was not favorable as previously discussed ni retention in reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd was probably due to sorption 3 2 3 saturation indices and potential metal removal mechanisms calculated sis on days 4 26 and 46 indicated that except for day 46 all ni bearing minerals carbonates hydroxides sulfides etc were undersaturated and therefore ni retention could be primarily attributed to sorption on organic matter at day 46 ni oh 2 was oversaturated table s4 and therefore was likely to precipitate in reactor pbr2 nmd for gypsum similar to the case of reactor pbr amd its si was very close to 0 indicating that its formation and dissolution rates were quasi similar 3 2 4 characteristics of the spent residues the srb counts showed low bacterial densities 7 5 x 103 cells 100 ml table s5 in the spent reactive mixture that reflected limited or no sulfate reduction results were consistent with the high orp values and low so4 2 concentrations which also suggested negligible srb activity the combined effect of the high salinity of nmd the low temperatures and the low hrt would explain why srb did not develop in the bioreactors s content was 1 7 1 9 times higher in the top than in the middle and bottom of reactor pbr1 nmd respectively with an increase of 30 compared to the initial content similar trends were also observed in reactor pbr2 nmd where the s content was 1 6 times higher in the top than in the middle and bottom with an increase of 38 4 compared to the initial content a probable retention of s in the form of gypsum as predicted by the geochemical modeling can explain these observations ca content slightly decreased in the top of reactors pbr1 nmd 12 2 and pbr2 nmd 3 1 in comparison with the initial values 56 1 56 3 g kg in addition ca content was lower at the top of reactors pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd 50 g kg and 54 6 g kg respectively than in the middle 57 5 g kg for both and bottom 59 9 g kg and 71 3 g kg layers table s5 the decrease of ca content in the top layers of the reactors can be explained by the consumption of calcite to neutralize the slight acidity 6 1 27 1 mg l caco3 table 1 of the nmd which hence increased ph therefore the increase of ca content in both the middle and bottom layers could probably be explained by the precipitation of ca bearing minerals e g gypsum in addition despite low cu content in the nmd 0 003 mg l table 1 a significant increase was observed in both reactors pbr1 nmd 62 5 and pbr2 nmd 80 respectively likewise similar trends were also observed for the ni content which also increased significantly in the top layers 93 9 for reactor pbr1 nmd and 20 4 for reactor pbr2 nmd respectively sem eds analyses showed the presence of c o ca na al si cl fe and ti originating from the peat other metals e g ni and cu were immobilized in this peat probably via sorption since precipitation was unlikely to occur as predicted by the geochemical modeling sorption of cu and ni onto the peat has already been discussed previously 50 58 high magnification images fig 8 highlight the presence of a hollow porous structure of hyaline cells in the form of arrows that confer good sorption and cation exchange capacities in addition amorphous minerals of ca o and fe were also found which contained small amounts of ni and cu 3 3 general discussion all three bioreactors failed to meet amd and nmd treatment objectives at the raglan mine in reactor pbr amd high ni removal 82 94 was observed at the beginning while lower values 53 56 were found at the end table s6 moreover ni removal produced a cumulative precipitation of 1 700 mg ni in pbr amd at a rate 480 mg ni d except for the period between 15 08 30 08 similar trends were also observed for reactor pbr2 nmd but with a higher removal efficiency where 92 97 of the ni removal occurred at the beginning while lower values 42 78 were found at the end table s6 ni removal gave a cumulative precipitation of 65 500 mg ni in reactor pbr2 nmd at a rate 1200 mg ni d except for the period between 31 07 and 13 08 since fe and cu concentrations were low in the nmd only fe and cu removal rates for reactor pbr amd were presented in table s6 high fe 99 0 and cu 99 9 removal efficiencies were observed during the treatment period which corresponds to 19 800 mg fe at a rate of up to 1000 mg fe d and up to 2 150 mg cu at a mean rate of 51 mg cu d respectively overall none of the reactors pbr amd pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd developed favorable conditions for srb activity the absence of so4 2 removal and the persistent oxidizing conditions suggest that the sulfate reduction process did not occur in these bioreactors or at least was negligible and hence the removal of metals as metal sulfides was unlikely to occur because of the low recorded temperatures 5 c on average in the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors the high salinity of the nmd could also have had a negative impact on the srb population growth the low hrts the low temperatures and the presence of salinity for the nmd may explain the reasons for which the establishment and the development of srb were not favored in the absence of srb activity the primary mechanisms governing the removal of metals in the pbr amd reactor are 1 precipitation as oxy hydroxides and carbonates related to ph changes 2 co precipitation with oxy hydroxides and 3 sorption on organic matter the lower removal efficiency of ni in the pbr amd reactor compared to fe and cu removal can be explained by the competition between ca fe cu and ni for the sorption sites of organic matter since the bonds formed between cu and fe with organic matter are stronger than ni which is still more mobile 54 in the pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd reactors ni removal is mainly governed by sorption mechanisms on the organic matter of the reactive mixture e g peat and wood ash the decrease in the ni removal rate in all bioreactors over time can be attributed to the gradual saturation of the active sorption sites despite the absence of s srb can grow and form syntrophic associations with methanogens or hydrogen scavengers to improve their survival even at low sulfate concentrations 61 in addition most srb have optimal growth conditions in the ph range 6 ph 8 hence outside this range a deterioration in srb activity and metal removal capacity is usually noted and an addition of alkaline materials during amd treatment would be required 61 however some acidophilic srb acclimated at ph 3 6 have been shown to improve the rate of metal removal 61 hence the use of acidophilic srb could be an option for the treatment of amd in pbrs under near neutral to basic ph and in the absence of srb activity metals can be removed in the form of oxides and carbonates depending on the orp 10 in addition as temperature decreases srb activity is inhibited and therefore the sulfate reduction rate becomes very low 61 furthermore sulfate and metal concentrations also played an important role during the treatment of mine drainage via srb increases of sulfate and metal concentrations could lead to the inhibition of srb activity and therefore the performance of the treatment could be significantly impaired 61 the main limitation of the application of srb in the treatment of amd and nmd is the sensitivity of srb to low ph and to salinity and temperature which affects the growth of srb and impairs bioreactor performance hence all these aforementioned parameters have to be taken into account while sizing a pbr in addition since mine drainage treatment requires a regular supply of biomass e g c n and p to the reactors for srb activity enhancement especially under low temperature reactive mixtures have to be carefully selected and adequately supplied before the installation of each treatment process to improve the probable use of pbrs to treat ni contaminated nmd in cold climates hrts 1d should be tested and the bioreactors should be allowed to run for at least 2 summers complementary characterizations of nutrient sources including total carbon nitrogen and phosphorus should be carried out to avoid an eventual deficit or decrease over time the use of an engineered srb consortium has also been suggested as a possible option to adapt to adverse environmental conditions at mining sites including conditions of flow temperature and acidity 43 4 conclusion performance of pbrs for the treatment of amd and saline nmd was evaluated in a northern mining context results from the pilot scale field trials showed that despite the high ni removal through reactors pbr amd pbr1 nmd and pbr2 nmd effluent ni concentrations did not meet environmental requirements however high removal rates of fe and cu were observed and did satisfy the thresholds and cu removal was not affected by the temperature a decrease in ni removal was observed over time for all reactors geochemical equilibrium modeling showed that fe is likely to precipitate in the form of oxides hydroxides and oxy hydroxides while ni was likely to occur in the form of ni oh 2 in the pbr amd reactor sorption onto fe oxy hydroxides for reactor pbr amd and organic matter could also be considered as an important mechanism for ni removal however metal removal in the form of metal sulfides was unlikely to occur in all bioreactors likewise very limited so4 2 was removed from the bioreactors which likely precipitated in the form of gypsum overall the limited performance of the reactors might have been due to the lack of srb activity the use of native srb in the reactive mixtures already adapted to low temperatures and high salinity could be a solution to enhance the development and activity of srb in pbrs which should therefore increase their performance finally the results of this study combined with additional tests will allow optimizing design criteria including selection of minimum operating temperatures and maximum salinity for large scale passive treatment systems at the raglan mine and

13572,dyes are recalcitrant organic compounds that generate environmental damage heterogeneous fenton like catalysts catalytic systems using reusable solid state catalysts as an alternative for fe2 in solution have gained widespread attention in dye removal this article reviews and discusses the catalytic activity and stability enhancement in fenton like processes the reported strategies to improve performance were coating and functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles substitution of magnetite with transition metals as well as the use of organic supports with a focus on biomass derivatives the precursors and the synthetic routes of iron oxide nanoparticles can be adjusted to tune the properties of resulting solids hence the common techniques applied in the synthesis and characterization of nanosized iron oxides were briefly summarized besides the application and efficiency of ionzymes iron oxides nanozymes in azo and anthraquinone dye removal were also analyzed highlighting the synergistic effect between adsorption and fenton like processes the knowledge to apply ionzymes in the remediation of colored effluents is still in continuous development due to several unsolved problems the main challenges to overcome are the acidic ph as an optimal reaction condition the dissolution of metal ions in the reaction medium the deactivation of catalysts and the generation of contaminating by products finally an obstacle identified in the process output was the disposal of exhausted catalysts and adsorbents these could be applied in further remediation of other contaminants this will imply a huge innovation effort to minimize the resulting waste and to simultaneously reduce the consumption of raw material in another process keywords ionzyme dye advanced oxidation process nanoparticle wastewater treatment 1 introduction the contamination of freshwater bodies due to industrial development economic activities and rapid population growth has become a global critical issue over the past few decades 1 complex effluents are generated by industries such as textile cosmetic pharmaceutical paper food among others 2 textile industries are the main source of dyed wastewater 3 the resulting effluents acquire significant importance due to their high content of synthetic organic compounds such as dyes surfactants and persistent molecules as well as metal salts 4 textile effluents are commonly highly colored and they have high chemical cod and biological demands of oxygen bod about 15 of the total dye is lost in the dyeing process hence the textile industries discharging approximately 1 000 000 kg year of dyes in their effluents 5 dyes are colorful natural or synthetic substances which have been used by humans for several applications 6 they are organic compounds consisting of chromophores no2 no nn co cs cc etc and auxochromes oh nh2 nhr nr2 cl cooh etc 2 7 the chromophores are responsible for imparting color to dyes the auxochromes enhance the color intensity or influence the dye solubility there are more than 100 000 kinds of dyes 1 60 70 of them correspond with azo ones 2 6 azo dyes are characterized by having complex and stable structures due to the combination of azo groups with aromatic rings 7 8 which hinder its biodegradation according to easton 1995 the second most important class after azo dyes corresponds to anthraquinone compounds which represents 15 of total dye 9 it is expected that the global dyes and pigments market size reach usd 49 1 billion by 2027 and the textile application dominates the market being the reactive and disperse dyes the most demanded ones 10 the manufacturing or processing operations release considerable amounts of insufficiently treated or untreated effluents into water bodies and exert negative impact on aquatic ecosystems 1 some of these undesirable effects include turbidity eutrophication aesthetic problems and aggravation of aquatic life 11 dyes impede the passage of sunlight 8 reducing the photosynthesis with the consequent decrease of dissolved oxygen in natural waters 12 furthermore the population s health is put at risk due to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of dyes 13 14 therefore the development of efficient processes capable of producing effluents which do not exceed the permitted limits of pollutants is urgently needed these processes must fulfill certain requirements to respond to the 12 principles of green chemistry which have been defined as the design of chemical products and procedures which allow reducing and eliminating the use and synthesis of hazardous substances 15 such requirements include among others environmental safety low cost and efficiency to remove large amounts of dyes in a short time span 16 the removal of complex molecules of dyes from wastewater has been done through several techniques such as adsorption 17 18 coagulation flocculation 11 19 ultra and nanofiltration membranes 20 21 chemical oxidation 22 and biological methods using enzymes 23 table 1 presents advantages and disadvantages of the main methods of treatment for dye removal some treatments are efficient but their prohibitive costs of investment and operation or the generation of secondary waste impose limitations for its large scale application 24 25 additionally improper treatment could lead to the generation of intermediaries which are more toxic than the original dyes 26 therefore the main objective of several recent published manuscripts was the removal of these recalcitrant dyes by effective means adsorption method involves the use of suitable material to remove pollutants from the aqueous medium it is considered as one of the most practical options since it has a lower initial cost simplicity of design simple operation and insensibility to toxic substances 27 this method is highly dependent on the nature and magnitude of adsorbent adsorbate interaction hence it is influenced by factors such as type of adsorbent adsorbent area particle size effluent ph temperature salts present in the wastewater dye dosage stirring speed and contact time 28 29 considerable efforts have been made to obtain inexpensive and effective adsorbents however due to the complex chemical structures of the dyes its removal by adsorption might not be completely efficient besides the process implies moving the dyes from one phase to another which may turn into a waste 24 consequently the adsorbent can be either regenerated by often environmentally incompatible procedures or discarded as waste leading to serious environmental issues 30 31 advanced oxidation processes aops have proven to be very effective methods in comparison with others to wastewater treatment 32 33 aop systems are considered environmentally sustainable provided that the energy consumption is low 34 conventional fenton reaction occurs in a homogeneous solution 35 36 in this reaction the fe2 ions are which accomplish the role of generating hydroxyl radicals oh whose high oxidizing power can completely mineralize complex organic molecules ideally particularly non biodegradable dyes 37 those processes which employed oh as oxidizing agent are widely referred to as hr aops despite being effective and selective the process also shows limitations as high dosage of the catalyst about 50 80 ppm of fe2 high consumption of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio 9 1 in optimal conditions and operation only at low ph 2 0 4 0 in addition they may present difficulty in catalyst recovery and generation of a ferric hydroxide sludge as contaminant sub product due to the excess iron dissolved in the solution 38 41 besides most of the textile effluents are alkaline not acid 2 the treatment and disposal of the iron sludge can represent up to 10 50 of the total operating cost 42 furthermore the requirement of a highly acid ph implies an increment in the associated costs since the process needs a ph adjustment before and after of the reaction 43 among aops fenton like and conventional fenton have been widely researched in the dyed effluent remediation 44 45 the generation of reactive oxygen species mainly oh from h2o2 is a fundamental principle of hr aops the oh is one of the strongest oxidant agents e 2 73 2 8 v these active radicals are capable of degrading all types of complex organic compounds present in wastewater into simpler organic compounds and might even achieve complete mineralization of them obtaining co2 and h2o 31 46 there are numerous reports of aops which use sulfate radical so4 e 2 5 3 1 v as oxidizing agent commonly denominated sr aops 47 48 these radicals have a high oxidation potential and considerable half life period react selectively toward organic compounds with non saturated bonds and aromatic π electrons and operate in a wide range of ph 49 50 however an important aspect which requires to be assessed is the possible generation of process specific by products mainly due to the release of sulfate ions since in this case the effluents would need additional treatment 50 51 in order to avoid the shortcomings of homogeneous fenton reaction intensive efforts have been directed to develop low cost and environmentally sustainable treatments seeking their application in large scale effluent remediation with the advance of nanotechnology during the last decades nanomaterials have raised great interest due to their capability of being applied to aops 25 the use of a solid in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo or heterogeneous fenton oxidation and in oxidation by so4 constitutes a promising alternative for dyed effluent treatment 40 42 the heterogeneous catalyst must be inexpensive with low leaching of transition metals operational for a wide ph range and with suitable catalytic activity 47 magnetic nanoparticles mnps mainly ferrites are promising for industrial scale polluted water treatment due to their tailored size straightforward composition low cost environmental compatibility magnetic behavior and surface functional properties 52 55 magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 nps with catalytic behavior similar to horseradish peroxidase hrp were first discovered by gao et al 56 the nanomaterials with enzyme like characteristics have been defined as nanozymes since then research studies regarding the use of fe3o4 based nanozymes as mimetics of the enzyme peroxidase have been widely developed several reviews have analyzed the synthesis functionalization and catalytic performance of fe3o4 based nanoscale systems 57 59 the magnetic behavior of fe3o4 nps offers the possibility of recovery by applying an external magnetic field 60 hence since additionally the fe3o4 nps exhibit robust peroxidase like activity are considered dual functional solids 61 besides fe3o4 nps have advantages such as low toxicity and economic viability which make them a suitable alternative to protein counterparts in fenton like processes to remove organic contaminants 62 however the use of only fe3o4 nps often shows a low catalytic activity accordingly several researchers have studied strategies to improve the efficiency of iron oxides in the degradation of pollutant molecules the purpose is to minimize negative effects of the processes on the environment and water qualities among these strategies structural modifications coating and functionalization of nps and utilization of varied materials as supports have been explored even more the problem of partial solubilization in water and the loss of iron to the solution is a serious drawback that needs solution through innovation the aim of this review was to present up to date information about the strategies to improve fe3o4 based nanomaterials activity and stability used as nanozymes in the fenton like processes to remove azo and anthraquinone dyes the precursors and the synthetic routes can be adjusted to tune the properties of resulting solids for this reason the common techniques employed in the synthesis and characterization of nanosized iron oxides were briefly summarized in addition the application and efficiency of fe3o4 based nanozymes in azo and anthraquinone dye removal was analyzed finally the challenges to be solved for the application of ionzymes in the remediation of colored effluents were presented the main dyes mentioned in the reports were summarized in table 2 2 structural and magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles iron oxides are characterized for their vast abundance in the earth and widely used due to their low cost they are non toxic materials with abundant distribution in nature in the form of various oxides the most common iron oxides are magnetite fe3o4 maghemite γ fe2o3 and hematite α fe2o3 67 68 the crystalline structure of iron oxides is formed by close packed arrays of anions oxygen in which the interstices are partially filled with cations fe ii or and fe iii in octahedral or tetrahedral coordination ferrite nps have the formula ab2o4 where a and b correspond to divalent and b correspond to trivalent cations respectively 69 in the fe3o4 since its structure is cubic inverse spinel the tetrahedral sites only contain fe iii ions while the octahedral sites are occupied by both fe iii and fe ii ions 38 70 71 specifically the inverse spinel crystal structure with a cubic unit cell of the fe3o4 has 32 oxygen ions arranged in a close packed array there are eight fe ii and eight fe iii ions in the octahedral sites while eight fe iii are occupying the tetrahedral sites the fe3o4 presents magnetic behavior since the octahedral sites contain equal numbers of fe2 and fe3 ions while the tetrahedral sites are filled only by fe3 ions since the number of fe3 ions is the same at both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites and the magnetic spin orientations of all a site ions being arranged in parallel and opposite directions to magnetic spin orientations of all b site ions the magnetic moments cancel each other out then the total net magnetization is due to the fe2 cations only 72 one of the most interesting aspects of nanotechnology is the possibility to obtain new properties when the size is nanometric particles smaller than 100 nm are called nanoparticles 73 at room temperature the fe3o4 in bulk is ferrimagnetic while the fe3o4 with size below to 6 8 nm is superparamagnetic 74 75 therefore the magnetic properties are not only related to the composition of nanomaterials but also to particle size 76 77 the coercivity is highly dependent on the size of nps as the particle diameter decreases the coercivity increases up to a specific value here all the magnetic spins are aligned and hence the magnetization is higher 78 however at a diameter smaller than a certain critical value coercivity goes down to zero this occurs since the magnetic moments of the fe atoms are randomly oriented due to thermal energy canceling each other out therefore the fe3o4 shows superparamagnetic behavior which constitutes an advantage since it allows their recovery through an external magnetic field 79 iron oxides nps ionps have the potential to be applied in multiple disciplines as medicine 80 analytical chemistry and environmental applications 81 mixed valent iron oxides since containing both fe iii and fe ii in their structure have the ability to affect the mobility toxicity and redox transformation of several organic and inorganic pollutants 72 spinel ferrites including fe3o4 possess superparamagnetic properties at nano scale low toxicity large surface area tunable surface high thermal and chemical stability and modest chemical composition therefore they have been considered potential adsorbents and catalysts in environmental remediation strategies 71 3 synthesis and characterization of magnetite nanoparticles the properties and performance of nanozymes are defined by several factors and in turn these are related to the synthetic method employed ghosh et al 75 compared structural parameters of prepared fe3o4 nps by several synthetic routes all methods used led to obtaining nanosized fe3o4 but the mean size and size distribution varied from one method to another similarly kafshgari et al 82 prepared manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 nps by co precipitation sol gel and hydrothermal routes and posteriorly they were characterized the mnfe2o4 nps showed 36 nm and 38 8 emu g 1 45 nm and 9 5 emu g 1 and 16 nm and 41 9 emu g 1 which correspond to crystallite size and saturation magnetization for co precipitation sol gel and hydrothermal respectively hence the results confirmed that the synthesis method of nps constitutes a fundamental issue to determine the crystallite size and its growth considerable efforts have been made to improve the catalytic activities of magnetic nanomaterials through the different synthetic pathways the methods used to synthesize nanosized fe3o4 have a key role since they could determine the particle size size distribution shape surface chemistry of the particles and their magnetic properties 83 84 the synthesis methods can be broadly classified into physical chemical and biological ones chemical methods are the most selected since they are simple and cost effective 67 besides they allow a control of nps size and shape by variation of reaction parameters 85 some advantages of these routes include low temperature requirement 350 c high yield of material and possibility of doping with ions during the synthesis 86 the common methods reported for the synthesis of fe3o4 nps are briefly described in this section then in table 3 were presented their respective advantages and disadvantages based on the surveyed literature it was identified that fe2 precursors commonly used comprise ferrous sulfate ferrous nitrate and ferrous chloride while fe3 precursors include ferric chloride ferric nitrate and ferric acetate 3 1 co precipitation co precipitation is the method mainly selected by researchers to obtain iron oxides nanoparticles ionps since it is the most effective and simple pathway without toxic intermediates 83 87 this method employs an aqueous salt solution containing dissolved species of fe ii and fe iii at room temperature or elevated temperature and an alkaline solution naoh or nh4oh to precipitate the iron oxide under inert atmosphere 75 88 89 the fe2 fe3 molar ratio must be 1 2 which is the exact stoichiometry to obtain fe3o4 a flow of inert gas nitrogen or argon is used to avoid the oxidation of fe2 and to reduce the particle size 90 a typical procedure for fe3o4 nps synthesis by co precipitation is shown in the fig 1 the size morphology and stability of ionps synthesized for this method depend on factors such as composition of reactants molar ratio of ferrous and ferric ions temperature ph reaction time speed of reducing agent addition into iron salt solution 68 91 for instance yazdani and seddigh 92 assessed the effects of various precursors on the morphology and mean particle size of the fe3o4 nps that were synthesized via co precipitation the results showed that bigger anions generated smaller fe3o4 nps this was explained considering that the bigger anions increased the thickness of the diffuse layer surrounding nuclei and mass transfer resistance therefore for a constant reaction time the mean size of synthesized nps changes inversely with change in the diffuse layer thickness in addition the effect of temperature and stirring rate on the synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation have been studied 93 the results showed that the structural features of the fe3o4 nps were dependent on both reaction parameters an increment in temperature and stirring rate led to fe3o4 nps with a higher level of crystallinity even though the fe3o4 particle size was more uniform as the temperature and stirring rate increased there was still agglomeration caused by the magnetism saragi et al 94 evaluated the temperature effect in the synthesis of fe3o4 nps by co precipitation as a result the average size of fe3o4 nps increases with the synthesis temperature due to the acceleration of chemical reaction of fe2 and fe3 ions the fe3o4 nps made by co precipitation usually have a relatively small size of below 30 nm in diameter 95 in a typical synthetic experiment chatterjee et al 96 dissolved iron salts into deionized water and kept them at room temperature for 15 min with vigorous stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere after that an ammonia solution was added drop by drop into the salt solution and the stirring was continued for another 2 h at 80 c the solution was cooled and solid black particles were magnetically separated and repeatedly washed the fe3o4 nps had a size of 10 15 nm despite the advantages offered by this method the nps often are not stable and they tend to agglomerate due to extremely small size and the magnetic behavior therefore they can be stabilized with surfactants having low molecular weight or functionalized with polymers 97 which will be analyzed below a drawback of this preparation route is the difficulty to obtain uniform and monodisperse nps since the ph of the reaction mixture must be adjusted both through the synthesis and at the purification steps 90 3 2 hydrothermal solvothermal hydrothermal methods have also been reported in the literature this route of synthesis refers to an aqueous reaction at elevated temperature typically between 100 and 1000 c and high vapor pressures typically between 1 and 10 000 atm to recrystallize materials in a closed system 98 for example fe3o4 nps were synthesized from an iron salt solution which contains iron chloride and iron sulphate in 2 1 ratio 75 then ammonium hydroxide nh4oh was added under stirring and this solution was transferred to autoclave and kept at 130 c for 3 h although water is the most employed solvent other solvents such as ethylene glycol eg diethylene glycol deg and polyethylene glycol peg can also be utilized the use of an organic solvent as the dispersion medium transforms the method towards a solvothermal route 98 torres gómez et al 99 synthesized fe3o4 nps by this method using a solution which contained fecl3 6h20 and peg as surfactant this solution was maintained under magnetic stirring then hydrazine n2h4 was added drop wise until a reddish solution was obtained which was then transferred immediately to teflon autoclaves and heated at different temperatures 120 c 140 c and 160 c in a muffle furnace for 4 h as a result quasi spheres octahedrons and cubes in the nanometric regime were obtained adjusting the temperature to 120 c 140 c and 160 c respectively in addition watcharenwong et al 100 prepared fe3o4 using iron iii acetylacetonate fe acac 3 in the eg solvent as reducing agent under stirring for 30 min to fully dissolve the solids and then slowly dropped poly acrylic acid paa while stirring the obtained solution was put in teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and sealed to heat to the boiling point of eg at 200 c for 16 h the fe3o4 nps showed a size between 60 250 nm the shape and crystallinity of fe3o4 nps are influenced by factors such as iron precursor precursor solvent ratio temperature and reaction time 91 the main problem associated with this technique is the low yield due to long reaction time at settled temperatures 70 therefore it is often accompanied by other techniques such as microwave treatment to increase the rate of fe3o4 crystal formation 101 3 3 sol gel this method comprises two aqueous media phases liquid and gel and requires the presence of a surfactant in the solvent 85 during this synthesis an exothermic and self sustaining redox reaction occurs in aqueous solution containing desired metal salts and organic complexant as oxidizer and reducer respectively 71 subsequently a large volume of gases leads to the formation of nps the synthesis of fe3o4 nps via sol gel method was carried out by takai et al 102 iron iii chloride fecl3 and iron ii chloride fecl2 were dissolved in eg and vigorously stirred for a period of 3 h at 45 c to form a sol then it was heated and maintained at a temperature of 80 c until dark color gel was formed this gel was aged for a period of 72 h and later dried at 140 c for 5 h the obtained xerogel was annealed at a certain temperature ranging from 200 to 400 c under vacuum condition the size of nps was temperature dependent obtaining an average particle size of 2 02 nm 5 58 nm and 8 35 nm for 200 c 300 c and 400 c respectively similarly a disadvantage of this method is that extra heat treatments are needed to obtain the final crystalline state 90 although this method produces highly dispersed nps with precise size control its application is restricted owing to the high cost unsafe operating conditions and longer reaction times 85 3 4 thermal decomposition this method involves a reaction that demands an elevated temperature to decompose initial materials for the obtainment of fe3o4 nps the nps synthesized by this technique have narrow size distribution and high crystallinity 70 calì et al 77 used iron chloride and sodium oleate dissolved in a mixture of ethanol deionized water and hexane this solution was heated up to 70 c and kept for 4 h then the product was washed and a solid was obtained finally the solid was mixed with oleic acid and octadecene and then this was heated until 320 c for 30 min to form 12 nm fe3o4 nps the parameters which influence the size and morphology of fe3o4 nps are temperature reaction time solvent and the surfactant selected to the substrate of such reaction 89 90 a main drawback is the high temperature 300 c of reaction 70 3 5 green synthesis recently biosynthetic routes denominated plant mediated green synthesis have been development for fabricating nps since they are simple economic clean technologies and hence suitable environmentally 103 104 the synthesis of iron nps and ionps from several plants have been reported such as leaf extract of peltophorum pterocarpum 105 terminalia bellirica plant extracts 106 daphne mezereum leaf extract 22 green tea extract 107 eucalyptus leaf extract 108 chromolaena odorata root extract 109 among others to obtain nps using this method the plant extract is mixed with the precursor in a metal ion salt solution at ambient atmosphere one aim of the green synthesis is to avoid the use of chemical stabilizers and reducing agents the extracts of plants could be used both as capping agent and as bio reductant 110 owing to the presence of several biomolecules such as ascorbic acid polyphenols phenolics flavonoids and sugars 111 red seaweed kappaphycus alvarezii has been employed as a green reducing and stabilizing agent in the preparation of fe3o4nps the synthesized fe3o4nps had spherical shape and an average diameter of 14 7 nm nevertheless the image of tem showed that most of the particles were agglomerated which might be due to the thickening properties of seaweed or the presence of hydroxyl groups from the extract 112 the particle agglomeration leads to a decrease of the effective surface area and therefore poor performances are obtained in this type of synthetic pathway the size and morphology control could be difficult since the plant extract has numerous components such as amino acids polyphenols nitrogenous bases and reducing sugars 113 although the green synthetic methods use non toxic reagents and low energy consumption the resulting nps have wide size distribution and lack shape control 113 114 this could lead to fe3o4 nps with modest magnetic response this synthetic route is promising to expand on a large scale due to the availability and safety of the inputs used being an economically feasible alternative however it is necessary to expand research in this field to obtain high performance nanomaterials that can be implemented in the remediation of industrial effluents 3 6 continuous magnetite nanoparticles production several approaches for the continuous synthesis of fe3o4 nps have been developed to scale up the process asimakidou et al 114 carried out the continuous production of fe3o4 nps by oxidative precipitation in aqueous media the product was obtained through a continuous flow setup two tanks were employed feso4 7h2o solution 0 03 m and a mixture of nano3 0 06 m naoh 0 125 m and ethanol 30 v v the solutions were pumped into the reactor which operated at room temperature under mild mechanical stirring and intense nitrogen bubbling until the formation of a green rust the ph was adjusted according to each reaction varying between 8 and 12 0 2 after that the green rust led to the aging reactor during a period of 4 h a production of 0 7 g fe3o4 h 1 was obtained however multiplying the amounts of tanks and the flow rates could obtain a higher yield the impinging stream rotating packed bed is rpb reactor was employed by fan et al 118 to synthesize continuously fe3o4 nps by co precipitation the reaction conditions were 65 32 of high gravity factor 60 l h 1 of liquid flow rate and 0 321 mol l 1 of fecl3 6h2o concentration a monodispersed fe3o4 nps was obtained with mean diameter of 8 9 nm and saturation magnetization of 60 5 emu g 1 the production of fe3o4 nps was 2 23 kg h 1 in another study fan et al 119 prepared l cysteine functionalized fe3o4 mnps by a simple high gravity reactive precipitation method combined with surface modification through is rpb reactor with the assistance of sonication the produced l cysteine fe3o4 nps were quasi spherical with an average diameter of about 10 nm and saturation magnetization of 53 0 emu g l 1 gu et al 120 synthesized continuously fe3o4 nps with a multiphase segmented flow system in the process one of the phases was a miniemulsion containing iron precursor solution in nanodroplet confinement the other phase was diluted ammonium hydroxide solution the as prepared fe3o4 nps obtained an average size of about 10 nm in addition prabowo et al 121 carried out a feasibility study to the large scale production of fe3o4 nps by co precipitation from the engineering point of view they obtained that the process of synthesis of fe3o4 nps on a large scale is promising with an estimated annual production of 456 kg although production at industrial scale is feasible recovering the initial cost could take up to 5 years finally it is essential to consider the generation of aqueous solutions containing chloride and sulfate as waste to be treated and disposed of hence it is still a fundamental issue the development of continuous synthesis methods of fe3o4 nps by cost effective routes without the production of hazardous waste and suitable environmentally 3 7 characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles according to the literature reviewed nanomaterials can be characterized by several techniques to get insight into the size size distribution morphology magnetic properties chemical composition specific surface area surface features among others see fig 2 the crystalline information and unit cell parameters of nps can be obtained via x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx allow obtaining information about the surface morphology and elemental composition respectively transmission electron microscopy tem provides accurate information on composition and structure thickness chemical and elemental composition electronic structure and energy levels xrd sem and tem also permit the estimation of the size of nps the functional groups and chemical bonds present in nps can be analyzed through fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy in addition the zeta potential determination allows measurement of the electrostatic potential at the electrical double layer surrounding a nanoparticle in solution the magnetic properties can be evaluated via vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the specific surface area of the samples and mean pore diameter can be measured via brunauer emmett teller bet surface area by dynamic light scattering dls it is possible to get information about particle size size distribution and agglomeration based on the hydrodynamic 4 nanosized magnetite as nanozyme in heterogeneous fenton oxidation nanomaterials with enzyme like intrinsic activity are considered nanozymes 122 as presented above iron oxide nps including fe3o4 and fe2o3 are denominated ionzyme and they constitute one of the most typical nanozymes 95 fe3o4 nps based nanozymes exhibit peroxidase and catalase like activity 123 and recently was reported activity similar to natural zymolyase 124 enzymatic activities of zymolyase include β 1 3 glucan laminaripentao hydrolase activity and β 1 3 glucanase activity ionzymes have been considered to be used in elimination of selected pollutants in fenton like systems 55 the main beneficial characteristics of nanozymes with peroxidase like activity for their application in fenton like systems were detailed in fig 3 the properties and catalytic activity of nanozymes are directly related to their structural parameters for example the shape control constitutes a relevant aspect to improve the catalysis since the crystal facets and consequently atomic arrangement on the facets have a significant effect on its activity 125 gao et al 62 reported that the nanocomposites containing fe3o4 nps with anisotropic morphology as nanorods show higher catalytic activity in comparison with nanoneedles and nano octahedra wei et al 126 compared the fenton like catalytic properties of spherical and octahedral fe3o4 nps as a result the octahedral fe3o4 nps showed higher catalytic stability than the spherical fe3o4 nps in the mb degradation with h2o2 in addition wan et al 127 informed that the nanosized fe3o4 with spherical shape had a superior performance as peroxidase mimetic followed by cube octahedron and hexagonal plate this was associated with the preferential exposure of catalytically active iron atoms fe2 fe3 or crystal planes although high efficiencies have been found for nps with different morphologies the spherical shape is the most commonly employed in fenton like reactions 128 the size is another fundamental parameter in the catalytic behavior of fe3o4 nps wan et al 129 compared the performance of fe3o4 nps with averages diameters of 30 70 250 and 600 nm they found that the catalytic activity increased with the reduction of nanoparticle size when the size decreases there is a higher specific surface area to interact with the substrate hence it increases the catalytic activity 95 130 in addition to the size and shape the efficiency of nanozymes as catalysts also depends on composition oxidation state geometry coating and stability of nps 130 131 the transfer of electrons between ferrous and ferric ions at the octahedral sites in fe3o4 favors the generation of oh from h2o2 these active radicals are capable of breaking unsaturated dye molecules and double bonds in their chromophore removing the color of effluents 62 besides fe3o4 nps can be separated from the reaction medium by application of a magnetic field from a nd iman for example and then re dispersed in solution for reuse this is a relevant issue regarding the sustainability of the system and the costs associated with it 39 although ionzymes exhibit advantages as easy recovery the activity of most of them is low compared to that of their enzymatic counterparts 132 in addition the dye removal using fe3o4 nps with h2o2 often requires to be combined with other processes to enhance their performance for example with ultrasound irradiation 54 one of the limitations associated with the use of fe3o4 nps is their tendency to agglomerate in solution in general the hydrophobic interactions between fe3o4 nps and its high surface area to volume ratio generate aggregates and eventually form larger sized nps 70 trujillo hernandez et al 133 prepared fe3o4 nps by thermal decomposition obtaining particle sizes between 15 and 100 nm with an average of 42 nm the sem micrograph showed that the particles present an agglomeration tendency furthermore ruíz baltazar et al 134 prepared fe3o4 nps via green route using cynara cardunculus leaf extract as a source of reducing agents the sem micrograph allowed the observation of nps agglomerates the agglomeration of nps occurs to reduce their surface energy due to their large surface area for mnps as fe3o4 magnetic dipole interaction and van der waals interactions are also relevant 135 nps are intrinsically unstable over prolonged periods of time they possess poor chemical resistance to strong acids or strong oxidizing agents that eventually lead to the loss of their magnetic activity after the synthesis iron nps quickly form iron oxide layers over their surface since under ambient conditions fe3o4 can easily be oxidized to fe2o3 67 in addition fe3o4 can be dissolved in an acidic medium khoshhesab and modaresnia 136 used fe3o4 nps as adsorbent for the removal of ab210 azo and rb19 anthraquinone dyes from aqueous solutions the fe3o4 nps were synthesized by co precipitation and had an average particle size of around 36 nm the adsorption capacities for ab210 and rb19 were 70 80 mg g 1 at 45 min and 74 40 mg g 1 at 5 min respectively the reusability study revealed that the adsorption efficiency decreased about 8 after five consecutive cycles and the recovery of adsorbent with a magnetic field was possible the loss in efficiency might be due to a dissolution of fe ions which are released toward the solution hence the fe3o4 gradually loses its active surface sites 137 another drawback when mnps are used in composites is the detachment of them from modified materials during the reaction which also produces the toxicity after long term accumulation in water 138 in summary despite the fe3o4 nps having several advantages in their role as nanozymes often they have drawbacks such as low catalytic activity after few uses unexpected interactions leaching of iron furthermore they tend to reduce the catalyst surface by aggregation and are oxidized easily in the air these results in the loss of dispersibility and magnetic properties 29 42 139 this results in unsatisfactory catalytic activity low reaction rate and deficient dye degradation hence the practical applications fundamentally require avoiding the agglomeration of nps due to their catalytic capability are directly related to the available active surface sites 128 moreover the implementation on a large scale requires an enhancement of h2o2 dosage to ensure application over a wide ph range and guarantee the recovery and reuse of the catalysts 140 then the development of catalytically active and stable iron oxide nps in fenton like reaction is a major challenge today in order to achieve enhanced catalysts various strategies have been studied and will be analyzed in the following sections 5 strategies to enhance the nanoparticulated magnetite properties 5 1 coating and functionalization of magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 nps have colloidal instability and they are susceptible to oxidation and corrosion as discussed in the previous sections therefore different approaches have been developed to stabilize and functionalize them for instance through modifications on their surface chemistry among the types of ion based materials core shell ionps typically consist of a magnetic core a coating and in some cases surface active modifiers 68 the coating of nps with organic or inorganic compounds constitutes a common surface modification method which might prevent the oxidation and agglomeration as well as allow higher functionalization when the number of active sites that can bind with the substrate increases by the surface modification so does the adsorption capacity and selectivity of fe3o4 nps towards certain pollutants therefore there is great interest in the modification of mnps since the nanoscale architecture of active centers influences its efficiency and selectivity 141 142 besides since the catalytic activity occurs on the surface of nps when they act as nanozyme the control of surface chemistry is essential to adjust its performance in the organic contaminant degradation 132 the surface modification of fe3o4 nps can be made either during the synthesis in situ or after as an independent process this strategy can be implemented by covalent immobilization of functional groups or the coating with charged species of the surface of nps 130 therefore the stabilization is achieved by steric or electrostatic forces respectively 143 through these procedures a mono layer is created on the surface of the fe3o4 the aim is to obtain fe3o4 nps with enhanced dispersibility in water improved physicochemical and mechanical properties and capacity to retain the magnetic properties 68 the coating fulfills several roles which comprise 1 the formation of a protective layer to avoid the oxidation 2 the reduction of the surface energy to prevent the agglomeration and to produce monodisperse nps and 3 the control of nucleation and growth process to manipulate the size and promote the oriented growth of the nucleus 78 several types of inorganic and organic coatings to stabilize nps in aqueous solutions have been described in the literature inorganic coatings have been widely studied mainly silica coated fe3o4 nanocomposites 144 the organic coatings here considered include surfactants polymers carbon based material and organic moieties these allow the addition of functional groups onto the surface of the nps such as hydroxyl carboxyl aldehyde and amino groups the surfactant surface active agents modified iron oxide nps contain diverse types of functional groups depending on the nature of surfactant the selection of suitable surfactants and their use in a proper amount constitute fundamental issues to control the size and morphology of nps 145 the use of carboxylates laurate palmitate linoleate as surfactants help to reduce the size of nps and shape control 146 klekotka et al 147 synthesized fe3o4 and γ fe2o3 nps with several types of surface stabilizers by thermal decomposition of fe acac 3 precursor in organic solution they employed long chain carboxylic acid lauric acid palmitic acid stearic acid caprylic acid oleic acid and amines oleyl amine trioctylamine hexylamine dioctylamine the tem micrographs showed that the nps coated with hexylamine and dioctylamine presented the most regular and uniform shape with lower particle size which may indicate self organization of nps while the fe3o4 core coated with carboxylic acid presented poorer size distribution hence the use of surfactants not only influences the size of fe3o4 nps but also governs size distribution and protects interaction between particles the high protection from aggregation due to surfactant presence was mainly seen in hexylamine besides all samples presented different saturation magnetization varying 50 to 83 am2 kg 1 indicating that it depends not only on the magnetic core but also on the surfactant used in a posterior study klekotka et al 145 concluded that amines allow the growth of uniform shaped particles in comparison to fatty acids furthermore tertiary amines cause flower like nanoparticle growth accordingly nicolás et al 84 found that the coating of fe3o4 nps with oleic acid led to a lower aggregation in addition an increase in the initial amount of oleic acid may affect the dispersibility of the fe3o4 nps due to the modification in stabilization mechanisms cîrcu et al 148 evaluated the effect of several organic stabilizers on fe3o4 nps and found that glycolic acid malic acid and mandelic acid generate an important increase in the saturation magnetization this study revealed that the coating and exposure times produced changes in the average crystallite size interestingly instead of simple anchoring stabilizers to the surfaces of fe3o4 nps a more complex recrystallization mechanism including re dispersing fe3o4 moieties from the nps and rearrangement was proposed köçkar et al 149 synthesized fe3o4 nps with tartaric acid at and ascorbic acid aa as surfactants by hydrothermal method the effects of coating with at aa and at aa 1 1 mixture on properties of fe3o4 nps were evaluated the particle average diameter was determined via tem obtaining 7 4 1 5 7 8 1 7 and 6 8 2 0 nm for at aa and at aa respectively the at fe3o4 nps showed less agglomeration besides the saturation magnetization values were higher than those of the precursor and changed according to the surfactant used in addition yau et al 150 prepared fe3o4 nps coated with l ascorbic acid laa a kind of vitamin c as surfactant they found that 0 96 g of laa as a capping agent allowed resulting fe3o4 nps with smaller size suitable superparamagnetic behavior and high stability and dispersion furthermore ren et al 151 carried out a peroxidase like activity test to study the performance of vitamin c vc functionalized fe3o4 nps the comparison between the catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb with vc fe3o4 nps h2o2 and naked fe3o4 nps h2o2 showed that the fe3o4 nps modified with vc presented enhanced catalytic activity chen et al 152 used n n di carboxymethyl perylene diimides pdi to functionalize fe3o4 nps the obtained pdi fe3o4 nanocomposites were tested through the catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate tmb in the presence of h2o2 as a result pdi fe3o4 showed a higher peroxidase like activity than that of naked fe3o4 nps polymers and small organic molecules have also been employed to enhance the stability of mnps and to obtain magnetic nanocomposites with distinct functions arévalo et al 153 synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation methods and dispersed them in a fatty acid oleic acid an organic sulfate sodium dodecyl sulfate a polymeric surfactant polyvinyl alcohol and olive oils of distinct acidity of 0 1 and 0 2 they assessed structural parameters and magnetic behavior of surfactant modified fe3o4 nps as a result modified fe3o4 nps with size of 9 4 11 1 nm were obtained the oleic acid modified fe3o4 presented the highest magnetization furthermore olive oils showed results similar to oleic acid therefore these can be used as alternatives in the synthesis of fe3o4 nps radoń et al 154 assessed the influence of various organic modifiers polyvinylpyrrolidone sodium citrate tartaric acid eg and dextrin on structure and optical properties of fe3o4 nps the synthetic method employed was the chemical co precipitation as a result the fe3o4 nps modified with tartaric acid presented the smallest size with crystallinity volume size 2 9 nm following by fe3o4 citrate 5 5 nm fe3o4 dextrin 8 4 nm fe3o4 pvp 9 2 nm naked fe3o4 10 6 nm and fe3o4 glycol 12 2 nm the tem image showed that the fe3o4 nps modified with citrate and tartrate tended to agglomerate which is related to the small average crystallinity volume size in relation to dextrin modified fe3o4 nps they had spherical shape and were dispersed in a polysaccharide matrix those nps modified with tartaric acid showed the highest value of optical band gap energy 3 01 ev jain et al 155 synthesized nanorods and nanospheres of iron oxides via polyol method using fe no3 3 as precursor and peg as both reducing and stabilizing agent the nanocrystals shape could be selected using peg posteriorly the efficiency of fe3o4 nps in removal of several dyes rhb mb and mo was assessed the fe3o4 microrods could effectively degrade all dyes in the presence of h2o2 cluster structured fe3o4 nps were functionalized with paa generating carboxyl groups on the surface of the nps 156 with optimal concentration of 5 wt paa the size of the particle decreased from 300 nm to 200 nm furthermore paa modified nps showed enhanced dispersion due to the electrostatic repulsion between carboxyl groups gamallo et al 157 prepared fe3o4 nps sterically stabilized with paa the fe3o4 paa nps were quasi spherical with average size of 10 1 2 4 nm and saturation magnetization of 70 emu g 1 sanchez et al 158 assessed the influence of paa molecular weight mw 1800 g mol 1 and 5000 g mol 1 and paa concentration on the magnetic and structural properties of iron oxide based nps they obtained a smaller particle size and narrow size distribution when the paa concentration was the highest furthermore the magnetization analysis showed that all samples exhibit superparamagnetic response presenting very low coercivity and remnant magnetization at room temperature polyvinyl alcohol pva can stabilize nps however its hydrophilic nature can reduce its effectiveness as a capping agent therefore the use of glutaraldehyde glut as a crosslinker allows resulting nps with high stability in low ph since glut is stable in acidic condition rahayu et al 159 synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation in presence of pva as a capping agent and assessed the use of glut as crosslinking agent the fe3o4 nps with pva and glut had a higher percentage of fe3o4 since their surface had a lower degree of oxidation towards γ fe2o3 and α fe2o3 this might enhance the peroxidase like activity of fe3o4 nps fan et al 160 utilized polydopamine pda shells on fe3o4 nps the core shell fe3o4 pda nanocomposites were synthesized by the combination of solvothermal reduction method and covalent bonding of pda through spontaneous polymerization of dopamine on the surface of the fe3o4 microspheres the obtained fe3o4 nps exhibited monodispersed spherical shape and they showed diameter from 200 500 nm and then the coating with pda increased the size between 20 and 40 nm the pda in the composite might act as a reducing agent and promote the reduction of fe3 favoring the fenton reaction hence the catalytic activity of fe3o4 pda was assessed in the rhb removal in presence of h2o2 the highest efficiency in the rhb removal was obtained with fe3o4 pda fe2 h2o2 system and it can be employed at a ph range of 3 0 9 0 in general fe3o4 nps based fenton like processes performed unsatisfactorily at neutral ph hence zhou et al 161 prepared glutathione coated fe3o4 nps via oxidative polymerization method these nps were employed as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp degradation at ph 6 5 this nanocomposite could remove up to 99 of 2 4 dcp in 240 min while the naked fe3o4 nps cannot operate at the same conditions in order to enhance the selectivity the mimicking of the binding environment of natural enzymes was also applied to improve the activity of nanozymes fe3o4 nps were modified with histidine his to mimic the architecture of natural hrp 162 the peroxidase activity of his fe3o4 was evaluated using tmb colorimetric system at acidic ph this modification resulted in important improvement of peroxidase like activity and the catalytic efficiency of the fe3o4 nanozyme by enhancing the affinity for h2o2 via hydrogen bond formation between the imidazole group of histidine and h2o2 furthermore the catalase like activity was also assessed by monitoring the h2o2 decomposition to o2 at neutral ph the improved catalase like performance was obtained with his modified fe3o4 nps kampferbeck et al 163 synthesized non agglomerated iron oxide nps average diameter of 13 7 0 6 nm by growing polystyrene shells via activators generated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization aget atr in microemulsion the encapsulation was carried out by direct polymerization of a cross linked polystyrene shell on the nanoparticle surface the thickness of the polymer shell and the degree of cross linking can be adjusted as a result the polystyrene encapsulated nps had a high stability in aqueous media even at ph 1 8 in addition up to ph 0 3 the particles were stable with no detectable loss of iron recently the use of natural polymers and bio organic wastes as part of magnetic nanocomposites have shown an immense potential due to their biocompatibility biodegradability and low cost chitosan cs has been employed to stabilize fe3o4 nps using a mixture of tripolyphosphate and sulphate as crosslinker agent by ex situ co precipitation method at room temperature 164 as a result the ratio enhancement between cs fe3o4 increases the particle size while decreased the crystallite size besides the higher tripolyphosphate content contributed to the small size and more spherical morphology leal et al 165 synthesize mfe2o4 m cu2 ni2 co2 mn2 and fe2 and then they were coated with 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane apts agent h2n ch2 3si och3 3 and functionalized with cs the obtained products were mfe2o4 mfe2o4 sio2 and mfe2o4 sio2 cs mfe2o4 showed large aggregates of particles with irregular shapes while the mfe2o4 sio2 cs nps presented lower agglomeration furthermore the coating and functionalization of nps allowed high dispersibility the saturation magnetization varies between 12 3 to 63 7 emu g 1 the minimum corresponds to nife2o4 sio2 cs and the maximum one corresponds to fe3o4 furthermore yerba mate extract coated fe3o4 nps fe3o4 ym were synthesized 166 the fe3o4 ym were prepared by co precipitation methods obtaining particles of 12 nm while the fe3o4 nps were 15 nm confirming the reduction in the size the particles were composed of a crystalline fe3o4 core surrounded by a shell of fe3o4 and fe2o3 oxides forming chelates with ym components containing carboxylic acid groups and phenols and a high content of organic nitrogen ym coating is capable of specifically absorbing h and oh leading to a higher content of surface charges than fe3o4 nps consequently particle agglomeration is reduced with increasing ym content and more stable homogeneous aqueous suspensions were formed recently the use of plant extracts in the synthesis process have been extensively studied since the phyto compounds could act both as a precipitant and as a capping agent for fe3o4 nps 109 5 2 transition metals modified nano magnetite nanocatalysts based on earth abundant transition metals mn2 fe 2 co2 ni2 cu2 have been extensively used in several applications 167 a recent review delineated the progress made around transition metal substituted spinel nano ferrites as promising candidates for fulfill the role of artificial enzymes focusing in the synthesis methods and the factors influencing the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes 168 factors that influence the catalytic activity of nano ferrites are the introduction of transition metals to spinel structures chemical composition i e the kind of transition metal introduced the reduction potential of the substitute metal as well as its valence state and the nature of the cation distribution since the fe3o4 nps possess several difficulties to be employed as a catalyst in fenton like reactions to remove organic contaminants the introduction of transition metals in their structure might constitute an efficient strategy to overcome these drawbacks the cations fe2 in the fe3o4 can be isomorphically substituted by other transition metals to enhance the properties of nanozymes the substitute transition metals should have similar ionic radius to fe2 fe3 cations and same oxidation states or one or two unit differences to the exchanged iron species 31 this could facilitate a higher performance for dyed effluent remediation since the pure fe3o4 have lower adsorption capacity and degradation rate in fenton reaction 31 the substitution of iron ions with transition metal ions in the oxide matrix is considered simple inexpensive and capable of causing considerable synergistic effects 169 a suitable transition metal content in general decreases the crystal size increasing the specific surface area and leading to a major adsorption capacity and catalytic activity the most common examples of spinel ferrites are represented by mfe2o4 where m can be any metal with an oxidation state of 2 such as co2 cu2 fe2 mn2 ni2 mg2 and zn2 170 the substitutions can also be made with trivalent cr3 v3 and ti3 and tetravalent nb4 and mo4 metal ions 171 172 rahim pouran et al 31 gave an overview of the adsorption potential and fenton like activity of several fe3o4 based catalysts substituted with transition metals they reported that the method most widely used for the preparation of substituted fe3o4 is the co precipitation of ferrous and ferric salts with the molar ratio of fe2 fe3 equal to 1 2 and transition metal salts under an inert gas environment besides they compiled literature related to the use of fe3o4 substituted with transition metals in combination with h2o2 in fenton like systems to remove recalcitrant organic contaminants firstly vinosha et al 173 prepared znfeo4 using zinc chloride zncl2 and ferric chloride fecl3 in solution as precursor agents the fecl3 solution was kept under continuous stirring and then naoh was added drop wise to adjust ph 10 subsequently zncl2 solution was added and the temperature was raised to 80 c for 3 h until brown precipitate was obtained finally it was annealed at 75 c for 24 h and calcined at 500 c for 5 h to obtain znfe2o4 nps li et al 174 synthesized zn doped fe3o4 by a modified one step solvothermal method they utilized fecl3 6h2o and zncl2 as precursors materials furthermore they employed eg that acts as reducing agent for the formation of ferrite nps deg as inhibitor to prevent the aggregation of nps and peg as surfactant likewise sodium acetate was added in the mixture solution not only to prevent particle agglomeration but also to act as a reducing agent they obtained nps of zn doped fe3o4 with small size it is known that the methods of synthesis significantly influence the size surface charge shape stability cation distribution and magnetic properties of spinel ferrite nps 69 arévalo cid et al 116 prepared mfe2o4 nps with m fe2 co2 and ni2 by three different methods coprecipitation sol gel and hydrothermal synthesis as a result all methods led to nps with spherical shape a larger particle size was found in cofe2o4 samples prepared by sol gel and smaller in the nife2o4 samples prepared by hydrothermal synthesis iron and nickel samples behaved as superparamagnetic materials while cofe2o4 samples exhibited a characteristic ferrimagnetic behavior the highest saturation magnetization value appears in the fe3o4 sample obtained by coprecipitation and the lowest value in the nickel samples in addition an increment in the magnetization saturation values was found in the cofe2o4 and nife2o4 samples prepared by hydrothermal however the substitution with ni 2 could lead to inhibitor effect of activity fenton 175 176 hence its use as catalyst in fenton systems is not recommended copper ferrite cufe2o4 nps have a potential application in effluent remediation masunga et al 177 summarized the advances of their synthesis magnetic properties and application in water treatment tehrani bagha et al 178 synthesized copper ferrite nps via polymeric precursor method they utilized stoichiometric amounts molar ratio of fe2 cu2 2 of fe no3 3 9h2o and cu no3 2 6h2o aqueous solutions then it was mixed with aqueous solutions of citric acid and eg the molar ratio of total metal ions to citric acid was kept as 1 3 and a mass proportion of 60 40 was used for citric acid eg the temperature of the solution was raised to 85 c and maintained at this temperature for 2 h up to the gel formation the resulting gel was heated at 300 c for 1 h leading to the expansion of its original volume to three times and formation of the porous semi carbonized powder precursor finally the product was calcined at 500 c for 2 h at ambient atmosphere the prepared nps had the nanocrystalline pure single phase structure almost spherical shape with an average diameter of about 21 nm values of saturation magnetization remnant magnetization and coercivity were found to be 6 5 emu g 1 2 1 emu g 1 and 380 oe respectively hamdan et al 179 synthesized cufe2o4 nps via co precipitation and sol gel auto combustion and then their performance in fenton like reaction for phenol removal was assessed the cufe2o4 nps obtained by sol gel showed higher catalytic activity than that prepared by co precipitation besides they presented higher efficiency than other catalysts cufe2o4 tio2 mgfe2o4 znfe2o4 the recovery and reusability of the catalyst was also evaluated and no considerable loss of catalytic activity was observed in five cycles 30 mg catalyst 0 5 m h2o2 25 c no ph adjustment no uv or sunlight achieving up to 63 of degradation after the first cycle and 60 after the fifth cycle furthermore the h2o2 addition procedure was evaluated obtaining that the continuous addition in small amounts produced higher efficiency than single shot addition the reason might be due to the decreasing in its scavenging effect and hence produced oh radicals have higher chance to attack and degrade phenol in other study othman et al 180 compared the performance of cufe2o4 and cufe2o4 coated with phosphate in the phenol removal using h2o2 as oxidizing agent ph 3 and t 35 and 45 c as optimal conditions the higher catalytic performance was observed for phosphate coated cufe2o4 which might be due to improving the morphological electronic and chemical properties ferrites containing two metal ions in addition to iron have also been employed as catalysts for dye removal dou et al 181 prepared ferrite samples with the formula of comnxfe2 xo4 by means of sol gel auto combustion route briefly the precursor materials used were co no3 2 6h2o fe no3 3 9h2o mncl2 4h2o and c6h8o7 h2o in addition citric acid was used with a molar ratio between metal nitrates to citric acid of 1 1 and ammonia water was added to adjust the ph the mixed gel was exothermic at elevated temperature and led to spontaneous combustion forming ferrite powders finally the powders were calcined in a muffle furnace for 2 h at 400 c for crystallization through sem analysis it was possible to observe that severe aggregation occurred in the pure cobalt ferrite which is attributed to the strong magnetic property of the pure cobalt ferrite itself however the aggregation notably decreased with the presence of manganese in comn0 2fe1 8o4 indicating that their presence effectively suppressed agglomeration of particles furthermore andhare et al 182 prepared co1 xznxfe2o4 ferrite nps by co precipitation using cocl2 6h2o zncl2 and fecl3 as precursors the size of ferrites was larger as the zinc concentration increased besides the increment in zinc concentration also produced a decrease in the agglomeration of nps as the magnetization of zinc ferrite is lower than cobalt ferrites hence the magnetic interaction between nps went down other researchers have studied the use of transition metals of the period fourth rahim pouran 172 analyzed the effect of transition metals of period five nb4 and mo4 on the structure and activity of fe3o4 in fenton systems the catalyst was synthesized by co precipitation methods all samples maintained the spinel structure and magnetic behavior the nb4 and mo4 replaced the octahedral fe3 and fe2 cations respectively furthermore high nb4 and mo4 substituted fe3o4 led to a significant decrease in crystal size with consequent increase in specific surface area obtaining a major adsorption capacity 5 3 supported magnetite nanoparticles another strategy to enhance the performance of fe3o4 nps in their application as catalyst is the use of organic and inorganic materials as support for bare nps these solid supports allow the deposition of active species on their surface facilitating the recovery of catalysts from reaction medium mechanical resistance is enhanced and generates synergistic effects that increase the chemical activity of material furthermore the use of support for a fe3o4 nps might improve the thermal and chemical stability of the catalyst and hence their catalytic properties there are numerous reports about fe3o4 based catalysts supported on organic and inorganic matrices among these carbon based nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide have been widely employed even when they are expensive song et al 37 prepared fe3o4 modified ultra small graphene oxide fe3o4 usgo as a heterogeneous catalyst for fenton like degradation of ppm level dye pollutants the composite was synthesized by in situ co precipitation of fe3o4 nps on the surface of usgo as a result fe3o4 usgo particles were spherical and homogeneously dispersed with size about 12 15 nm the usgo acts as the template for co precipitation hence the narrow size distribution of fe3o4 usgo was obtained pamp poly 2 acrylamido 2 methyl 1 propansul fonic acid hydrogel supported fe3o4 nanozymes were also synthesized via co precipitation reaction by sang et al 183 they obtained a magnetic pamps fe3o4 with intrinsic peroxidase activity and high catalytic activity furthermore they evaluated pamps with different concentrations of crosslinking agents n n methylenebisacrylamide mba obtaining that the lower crosslinking concentration led to the higher catalytic activity of the nanozyme in addition the mesoporous ceo2 was used as support of fe3o4 nps the fe3o4 ceo2 composite acts both as adsorbent and as catalyst for dye degradation in presence of h2o2 184 besides it showed low metal leaching due to the possible strong metal support interaction which enhanced the dispersion and stabilization of fe species it has been demonstrated that fe3o4 nps supported on carbon nanotubes cnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts exhibited high peroxidase like activity in the fenton like degradation of various organic compounds in water these nanocomposites are catalytically active in a wide range of ph 1 0 10 0 185 xu et al 186 synthesized anchored onto the surface of mwcnts by moderate chemical co precipitation method the nanocomposite was employed in the mo removal it exhibited synergic effects between adsorption and fenton like catalytic oxidation for mo degradation process furthermore biomass activated carbon bac supported fe3o4 nps fe3o4 bac were synthesized via solvothermal method by liu et al 187 the fe3o4 nps in bac showed high crystallinity uniform particle size and suitable dispersibility the fe3o4 bac was used as adsorbent and fenton like reagent for pre concentration and degradation of mb from an aqueous solution in the presence of h2o2 the nanocomposite had high performance in mild reaction conditions which is desirable synthetic or natural polymeric supports provide advantages such as low cost mechanical resistance high catalytic activity and immense potential for reusability a wide variety of catalysts have been developed using several polymeric materials as support nps such as cs and carboxyl cellulose nanospheres qin et al 115 synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide coated on the surface of carboxyl cellulose nano spheres via co precipitation methods and proposed a formation mechanism in the synthesis of fe3o4 nps nucleation growth and secondary processes such as agglomeration take place when cellulose nano spheres are added their carboxyl groups do not only provide sites for nucleation but they also minimize the degree of agglomeration of the iron oxides particles as well as limit the particle size growing infinitely the mnps were less than 100 nm with narrow size distribution furthermore a catalyst was produced by impregnating cellulose nanofibrils with fe3o4 and applied to the degradation of mb dye in a fenton like reactive process 188 the cellulose nanofibrils were obtained by mechanical defibrillation from eucalyptus kraft pulp when the cellulose fibers pass through the defibrillator their dimensions and surface structure are changed which results in viscosity changes owing to the breaking and reformation of chemical bonds generating an increase in the surface area since the fe3o4 tends to form clusters the synthesis with the cellulosic matrix improves the efficiency of the catalyst due to the insoluble cellulose in water or organic solvents avoiding the catalytic activity decrease the magnetic solid can be used for multiple cycles to avoid the final disposal of agricultural waste their use as support material of iron oxide has been considered iron oxides supported on activated carbon derived from peanut hulls were prepared and employed in oxidation of mb 41 dye removal was due to adsorption and oxidation process both are influenced by the presence of oxygenated groups on the surface furthermore the oxidation activity depended on the amount and crystal size of fe3o4 samples with the highest amounts of fe3o4 on the surface but the biggest particles size leading to low conversion the catalytic processes that incorporate renewable sources as the biomass are more energy efficient than conventional methodologies and avoid the generation of polluting sub products bastidas et al 189 synthesize a magnetic catalyst consisting of iron species impregnated on fique fibers furcraea spp the surface of fique fibers was previously functionalized using a basic treatment to form ionic species ch2 na conforming nucleation points for nps formation the chemical nature of the fiber surface significantly influences the iron impregnation process gupta et al 190 extracted cellulose nanofibers cnf from bio waste pine needles and then they synthesized cellulose nife2o4 nanocomposites cnf nife by the in situ deposition of nife2o4 nife nps on the surface of cnf this nanocatalyst was employed in the dyed effluent remediation 6 application of magnetite based nanozymes in azo and anthraquinone dye degradation by fenton like oxidation 6 1 coated and functionalized nanosized magnetite the interactions between superparamagnetic fe3o4 nps lead to formation of aggregates with lower surface volume ratios which affect their catalytic activity to overcome this drawback the nps surface can be modified with stabilizing agents as was mentioned in the previous section there are numerous reports about magnetic fe3o4 nps and their combination with other compounds for higher functionalization table 4 recently the use of bio surfactants and biological capping agents for surface functionalization of nps is being extensively studied they cannot only increase their colloidal stability but may also improve their biological and catalytic activities abbasi kajani and bordbar 191 synthesized nanosized fe3o4 by modified co precipitation method and functionalized by the taxane diterpenoids extracted from taxus baccata l the fe3o4 nps had less than 50 nm and they presented stable magnetic behavior without surface oxidation the fenton like catalytic activity of functionalized fe3o4 was assessed through dye mb and mo removal the effect of fe nps and h2o2 concentration were studied obtaining that the catalytic activity for dye oxidation was directly related to these parameters the mb 12 5 mg l 1 was completely removed after 210 and 420 min in the presence of 2 and 1 mg ml 1 of fe nps respectively the reaction for mo 25 mg l 1 removal was slower achieving complete removal in 22 h in the presence of 2 mg ml 1 fe nps hydrogel coated hc fe3o4 nps were synthesized by co precipitation and the coating was carboxymethyl cellulose monomer of acrylic acid aa and acrylamide am crosslinker of n n methylene bisacrylamide mba and initiator of ammonium persulfate aps in a graft polymerization reaction 192 the hc fe3o4 nps were applied to remove ar73 from water to assess their catalytic activity fe3o4 nps achieved an ar73 removal efficiency of 49 0 and 20 1 in 300 min at ph 3 and ph 3 5 respectively hc fe3o4 nps at the same conditions obtained removal efficiency of 985 hence the coating with hydrogel enhanced the catalytic activity of fe3o4 nps in the ar73 removal by fenton like reaction three pathways were proposed by the authors i the formed shell that prevented fe3o4 aggregation and increased the reaction contact ii electrostatic interaction coo fe3 that accelerated fe2 fe3 redox cycle and iii complexing cellulose fe2 promoted h2o2 decomposition fe3o4 nps coated with paa have been employed in degradation of rb19 157 the optimal reaction conditions were selected through a response surface methodology rsm and then the rb19 removal was carried out in a sequential batch reactor coupled to an external magnetic separation system the treatment for 4 h achieved a dye removal of 91 3 in addition mnps were modified with sodium alginate by a co precipitation method and the efficiency in the rb222 removal with h2o2 was assessed 193 the efficiencies in the dye removal were 54 5 and 90 4 using the magnetic sodium alginate and magnetic sodium alginate h2o2 processes respectively gogoi et al 194 coated fe3o4 nps with β cyclodextrin β cd fe3o4 nps to stabilize the nps and increase their surface functional groups the fe3o4 nps and β cyclodextrin form composites by hydrogen bond through hydroxyl groups or by covalent bonding the nanocomposite showed high crystallinity a size range of 10 2 nm and a saturation magnetization that allows their magnetic recovery the efficiency in the ebt removal was compared between β cd fe3o4 and fe3o4 np at the same conditions it was found that the highest efficiency in ebt removal was for β cd fe3o4 nps with 90 degradation while the fe3o4 nps achieved a 65 removal hence the catalytic activity of fe3o4 was enhanced with the coating with β cyclodextrin furthermore β cd in the nps controlled the iron leaching toward the solution recently atta et al 195 synthesized fe3o4 nps functionalized with a poly ionic liquid based on quaternized dialkyl ethanolamine with 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonate co vinylpyrrolidone qampsa vp the efficiency of the coating to protect the fe3o4 nps from oxidation or thermal degradation and the catalytic activity of fe3o4 qapsa vp in the mb removal were assessed as a result the activity of qampsa vp fe3o4 catalyst in fenton reaction remained high by up to 7 cycles hence the coating of fe3o4 nps with qapsa vp prevents the iron leaching and improves their thermal and chemical stability finally to avoid the problem of the bounded operational ph range tang et al 2020 coated the fe3o4 nps prepared by hydrothermal methods with sulfur 196 the results showed that s fe3o4nps were capable to degrade effectively rhb at ph range of 3 9 while the bare fe3o4 nps exhibited inferior performance even in acidic ph 3 medium 6 2 transition metals modified nanoparticulate magnetite in azo and anthraquinone dye degradation in hr aops several studies have reported the use of transition metal substituted fe3o4 to enhance the performance of these nanomaterials in dye removal table 5 costa et al 176 proposed the possible reasons for the improvement in catalytic activity the first mechanism is the conjugation of redox pairs of iron species and substituent active ions in the production of oh then the generation of oxygen vacancies as active sites on the catalyst surface occurs through adjustments for unequal charge substitutions or cationic deficiency in the structure of modified iron oxide these vacancies can be related directly to the degradation of the dye or indirectly to generate oh tehrani bagha et al 178 evaluated the performance of copper ferrite nps cufe2o4 as adsorbent and as catalyst in cwpo for rr120 removal the aim of the study was to assess the effect of temperature ph and catalyst and h2o2 dosage as well as the recovery and reuse of the catalyst the results showed that the optimal conditions corresponded to ph 3 temperature 75 c catalyst dosage 0 02 g l 1 and h2o2 10 mm which is comparable with typical fenton process the reaction achieved the complete removal of rr120 50 mg l 1 in approximately 30 min while at ph 6 the complete removal was achieved in 45 min of reaction although the catalyst presented high efficiency it also showed drawbacks related to the optimal performance at elevated temperature which could increase the treatment cost in addition huang et al 2018 made the isomorphic substitution of fe2 with cu2 by oxidative precipitation combined ionothermal synthesis 197 they assessed the efficiency of fe3 xcuxo4 x 0 06 0 12 and 0 23 nps to decompose h2o2 for rhb degradation the highest catalytic activity was obtained for fe2 88cu0 12o4 nps the enhanced performance of copper ferrite in comparison with f3o4 was explained considering that the surface cu2 ions expedite the regeneration of fenton active species fe2 by reduction of fe3 with hoo radicals or cu2 cations however after eighth cycles the efficiency decreased from 95 2 to 84 7 88 7 due to particle aggregation or catalyst loss during the recycled process in order to assess the catalytic activity of fe3o4 substituted with transition metals mfe2o4 ferrites m cu2 mn2 fe2 zn2 were prepared by co precipitation and their efficiency to remove phenol in presence of h2o2 was studied 198 cu ferrite showed the higher efficiency with 78 of phenol removal in 175 min ph 6 mn2 zn2 and fe2 ferrites presented about 50 or less of phenol removal in the same conditions one plausible reason for which the replacement of fe2 with cu2 led to higher efficiency in the degradation of phenol could be due to the higher redox potential of copper compared to the other metals used furthermore the cationic dye removal was also evaluated obtaining that the mn2 ferrites were most suitable this might be due to the higher adsorption of cationic dyes on the surface of mn2 ferrites owing to this depending on the surface charge of the catalyst and the molecular charge of the contaminant furthermore cufe2o4 nps have been prepared by co precipitation methods and then they were incorporated on paa hydrogel using water soluble crosslinker n n methylene bis acrylamide 199 this nanocomposite was employed to remove mb from water obtaining a 98 of removal in 125 min due to the adsorption and fenton like processes mg2 has also been employed as a substitute of fe2 ions in fe3o4 to synthesize improved catalysts for dye removal zhang et al 200 synthesized mgfe2o4 nanorods with a size of 50 nm and were used as catalyst in fenton like oxidation of cr solution after 120 min with a temperature of 80 c 95 of the initial dye was removed using 40 mg mgfe2o4 nanorods and 75 mg l 1 h2o2 as an external oxidant furthermore the recovery and reusability were assessed obtaining a removal efficiency of 80 after 5 cycles ivanets et al 201 employed magnesium ferrite nps mgfe2o4 nps and metal loaded mn2 co2 ni2 and cu2 mgfe2o4 nps in fenton like oxidation for mb degradation in aqueous solution under visible light and dark all samples of mgfe2o4 loaded with metals showed less catalytic activity which might be owing to the blocking of fe containing active centers are engaged in the formation of oh in addition mgfe2o4 catalyst presented suitable stability to a wide range of ph hence this could allow to avoid the ph value correction by the acidification of effluents and to elude the formation of undesirable acidic wastewater the sample of mgfe2o4 loaded with mn showed a large release of mn2 ions into the solution hence they are not suitable to act as catalysts in fenton like reactions the substitution of fe2 with co2 in the fe3o4 structure was carried out through oxidation precipitation method by alrozi et al 202 the obtained fe3 xcoxo4 catalyst was employed in the oxidative degradation of ao7 in presence of h2o2 as a result the co2 substituted fe3o4 showed higher efficiency in the ao7 degradation in addition rahim pouran 172 reported the use of nb4 and mo4 substituted fe3o4 in the mb removal the presence of transition metal significantly enhanced the degradation fulfilling the removal in 180 min the proposed factors that may affect the mb involve an increase in the surface area improved oh generation and fe2 regeneration by thermodynamically favorable nb4 nb5 and mo4 mo6 redox pairs increase of oxygen vacancies that serve as active sites on the catalyst surface and the participation of peroxo niobium in the degradation process in addition the leaching of iron was ineligible in neutral and basic condition and insignificant in acid condition furthermore rahim pouran et al 203 prepared a heterogeneous catalyst by isomorphic substitution of iron ions of fe3o4 with molybdenum mo ions regarding that mo mo4 65 pm and mo6 59 pm and iron fe2 61 pm and fe3 55 pm species have the similar ionic radii the fe2 62mo0 21o4 catalyst showed considerable activity with complete mb removal within 150 min this experimental finding was associated with the enlarged surface area the role of surface mo4 mo6 redox pairs and the oxygen vacancies among the aops in addition to those that involve the use of oh radicals as oxidizing agents oxidation process of organic pollutants using sulfate radical so4 generated from persulfate ps peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have also been studied the so4 radicals have the advantage that they can be produced in a wide ph range have a long half life and high selectivity for the oxidation 204 recently dou et al 181 synthesized ferrites with the formula of comnxfe2 xo4 and evaluated their efficiency in decomposing harmful oii azo dye in oxidant hso3 chemocatalysis process they observed that the samples containing manganese showed higher degrading capability of oii than that of the pure cobalt ferrite with the addition of nahso3 the comn0 2fe1 8o4 nahso3 system presented the higher optimum catalytic it could be seen that mn iii species were activated by hso3 and played a significant role in the process of chemical catalysis deng et al 204 prepared cofe2o4 nps functionalized with ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid or edta edta cofe2o4 by modified one pot hydrothermal process and they were applied for the oxidation of orange g og using pms as oxidizing agent the produced catalyst had high dispersion in aqueous solution with saturation magnetization enough to be recovered using an external magnet the edta cofe2o4 showed higher performance in og removal than that of cofe2o4 under the same conditions however due to the loss of the catalyst and the leaching of cobalt ions a decrease in the catalytic activity after fourth cycles was observed das et al 205 prepared a ni supported on hydroxyapatite encapsulated cobalt ferrite nanocomposite ni hap cofe2o4 and was employed to remove mb and mo from aqueous solutions in presence of h2o2 as a result the catalyst accomplished a degradation of 90 and 99 1 of mb and mo respectively in 90 min furthermore the catalyst exhibits superparamagnetic behavior hence could be recovered from the medium reaction by application of an external magnetic field furthermore xian et al 206 synthesized mfe2o4 m co2 cu2 mn2 and zn2 by sol gel method and their capability to generate sulfate radical so4 from ps was evaluated the so4 radicals are capable of decomposing organic pollutants hence the catalytic performance of mfe2o4 to degrade ao was assessed obtaining that cufe2o4 showed the greater catalytic activity with 87 6 of dye besides cofe2o4 mnfe2o4 znfe2o4 followed with solids with less catalytic performance in addition deng et al 207 prepared ordered mesoporous mnfe2o4 nps and this composite was employed for oii degradation using pms as oxidizing agent although a high efficiency 97 31 of oii removal was achieved there was a greater release of mn2 toward the solution which led to a decrease in the dye removal in the subsequent cycles in order to avoid the drawbacks associated with the poor catalytic performance of mnfe2o4 du et al 208 prepared catalyst based on mnfe2o4 and shell of pyrolyzed cs for activating ps to produce so4 radicals the modifications with cs enhanced significantly the specific surface area of mnfe2o4 besides the catalyst was employed to degrade ao7 the high efficiency in the ao7 removal was obtained for the catalyst calcined at 600 c under optimal conditions the catalyst could remove up to 99 of ao7 however after the second and third cycles the removal decreased to 78 0 and 56 7 respectively owing to the dissolution of metals into solution although the application of so4 radicals as oxidants of organic pollutants could be highly efficient several drawbacks must be taken into consideration mainly the contamination with sulfate salts or even worse newly created hazardous compounds 209 hence the use of oxidants containing sulfur should be analyzed in detail due to the potential generation of hazardous degradation products that would require subsequent treatment 210 the use of fe3o4 substituted with transition metals allows the operation of fenton like reactions in neutral ph which is environmentally preferred besides ferrites are more stable at neutral ph than low or high ph conditions 198 6 3 supported and matrix dispersed magnetite nps the use of proper materials as supports of nanosized fe3o4 have shown to be a suitable strategy to avoid the aggregation of fe3o4 nps these materials such as magnetic nanocomposites have been widely synthesized and employed as nanozymes to remove dyes table 6 cao et al 212 synthesized fe3o4 nps immobilized on the surface of graphene oxide go and functionalized by the triethanolamine tea and its oxidized products the obtained nps showed an average particle size of approximately 28 6 nm which was evaluated from the particle size distribution curve the efficiency in mb removal was compared between naked fe3o4 nps and tea go fe3o4 nps the removal rate of fe3o4 nps was smaller due to the agglomeration of magnetic particles hence tea go fe3o4 composite prevents agglomeration of nps and accelerates the mb removal the recovery and reusability also were evaluated obtaining that the catalytic activity decreased after several cycles which might be due to the loss of tea go fe3o4 during recovery and the partial change in tea structure during the degradation fe3o4 ceo2 composites were synthesized through impregnation calcination method using mesoporous ceo2 as support and the efficiency in the mb removal was assessed 184 the composites showed high adsorption which might be due to the abundant oxygen vacancies at the surface that facilitate the adsorption of mb on the surface of the catalyst and the large pore volume furthermore considerable fenton catalytic performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect between fe2 and ce4 that favors the electron transfer in the fenton reaction system in addition the loss of metal toward the reaction medium was low iron 0 22 mg l 1 and cerium 0 63 mg l 1 which might indicate the high stability of the composite fe3o4 nps were deposited onto borosilicate glass and the composite was utilized in fenton like reaction for decolorization of br18 and ar88 dyes 213 the ph fe3o4 loading dye concentration and h2o2 dosage effects were studied the reaction was carried out under 250 rpm stirring speed and 25 1 c the optimal ph values to achieve the maximum removal efficiencies were 3 5 and 6 0 for br18 51 and ar88 95 respectively in addition the suitable dye concentration h2o2 concentration and fe3o4 loading were determined as 0 1 mm 10 mm and 2 g l 1 respectively furthermore the stability of fe3o4 nps coated on glass substrate was compared with powder fe3o4 obtaining that the stability was higher for fe3o4 nps coated on the borosilicate glass deng et al 128 used carbon nanotubes cnts as support for fe3o4 to remove oii the tem micrograph showed that fe3o4 nps were highly dispersed on cnts and they did not aggregate furthermore the efficiency in oii 0 25 mmol l 1 removal of both fe3o4 nps and f3o4 cnts were compared using 500 mg l 1 of each catalyst the results showed that fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 cnts removed 37 1 and 94 0 of dye this indicated that the catalytic activity of fe3o4 was enhanced using cnts as support lima et al 214 used ac prepared from coconut shells as support of iron oxides they assessed the influence of the iron content 2 5 5 10 15 on the catalytic properties of the catalysts the results showed that the ac iron oxide magnetite with a core of hematite catalyst with 15 of iron was the most active in the mb removal by adsorption and fenton reaction this was mainly due to the high iron amount on the surface magnetic cobalt ferrites cofe2o4 on activated carbon ac nanocomposites were also synthesized by chen et al 215 the nanocomposites were employed in catalysis with potassium hydrogen persulfate pms to degrade mb cofe2o4 acted as the catalyst for so4 active radicals in the removal of organic pollutants besides the superparamagnetic behavior of the catalyst allowed their separation through a magnetic field the mb removal was about 96 after four cycles indicating the good stability and reusability of the employed catalyst guan et al 216 prepared cufe2o4 supported on rectorite sludge derived biochar to obtain cufe2o4 rsdbc composites which were employed to obtain so4 radicals from persulfate for ao7 removal they determined the optimal reaction conditions being ps concentration 2 mm catalyst dosage 0 6 g l 1 initial ph value 7 0 and 25 c of reaction temperature under these conditions a 95 of ao7 removal was achieved while 82 3 of dye removal was maintained after the third cycle recently sadaf et al 217 have developed magnetic nano biocomposites cnps with iron oxide nps stabilized with wheat straw cellulose they studied the mo removal by both adsorption and catalytic activity the results showed that the maximal removal of the dye by adsorption was only 10 even at 5 mg ml 1 while cnps with h2o2 act as peroxidase mimics removing 30 of the mo at 5 mg ml 1 concentration and ph 5 0 however the highest dye removal efficiency of cnps was observed at ph 3 0 with 100 efficiency which could be due to their peroxidase activity being the highest under acidic ph conditions in addition the thermal and ph stability of cnps were studied in comparison with commercial peroxidase cnps were active in the wide ph range of 3 9 and at 65 c for 48 h while the commercial peroxidase lost 50 of its activity after 1 h and was stable only in a ph range of 6 0 7 0 liu et al 187 synthesized biomass activated carbon bac from waste biomass fallen platanus orientalis leaves as support of fe3o4 nps fe3o4 bac was evaluated in mb degradation determining the optimal experimental conditions and reaction mechanism as a result fe3o4 bac 1 2 showed a high crystallinity uniform particle size and good dispersibility furthermore the nanocomposite permitted the mb removal with good capability for recycling in addition the mb removal by fe3o4 bac in presence of h2o2 correspond to oh radical mechanism jiao et al 46 compared the catalytic activity of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 nps on cellulose aerogels fe3o4 ca in fenton like degradation of rhb the fe3o4 ca nanocomposite was synthesized through a hydrothermal method the results showed that the supported nps presented enhanced activity achieving a 100 of rhb removal in 64 h the homogeneous dispersion of fe3o4 nps in the cellulose aerogel increased the active sites for fenton like reaction cs is a linear natural polysaccharide which has been widely employed as support of fe3o4 nps however the cs has a poor mechanical strength which affects its degradation efficiency hence glut can be employed to stabilize cs hou et al 218 also utilized hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 ha to improve the stability of cs this composite was used as support of fe3o4 to develop a heterogeneous fenton catalyst to remove ay220 from water the magnetic composite could remove as high as 95 of the dye through adsorption and catalysis that coexist during the process of heterogeneous fenton like reaction cellulose is an organic polymer with vast abundance in nature this polymer constitutes a suitable support for fe3o4 catalyst due to its biodegradability renewable properties large surface area and mechanical properties furthermore cellulose contains strong inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonds owing to abundance of hydroxyl groups which may allow their surface modification to anchor efficiently the fe3o4 nps 115 fe3o4 nps were synthesized by co precipitation in presence of the modified micro crystalline cellulose bearing the macrocyclic moieties with schiff base units 219 the macrocyclic chelating system was made as outlined below dialdehyde cellulose dac was modified with o phenylenediamine phda through schiff base formation between the carbonyl group of dac and the active amino group of pda posteriorly a polycondensation of benzil bz with phda cross linked cellulose phda g dac was carried out obtaining 1 2 diphenylethanedione c cellulose 2 3 bis benzene 1 2 diamine bz phda g dac finally the fe3o4 nps were deposited into the concavity of functionalized amino cellulose via an in situ process to obtain hybrid bz phda g dac fe3o4 nps this nanocomposite could disperse in aqueous solution which made it appropriate to be applied as a catalyst in fenton like reaction then the catalyst was utilized in ay17 removal in comparison with fe3o4 nps obtaining that the cellulose schiff base enhanced the mass transfer of pollutants towards the active sites fe2 fe3 during the reaction hence the complete removal of ay17 was obtained in 30 min of reaction under optimal conditions lu et al 220 prepared fe3o4 nps on pretreated cellulose the cellulose was treated through mechanical activation and metal salts mafcc to break its inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonds and stable structure besides fe3o4 nps also were supported on cellulose only treated with mechanical activation mac then the fe3o4 nps were anchored on the pre treated cellulose surface by co precipitation the obtained catalysts were employed in a fenton like system for mb removal the fe3o4 mac and fe3o4 mafcc catalysts showed high catalytic activity achieving a 90 8 and 98 2 respectively furthermore after ten cycles the efficiency in the degradation went down to 37 8 for fe3o4 mac and 61 2 for fe3o4 mafcc this loss in the catalytic activity of fe3o4 mac could be due to the detachment of the fe3o4 nps from the surface of cellulose during the degradation while the fe3o4 mafcc was the most stable owing to the strong interaction between mafcc and fe3o4 qin et al 115 prepared magnetic composite nanospheres by anchoring the fe3o4 nps on the surface of carboxyl cellulose nanospheres via co precipitation the obtained nanocomposite showed superparamagnetic behavior which allowed its recovery through an external magnetic field the catalytic efficiency of nanocomposite to remove navy blue nb was evaluated by using it as a catalyst in fenton like reaction in presence of h2o2 the maximum removal of 98 0 was achieved at 5 min and 75 0 of the removal efficiency could be maintained after five cycles under optimized conditions gao et al 62 synthesized anisotropic fe3o4 nps nanorods in a hydrogel matrix sodium 2 acrylamido 2 methyl 1 propanesulfonate hydrogel pnaamps and assessed the performance of this nanocomposite to remove mb rhb and cr from water as a result the hybrid nanocomposites removed the dyes due to the combination of the catalytic activities of fe3o4 nps and the adsorption capacities of hydrogel networks the decolorization was completed with 2 min of adsorption and 3 min of degradation in addition only 25 of cr was removed in 150 s of adsorption and 180 s of degradation due to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic dye and the anionic hydrogel while cationic rhb removal was 85 at the same time lu et al 221 used cellulose microfibrils cmf as support of fe3o4 nps and cu based metal organic framework hkust 1 the hkust 1 fe3o4 cmf composite catalyst was characterized and then it was employed in mb removal by adsorption and fenton like reaction the adsorption capacity toward mb of the composite was 68 while the degradation efficiency in the presence of h2o2 was of 98 which went down to 91 5 after five cycles the catalytic mechanism with hydrogen peroxide requires that the hydrogen peroxide reacts with the magnetite generating the hydroxyl and other radicals with the dye near the surface of the supported magnetite the reaction proceeds fig 4 shows the relative sizes and the interaction of a local model of magnetite mag with an anthraquinone dye alizarin red s and hydrogen peroxide fig 5 shows the interaction of an azo dye orange ii with an immobilized mag the support could be any solid where the magnetite is immobilized these figures show the steric interactions of the dyes with the mag and the surface the efficiency of a pollutant degradation in the case of the use of hydrogen peroxide needs a discussion about the efficiency of the oxidant production our group has published about the fenton mechanism homogeneous and heterogeneous 223 there have been several controversies related to the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide activation and even the secondary reactions see manuscripts of kremer 224 the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide conversion to free radicals and ions is strongly dependent on the reaction media composition see references in 223 several strategies have been explored to avoid in fenton the hydrogen peroxide decomposition for one side the catalatic reaction and to improve the conversion to active species in dye degradation the discussion is active in terms of different models for the fenton reaction haber and weiss barb et al and kremer 224 in the radical model the ideal ratio is 1 1 for fe2 and h2o2 whereas it is 2 1 for the o2 generation through the formation of a feo2 experimentally the optimum ratios to obtain high dyes degradation and chemical oxygen demand cod reduction is much higher the recent manuscript of giwa et al 2020 demonstrated in homogeneous fenton for methylene blue degradation that the optimum ratio h2o2 fe2 was near 175 when fe2 was 4 mm at ph 3 and 298 k with hydrogen peroxide at 70 mm 225 this manuscript shows that an excess of hydrogen peroxide is needed due to secondary reactions to decompose methylene blue mb the excess depends on ph reaction media composition and temperature the results were close to those reported on fenton treatment regarding the degradation of azo dyes the effective condition was reported at an iron to hydrogen peroxide ratio of 1 20 in dye degradation 226 at an initial mb concentration of around 20 mg l 1 the fenton process was operative as a color degradation efficiency of 98 8 within 30 min with a cod removal of 85 several strategies have been explored to increase the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide and to decrease the concentration of iron and hydrogen peroxide with similar dye degradation among them the step addition of hydrogen peroxide has been reported 227 the interest in heterogeneous fenton and the possibility of the application at industrial level fuels the research in this area 7 synergistic effect of adsorption and fenton like reaction 7 1 general previous work bello et al 228 published an overview on the application of combined adsorption aops for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from water they concluded that some advantages of integrating adsorption with aops include higher performance shorter treatment time and regeneration of spent adsorbents the combination of adsorption and fenton oxidation could be employed with two different aims the ionzyme with dual function adsorbent and catalyst in fenton like reaction or as a part of a system for which it only plays the role of catalyst in the fenton like reaction 228 first ionzymes can act either as adsorbent and heterogeneous catalyst for instance li et al 184 employed fe3o4 ceo2 composite to remove mb in this case the composite fulfils a dual function role as both adsorbent and fenton like catalyst in presence of h2o2 the ceo2 had abundant vacancies of ce3 which gives it a great capacity of adsorption and the fe2 and ce4 generate an effect synergistic that enhances the catalytic activity without h2o2 addition the efficiency in the removal was lower while when h2o2 was added the mb removal was improved second the adsorption can be used as a process integrated with oxidation either as fenton like or as sulfate radical mediated oxidation as a complement for example chen et al 215 used magnetic cobalt ferrites cofe2o4 activated carbon ac nanocomposites as catalysts for potassium hydrogen persulfate pms to degrade mb in this case the cofe2o4 acted as a catalyst in the generation of sulfate radicals while the activated carbon accomplished the role of adsorbent creating a synergistic effect in the dye removal in addition lu et al 220 prepared hkust 1 fe3o4 cmf composite catalyst both cellulose microfibrils and hkust 1 act as adsorbents while the fenton like reaction was catalyzed by fe3o4 nps when fe3o4 nps were used in presence of h2o4 only a 25 of mb was removed while fe3o4 cmf and fe3o4 hkust 1 could remove 50 and 67 respectively when fe3o4 cmf hkust 1 composite was used the efficiency in the mb removal went up to 98 indicating a synergistic effect between the adsorption and fenton like reaction the problem with these approaches is that a potential contaminant is added such as the persulfate salt 7 2 published literature by our group about these topics in the last years the catalysis group in plapiqui has studied the synthesis and application of iron oxides as adsorbents and as part of biocatalysts as support of enzymes and biomimetics in fenton heterogeneous reactions the removal of aromatic compounds by processes based on enzymes or their biomimetics has been a focus of research hpr particularly the c isoenzyme or hrpc the most abundant has been the subject of exhaustive study in multiple applications in the elimination of phenol and aniline derived compounds the hrp immobilization is a necessary step to make the process cost effective otherwise it would be prohibitively expensive furthermore the use of biomimetics of the hrp as iron porphyrins and iron or ferrous complexes with aniline ligands have also been extensively researched ferreira 229 demonstrated through characterization studies using ultraviolet uv visible light that unsupported soluble complexes of this type are capable of activate h2o2 and generating free radicals besides saidman et al 230 studied the immobilization of hrp and hematin in fe3o4 with the aim of removing aniline by polymerization posteriorly pirillo et al 231 assessed the ability of goethite co substituted goethite and fe3o4 to adsorb dyes with azo ebbr anthraquinone ars and aril methane fluorescein groups this was carried out via adsorption isotherms and kinetic analysis the results showed that all iron oxides were effective adsorbents to remove dyes from solution ars exhibited the highest affinity with the adsorbents evaluated while fluorescein showed the lowest affinity co goethite goethite magnetite furthermore the effect of the ph in the adsorption process was also studied 232 these studies allowed to infer that the iron oxides might be promising dye adsorbents and that the magnetic properties of the fe3o4 could facilitate their recovery from treated effluents in a subsequent study pirillo et al 5 compared the adsorption abilities of fe3o4 and goethite α fe3 o oh with a biopolymer chitosan using ars ebbr and fluorescein as a model dyes they found that chitosan had higher adsorption capacity for ars and ebbr than iron oxides while goethite showed higher adsorption for fluoresceine at ph 5 and 9 this might occur since the adsorption capacity of chitosan is related to the availability of amino groups in its structure which in turn depends on ph pirillo et al 233 carried out a comparative analysis between hrp and hematin as catalysts in the removal of ebbr and fluorescein dyes using h2o2 as oxidizing agent both catalysts were efficient in the ebbr removal with dissimilar mechanisms while fluorescein was only oxidized by hrp however it presented low efficiency at high dye concentration in addition the immobilization of hrp and hematin on magnetite activated carbon activated carbon and chitosan was carried out 234 the supported biocatalysts were applied in the ars and ebbr removal the biocatalyst based on magnetite activated carbon and activated carbon were discarded the chitosan glut hrp biocatalyst showed low adsorption capacity and the enzymatic activity of hrp in ebbr removal could not be evident besides the performance of chitosan glut hematin in ebbr removal was influenced by the dye concentration and the mass of catalyst while the temperature had no significant effect on the dye degradation h2o2 concentration of 0 021 m a relevant aspect of this study was the adsorption of dyes on the support used i e fe3o4 acted as a dye adsorbent and a mimetic due to the surface iron reaction with h2o2 recently cabrera et al 235 mathematically described the kinetics of degradation reaction of oii alkaline solution catalyzed by hematin as mimetics of peroxidase using h2o2 as oxidizing agent the peroxidatic pseudo catalatic model was selected as the most suitable for a wide range of conditions 25 400 mg l 1 oii concentration 2 4 10 mm h2o2 concentration and 3 17 mg l 1 hematin concentration at room temperature and alkaline ph 10 6 this model involves two reversible inactivation routes h2o2 and oii efe formation and e oii formation the study of the proper synthesis of fe3o4 nps based catalysts and their use in combination with h2o2 for azo and anthraquinone dye degradation would be appropriate in this sense as a precedent nicolás et al 84 synthesized fe3o4 based mnps through co precipitation method using oleic acid as stabilizer then the fe3o4 nps were coated with chitosan biopolymer via nanoprecipitation the tem micrographics showed high agglomeration of naked fe3o4 and sizes of around 10 nm while the fe3o4 coated with oleic acid exhibited better dispersion and sizes between 13 20 nm a relevant aspect in the co precipitation method is the order in which the additives and alkali solution are added although the nps modified with chitosan contain a minimal amount of fe3o4 they showed satisfactory magnetic properties thus the subject has evolved from the application of enzymes and their biomimetics to the mimetics of enzymes based on iron oxides ionzymes 8 innovations for known problems in environmental solutions the problems reviewed in this manuscript have hindered the diffusion of the nps in the field of textile effluent remediation the leaching of iron may be solved with the adequate support and binding of the nps to an adequate support through the adequate protocol by using cross linkers and or modifiers the immobilized nps increase their stability and the goal is that they maintain their activity in the target reaction the innovation in this field requires to know about the textile or paper industry and how difficult technically is to introduce new equipment or new procedures in general changes are slow and expensive to be implemented therefore the field should explore additional aspects to consider if the implementation of the nps with h2o2 to clear color is the goal these additional aspects include a the easy introduction and extraction of the catalytic solid using low cost equipment b the reuse of the catalytic solid or the adsorbent whereas it is possible c the adequate disposal of the generated solid waste after adsorption or the use of the exhausted solids supported magnetite and or adsorbent in other environmental application d the detection of new avenues of innovation in textile effluent treatment process textile factories with effluent treatment plants etp have several problems among them the inadequate treatment due to incorrect dosing of chemicals required in the treatment process with inactivity and even death of microorganisms this takes place due to the ph insufficient oxygen or lack of nutrients all of these can be addressed through chemical dosing a new method should use the same equipment and installations it should increase productivity and efficient use of water flow and it should generate an important change in improved operativity textile industry generates a big volume of wastewater including chemicals used in dyeing printing and finishing processes the physicochemical treatment always comes before the biological treatment units it is clear that the oxidation with h2o2 using immobilized magnetite nps is a secondary or tertiary treatment the introduction of innovation about how the catalytic solid is introduced in the effluent treatment plant or etp is key to future success the effluents treated with aops were found to reduce 70 80 cod when compared to 30 45 reduction in biological treatment 236 other topic of importance is the reuse of the generated solids when using adsorbents and catalytic solids in aops the contaminant changes its place from a solution to a solid and transforms the catalyst or adsorbent in solid waste after several uses and exhaustion therefore the nature is changed from wastewater to solid waste however after using the immobilized magnetite has adsorbed several organic compounds when magnetite is supported it includes the role of the support as dye adsorbent these adsorbed compounds could be ligands for transition metal ions dissolved in water such as fig 6 shows the cost effective solids based on nanomaterials combined with biological substrates have been considered heavy metal adsorbents 237 those adsorbents require little processing are abundant in nature or are a by product or waste material from another industry and can be denominated as low cost adsorbents 238 minimal treatment or conditioning of the spent adsorbent could allow its subsequent application as a heavy metal adsorbent in this sense the industrial solid wastes particularly the exhausted adsorbent gain relevance soliman and moustafa 239 reviewed several factors such as ph temperature adsorbent dosage and contact time that influence heavy metal adsorption onto industrial solid wastes the heavy metal removal will be conditioned by chemical structure of the adsorbent surface area and availability of surface active centers hence an adequate characterization of solid adsorbent is a fundamental aspect to later consider its potential application even more ma and liu 240 propose the use of contaminant laden adsorbents cr6 fe3o4 c as anodes with high potassium storage capacity additionally the ash of waste adsorbents based on biomass have been considered partial cement replacement as well as aggregates in the concrete production 241 the value given to waste would allow the reduction of the use of raw material as well as the production of waste to be disposed of the landfill disposal of waste adsorbent is not environmentally advisable due to the presence of inorganics in them and the risk of contaminant leaching in this way the use of biomass including magnetite and adsorbed organic compounds has been recently reported as interesting in cement biofuels and in the adsorption of heavy metals from contaminated wastewaters including hg2 the exhausted catalysts used in aops in etp could be used to solve other environmental problems such as the heavy metal contamination in the wastewater of other industries the topic of the further use of exhausted catalytic materials and adsorbents from the textile or paper industry effluents as adsorbents fillers or sources of high value products will be explored in a future manuscript 9 conclusions the development of nanozymes nanomaterials with intrinsic enzymatic properties has emerged as an appealing alternative to the natural enzymes with application potential in several fields particularly the iron oxide based nanozymes ionzymes have demonstrated high efficiency in the recalcitrant organic compounds for instance azo and anthraquinone dyes removal from water in fenton like process due to the intrinsic peroxidase like activity of iron oxide nps in addition ionzymes can be combined with a wide gamma of materials which constitute a significant challenge the use of oh radical from h2o2 seems to be promising due to the high efficiency in the dye removal however the use of so4 is being studied and although the generation of sulfate radicals as an oxidant agent shows high efficiency the sulfate leaving in the treated water has a negative effect on the environment the treated effluent with this process could require desulfidation as posterior treatment which increment the process cost among the strategies used to improve the performance of fe3o4 based nanozymes the stabilization and functionalization of nps with different compounds have been explored this allows to reduce the agglomeration of nps which negatively affects its catalytic efficiency in fenton like reaction however optimal reaction conditions comprising acidic ph and high temperatures lead to the search of other mechanisms of improvement to overcome these shortcomings the isomorphic substitution of fe2 ions in the fe3o4 with other transition metals proves to be a suitable alternative mainly with cu2 according to the literature reviewed in addition the use of materials as catalyst support allows providing greater stability to the nanocomposite and generating synergistic effects between adsorption and fenton like catalytic activity intrinsic to fe3o4 nps the potential of using aops in desorption and regeneration of spent adsorbents is attractive aops can regenerate spent adsorbents by degrading the adsorbed pollutants as has been demonstrated in many studies besides the use of supports derived from biomass seems to be promising since it implies the use of renewable sources of materials which might be environmentally sustainable the high performance of nanozymes in small scale experiments is evident but the application in environmental remediation is still limited among the disadvantages that still need to be investigated in depth are the acidic ph as an optimal reaction condition the dissolution of metal ions in the reaction medium the deactivation of the catalyst and the generation of contaminating by products that require an adequate final disposal hence the knowledge to apply nanozymes in the remediation of colored effluents is still in continuous development another aspect to consider is the output of the process of dyed wastewater remediation when supported ionzymes are used because of the treatment the exhausted catalytic and adsorbent solids become waste at present their application in other processes is being explored this valorization of the exhausted adsorbent could be a possibility to open new directions for waste management toward reuse in effective practical applications declaration of competing

13572,dyes are recalcitrant organic compounds that generate environmental damage heterogeneous fenton like catalysts catalytic systems using reusable solid state catalysts as an alternative for fe2 in solution have gained widespread attention in dye removal this article reviews and discusses the catalytic activity and stability enhancement in fenton like processes the reported strategies to improve performance were coating and functionalization of magnetic nanoparticles substitution of magnetite with transition metals as well as the use of organic supports with a focus on biomass derivatives the precursors and the synthetic routes of iron oxide nanoparticles can be adjusted to tune the properties of resulting solids hence the common techniques applied in the synthesis and characterization of nanosized iron oxides were briefly summarized besides the application and efficiency of ionzymes iron oxides nanozymes in azo and anthraquinone dye removal were also analyzed highlighting the synergistic effect between adsorption and fenton like processes the knowledge to apply ionzymes in the remediation of colored effluents is still in continuous development due to several unsolved problems the main challenges to overcome are the acidic ph as an optimal reaction condition the dissolution of metal ions in the reaction medium the deactivation of catalysts and the generation of contaminating by products finally an obstacle identified in the process output was the disposal of exhausted catalysts and adsorbents these could be applied in further remediation of other contaminants this will imply a huge innovation effort to minimize the resulting waste and to simultaneously reduce the consumption of raw material in another process keywords ionzyme dye advanced oxidation process nanoparticle wastewater treatment 1 introduction the contamination of freshwater bodies due to industrial development economic activities and rapid population growth has become a global critical issue over the past few decades 1 complex effluents are generated by industries such as textile cosmetic pharmaceutical paper food among others 2 textile industries are the main source of dyed wastewater 3 the resulting effluents acquire significant importance due to their high content of synthetic organic compounds such as dyes surfactants and persistent molecules as well as metal salts 4 textile effluents are commonly highly colored and they have high chemical cod and biological demands of oxygen bod about 15 of the total dye is lost in the dyeing process hence the textile industries discharging approximately 1 000 000 kg year of dyes in their effluents 5 dyes are colorful natural or synthetic substances which have been used by humans for several applications 6 they are organic compounds consisting of chromophores no2 no nn co cs cc etc and auxochromes oh nh2 nhr nr2 cl cooh etc 2 7 the chromophores are responsible for imparting color to dyes the auxochromes enhance the color intensity or influence the dye solubility there are more than 100 000 kinds of dyes 1 60 70 of them correspond with azo ones 2 6 azo dyes are characterized by having complex and stable structures due to the combination of azo groups with aromatic rings 7 8 which hinder its biodegradation according to easton 1995 the second most important class after azo dyes corresponds to anthraquinone compounds which represents 15 of total dye 9 it is expected that the global dyes and pigments market size reach usd 49 1 billion by 2027 and the textile application dominates the market being the reactive and disperse dyes the most demanded ones 10 the manufacturing or processing operations release considerable amounts of insufficiently treated or untreated effluents into water bodies and exert negative impact on aquatic ecosystems 1 some of these undesirable effects include turbidity eutrophication aesthetic problems and aggravation of aquatic life 11 dyes impede the passage of sunlight 8 reducing the photosynthesis with the consequent decrease of dissolved oxygen in natural waters 12 furthermore the population s health is put at risk due to the toxic and carcinogenic effects of dyes 13 14 therefore the development of efficient processes capable of producing effluents which do not exceed the permitted limits of pollutants is urgently needed these processes must fulfill certain requirements to respond to the 12 principles of green chemistry which have been defined as the design of chemical products and procedures which allow reducing and eliminating the use and synthesis of hazardous substances 15 such requirements include among others environmental safety low cost and efficiency to remove large amounts of dyes in a short time span 16 the removal of complex molecules of dyes from wastewater has been done through several techniques such as adsorption 17 18 coagulation flocculation 11 19 ultra and nanofiltration membranes 20 21 chemical oxidation 22 and biological methods using enzymes 23 table 1 presents advantages and disadvantages of the main methods of treatment for dye removal some treatments are efficient but their prohibitive costs of investment and operation or the generation of secondary waste impose limitations for its large scale application 24 25 additionally improper treatment could lead to the generation of intermediaries which are more toxic than the original dyes 26 therefore the main objective of several recent published manuscripts was the removal of these recalcitrant dyes by effective means adsorption method involves the use of suitable material to remove pollutants from the aqueous medium it is considered as one of the most practical options since it has a lower initial cost simplicity of design simple operation and insensibility to toxic substances 27 this method is highly dependent on the nature and magnitude of adsorbent adsorbate interaction hence it is influenced by factors such as type of adsorbent adsorbent area particle size effluent ph temperature salts present in the wastewater dye dosage stirring speed and contact time 28 29 considerable efforts have been made to obtain inexpensive and effective adsorbents however due to the complex chemical structures of the dyes its removal by adsorption might not be completely efficient besides the process implies moving the dyes from one phase to another which may turn into a waste 24 consequently the adsorbent can be either regenerated by often environmentally incompatible procedures or discarded as waste leading to serious environmental issues 30 31 advanced oxidation processes aops have proven to be very effective methods in comparison with others to wastewater treatment 32 33 aop systems are considered environmentally sustainable provided that the energy consumption is low 34 conventional fenton reaction occurs in a homogeneous solution 35 36 in this reaction the fe2 ions are which accomplish the role of generating hydroxyl radicals oh whose high oxidizing power can completely mineralize complex organic molecules ideally particularly non biodegradable dyes 37 those processes which employed oh as oxidizing agent are widely referred to as hr aops despite being effective and selective the process also shows limitations as high dosage of the catalyst about 50 80 ppm of fe2 high consumption of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 h2o2 fe2 molar ratio 9 1 in optimal conditions and operation only at low ph 2 0 4 0 in addition they may present difficulty in catalyst recovery and generation of a ferric hydroxide sludge as contaminant sub product due to the excess iron dissolved in the solution 38 41 besides most of the textile effluents are alkaline not acid 2 the treatment and disposal of the iron sludge can represent up to 10 50 of the total operating cost 42 furthermore the requirement of a highly acid ph implies an increment in the associated costs since the process needs a ph adjustment before and after of the reaction 43 among aops fenton like and conventional fenton have been widely researched in the dyed effluent remediation 44 45 the generation of reactive oxygen species mainly oh from h2o2 is a fundamental principle of hr aops the oh is one of the strongest oxidant agents e 2 73 2 8 v these active radicals are capable of degrading all types of complex organic compounds present in wastewater into simpler organic compounds and might even achieve complete mineralization of them obtaining co2 and h2o 31 46 there are numerous reports of aops which use sulfate radical so4 e 2 5 3 1 v as oxidizing agent commonly denominated sr aops 47 48 these radicals have a high oxidation potential and considerable half life period react selectively toward organic compounds with non saturated bonds and aromatic π electrons and operate in a wide range of ph 49 50 however an important aspect which requires to be assessed is the possible generation of process specific by products mainly due to the release of sulfate ions since in this case the effluents would need additional treatment 50 51 in order to avoid the shortcomings of homogeneous fenton reaction intensive efforts have been directed to develop low cost and environmentally sustainable treatments seeking their application in large scale effluent remediation with the advance of nanotechnology during the last decades nanomaterials have raised great interest due to their capability of being applied to aops 25 the use of a solid in catalytic wet peroxide oxidation cwpo or heterogeneous fenton oxidation and in oxidation by so4 constitutes a promising alternative for dyed effluent treatment 40 42 the heterogeneous catalyst must be inexpensive with low leaching of transition metals operational for a wide ph range and with suitable catalytic activity 47 magnetic nanoparticles mnps mainly ferrites are promising for industrial scale polluted water treatment due to their tailored size straightforward composition low cost environmental compatibility magnetic behavior and surface functional properties 52 55 magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 nps with catalytic behavior similar to horseradish peroxidase hrp were first discovered by gao et al 56 the nanomaterials with enzyme like characteristics have been defined as nanozymes since then research studies regarding the use of fe3o4 based nanozymes as mimetics of the enzyme peroxidase have been widely developed several reviews have analyzed the synthesis functionalization and catalytic performance of fe3o4 based nanoscale systems 57 59 the magnetic behavior of fe3o4 nps offers the possibility of recovery by applying an external magnetic field 60 hence since additionally the fe3o4 nps exhibit robust peroxidase like activity are considered dual functional solids 61 besides fe3o4 nps have advantages such as low toxicity and economic viability which make them a suitable alternative to protein counterparts in fenton like processes to remove organic contaminants 62 however the use of only fe3o4 nps often shows a low catalytic activity accordingly several researchers have studied strategies to improve the efficiency of iron oxides in the degradation of pollutant molecules the purpose is to minimize negative effects of the processes on the environment and water qualities among these strategies structural modifications coating and functionalization of nps and utilization of varied materials as supports have been explored even more the problem of partial solubilization in water and the loss of iron to the solution is a serious drawback that needs solution through innovation the aim of this review was to present up to date information about the strategies to improve fe3o4 based nanomaterials activity and stability used as nanozymes in the fenton like processes to remove azo and anthraquinone dyes the precursors and the synthetic routes can be adjusted to tune the properties of resulting solids for this reason the common techniques employed in the synthesis and characterization of nanosized iron oxides were briefly summarized in addition the application and efficiency of fe3o4 based nanozymes in azo and anthraquinone dye removal was analyzed finally the challenges to be solved for the application of ionzymes in the remediation of colored effluents were presented the main dyes mentioned in the reports were summarized in table 2 2 structural and magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles iron oxides are characterized for their vast abundance in the earth and widely used due to their low cost they are non toxic materials with abundant distribution in nature in the form of various oxides the most common iron oxides are magnetite fe3o4 maghemite γ fe2o3 and hematite α fe2o3 67 68 the crystalline structure of iron oxides is formed by close packed arrays of anions oxygen in which the interstices are partially filled with cations fe ii or and fe iii in octahedral or tetrahedral coordination ferrite nps have the formula ab2o4 where a and b correspond to divalent and b correspond to trivalent cations respectively 69 in the fe3o4 since its structure is cubic inverse spinel the tetrahedral sites only contain fe iii ions while the octahedral sites are occupied by both fe iii and fe ii ions 38 70 71 specifically the inverse spinel crystal structure with a cubic unit cell of the fe3o4 has 32 oxygen ions arranged in a close packed array there are eight fe ii and eight fe iii ions in the octahedral sites while eight fe iii are occupying the tetrahedral sites the fe3o4 presents magnetic behavior since the octahedral sites contain equal numbers of fe2 and fe3 ions while the tetrahedral sites are filled only by fe3 ions since the number of fe3 ions is the same at both the octahedral and tetrahedral sites and the magnetic spin orientations of all a site ions being arranged in parallel and opposite directions to magnetic spin orientations of all b site ions the magnetic moments cancel each other out then the total net magnetization is due to the fe2 cations only 72 one of the most interesting aspects of nanotechnology is the possibility to obtain new properties when the size is nanometric particles smaller than 100 nm are called nanoparticles 73 at room temperature the fe3o4 in bulk is ferrimagnetic while the fe3o4 with size below to 6 8 nm is superparamagnetic 74 75 therefore the magnetic properties are not only related to the composition of nanomaterials but also to particle size 76 77 the coercivity is highly dependent on the size of nps as the particle diameter decreases the coercivity increases up to a specific value here all the magnetic spins are aligned and hence the magnetization is higher 78 however at a diameter smaller than a certain critical value coercivity goes down to zero this occurs since the magnetic moments of the fe atoms are randomly oriented due to thermal energy canceling each other out therefore the fe3o4 shows superparamagnetic behavior which constitutes an advantage since it allows their recovery through an external magnetic field 79 iron oxides nps ionps have the potential to be applied in multiple disciplines as medicine 80 analytical chemistry and environmental applications 81 mixed valent iron oxides since containing both fe iii and fe ii in their structure have the ability to affect the mobility toxicity and redox transformation of several organic and inorganic pollutants 72 spinel ferrites including fe3o4 possess superparamagnetic properties at nano scale low toxicity large surface area tunable surface high thermal and chemical stability and modest chemical composition therefore they have been considered potential adsorbents and catalysts in environmental remediation strategies 71 3 synthesis and characterization of magnetite nanoparticles the properties and performance of nanozymes are defined by several factors and in turn these are related to the synthetic method employed ghosh et al 75 compared structural parameters of prepared fe3o4 nps by several synthetic routes all methods used led to obtaining nanosized fe3o4 but the mean size and size distribution varied from one method to another similarly kafshgari et al 82 prepared manganese ferrite mnfe2o4 nps by co precipitation sol gel and hydrothermal routes and posteriorly they were characterized the mnfe2o4 nps showed 36 nm and 38 8 emu g 1 45 nm and 9 5 emu g 1 and 16 nm and 41 9 emu g 1 which correspond to crystallite size and saturation magnetization for co precipitation sol gel and hydrothermal respectively hence the results confirmed that the synthesis method of nps constitutes a fundamental issue to determine the crystallite size and its growth considerable efforts have been made to improve the catalytic activities of magnetic nanomaterials through the different synthetic pathways the methods used to synthesize nanosized fe3o4 have a key role since they could determine the particle size size distribution shape surface chemistry of the particles and their magnetic properties 83 84 the synthesis methods can be broadly classified into physical chemical and biological ones chemical methods are the most selected since they are simple and cost effective 67 besides they allow a control of nps size and shape by variation of reaction parameters 85 some advantages of these routes include low temperature requirement 350 c high yield of material and possibility of doping with ions during the synthesis 86 the common methods reported for the synthesis of fe3o4 nps are briefly described in this section then in table 3 were presented their respective advantages and disadvantages based on the surveyed literature it was identified that fe2 precursors commonly used comprise ferrous sulfate ferrous nitrate and ferrous chloride while fe3 precursors include ferric chloride ferric nitrate and ferric acetate 3 1 co precipitation co precipitation is the method mainly selected by researchers to obtain iron oxides nanoparticles ionps since it is the most effective and simple pathway without toxic intermediates 83 87 this method employs an aqueous salt solution containing dissolved species of fe ii and fe iii at room temperature or elevated temperature and an alkaline solution naoh or nh4oh to precipitate the iron oxide under inert atmosphere 75 88 89 the fe2 fe3 molar ratio must be 1 2 which is the exact stoichiometry to obtain fe3o4 a flow of inert gas nitrogen or argon is used to avoid the oxidation of fe2 and to reduce the particle size 90 a typical procedure for fe3o4 nps synthesis by co precipitation is shown in the fig 1 the size morphology and stability of ionps synthesized for this method depend on factors such as composition of reactants molar ratio of ferrous and ferric ions temperature ph reaction time speed of reducing agent addition into iron salt solution 68 91 for instance yazdani and seddigh 92 assessed the effects of various precursors on the morphology and mean particle size of the fe3o4 nps that were synthesized via co precipitation the results showed that bigger anions generated smaller fe3o4 nps this was explained considering that the bigger anions increased the thickness of the diffuse layer surrounding nuclei and mass transfer resistance therefore for a constant reaction time the mean size of synthesized nps changes inversely with change in the diffuse layer thickness in addition the effect of temperature and stirring rate on the synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation have been studied 93 the results showed that the structural features of the fe3o4 nps were dependent on both reaction parameters an increment in temperature and stirring rate led to fe3o4 nps with a higher level of crystallinity even though the fe3o4 particle size was more uniform as the temperature and stirring rate increased there was still agglomeration caused by the magnetism saragi et al 94 evaluated the temperature effect in the synthesis of fe3o4 nps by co precipitation as a result the average size of fe3o4 nps increases with the synthesis temperature due to the acceleration of chemical reaction of fe2 and fe3 ions the fe3o4 nps made by co precipitation usually have a relatively small size of below 30 nm in diameter 95 in a typical synthetic experiment chatterjee et al 96 dissolved iron salts into deionized water and kept them at room temperature for 15 min with vigorous stirring under a nitrogen atmosphere after that an ammonia solution was added drop by drop into the salt solution and the stirring was continued for another 2 h at 80 c the solution was cooled and solid black particles were magnetically separated and repeatedly washed the fe3o4 nps had a size of 10 15 nm despite the advantages offered by this method the nps often are not stable and they tend to agglomerate due to extremely small size and the magnetic behavior therefore they can be stabilized with surfactants having low molecular weight or functionalized with polymers 97 which will be analyzed below a drawback of this preparation route is the difficulty to obtain uniform and monodisperse nps since the ph of the reaction mixture must be adjusted both through the synthesis and at the purification steps 90 3 2 hydrothermal solvothermal hydrothermal methods have also been reported in the literature this route of synthesis refers to an aqueous reaction at elevated temperature typically between 100 and 1000 c and high vapor pressures typically between 1 and 10 000 atm to recrystallize materials in a closed system 98 for example fe3o4 nps were synthesized from an iron salt solution which contains iron chloride and iron sulphate in 2 1 ratio 75 then ammonium hydroxide nh4oh was added under stirring and this solution was transferred to autoclave and kept at 130 c for 3 h although water is the most employed solvent other solvents such as ethylene glycol eg diethylene glycol deg and polyethylene glycol peg can also be utilized the use of an organic solvent as the dispersion medium transforms the method towards a solvothermal route 98 torres gómez et al 99 synthesized fe3o4 nps by this method using a solution which contained fecl3 6h20 and peg as surfactant this solution was maintained under magnetic stirring then hydrazine n2h4 was added drop wise until a reddish solution was obtained which was then transferred immediately to teflon autoclaves and heated at different temperatures 120 c 140 c and 160 c in a muffle furnace for 4 h as a result quasi spheres octahedrons and cubes in the nanometric regime were obtained adjusting the temperature to 120 c 140 c and 160 c respectively in addition watcharenwong et al 100 prepared fe3o4 using iron iii acetylacetonate fe acac 3 in the eg solvent as reducing agent under stirring for 30 min to fully dissolve the solids and then slowly dropped poly acrylic acid paa while stirring the obtained solution was put in teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and sealed to heat to the boiling point of eg at 200 c for 16 h the fe3o4 nps showed a size between 60 250 nm the shape and crystallinity of fe3o4 nps are influenced by factors such as iron precursor precursor solvent ratio temperature and reaction time 91 the main problem associated with this technique is the low yield due to long reaction time at settled temperatures 70 therefore it is often accompanied by other techniques such as microwave treatment to increase the rate of fe3o4 crystal formation 101 3 3 sol gel this method comprises two aqueous media phases liquid and gel and requires the presence of a surfactant in the solvent 85 during this synthesis an exothermic and self sustaining redox reaction occurs in aqueous solution containing desired metal salts and organic complexant as oxidizer and reducer respectively 71 subsequently a large volume of gases leads to the formation of nps the synthesis of fe3o4 nps via sol gel method was carried out by takai et al 102 iron iii chloride fecl3 and iron ii chloride fecl2 were dissolved in eg and vigorously stirred for a period of 3 h at 45 c to form a sol then it was heated and maintained at a temperature of 80 c until dark color gel was formed this gel was aged for a period of 72 h and later dried at 140 c for 5 h the obtained xerogel was annealed at a certain temperature ranging from 200 to 400 c under vacuum condition the size of nps was temperature dependent obtaining an average particle size of 2 02 nm 5 58 nm and 8 35 nm for 200 c 300 c and 400 c respectively similarly a disadvantage of this method is that extra heat treatments are needed to obtain the final crystalline state 90 although this method produces highly dispersed nps with precise size control its application is restricted owing to the high cost unsafe operating conditions and longer reaction times 85 3 4 thermal decomposition this method involves a reaction that demands an elevated temperature to decompose initial materials for the obtainment of fe3o4 nps the nps synthesized by this technique have narrow size distribution and high crystallinity 70 calì et al 77 used iron chloride and sodium oleate dissolved in a mixture of ethanol deionized water and hexane this solution was heated up to 70 c and kept for 4 h then the product was washed and a solid was obtained finally the solid was mixed with oleic acid and octadecene and then this was heated until 320 c for 30 min to form 12 nm fe3o4 nps the parameters which influence the size and morphology of fe3o4 nps are temperature reaction time solvent and the surfactant selected to the substrate of such reaction 89 90 a main drawback is the high temperature 300 c of reaction 70 3 5 green synthesis recently biosynthetic routes denominated plant mediated green synthesis have been development for fabricating nps since they are simple economic clean technologies and hence suitable environmentally 103 104 the synthesis of iron nps and ionps from several plants have been reported such as leaf extract of peltophorum pterocarpum 105 terminalia bellirica plant extracts 106 daphne mezereum leaf extract 22 green tea extract 107 eucalyptus leaf extract 108 chromolaena odorata root extract 109 among others to obtain nps using this method the plant extract is mixed with the precursor in a metal ion salt solution at ambient atmosphere one aim of the green synthesis is to avoid the use of chemical stabilizers and reducing agents the extracts of plants could be used both as capping agent and as bio reductant 110 owing to the presence of several biomolecules such as ascorbic acid polyphenols phenolics flavonoids and sugars 111 red seaweed kappaphycus alvarezii has been employed as a green reducing and stabilizing agent in the preparation of fe3o4nps the synthesized fe3o4nps had spherical shape and an average diameter of 14 7 nm nevertheless the image of tem showed that most of the particles were agglomerated which might be due to the thickening properties of seaweed or the presence of hydroxyl groups from the extract 112 the particle agglomeration leads to a decrease of the effective surface area and therefore poor performances are obtained in this type of synthetic pathway the size and morphology control could be difficult since the plant extract has numerous components such as amino acids polyphenols nitrogenous bases and reducing sugars 113 although the green synthetic methods use non toxic reagents and low energy consumption the resulting nps have wide size distribution and lack shape control 113 114 this could lead to fe3o4 nps with modest magnetic response this synthetic route is promising to expand on a large scale due to the availability and safety of the inputs used being an economically feasible alternative however it is necessary to expand research in this field to obtain high performance nanomaterials that can be implemented in the remediation of industrial effluents 3 6 continuous magnetite nanoparticles production several approaches for the continuous synthesis of fe3o4 nps have been developed to scale up the process asimakidou et al 114 carried out the continuous production of fe3o4 nps by oxidative precipitation in aqueous media the product was obtained through a continuous flow setup two tanks were employed feso4 7h2o solution 0 03 m and a mixture of nano3 0 06 m naoh 0 125 m and ethanol 30 v v the solutions were pumped into the reactor which operated at room temperature under mild mechanical stirring and intense nitrogen bubbling until the formation of a green rust the ph was adjusted according to each reaction varying between 8 and 12 0 2 after that the green rust led to the aging reactor during a period of 4 h a production of 0 7 g fe3o4 h 1 was obtained however multiplying the amounts of tanks and the flow rates could obtain a higher yield the impinging stream rotating packed bed is rpb reactor was employed by fan et al 118 to synthesize continuously fe3o4 nps by co precipitation the reaction conditions were 65 32 of high gravity factor 60 l h 1 of liquid flow rate and 0 321 mol l 1 of fecl3 6h2o concentration a monodispersed fe3o4 nps was obtained with mean diameter of 8 9 nm and saturation magnetization of 60 5 emu g 1 the production of fe3o4 nps was 2 23 kg h 1 in another study fan et al 119 prepared l cysteine functionalized fe3o4 mnps by a simple high gravity reactive precipitation method combined with surface modification through is rpb reactor with the assistance of sonication the produced l cysteine fe3o4 nps were quasi spherical with an average diameter of about 10 nm and saturation magnetization of 53 0 emu g l 1 gu et al 120 synthesized continuously fe3o4 nps with a multiphase segmented flow system in the process one of the phases was a miniemulsion containing iron precursor solution in nanodroplet confinement the other phase was diluted ammonium hydroxide solution the as prepared fe3o4 nps obtained an average size of about 10 nm in addition prabowo et al 121 carried out a feasibility study to the large scale production of fe3o4 nps by co precipitation from the engineering point of view they obtained that the process of synthesis of fe3o4 nps on a large scale is promising with an estimated annual production of 456 kg although production at industrial scale is feasible recovering the initial cost could take up to 5 years finally it is essential to consider the generation of aqueous solutions containing chloride and sulfate as waste to be treated and disposed of hence it is still a fundamental issue the development of continuous synthesis methods of fe3o4 nps by cost effective routes without the production of hazardous waste and suitable environmentally 3 7 characterization of iron oxide nanoparticles according to the literature reviewed nanomaterials can be characterized by several techniques to get insight into the size size distribution morphology magnetic properties chemical composition specific surface area surface features among others see fig 2 the crystalline information and unit cell parameters of nps can be obtained via x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy sem and scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx allow obtaining information about the surface morphology and elemental composition respectively transmission electron microscopy tem provides accurate information on composition and structure thickness chemical and elemental composition electronic structure and energy levels xrd sem and tem also permit the estimation of the size of nps the functional groups and chemical bonds present in nps can be analyzed through fourier transform infrared ft ir spectroscopy in addition the zeta potential determination allows measurement of the electrostatic potential at the electrical double layer surrounding a nanoparticle in solution the magnetic properties can be evaluated via vibrating sample magnetometer vsm the specific surface area of the samples and mean pore diameter can be measured via brunauer emmett teller bet surface area by dynamic light scattering dls it is possible to get information about particle size size distribution and agglomeration based on the hydrodynamic 4 nanosized magnetite as nanozyme in heterogeneous fenton oxidation nanomaterials with enzyme like intrinsic activity are considered nanozymes 122 as presented above iron oxide nps including fe3o4 and fe2o3 are denominated ionzyme and they constitute one of the most typical nanozymes 95 fe3o4 nps based nanozymes exhibit peroxidase and catalase like activity 123 and recently was reported activity similar to natural zymolyase 124 enzymatic activities of zymolyase include β 1 3 glucan laminaripentao hydrolase activity and β 1 3 glucanase activity ionzymes have been considered to be used in elimination of selected pollutants in fenton like systems 55 the main beneficial characteristics of nanozymes with peroxidase like activity for their application in fenton like systems were detailed in fig 3 the properties and catalytic activity of nanozymes are directly related to their structural parameters for example the shape control constitutes a relevant aspect to improve the catalysis since the crystal facets and consequently atomic arrangement on the facets have a significant effect on its activity 125 gao et al 62 reported that the nanocomposites containing fe3o4 nps with anisotropic morphology as nanorods show higher catalytic activity in comparison with nanoneedles and nano octahedra wei et al 126 compared the fenton like catalytic properties of spherical and octahedral fe3o4 nps as a result the octahedral fe3o4 nps showed higher catalytic stability than the spherical fe3o4 nps in the mb degradation with h2o2 in addition wan et al 127 informed that the nanosized fe3o4 with spherical shape had a superior performance as peroxidase mimetic followed by cube octahedron and hexagonal plate this was associated with the preferential exposure of catalytically active iron atoms fe2 fe3 or crystal planes although high efficiencies have been found for nps with different morphologies the spherical shape is the most commonly employed in fenton like reactions 128 the size is another fundamental parameter in the catalytic behavior of fe3o4 nps wan et al 129 compared the performance of fe3o4 nps with averages diameters of 30 70 250 and 600 nm they found that the catalytic activity increased with the reduction of nanoparticle size when the size decreases there is a higher specific surface area to interact with the substrate hence it increases the catalytic activity 95 130 in addition to the size and shape the efficiency of nanozymes as catalysts also depends on composition oxidation state geometry coating and stability of nps 130 131 the transfer of electrons between ferrous and ferric ions at the octahedral sites in fe3o4 favors the generation of oh from h2o2 these active radicals are capable of breaking unsaturated dye molecules and double bonds in their chromophore removing the color of effluents 62 besides fe3o4 nps can be separated from the reaction medium by application of a magnetic field from a nd iman for example and then re dispersed in solution for reuse this is a relevant issue regarding the sustainability of the system and the costs associated with it 39 although ionzymes exhibit advantages as easy recovery the activity of most of them is low compared to that of their enzymatic counterparts 132 in addition the dye removal using fe3o4 nps with h2o2 often requires to be combined with other processes to enhance their performance for example with ultrasound irradiation 54 one of the limitations associated with the use of fe3o4 nps is their tendency to agglomerate in solution in general the hydrophobic interactions between fe3o4 nps and its high surface area to volume ratio generate aggregates and eventually form larger sized nps 70 trujillo hernandez et al 133 prepared fe3o4 nps by thermal decomposition obtaining particle sizes between 15 and 100 nm with an average of 42 nm the sem micrograph showed that the particles present an agglomeration tendency furthermore ruíz baltazar et al 134 prepared fe3o4 nps via green route using cynara cardunculus leaf extract as a source of reducing agents the sem micrograph allowed the observation of nps agglomerates the agglomeration of nps occurs to reduce their surface energy due to their large surface area for mnps as fe3o4 magnetic dipole interaction and van der waals interactions are also relevant 135 nps are intrinsically unstable over prolonged periods of time they possess poor chemical resistance to strong acids or strong oxidizing agents that eventually lead to the loss of their magnetic activity after the synthesis iron nps quickly form iron oxide layers over their surface since under ambient conditions fe3o4 can easily be oxidized to fe2o3 67 in addition fe3o4 can be dissolved in an acidic medium khoshhesab and modaresnia 136 used fe3o4 nps as adsorbent for the removal of ab210 azo and rb19 anthraquinone dyes from aqueous solutions the fe3o4 nps were synthesized by co precipitation and had an average particle size of around 36 nm the adsorption capacities for ab210 and rb19 were 70 80 mg g 1 at 45 min and 74 40 mg g 1 at 5 min respectively the reusability study revealed that the adsorption efficiency decreased about 8 after five consecutive cycles and the recovery of adsorbent with a magnetic field was possible the loss in efficiency might be due to a dissolution of fe ions which are released toward the solution hence the fe3o4 gradually loses its active surface sites 137 another drawback when mnps are used in composites is the detachment of them from modified materials during the reaction which also produces the toxicity after long term accumulation in water 138 in summary despite the fe3o4 nps having several advantages in their role as nanozymes often they have drawbacks such as low catalytic activity after few uses unexpected interactions leaching of iron furthermore they tend to reduce the catalyst surface by aggregation and are oxidized easily in the air these results in the loss of dispersibility and magnetic properties 29 42 139 this results in unsatisfactory catalytic activity low reaction rate and deficient dye degradation hence the practical applications fundamentally require avoiding the agglomeration of nps due to their catalytic capability are directly related to the available active surface sites 128 moreover the implementation on a large scale requires an enhancement of h2o2 dosage to ensure application over a wide ph range and guarantee the recovery and reuse of the catalysts 140 then the development of catalytically active and stable iron oxide nps in fenton like reaction is a major challenge today in order to achieve enhanced catalysts various strategies have been studied and will be analyzed in the following sections 5 strategies to enhance the nanoparticulated magnetite properties 5 1 coating and functionalization of magnetite nanoparticles fe3o4 nps have colloidal instability and they are susceptible to oxidation and corrosion as discussed in the previous sections therefore different approaches have been developed to stabilize and functionalize them for instance through modifications on their surface chemistry among the types of ion based materials core shell ionps typically consist of a magnetic core a coating and in some cases surface active modifiers 68 the coating of nps with organic or inorganic compounds constitutes a common surface modification method which might prevent the oxidation and agglomeration as well as allow higher functionalization when the number of active sites that can bind with the substrate increases by the surface modification so does the adsorption capacity and selectivity of fe3o4 nps towards certain pollutants therefore there is great interest in the modification of mnps since the nanoscale architecture of active centers influences its efficiency and selectivity 141 142 besides since the catalytic activity occurs on the surface of nps when they act as nanozyme the control of surface chemistry is essential to adjust its performance in the organic contaminant degradation 132 the surface modification of fe3o4 nps can be made either during the synthesis in situ or after as an independent process this strategy can be implemented by covalent immobilization of functional groups or the coating with charged species of the surface of nps 130 therefore the stabilization is achieved by steric or electrostatic forces respectively 143 through these procedures a mono layer is created on the surface of the fe3o4 the aim is to obtain fe3o4 nps with enhanced dispersibility in water improved physicochemical and mechanical properties and capacity to retain the magnetic properties 68 the coating fulfills several roles which comprise 1 the formation of a protective layer to avoid the oxidation 2 the reduction of the surface energy to prevent the agglomeration and to produce monodisperse nps and 3 the control of nucleation and growth process to manipulate the size and promote the oriented growth of the nucleus 78 several types of inorganic and organic coatings to stabilize nps in aqueous solutions have been described in the literature inorganic coatings have been widely studied mainly silica coated fe3o4 nanocomposites 144 the organic coatings here considered include surfactants polymers carbon based material and organic moieties these allow the addition of functional groups onto the surface of the nps such as hydroxyl carboxyl aldehyde and amino groups the surfactant surface active agents modified iron oxide nps contain diverse types of functional groups depending on the nature of surfactant the selection of suitable surfactants and their use in a proper amount constitute fundamental issues to control the size and morphology of nps 145 the use of carboxylates laurate palmitate linoleate as surfactants help to reduce the size of nps and shape control 146 klekotka et al 147 synthesized fe3o4 and γ fe2o3 nps with several types of surface stabilizers by thermal decomposition of fe acac 3 precursor in organic solution they employed long chain carboxylic acid lauric acid palmitic acid stearic acid caprylic acid oleic acid and amines oleyl amine trioctylamine hexylamine dioctylamine the tem micrographs showed that the nps coated with hexylamine and dioctylamine presented the most regular and uniform shape with lower particle size which may indicate self organization of nps while the fe3o4 core coated with carboxylic acid presented poorer size distribution hence the use of surfactants not only influences the size of fe3o4 nps but also governs size distribution and protects interaction between particles the high protection from aggregation due to surfactant presence was mainly seen in hexylamine besides all samples presented different saturation magnetization varying 50 to 83 am2 kg 1 indicating that it depends not only on the magnetic core but also on the surfactant used in a posterior study klekotka et al 145 concluded that amines allow the growth of uniform shaped particles in comparison to fatty acids furthermore tertiary amines cause flower like nanoparticle growth accordingly nicolás et al 84 found that the coating of fe3o4 nps with oleic acid led to a lower aggregation in addition an increase in the initial amount of oleic acid may affect the dispersibility of the fe3o4 nps due to the modification in stabilization mechanisms cîrcu et al 148 evaluated the effect of several organic stabilizers on fe3o4 nps and found that glycolic acid malic acid and mandelic acid generate an important increase in the saturation magnetization this study revealed that the coating and exposure times produced changes in the average crystallite size interestingly instead of simple anchoring stabilizers to the surfaces of fe3o4 nps a more complex recrystallization mechanism including re dispersing fe3o4 moieties from the nps and rearrangement was proposed köçkar et al 149 synthesized fe3o4 nps with tartaric acid at and ascorbic acid aa as surfactants by hydrothermal method the effects of coating with at aa and at aa 1 1 mixture on properties of fe3o4 nps were evaluated the particle average diameter was determined via tem obtaining 7 4 1 5 7 8 1 7 and 6 8 2 0 nm for at aa and at aa respectively the at fe3o4 nps showed less agglomeration besides the saturation magnetization values were higher than those of the precursor and changed according to the surfactant used in addition yau et al 150 prepared fe3o4 nps coated with l ascorbic acid laa a kind of vitamin c as surfactant they found that 0 96 g of laa as a capping agent allowed resulting fe3o4 nps with smaller size suitable superparamagnetic behavior and high stability and dispersion furthermore ren et al 151 carried out a peroxidase like activity test to study the performance of vitamin c vc functionalized fe3o4 nps the comparison between the catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate 3 3 5 5 tetramethylbenzidine tmb with vc fe3o4 nps h2o2 and naked fe3o4 nps h2o2 showed that the fe3o4 nps modified with vc presented enhanced catalytic activity chen et al 152 used n n di carboxymethyl perylene diimides pdi to functionalize fe3o4 nps the obtained pdi fe3o4 nanocomposites were tested through the catalytic oxidation of peroxidase substrate tmb in the presence of h2o2 as a result pdi fe3o4 showed a higher peroxidase like activity than that of naked fe3o4 nps polymers and small organic molecules have also been employed to enhance the stability of mnps and to obtain magnetic nanocomposites with distinct functions arévalo et al 153 synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation methods and dispersed them in a fatty acid oleic acid an organic sulfate sodium dodecyl sulfate a polymeric surfactant polyvinyl alcohol and olive oils of distinct acidity of 0 1 and 0 2 they assessed structural parameters and magnetic behavior of surfactant modified fe3o4 nps as a result modified fe3o4 nps with size of 9 4 11 1 nm were obtained the oleic acid modified fe3o4 presented the highest magnetization furthermore olive oils showed results similar to oleic acid therefore these can be used as alternatives in the synthesis of fe3o4 nps radoń et al 154 assessed the influence of various organic modifiers polyvinylpyrrolidone sodium citrate tartaric acid eg and dextrin on structure and optical properties of fe3o4 nps the synthetic method employed was the chemical co precipitation as a result the fe3o4 nps modified with tartaric acid presented the smallest size with crystallinity volume size 2 9 nm following by fe3o4 citrate 5 5 nm fe3o4 dextrin 8 4 nm fe3o4 pvp 9 2 nm naked fe3o4 10 6 nm and fe3o4 glycol 12 2 nm the tem image showed that the fe3o4 nps modified with citrate and tartrate tended to agglomerate which is related to the small average crystallinity volume size in relation to dextrin modified fe3o4 nps they had spherical shape and were dispersed in a polysaccharide matrix those nps modified with tartaric acid showed the highest value of optical band gap energy 3 01 ev jain et al 155 synthesized nanorods and nanospheres of iron oxides via polyol method using fe no3 3 as precursor and peg as both reducing and stabilizing agent the nanocrystals shape could be selected using peg posteriorly the efficiency of fe3o4 nps in removal of several dyes rhb mb and mo was assessed the fe3o4 microrods could effectively degrade all dyes in the presence of h2o2 cluster structured fe3o4 nps were functionalized with paa generating carboxyl groups on the surface of the nps 156 with optimal concentration of 5 wt paa the size of the particle decreased from 300 nm to 200 nm furthermore paa modified nps showed enhanced dispersion due to the electrostatic repulsion between carboxyl groups gamallo et al 157 prepared fe3o4 nps sterically stabilized with paa the fe3o4 paa nps were quasi spherical with average size of 10 1 2 4 nm and saturation magnetization of 70 emu g 1 sanchez et al 158 assessed the influence of paa molecular weight mw 1800 g mol 1 and 5000 g mol 1 and paa concentration on the magnetic and structural properties of iron oxide based nps they obtained a smaller particle size and narrow size distribution when the paa concentration was the highest furthermore the magnetization analysis showed that all samples exhibit superparamagnetic response presenting very low coercivity and remnant magnetization at room temperature polyvinyl alcohol pva can stabilize nps however its hydrophilic nature can reduce its effectiveness as a capping agent therefore the use of glutaraldehyde glut as a crosslinker allows resulting nps with high stability in low ph since glut is stable in acidic condition rahayu et al 159 synthesized fe3o4 nps by co precipitation in presence of pva as a capping agent and assessed the use of glut as crosslinking agent the fe3o4 nps with pva and glut had a higher percentage of fe3o4 since their surface had a lower degree of oxidation towards γ fe2o3 and α fe2o3 this might enhance the peroxidase like activity of fe3o4 nps fan et al 160 utilized polydopamine pda shells on fe3o4 nps the core shell fe3o4 pda nanocomposites were synthesized by the combination of solvothermal reduction method and covalent bonding of pda through spontaneous polymerization of dopamine on the surface of the fe3o4 microspheres the obtained fe3o4 nps exhibited monodispersed spherical shape and they showed diameter from 200 500 nm and then the coating with pda increased the size between 20 and 40 nm the pda in the composite might act as a reducing agent and promote the reduction of fe3 favoring the fenton reaction hence the catalytic activity of fe3o4 pda was assessed in the rhb removal in presence of h2o2 the highest efficiency in the rhb removal was obtained with fe3o4 pda fe2 h2o2 system and it can be employed at a ph range of 3 0 9 0 in general fe3o4 nps based fenton like processes performed unsatisfactorily at neutral ph hence zhou et al 161 prepared glutathione coated fe3o4 nps via oxidative polymerization method these nps were employed as heterogeneous fenton like catalysts for 2 4 dichlorophenol 2 4 dcp degradation at ph 6 5 this nanocomposite could remove up to 99 of 2 4 dcp in 240 min while the naked fe3o4 nps cannot operate at the same conditions in order to enhance the selectivity the mimicking of the binding environment of natural enzymes was also applied to improve the activity of nanozymes fe3o4 nps were modified with histidine his to mimic the architecture of natural hrp 162 the peroxidase activity of his fe3o4 was evaluated using tmb colorimetric system at acidic ph this modification resulted in important improvement of peroxidase like activity and the catalytic efficiency of the fe3o4 nanozyme by enhancing the affinity for h2o2 via hydrogen bond formation between the imidazole group of histidine and h2o2 furthermore the catalase like activity was also assessed by monitoring the h2o2 decomposition to o2 at neutral ph the improved catalase like performance was obtained with his modified fe3o4 nps kampferbeck et al 163 synthesized non agglomerated iron oxide nps average diameter of 13 7 0 6 nm by growing polystyrene shells via activators generated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization aget atr in microemulsion the encapsulation was carried out by direct polymerization of a cross linked polystyrene shell on the nanoparticle surface the thickness of the polymer shell and the degree of cross linking can be adjusted as a result the polystyrene encapsulated nps had a high stability in aqueous media even at ph 1 8 in addition up to ph 0 3 the particles were stable with no detectable loss of iron recently the use of natural polymers and bio organic wastes as part of magnetic nanocomposites have shown an immense potential due to their biocompatibility biodegradability and low cost chitosan cs has been employed to stabilize fe3o4 nps using a mixture of tripolyphosphate and sulphate as crosslinker agent by ex situ co precipitation method at room temperature 164 as a result the ratio enhancement between cs fe3o4 increases the particle size while decreased the crystallite size besides the higher tripolyphosphate content contributed to the small size and more spherical morphology leal et al 165 synthesize mfe2o4 m cu2 ni2 co2 mn2 and fe2 and then they were coated with 3 aminopropyl trimethoxysilane apts agent h2n ch2 3si och3 3 and functionalized with cs the obtained products were mfe2o4 mfe2o4 sio2 and mfe2o4 sio2 cs mfe2o4 showed large aggregates of particles with irregular shapes while the mfe2o4 sio2 cs nps presented lower agglomeration furthermore the coating and functionalization of nps allowed high dispersibility the saturation magnetization varies between 12 3 to 63 7 emu g 1 the minimum corresponds to nife2o4 sio2 cs and the maximum one corresponds to fe3o4 furthermore yerba mate extract coated fe3o4 nps fe3o4 ym were synthesized 166 the fe3o4 ym were prepared by co precipitation methods obtaining particles of 12 nm while the fe3o4 nps were 15 nm confirming the reduction in the size the particles were composed of a crystalline fe3o4 core surrounded by a shell of fe3o4 and fe2o3 oxides forming chelates with ym components containing carboxylic acid groups and phenols and a high content of organic nitrogen ym coating is capable of specifically absorbing h and oh leading to a higher content of surface charges than fe3o4 nps consequently particle agglomeration is reduced with increasing ym content and more stable homogeneous aqueous suspensions were formed recently the use of plant extracts in the synthesis process have been extensively studied since the phyto compounds could act both as a precipitant and as a capping agent for fe3o4 nps 109 5 2 transition metals modified nano magnetite nanocatalysts based on earth abundant transition metals mn2 fe 2 co2 ni2 cu2 have been extensively used in several applications 167 a recent review delineated the progress made around transition metal substituted spinel nano ferrites as promising candidates for fulfill the role of artificial enzymes focusing in the synthesis methods and the factors influencing the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes 168 factors that influence the catalytic activity of nano ferrites are the introduction of transition metals to spinel structures chemical composition i e the kind of transition metal introduced the reduction potential of the substitute metal as well as its valence state and the nature of the cation distribution since the fe3o4 nps possess several difficulties to be employed as a catalyst in fenton like reactions to remove organic contaminants the introduction of transition metals in their structure might constitute an efficient strategy to overcome these drawbacks the cations fe2 in the fe3o4 can be isomorphically substituted by other transition metals to enhance the properties of nanozymes the substitute transition metals should have similar ionic radius to fe2 fe3 cations and same oxidation states or one or two unit differences to the exchanged iron species 31 this could facilitate a higher performance for dyed effluent remediation since the pure fe3o4 have lower adsorption capacity and degradation rate in fenton reaction 31 the substitution of iron ions with transition metal ions in the oxide matrix is considered simple inexpensive and capable of causing considerable synergistic effects 169 a suitable transition metal content in general decreases the crystal size increasing the specific surface area and leading to a major adsorption capacity and catalytic activity the most common examples of spinel ferrites are represented by mfe2o4 where m can be any metal with an oxidation state of 2 such as co2 cu2 fe2 mn2 ni2 mg2 and zn2 170 the substitutions can also be made with trivalent cr3 v3 and ti3 and tetravalent nb4 and mo4 metal ions 171 172 rahim pouran et al 31 gave an overview of the adsorption potential and fenton like activity of several fe3o4 based catalysts substituted with transition metals they reported that the method most widely used for the preparation of substituted fe3o4 is the co precipitation of ferrous and ferric salts with the molar ratio of fe2 fe3 equal to 1 2 and transition metal salts under an inert gas environment besides they compiled literature related to the use of fe3o4 substituted with transition metals in combination with h2o2 in fenton like systems to remove recalcitrant organic contaminants firstly vinosha et al 173 prepared znfeo4 using zinc chloride zncl2 and ferric chloride fecl3 in solution as precursor agents the fecl3 solution was kept under continuous stirring and then naoh was added drop wise to adjust ph 10 subsequently zncl2 solution was added and the temperature was raised to 80 c for 3 h until brown precipitate was obtained finally it was annealed at 75 c for 24 h and calcined at 500 c for 5 h to obtain znfe2o4 nps li et al 174 synthesized zn doped fe3o4 by a modified one step solvothermal method they utilized fecl3 6h2o and zncl2 as precursors materials furthermore they employed eg that acts as reducing agent for the formation of ferrite nps deg as inhibitor to prevent the aggregation of nps and peg as surfactant likewise sodium acetate was added in the mixture solution not only to prevent particle agglomeration but also to act as a reducing agent they obtained nps of zn doped fe3o4 with small size it is known that the methods of synthesis significantly influence the size surface charge shape stability cation distribution and magnetic properties of spinel ferrite nps 69 arévalo cid et al 116 prepared mfe2o4 nps with m fe2 co2 and ni2 by three different methods coprecipitation sol gel and hydrothermal synthesis as a result all methods led to nps with spherical shape a larger particle size was found in cofe2o4 samples prepared by sol gel and smaller in the nife2o4 samples prepared by hydrothermal synthesis iron and nickel samples behaved as superparamagnetic materials while cofe2o4 samples exhibited a characteristic ferrimagnetic behavior the highest saturation magnetization value appears in the fe3o4 sample obtained by coprecipitation and the lowest value in the nickel samples in addition an increment in the magnetization saturation values was found in the cofe2o4 and nife2o4 samples prepared by hydrothermal however the substitution with ni 2 could lead to inhibitor effect of activity fenton 175 176 hence its use as catalyst in fenton systems is not recommended copper ferrite cufe2o4 nps have a potential application in effluent remediation masunga et al 177 summarized the advances of their synthesis magnetic properties and application in water treatment tehrani bagha et al 178 synthesized copper ferrite nps via polymeric precursor method they utilized stoichiometric amounts molar ratio of fe2 cu2 2 of fe no3 3 9h2o and cu no3 2 6h2o aqueous solutions then it was mixed with aqueous solutions of citric acid and eg the molar ratio of total metal ions to citric acid was kept as 1 3 and a mass proportion of 60 40 was used for citric acid eg the temperature of the solution was raised to 85 c and maintained at this temperature for 2 h up to the gel formation the resulting gel was heated at 300 c for 1 h leading to the expansion of its original volume to three times and formation of the porous semi carbonized powder precursor finally the product was calcined at 500 c for 2 h at ambient atmosphere the prepared nps had the nanocrystalline pure single phase structure almost spherical shape with an average diameter of about 21 nm values of saturation magnetization remnant magnetization and coercivity were found to be 6 5 emu g 1 2 1 emu g 1 and 380 oe respectively hamdan et al 179 synthesized cufe2o4 nps via co precipitation and sol gel auto combustion and then their performance in fenton like reaction for phenol removal was assessed the cufe2o4 nps obtained by sol gel showed higher catalytic activity than that prepared by co precipitation besides they presented higher efficiency than other catalysts cufe2o4 tio2 mgfe2o4 znfe2o4 the recovery and reusability of the catalyst was also evaluated and no considerable loss of catalytic activity was observed in five cycles 30 mg catalyst 0 5 m h2o2 25 c no ph adjustment no uv or sunlight achieving up to 63 of degradation after the first cycle and 60 after the fifth cycle furthermore the h2o2 addition procedure was evaluated obtaining that the continuous addition in small amounts produced higher efficiency than single shot addition the reason might be due to the decreasing in its scavenging effect and hence produced oh radicals have higher chance to attack and degrade phenol in other study othman et al 180 compared the performance of cufe2o4 and cufe2o4 coated with phosphate in the phenol removal using h2o2 as oxidizing agent ph 3 and t 35 and 45 c as optimal conditions the higher catalytic performance was observed for phosphate coated cufe2o4 which might be due to improving the morphological electronic and chemical properties ferrites containing two metal ions in addition to iron have also been employed as catalysts for dye removal dou et al 181 prepared ferrite samples with the formula of comnxfe2 xo4 by means of sol gel auto combustion route briefly the precursor materials used were co no3 2 6h2o fe no3 3 9h2o mncl2 4h2o and c6h8o7 h2o in addition citric acid was used with a molar ratio between metal nitrates to citric acid of 1 1 and ammonia water was added to adjust the ph the mixed gel was exothermic at elevated temperature and led to spontaneous combustion forming ferrite powders finally the powders were calcined in a muffle furnace for 2 h at 400 c for crystallization through sem analysis it was possible to observe that severe aggregation occurred in the pure cobalt ferrite which is attributed to the strong magnetic property of the pure cobalt ferrite itself however the aggregation notably decreased with the presence of manganese in comn0 2fe1 8o4 indicating that their presence effectively suppressed agglomeration of particles furthermore andhare et al 182 prepared co1 xznxfe2o4 ferrite nps by co precipitation using cocl2 6h2o zncl2 and fecl3 as precursors the size of ferrites was larger as the zinc concentration increased besides the increment in zinc concentration also produced a decrease in the agglomeration of nps as the magnetization of zinc ferrite is lower than cobalt ferrites hence the magnetic interaction between nps went down other researchers have studied the use of transition metals of the period fourth rahim pouran 172 analyzed the effect of transition metals of period five nb4 and mo4 on the structure and activity of fe3o4 in fenton systems the catalyst was synthesized by co precipitation methods all samples maintained the spinel structure and magnetic behavior the nb4 and mo4 replaced the octahedral fe3 and fe2 cations respectively furthermore high nb4 and mo4 substituted fe3o4 led to a significant decrease in crystal size with consequent increase in specific surface area obtaining a major adsorption capacity 5 3 supported magnetite nanoparticles another strategy to enhance the performance of fe3o4 nps in their application as catalyst is the use of organic and inorganic materials as support for bare nps these solid supports allow the deposition of active species on their surface facilitating the recovery of catalysts from reaction medium mechanical resistance is enhanced and generates synergistic effects that increase the chemical activity of material furthermore the use of support for a fe3o4 nps might improve the thermal and chemical stability of the catalyst and hence their catalytic properties there are numerous reports about fe3o4 based catalysts supported on organic and inorganic matrices among these carbon based nanostructures such as carbon nanotubes graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide have been widely employed even when they are expensive song et al 37 prepared fe3o4 modified ultra small graphene oxide fe3o4 usgo as a heterogeneous catalyst for fenton like degradation of ppm level dye pollutants the composite was synthesized by in situ co precipitation of fe3o4 nps on the surface of usgo as a result fe3o4 usgo particles were spherical and homogeneously dispersed with size about 12 15 nm the usgo acts as the template for co precipitation hence the narrow size distribution of fe3o4 usgo was obtained pamp poly 2 acrylamido 2 methyl 1 propansul fonic acid hydrogel supported fe3o4 nanozymes were also synthesized via co precipitation reaction by sang et al 183 they obtained a magnetic pamps fe3o4 with intrinsic peroxidase activity and high catalytic activity furthermore they evaluated pamps with different concentrations of crosslinking agents n n methylenebisacrylamide mba obtaining that the lower crosslinking concentration led to the higher catalytic activity of the nanozyme in addition the mesoporous ceo2 was used as support of fe3o4 nps the fe3o4 ceo2 composite acts both as adsorbent and as catalyst for dye degradation in presence of h2o2 184 besides it showed low metal leaching due to the possible strong metal support interaction which enhanced the dispersion and stabilization of fe species it has been demonstrated that fe3o4 nps supported on carbon nanotubes cnts and multi walled carbon nanotubes mwcnts exhibited high peroxidase like activity in the fenton like degradation of various organic compounds in water these nanocomposites are catalytically active in a wide range of ph 1 0 10 0 185 xu et al 186 synthesized anchored onto the surface of mwcnts by moderate chemical co precipitation method the nanocomposite was employed in the mo removal it exhibited synergic effects between adsorption and fenton like catalytic oxidation for mo degradation process furthermore biomass activated carbon bac supported fe3o4 nps fe3o4 bac were synthesized via solvothermal method by liu et al 187 the fe3o4 nps in bac showed high crystallinity uniform particle size and suitable dispersibility the fe3o4 bac was used as adsorbent and fenton like reagent for pre concentration and degradation of mb from an aqueous solution in the presence of h2o2 the nanocomposite had high performance in mild reaction conditions which is desirable synthetic or natural polymeric supports provide advantages such as low cost mechanical resistance high catalytic activity and immense potential for reusability a wide variety of catalysts have been developed using several polymeric materials as support nps such as cs and carboxyl cellulose nanospheres qin et al 115 synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide coated on the surface of carboxyl cellulose nano spheres via co precipitation methods and proposed a formation mechanism in the synthesis of fe3o4 nps nucleation growth and secondary processes such as agglomeration take place when cellulose nano spheres are added their carboxyl groups do not only provide sites for nucleation but they also minimize the degree of agglomeration of the iron oxides particles as well as limit the particle size growing infinitely the mnps were less than 100 nm with narrow size distribution furthermore a catalyst was produced by impregnating cellulose nanofibrils with fe3o4 and applied to the degradation of mb dye in a fenton like reactive process 188 the cellulose nanofibrils were obtained by mechanical defibrillation from eucalyptus kraft pulp when the cellulose fibers pass through the defibrillator their dimensions and surface structure are changed which results in viscosity changes owing to the breaking and reformation of chemical bonds generating an increase in the surface area since the fe3o4 tends to form clusters the synthesis with the cellulosic matrix improves the efficiency of the catalyst due to the insoluble cellulose in water or organic solvents avoiding the catalytic activity decrease the magnetic solid can be used for multiple cycles to avoid the final disposal of agricultural waste their use as support material of iron oxide has been considered iron oxides supported on activated carbon derived from peanut hulls were prepared and employed in oxidation of mb 41 dye removal was due to adsorption and oxidation process both are influenced by the presence of oxygenated groups on the surface furthermore the oxidation activity depended on the amount and crystal size of fe3o4 samples with the highest amounts of fe3o4 on the surface but the biggest particles size leading to low conversion the catalytic processes that incorporate renewable sources as the biomass are more energy efficient than conventional methodologies and avoid the generation of polluting sub products bastidas et al 189 synthesize a magnetic catalyst consisting of iron species impregnated on fique fibers furcraea spp the surface of fique fibers was previously functionalized using a basic treatment to form ionic species ch2 na conforming nucleation points for nps formation the chemical nature of the fiber surface significantly influences the iron impregnation process gupta et al 190 extracted cellulose nanofibers cnf from bio waste pine needles and then they synthesized cellulose nife2o4 nanocomposites cnf nife by the in situ deposition of nife2o4 nife nps on the surface of cnf this nanocatalyst was employed in the dyed effluent remediation 6 application of magnetite based nanozymes in azo and anthraquinone dye degradation by fenton like oxidation 6 1 coated and functionalized nanosized magnetite the interactions between superparamagnetic fe3o4 nps lead to formation of aggregates with lower surface volume ratios which affect their catalytic activity to overcome this drawback the nps surface can be modified with stabilizing agents as was mentioned in the previous section there are numerous reports about magnetic fe3o4 nps and their combination with other compounds for higher functionalization table 4 recently the use of bio surfactants and biological capping agents for surface functionalization of nps is being extensively studied they cannot only increase their colloidal stability but may also improve their biological and catalytic activities abbasi kajani and bordbar 191 synthesized nanosized fe3o4 by modified co precipitation method and functionalized by the taxane diterpenoids extracted from taxus baccata l the fe3o4 nps had less than 50 nm and they presented stable magnetic behavior without surface oxidation the fenton like catalytic activity of functionalized fe3o4 was assessed through dye mb and mo removal the effect of fe nps and h2o2 concentration were studied obtaining that the catalytic activity for dye oxidation was directly related to these parameters the mb 12 5 mg l 1 was completely removed after 210 and 420 min in the presence of 2 and 1 mg ml 1 of fe nps respectively the reaction for mo 25 mg l 1 removal was slower achieving complete removal in 22 h in the presence of 2 mg ml 1 fe nps hydrogel coated hc fe3o4 nps were synthesized by co precipitation and the coating was carboxymethyl cellulose monomer of acrylic acid aa and acrylamide am crosslinker of n n methylene bisacrylamide mba and initiator of ammonium persulfate aps in a graft polymerization reaction 192 the hc fe3o4 nps were applied to remove ar73 from water to assess their catalytic activity fe3o4 nps achieved an ar73 removal efficiency of 49 0 and 20 1 in 300 min at ph 3 and ph 3 5 respectively hc fe3o4 nps at the same conditions obtained removal efficiency of 985 hence the coating with hydrogel enhanced the catalytic activity of fe3o4 nps in the ar73 removal by fenton like reaction three pathways were proposed by the authors i the formed shell that prevented fe3o4 aggregation and increased the reaction contact ii electrostatic interaction coo fe3 that accelerated fe2 fe3 redox cycle and iii complexing cellulose fe2 promoted h2o2 decomposition fe3o4 nps coated with paa have been employed in degradation of rb19 157 the optimal reaction conditions were selected through a response surface methodology rsm and then the rb19 removal was carried out in a sequential batch reactor coupled to an external magnetic separation system the treatment for 4 h achieved a dye removal of 91 3 in addition mnps were modified with sodium alginate by a co precipitation method and the efficiency in the rb222 removal with h2o2 was assessed 193 the efficiencies in the dye removal were 54 5 and 90 4 using the magnetic sodium alginate and magnetic sodium alginate h2o2 processes respectively gogoi et al 194 coated fe3o4 nps with β cyclodextrin β cd fe3o4 nps to stabilize the nps and increase their surface functional groups the fe3o4 nps and β cyclodextrin form composites by hydrogen bond through hydroxyl groups or by covalent bonding the nanocomposite showed high crystallinity a size range of 10 2 nm and a saturation magnetization that allows their magnetic recovery the efficiency in the ebt removal was compared between β cd fe3o4 and fe3o4 np at the same conditions it was found that the highest efficiency in ebt removal was for β cd fe3o4 nps with 90 degradation while the fe3o4 nps achieved a 65 removal hence the catalytic activity of fe3o4 was enhanced with the coating with β cyclodextrin furthermore β cd in the nps controlled the iron leaching toward the solution recently atta et al 195 synthesized fe3o4 nps functionalized with a poly ionic liquid based on quaternized dialkyl ethanolamine with 2 acrylamido 2 methylpropane sulfonate co vinylpyrrolidone qampsa vp the efficiency of the coating to protect the fe3o4 nps from oxidation or thermal degradation and the catalytic activity of fe3o4 qapsa vp in the mb removal were assessed as a result the activity of qampsa vp fe3o4 catalyst in fenton reaction remained high by up to 7 cycles hence the coating of fe3o4 nps with qapsa vp prevents the iron leaching and improves their thermal and chemical stability finally to avoid the problem of the bounded operational ph range tang et al 2020 coated the fe3o4 nps prepared by hydrothermal methods with sulfur 196 the results showed that s fe3o4nps were capable to degrade effectively rhb at ph range of 3 9 while the bare fe3o4 nps exhibited inferior performance even in acidic ph 3 medium 6 2 transition metals modified nanoparticulate magnetite in azo and anthraquinone dye degradation in hr aops several studies have reported the use of transition metal substituted fe3o4 to enhance the performance of these nanomaterials in dye removal table 5 costa et al 176 proposed the possible reasons for the improvement in catalytic activity the first mechanism is the conjugation of redox pairs of iron species and substituent active ions in the production of oh then the generation of oxygen vacancies as active sites on the catalyst surface occurs through adjustments for unequal charge substitutions or cationic deficiency in the structure of modified iron oxide these vacancies can be related directly to the degradation of the dye or indirectly to generate oh tehrani bagha et al 178 evaluated the performance of copper ferrite nps cufe2o4 as adsorbent and as catalyst in cwpo for rr120 removal the aim of the study was to assess the effect of temperature ph and catalyst and h2o2 dosage as well as the recovery and reuse of the catalyst the results showed that the optimal conditions corresponded to ph 3 temperature 75 c catalyst dosage 0 02 g l 1 and h2o2 10 mm which is comparable with typical fenton process the reaction achieved the complete removal of rr120 50 mg l 1 in approximately 30 min while at ph 6 the complete removal was achieved in 45 min of reaction although the catalyst presented high efficiency it also showed drawbacks related to the optimal performance at elevated temperature which could increase the treatment cost in addition huang et al 2018 made the isomorphic substitution of fe2 with cu2 by oxidative precipitation combined ionothermal synthesis 197 they assessed the efficiency of fe3 xcuxo4 x 0 06 0 12 and 0 23 nps to decompose h2o2 for rhb degradation the highest catalytic activity was obtained for fe2 88cu0 12o4 nps the enhanced performance of copper ferrite in comparison with f3o4 was explained considering that the surface cu2 ions expedite the regeneration of fenton active species fe2 by reduction of fe3 with hoo radicals or cu2 cations however after eighth cycles the efficiency decreased from 95 2 to 84 7 88 7 due to particle aggregation or catalyst loss during the recycled process in order to assess the catalytic activity of fe3o4 substituted with transition metals mfe2o4 ferrites m cu2 mn2 fe2 zn2 were prepared by co precipitation and their efficiency to remove phenol in presence of h2o2 was studied 198 cu ferrite showed the higher efficiency with 78 of phenol removal in 175 min ph 6 mn2 zn2 and fe2 ferrites presented about 50 or less of phenol removal in the same conditions one plausible reason for which the replacement of fe2 with cu2 led to higher efficiency in the degradation of phenol could be due to the higher redox potential of copper compared to the other metals used furthermore the cationic dye removal was also evaluated obtaining that the mn2 ferrites were most suitable this might be due to the higher adsorption of cationic dyes on the surface of mn2 ferrites owing to this depending on the surface charge of the catalyst and the molecular charge of the contaminant furthermore cufe2o4 nps have been prepared by co precipitation methods and then they were incorporated on paa hydrogel using water soluble crosslinker n n methylene bis acrylamide 199 this nanocomposite was employed to remove mb from water obtaining a 98 of removal in 125 min due to the adsorption and fenton like processes mg2 has also been employed as a substitute of fe2 ions in fe3o4 to synthesize improved catalysts for dye removal zhang et al 200 synthesized mgfe2o4 nanorods with a size of 50 nm and were used as catalyst in fenton like oxidation of cr solution after 120 min with a temperature of 80 c 95 of the initial dye was removed using 40 mg mgfe2o4 nanorods and 75 mg l 1 h2o2 as an external oxidant furthermore the recovery and reusability were assessed obtaining a removal efficiency of 80 after 5 cycles ivanets et al 201 employed magnesium ferrite nps mgfe2o4 nps and metal loaded mn2 co2 ni2 and cu2 mgfe2o4 nps in fenton like oxidation for mb degradation in aqueous solution under visible light and dark all samples of mgfe2o4 loaded with metals showed less catalytic activity which might be owing to the blocking of fe containing active centers are engaged in the formation of oh in addition mgfe2o4 catalyst presented suitable stability to a wide range of ph hence this could allow to avoid the ph value correction by the acidification of effluents and to elude the formation of undesirable acidic wastewater the sample of mgfe2o4 loaded with mn showed a large release of mn2 ions into the solution hence they are not suitable to act as catalysts in fenton like reactions the substitution of fe2 with co2 in the fe3o4 structure was carried out through oxidation precipitation method by alrozi et al 202 the obtained fe3 xcoxo4 catalyst was employed in the oxidative degradation of ao7 in presence of h2o2 as a result the co2 substituted fe3o4 showed higher efficiency in the ao7 degradation in addition rahim pouran 172 reported the use of nb4 and mo4 substituted fe3o4 in the mb removal the presence of transition metal significantly enhanced the degradation fulfilling the removal in 180 min the proposed factors that may affect the mb involve an increase in the surface area improved oh generation and fe2 regeneration by thermodynamically favorable nb4 nb5 and mo4 mo6 redox pairs increase of oxygen vacancies that serve as active sites on the catalyst surface and the participation of peroxo niobium in the degradation process in addition the leaching of iron was ineligible in neutral and basic condition and insignificant in acid condition furthermore rahim pouran et al 203 prepared a heterogeneous catalyst by isomorphic substitution of iron ions of fe3o4 with molybdenum mo ions regarding that mo mo4 65 pm and mo6 59 pm and iron fe2 61 pm and fe3 55 pm species have the similar ionic radii the fe2 62mo0 21o4 catalyst showed considerable activity with complete mb removal within 150 min this experimental finding was associated with the enlarged surface area the role of surface mo4 mo6 redox pairs and the oxygen vacancies among the aops in addition to those that involve the use of oh radicals as oxidizing agents oxidation process of organic pollutants using sulfate radical so4 generated from persulfate ps peroxymonosulfate pms and peroxydisulfate pds have also been studied the so4 radicals have the advantage that they can be produced in a wide ph range have a long half life and high selectivity for the oxidation 204 recently dou et al 181 synthesized ferrites with the formula of comnxfe2 xo4 and evaluated their efficiency in decomposing harmful oii azo dye in oxidant hso3 chemocatalysis process they observed that the samples containing manganese showed higher degrading capability of oii than that of the pure cobalt ferrite with the addition of nahso3 the comn0 2fe1 8o4 nahso3 system presented the higher optimum catalytic it could be seen that mn iii species were activated by hso3 and played a significant role in the process of chemical catalysis deng et al 204 prepared cofe2o4 nps functionalized with ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid or edta edta cofe2o4 by modified one pot hydrothermal process and they were applied for the oxidation of orange g og using pms as oxidizing agent the produced catalyst had high dispersion in aqueous solution with saturation magnetization enough to be recovered using an external magnet the edta cofe2o4 showed higher performance in og removal than that of cofe2o4 under the same conditions however due to the loss of the catalyst and the leaching of cobalt ions a decrease in the catalytic activity after fourth cycles was observed das et al 205 prepared a ni supported on hydroxyapatite encapsulated cobalt ferrite nanocomposite ni hap cofe2o4 and was employed to remove mb and mo from aqueous solutions in presence of h2o2 as a result the catalyst accomplished a degradation of 90 and 99 1 of mb and mo respectively in 90 min furthermore the catalyst exhibits superparamagnetic behavior hence could be recovered from the medium reaction by application of an external magnetic field furthermore xian et al 206 synthesized mfe2o4 m co2 cu2 mn2 and zn2 by sol gel method and their capability to generate sulfate radical so4 from ps was evaluated the so4 radicals are capable of decomposing organic pollutants hence the catalytic performance of mfe2o4 to degrade ao was assessed obtaining that cufe2o4 showed the greater catalytic activity with 87 6 of dye besides cofe2o4 mnfe2o4 znfe2o4 followed with solids with less catalytic performance in addition deng et al 207 prepared ordered mesoporous mnfe2o4 nps and this composite was employed for oii degradation using pms as oxidizing agent although a high efficiency 97 31 of oii removal was achieved there was a greater release of mn2 toward the solution which led to a decrease in the dye removal in the subsequent cycles in order to avoid the drawbacks associated with the poor catalytic performance of mnfe2o4 du et al 208 prepared catalyst based on mnfe2o4 and shell of pyrolyzed cs for activating ps to produce so4 radicals the modifications with cs enhanced significantly the specific surface area of mnfe2o4 besides the catalyst was employed to degrade ao7 the high efficiency in the ao7 removal was obtained for the catalyst calcined at 600 c under optimal conditions the catalyst could remove up to 99 of ao7 however after the second and third cycles the removal decreased to 78 0 and 56 7 respectively owing to the dissolution of metals into solution although the application of so4 radicals as oxidants of organic pollutants could be highly efficient several drawbacks must be taken into consideration mainly the contamination with sulfate salts or even worse newly created hazardous compounds 209 hence the use of oxidants containing sulfur should be analyzed in detail due to the potential generation of hazardous degradation products that would require subsequent treatment 210 the use of fe3o4 substituted with transition metals allows the operation of fenton like reactions in neutral ph which is environmentally preferred besides ferrites are more stable at neutral ph than low or high ph conditions 198 6 3 supported and matrix dispersed magnetite nps the use of proper materials as supports of nanosized fe3o4 have shown to be a suitable strategy to avoid the aggregation of fe3o4 nps these materials such as magnetic nanocomposites have been widely synthesized and employed as nanozymes to remove dyes table 6 cao et al 212 synthesized fe3o4 nps immobilized on the surface of graphene oxide go and functionalized by the triethanolamine tea and its oxidized products the obtained nps showed an average particle size of approximately 28 6 nm which was evaluated from the particle size distribution curve the efficiency in mb removal was compared between naked fe3o4 nps and tea go fe3o4 nps the removal rate of fe3o4 nps was smaller due to the agglomeration of magnetic particles hence tea go fe3o4 composite prevents agglomeration of nps and accelerates the mb removal the recovery and reusability also were evaluated obtaining that the catalytic activity decreased after several cycles which might be due to the loss of tea go fe3o4 during recovery and the partial change in tea structure during the degradation fe3o4 ceo2 composites were synthesized through impregnation calcination method using mesoporous ceo2 as support and the efficiency in the mb removal was assessed 184 the composites showed high adsorption which might be due to the abundant oxygen vacancies at the surface that facilitate the adsorption of mb on the surface of the catalyst and the large pore volume furthermore considerable fenton catalytic performance could be attributed to the synergistic effect between fe2 and ce4 that favors the electron transfer in the fenton reaction system in addition the loss of metal toward the reaction medium was low iron 0 22 mg l 1 and cerium 0 63 mg l 1 which might indicate the high stability of the composite fe3o4 nps were deposited onto borosilicate glass and the composite was utilized in fenton like reaction for decolorization of br18 and ar88 dyes 213 the ph fe3o4 loading dye concentration and h2o2 dosage effects were studied the reaction was carried out under 250 rpm stirring speed and 25 1 c the optimal ph values to achieve the maximum removal efficiencies were 3 5 and 6 0 for br18 51 and ar88 95 respectively in addition the suitable dye concentration h2o2 concentration and fe3o4 loading were determined as 0 1 mm 10 mm and 2 g l 1 respectively furthermore the stability of fe3o4 nps coated on glass substrate was compared with powder fe3o4 obtaining that the stability was higher for fe3o4 nps coated on the borosilicate glass deng et al 128 used carbon nanotubes cnts as support for fe3o4 to remove oii the tem micrograph showed that fe3o4 nps were highly dispersed on cnts and they did not aggregate furthermore the efficiency in oii 0 25 mmol l 1 removal of both fe3o4 nps and f3o4 cnts were compared using 500 mg l 1 of each catalyst the results showed that fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 cnts removed 37 1 and 94 0 of dye this indicated that the catalytic activity of fe3o4 was enhanced using cnts as support lima et al 214 used ac prepared from coconut shells as support of iron oxides they assessed the influence of the iron content 2 5 5 10 15 on the catalytic properties of the catalysts the results showed that the ac iron oxide magnetite with a core of hematite catalyst with 15 of iron was the most active in the mb removal by adsorption and fenton reaction this was mainly due to the high iron amount on the surface magnetic cobalt ferrites cofe2o4 on activated carbon ac nanocomposites were also synthesized by chen et al 215 the nanocomposites were employed in catalysis with potassium hydrogen persulfate pms to degrade mb cofe2o4 acted as the catalyst for so4 active radicals in the removal of organic pollutants besides the superparamagnetic behavior of the catalyst allowed their separation through a magnetic field the mb removal was about 96 after four cycles indicating the good stability and reusability of the employed catalyst guan et al 216 prepared cufe2o4 supported on rectorite sludge derived biochar to obtain cufe2o4 rsdbc composites which were employed to obtain so4 radicals from persulfate for ao7 removal they determined the optimal reaction conditions being ps concentration 2 mm catalyst dosage 0 6 g l 1 initial ph value 7 0 and 25 c of reaction temperature under these conditions a 95 of ao7 removal was achieved while 82 3 of dye removal was maintained after the third cycle recently sadaf et al 217 have developed magnetic nano biocomposites cnps with iron oxide nps stabilized with wheat straw cellulose they studied the mo removal by both adsorption and catalytic activity the results showed that the maximal removal of the dye by adsorption was only 10 even at 5 mg ml 1 while cnps with h2o2 act as peroxidase mimics removing 30 of the mo at 5 mg ml 1 concentration and ph 5 0 however the highest dye removal efficiency of cnps was observed at ph 3 0 with 100 efficiency which could be due to their peroxidase activity being the highest under acidic ph conditions in addition the thermal and ph stability of cnps were studied in comparison with commercial peroxidase cnps were active in the wide ph range of 3 9 and at 65 c for 48 h while the commercial peroxidase lost 50 of its activity after 1 h and was stable only in a ph range of 6 0 7 0 liu et al 187 synthesized biomass activated carbon bac from waste biomass fallen platanus orientalis leaves as support of fe3o4 nps fe3o4 bac was evaluated in mb degradation determining the optimal experimental conditions and reaction mechanism as a result fe3o4 bac 1 2 showed a high crystallinity uniform particle size and good dispersibility furthermore the nanocomposite permitted the mb removal with good capability for recycling in addition the mb removal by fe3o4 bac in presence of h2o2 correspond to oh radical mechanism jiao et al 46 compared the catalytic activity of fe3o4 nps and fe3o4 nps on cellulose aerogels fe3o4 ca in fenton like degradation of rhb the fe3o4 ca nanocomposite was synthesized through a hydrothermal method the results showed that the supported nps presented enhanced activity achieving a 100 of rhb removal in 64 h the homogeneous dispersion of fe3o4 nps in the cellulose aerogel increased the active sites for fenton like reaction cs is a linear natural polysaccharide which has been widely employed as support of fe3o4 nps however the cs has a poor mechanical strength which affects its degradation efficiency hence glut can be employed to stabilize cs hou et al 218 also utilized hydroxyapatite ca10 po4 6 oh 2 ha to improve the stability of cs this composite was used as support of fe3o4 to develop a heterogeneous fenton catalyst to remove ay220 from water the magnetic composite could remove as high as 95 of the dye through adsorption and catalysis that coexist during the process of heterogeneous fenton like reaction cellulose is an organic polymer with vast abundance in nature this polymer constitutes a suitable support for fe3o4 catalyst due to its biodegradability renewable properties large surface area and mechanical properties furthermore cellulose contains strong inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonds owing to abundance of hydroxyl groups which may allow their surface modification to anchor efficiently the fe3o4 nps 115 fe3o4 nps were synthesized by co precipitation in presence of the modified micro crystalline cellulose bearing the macrocyclic moieties with schiff base units 219 the macrocyclic chelating system was made as outlined below dialdehyde cellulose dac was modified with o phenylenediamine phda through schiff base formation between the carbonyl group of dac and the active amino group of pda posteriorly a polycondensation of benzil bz with phda cross linked cellulose phda g dac was carried out obtaining 1 2 diphenylethanedione c cellulose 2 3 bis benzene 1 2 diamine bz phda g dac finally the fe3o4 nps were deposited into the concavity of functionalized amino cellulose via an in situ process to obtain hybrid bz phda g dac fe3o4 nps this nanocomposite could disperse in aqueous solution which made it appropriate to be applied as a catalyst in fenton like reaction then the catalyst was utilized in ay17 removal in comparison with fe3o4 nps obtaining that the cellulose schiff base enhanced the mass transfer of pollutants towards the active sites fe2 fe3 during the reaction hence the complete removal of ay17 was obtained in 30 min of reaction under optimal conditions lu et al 220 prepared fe3o4 nps on pretreated cellulose the cellulose was treated through mechanical activation and metal salts mafcc to break its inter and intra molecular hydrogen bonds and stable structure besides fe3o4 nps also were supported on cellulose only treated with mechanical activation mac then the fe3o4 nps were anchored on the pre treated cellulose surface by co precipitation the obtained catalysts were employed in a fenton like system for mb removal the fe3o4 mac and fe3o4 mafcc catalysts showed high catalytic activity achieving a 90 8 and 98 2 respectively furthermore after ten cycles the efficiency in the degradation went down to 37 8 for fe3o4 mac and 61 2 for fe3o4 mafcc this loss in the catalytic activity of fe3o4 mac could be due to the detachment of the fe3o4 nps from the surface of cellulose during the degradation while the fe3o4 mafcc was the most stable owing to the strong interaction between mafcc and fe3o4 qin et al 115 prepared magnetic composite nanospheres by anchoring the fe3o4 nps on the surface of carboxyl cellulose nanospheres via co precipitation the obtained nanocomposite showed superparamagnetic behavior which allowed its recovery through an external magnetic field the catalytic efficiency of nanocomposite to remove navy blue nb was evaluated by using it as a catalyst in fenton like reaction in presence of h2o2 the maximum removal of 98 0 was achieved at 5 min and 75 0 of the removal efficiency could be maintained after five cycles under optimized conditions gao et al 62 synthesized anisotropic fe3o4 nps nanorods in a hydrogel matrix sodium 2 acrylamido 2 methyl 1 propanesulfonate hydrogel pnaamps and assessed the performance of this nanocomposite to remove mb rhb and cr from water as a result the hybrid nanocomposites removed the dyes due to the combination of the catalytic activities of fe3o4 nps and the adsorption capacities of hydrogel networks the decolorization was completed with 2 min of adsorption and 3 min of degradation in addition only 25 of cr was removed in 150 s of adsorption and 180 s of degradation due to the electrostatic repulsion between the anionic dye and the anionic hydrogel while cationic rhb removal was 85 at the same time lu et al 221 used cellulose microfibrils cmf as support of fe3o4 nps and cu based metal organic framework hkust 1 the hkust 1 fe3o4 cmf composite catalyst was characterized and then it was employed in mb removal by adsorption and fenton like reaction the adsorption capacity toward mb of the composite was 68 while the degradation efficiency in the presence of h2o2 was of 98 which went down to 91 5 after five cycles the catalytic mechanism with hydrogen peroxide requires that the hydrogen peroxide reacts with the magnetite generating the hydroxyl and other radicals with the dye near the surface of the supported magnetite the reaction proceeds fig 4 shows the relative sizes and the interaction of a local model of magnetite mag with an anthraquinone dye alizarin red s and hydrogen peroxide fig 5 shows the interaction of an azo dye orange ii with an immobilized mag the support could be any solid where the magnetite is immobilized these figures show the steric interactions of the dyes with the mag and the surface the efficiency of a pollutant degradation in the case of the use of hydrogen peroxide needs a discussion about the efficiency of the oxidant production our group has published about the fenton mechanism homogeneous and heterogeneous 223 there have been several controversies related to the mechanism of hydrogen peroxide activation and even the secondary reactions see manuscripts of kremer 224 the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide conversion to free radicals and ions is strongly dependent on the reaction media composition see references in 223 several strategies have been explored to avoid in fenton the hydrogen peroxide decomposition for one side the catalatic reaction and to improve the conversion to active species in dye degradation the discussion is active in terms of different models for the fenton reaction haber and weiss barb et al and kremer 224 in the radical model the ideal ratio is 1 1 for fe2 and h2o2 whereas it is 2 1 for the o2 generation through the formation of a feo2 experimentally the optimum ratios to obtain high dyes degradation and chemical oxygen demand cod reduction is much higher the recent manuscript of giwa et al 2020 demonstrated in homogeneous fenton for methylene blue degradation that the optimum ratio h2o2 fe2 was near 175 when fe2 was 4 mm at ph 3 and 298 k with hydrogen peroxide at 70 mm 225 this manuscript shows that an excess of hydrogen peroxide is needed due to secondary reactions to decompose methylene blue mb the excess depends on ph reaction media composition and temperature the results were close to those reported on fenton treatment regarding the degradation of azo dyes the effective condition was reported at an iron to hydrogen peroxide ratio of 1 20 in dye degradation 226 at an initial mb concentration of around 20 mg l 1 the fenton process was operative as a color degradation efficiency of 98 8 within 30 min with a cod removal of 85 several strategies have been explored to increase the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide and to decrease the concentration of iron and hydrogen peroxide with similar dye degradation among them the step addition of hydrogen peroxide has been reported 227 the interest in heterogeneous fenton and the possibility of the application at industrial level fuels the research in this area 7 synergistic effect of adsorption and fenton like reaction 7 1 general previous work bello et al 228 published an overview on the application of combined adsorption aops for the removal of recalcitrant pollutants from water they concluded that some advantages of integrating adsorption with aops include higher performance shorter treatment time and regeneration of spent adsorbents the combination of adsorption and fenton oxidation could be employed with two different aims the ionzyme with dual function adsorbent and catalyst in fenton like reaction or as a part of a system for which it only plays the role of catalyst in the fenton like reaction 228 first ionzymes can act either as adsorbent and heterogeneous catalyst for instance li et al 184 employed fe3o4 ceo2 composite to remove mb in this case the composite fulfils a dual function role as both adsorbent and fenton like catalyst in presence of h2o2 the ceo2 had abundant vacancies of ce3 which gives it a great capacity of adsorption and the fe2 and ce4 generate an effect synergistic that enhances the catalytic activity without h2o2 addition the efficiency in the removal was lower while when h2o2 was added the mb removal was improved second the adsorption can be used as a process integrated with oxidation either as fenton like or as sulfate radical mediated oxidation as a complement for example chen et al 215 used magnetic cobalt ferrites cofe2o4 activated carbon ac nanocomposites as catalysts for potassium hydrogen persulfate pms to degrade mb in this case the cofe2o4 acted as a catalyst in the generation of sulfate radicals while the activated carbon accomplished the role of adsorbent creating a synergistic effect in the dye removal in addition lu et al 220 prepared hkust 1 fe3o4 cmf composite catalyst both cellulose microfibrils and hkust 1 act as adsorbents while the fenton like reaction was catalyzed by fe3o4 nps when fe3o4 nps were used in presence of h2o4 only a 25 of mb was removed while fe3o4 cmf and fe3o4 hkust 1 could remove 50 and 67 respectively when fe3o4 cmf hkust 1 composite was used the efficiency in the mb removal went up to 98 indicating a synergistic effect between the adsorption and fenton like reaction the problem with these approaches is that a potential contaminant is added such as the persulfate salt 7 2 published literature by our group about these topics in the last years the catalysis group in plapiqui has studied the synthesis and application of iron oxides as adsorbents and as part of biocatalysts as support of enzymes and biomimetics in fenton heterogeneous reactions the removal of aromatic compounds by processes based on enzymes or their biomimetics has been a focus of research hpr particularly the c isoenzyme or hrpc the most abundant has been the subject of exhaustive study in multiple applications in the elimination of phenol and aniline derived compounds the hrp immobilization is a necessary step to make the process cost effective otherwise it would be prohibitively expensive furthermore the use of biomimetics of the hrp as iron porphyrins and iron or ferrous complexes with aniline ligands have also been extensively researched ferreira 229 demonstrated through characterization studies using ultraviolet uv visible light that unsupported soluble complexes of this type are capable of activate h2o2 and generating free radicals besides saidman et al 230 studied the immobilization of hrp and hematin in fe3o4 with the aim of removing aniline by polymerization posteriorly pirillo et al 231 assessed the ability of goethite co substituted goethite and fe3o4 to adsorb dyes with azo ebbr anthraquinone ars and aril methane fluorescein groups this was carried out via adsorption isotherms and kinetic analysis the results showed that all iron oxides were effective adsorbents to remove dyes from solution ars exhibited the highest affinity with the adsorbents evaluated while fluorescein showed the lowest affinity co goethite goethite magnetite furthermore the effect of the ph in the adsorption process was also studied 232 these studies allowed to infer that the iron oxides might be promising dye adsorbents and that the magnetic properties of the fe3o4 could facilitate their recovery from treated effluents in a subsequent study pirillo et al 5 compared the adsorption abilities of fe3o4 and goethite α fe3 o oh with a biopolymer chitosan using ars ebbr and fluorescein as a model dyes they found that chitosan had higher adsorption capacity for ars and ebbr than iron oxides while goethite showed higher adsorption for fluoresceine at ph 5 and 9 this might occur since the adsorption capacity of chitosan is related to the availability of amino groups in its structure which in turn depends on ph pirillo et al 233 carried out a comparative analysis between hrp and hematin as catalysts in the removal of ebbr and fluorescein dyes using h2o2 as oxidizing agent both catalysts were efficient in the ebbr removal with dissimilar mechanisms while fluorescein was only oxidized by hrp however it presented low efficiency at high dye concentration in addition the immobilization of hrp and hematin on magnetite activated carbon activated carbon and chitosan was carried out 234 the supported biocatalysts were applied in the ars and ebbr removal the biocatalyst based on magnetite activated carbon and activated carbon were discarded the chitosan glut hrp biocatalyst showed low adsorption capacity and the enzymatic activity of hrp in ebbr removal could not be evident besides the performance of chitosan glut hematin in ebbr removal was influenced by the dye concentration and the mass of catalyst while the temperature had no significant effect on the dye degradation h2o2 concentration of 0 021 m a relevant aspect of this study was the adsorption of dyes on the support used i e fe3o4 acted as a dye adsorbent and a mimetic due to the surface iron reaction with h2o2 recently cabrera et al 235 mathematically described the kinetics of degradation reaction of oii alkaline solution catalyzed by hematin as mimetics of peroxidase using h2o2 as oxidizing agent the peroxidatic pseudo catalatic model was selected as the most suitable for a wide range of conditions 25 400 mg l 1 oii concentration 2 4 10 mm h2o2 concentration and 3 17 mg l 1 hematin concentration at room temperature and alkaline ph 10 6 this model involves two reversible inactivation routes h2o2 and oii efe formation and e oii formation the study of the proper synthesis of fe3o4 nps based catalysts and their use in combination with h2o2 for azo and anthraquinone dye degradation would be appropriate in this sense as a precedent nicolás et al 84 synthesized fe3o4 based mnps through co precipitation method using oleic acid as stabilizer then the fe3o4 nps were coated with chitosan biopolymer via nanoprecipitation the tem micrographics showed high agglomeration of naked fe3o4 and sizes of around 10 nm while the fe3o4 coated with oleic acid exhibited better dispersion and sizes between 13 20 nm a relevant aspect in the co precipitation method is the order in which the additives and alkali solution are added although the nps modified with chitosan contain a minimal amount of fe3o4 they showed satisfactory magnetic properties thus the subject has evolved from the application of enzymes and their biomimetics to the mimetics of enzymes based on iron oxides ionzymes 8 innovations for known problems in environmental solutions the problems reviewed in this manuscript have hindered the diffusion of the nps in the field of textile effluent remediation the leaching of iron may be solved with the adequate support and binding of the nps to an adequate support through the adequate protocol by using cross linkers and or modifiers the immobilized nps increase their stability and the goal is that they maintain their activity in the target reaction the innovation in this field requires to know about the textile or paper industry and how difficult technically is to introduce new equipment or new procedures in general changes are slow and expensive to be implemented therefore the field should explore additional aspects to consider if the implementation of the nps with h2o2 to clear color is the goal these additional aspects include a the easy introduction and extraction of the catalytic solid using low cost equipment b the reuse of the catalytic solid or the adsorbent whereas it is possible c the adequate disposal of the generated solid waste after adsorption or the use of the exhausted solids supported magnetite and or adsorbent in other environmental application d the detection of new avenues of innovation in textile effluent treatment process textile factories with effluent treatment plants etp have several problems among them the inadequate treatment due to incorrect dosing of chemicals required in the treatment process with inactivity and even death of microorganisms this takes place due to the ph insufficient oxygen or lack of nutrients all of these can be addressed through chemical dosing a new method should use the same equipment and installations it should increase productivity and efficient use of water flow and it should generate an important change in improved operativity textile industry generates a big volume of wastewater including chemicals used in dyeing printing and finishing processes the physicochemical treatment always comes before the biological treatment units it is clear that the oxidation with h2o2 using immobilized magnetite nps is a secondary or tertiary treatment the introduction of innovation about how the catalytic solid is introduced in the effluent treatment plant or etp is key to future success the effluents treated with aops were found to reduce 70 80 cod when compared to 30 45 reduction in biological treatment 236 other topic of importance is the reuse of the generated solids when using adsorbents and catalytic solids in aops the contaminant changes its place from a solution to a solid and transforms the catalyst or adsorbent in solid waste after several uses and exhaustion therefore the nature is changed from wastewater to solid waste however after using the immobilized magnetite has adsorbed several organic compounds when magnetite is supported it includes the role of the support as dye adsorbent these adsorbed compounds could be ligands for transition metal ions dissolved in water such as fig 6 shows the cost effective solids based on nanomaterials combined with biological substrates have been considered heavy metal adsorbents 237 those adsorbents require little processing are abundant in nature or are a by product or waste material from another industry and can be denominated as low cost adsorbents 238 minimal treatment or conditioning of the spent adsorbent could allow its subsequent application as a heavy metal adsorbent in this sense the industrial solid wastes particularly the exhausted adsorbent gain relevance soliman and moustafa 239 reviewed several factors such as ph temperature adsorbent dosage and contact time that influence heavy metal adsorption onto industrial solid wastes the heavy metal removal will be conditioned by chemical structure of the adsorbent surface area and availability of surface active centers hence an adequate characterization of solid adsorbent is a fundamental aspect to later consider its potential application even more ma and liu 240 propose the use of contaminant laden adsorbents cr6 fe3o4 c as anodes with high potassium storage capacity additionally the ash of waste adsorbents based on biomass have been considered partial cement replacement as well as aggregates in the concrete production 241 the value given to waste would allow the reduction of the use of raw material as well as the production of waste to be disposed of the landfill disposal of waste adsorbent is not environmentally advisable due to the presence of inorganics in them and the risk of contaminant leaching in this way the use of biomass including magnetite and adsorbed organic compounds has been recently reported as interesting in cement biofuels and in the adsorption of heavy metals from contaminated wastewaters including hg2 the exhausted catalysts used in aops in etp could be used to solve other environmental problems such as the heavy metal contamination in the wastewater of other industries the topic of the further use of exhausted catalytic materials and adsorbents from the textile or paper industry effluents as adsorbents fillers or sources of high value products will be explored in a future manuscript 9 conclusions the development of nanozymes nanomaterials with intrinsic enzymatic properties has emerged as an appealing alternative to the natural enzymes with application potential in several fields particularly the iron oxide based nanozymes ionzymes have demonstrated high efficiency in the recalcitrant organic compounds for instance azo and anthraquinone dyes removal from water in fenton like process due to the intrinsic peroxidase like activity of iron oxide nps in addition ionzymes can be combined with a wide gamma of materials which constitute a significant challenge the use of oh radical from h2o2 seems to be promising due to the high efficiency in the dye removal however the use of so4 is being studied and although the generation of sulfate radicals as an oxidant agent shows high efficiency the sulfate leaving in the treated water has a negative effect on the environment the treated effluent with this process could require desulfidation as posterior treatment which increment the process cost among the strategies used to improve the performance of fe3o4 based nanozymes the stabilization and functionalization of nps with different compounds have been explored this allows to reduce the agglomeration of nps which negatively affects its catalytic efficiency in fenton like reaction however optimal reaction conditions comprising acidic ph and high temperatures lead to the search of other mechanisms of improvement to overcome these shortcomings the isomorphic substitution of fe2 ions in the fe3o4 with other transition metals proves to be a suitable alternative mainly with cu2 according to the literature reviewed in addition the use of materials as catalyst support allows providing greater stability to the nanocomposite and generating synergistic effects between adsorption and fenton like catalytic activity intrinsic to fe3o4 nps the potential of using aops in desorption and regeneration of spent adsorbents is attractive aops can regenerate spent adsorbents by degrading the adsorbed pollutants as has been demonstrated in many studies besides the use of supports derived from biomass seems to be promising since it implies the use of renewable sources of materials which might be environmentally sustainable the high performance of nanozymes in small scale experiments is evident but the application in environmental remediation is still limited among the disadvantages that still need to be investigated in depth are the acidic ph as an optimal reaction condition the dissolution of metal ions in the reaction medium the deactivation of the catalyst and the generation of contaminating by products that require an adequate final disposal hence the knowledge to apply nanozymes in the remediation of colored effluents is still in continuous development another aspect to consider is the output of the process of dyed wastewater remediation when supported ionzymes are used because of the treatment the exhausted catalytic and adsorbent solids become waste at present their application in other processes is being explored this valorization of the exhausted adsorbent could be a possibility to open new directions for waste management toward reuse in effective practical applications declaration of competing

13573,this study investigates the capability of tetraselmis sp for treating mariculture wastewater in a 70 l high rate algal pond and determines the feasibility of using the resulting biomass the culture medium contained 45 mg l 1 nitrates 10 mg l 1 nitrites 30 mg l 1 ammonium 17 mg l 1 orthophosphates and 270 mg o2 l 1 of dissolved organic matter as chemical oxygen demand cod the culture was kept under a 12 h 12 h light darkness photoperiod using a photosynthetically active photon flux density of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 and a temperature of 23 2 c a 4 cycle growth semicontinuous culture was used obtaining on average 1 19 g l 1 dry biomass with lipid content of 62 16 mg g 1 in the first batch culture cycle 11 4 of highly non saturated fatty acids were obtained and a significant decrease thereof was observed in subsequent batch culture cycles nutrient removals were 95 5 0 4 total nitrogen 94 4 0 5 ortho phosphates and 61 4 3 9 cod these results show the feasibility of mariculture wastewater treatment using the studied microalga with the advantage of producing biomass containing accumulated lipids and usable as food for mariculture species thus it may be possible to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment and of culturing marine species keywords phycoremediation tetraselmis mariculture wastewater microalgal biomass nutrient removal 1 introduction aquaculture and marine aquaculture systems are used to culture aquatic animals and plants such as fishes mollusks shellfishes and aquatic plants 1 this activity produces wastewater and a deficient planning and operation can adversely impact the integrity of the coastline environment 2 generally aquaculture systems are concentrated in small areas increasing the amount of locally discharged nutrients this contributes to eutrophication increasing the occurrence intensity and duration of hypoxic conditions in coastal waters around the world as the production of the aquaculture industry increases eutrophication increases too 3 uncontrolled growth of fish and shrimp farms means greater volumes of effluents being discharged to several sites many cultures are carried out in ponds generating effluents that are discharged not only during drainage and water makeup but also during rains leading to non specific pollution sources 4 as the aquaculture industry intensively develops its environmental impact increases water discharges from this industry negatively affect the environment as the demand of fish and shellfish production for food increases 5 the environmental impacts of marine aquaculture depend on various factors such as species culture method feed hydrography etc 6 however there is a high generation of particulates soluble organic wastes and soluble inorganic excretory waste that is discharged to the environment 7 producing substantial impact on the nutrient load in coastal areas incrementing biodeposition and altering the sediments quality 8 the non soluble fraction of wastes is accumulated as sediments near the discharge area so the major impact is in the sea bottom where there is an increasing oxygen demand causing anoxic conditions and toxic gases production thereby reducing the benthic diversity 6 all of these result in variations in the water column composition and alteration of the biogeochemical cycles waste discharge causes an increase in nutrient levels turbidity and organic matter and a decrease in ph oxygen concentration and conductivity the extensive use of chemicals affects coastal bacterial and plankton communities and increases the presence of opportunistic predators that affect the ecosystem ecology 8 there is a need for a wastewater treatment of the discharged water to prevent harmful effects to the ecosystem conventional systems cannot efficiently remove nitrogen and phosphorus present in wastewaters consequently more efficient and cost effective processes are required one of the main methods to deal with saline wastewater is the non treated or partially treated direct discharge to the ocean via outfalls 9 biological treatment systems like sequencing batch reactors activated sludge biodiscs and membrane bioreactors have high removal efficiencies but the efficiencies tend to decrease at higher salinities or nutrient loads 10 other methods used are reverse osmosis filtration and electrodialysis 11 but these are expensive another alternative is electrocoagulation capable of high efficiency removals of nitrogen and phosphorous 12 but it generates sludge that requires further processing microalgae can remove nitrogen and phosphorous at high efficiencies by promoting algal growth and regulating metabolic activities 13 processes using microalgae are known for being a promising option for wastewater treatment 14 however to reduce the overall treatment costs said processes must produce commercially valuable byproducts 15 phycoremediation is directly related to microalgae growth so factors that promote growth could increase remediation efficiency and enhance biomass productivity the resulting biomass has several applications such as biofuels biofertilizers and aquaculture nutrition 16 for this reason high rate algal ponds hraps are an excellent option as they combine the presence of microalgae capable of removing nitrogen and phosphorus from water and the provision of oxygen to heterotrophic bacteria decomposing organic matter 17 an additional advantage is the low costs of construction operation and maintenance of hraps currently microalgae that are used as food in aquaculture are cultured using artificial means requiring high volumes of fresh water so a recirculation system may be implemented where the wastewater production is used for the microalgae culture which subsequently can be used as food for the aquaculture species in parallel the generated wastewater can be treated by recycling the nutrients present in it for microalgae biomass obtention that would be used for byproducts production and the treated water could either be re used in said aquaculture operation or discharged to the ecosystem with no negative effects this would reduce the costs associated with purchasing food for the aquaculture operation as well as the reliance on resources such as water and nutrients for culturing the microalgae 18 microalgae also could be harvested to obtain other byproducts this process can account for 20 up to 30 of the cost of biomass processing 19 depending on the harvesting technology several factors such as cell age shape species density and size influence the harvesting process in general harvesting involves two steps thickening that can be achieved by flocculation flotation and or sedimentation and a second step of further dewatering that could be performed by centrifugation or filtration 20 marine algae of the genus tetraselmis are widely used in aquaculture as a source of food for certain fishes oysters and mollusks tetraselmis algae are 10 and 20 μm unicellular flagellated algae capable of being produced at large scale facilities due to their ability to withstand a wide salt concentration range 0 35 21 and temperature range 2 34 c their nutritional requirements are minimal since their growth does not depend on vitamins and they assimilate nitrogen from ammonium urea nitrates or amino acids 22 batch cultures require maintaining strain inocula and cleaning reactors between runs which increases the consumables demand and results in low productivity a semicontinuous or continuous culture has advantages over batch culture because the productivity achieved in batch culture can be maintained in optimized semicontinuous or continuous processes culture cycle duration can be adjusted to changing environment conditions and in this case biomass production and accumulation of relevant products occur within the same reactor 23 also a semicontinuous culture has a lower cost and the composition of the biomass can be more consistent 24 therefore this study has focused on cultivating tetraselmis sp in a hrap fed in a semicontinuous manner with water that simulate a marine aquaculture effluent the objective of the study is to determine the capability of tetraselmis sp to remove nutrients so these nutrients could be recycled and transformed to microalgal biomass that in turn can be transformed to value added byproducts such as food for marine aquaculture species or for biofuel production obtaining low cost reusable treated water and high biomass productivity and lipid accumulation in the microalga results in the ability to obtain byproducts that could reduce the costs of treating wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 physicochemical characterization of water the synthetic wastewater used in this study was prepared based on the characterization made of the actual wastewater effluents from growing commercial marine species such as octopus shrimp seabass corvina snapper and ornamental species collected at the facilities of the yucatan academic unit of unam located in sisal yucatan mexico 21 164468574129128 n 90 04835312636192 w phosphorous nitrites ammonia nitrogen and nitrates were measured by spectrophotometry 25 26 ph and dissolved oxygen were determined via electrodes 27 culture medium salinity was determined by using an instant ocean hydrometer and chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by the closed reflux colorimetric method described by 28 2 2 culture of the microalga tetraselmis sp was donated by the ceparium of the live feed laboratory of the multidisciplinary unit of teaching and research in sisal yucatan of the sciences faculty unam this microalga was cultivated in a hrap with the following dimensions 1 1 m length 0 8 m wide and 0 1 m deep having a culture capacity of 70 l fig 1 the reactor is a plug flow type reactor with recirculation 29 the hrap was kept under a greenhouse at a temperature within the range of 21 26 c the culture was kept under a 12 h

agitation by a paddle wheel in the hrap previous to inoculation of the hrap tetraselmis sp was cultured in 4 l erlenmeyer flasks at the same conditions described before the culture is maintained until the exponential phase and once the death phase is reached half of the culture volume 35 l is removed then additional wastewater 35 l is added simulating the mariculture effluent thereby obtaining a microalga semicontinuous culture this was repeated 3 times 2 3 wastewater simulating a mariculture effluent the characterization of the marine aquaculture wastewater is presented in table 1 artificial seawater was prepared using instant ocean sea salt with a salinity of 31 g kg 1 then 370 mg l 1 sodium acetate cas 17 09 3 15 6 mg l 1 k3po4 cas 7778 53 2 110 1 mg l 1 nh4 2so4 cas 7783 20 2 7 5 mg l

octopus european bass corvina snapper and ornamental species at the multidisciplinary unit of the unam in sisal yucatan mexico 2 4 microalga growth the microalga growth was determined by measuring the optical density of the culture at 680 nm the optical density to biomass dry weight ratio was previously determined 30 the specific growth rate and biomass and lipid productivity were calculated according to 31 the nutrient removal kinetics were calculated according to 32 by the following equation r s i s f t f t i where r is the removal rate of the nutrient si is the nutrient concentration at the beginning of the culture sf is the nutrient concentration at the end of the cycle tf is the time at the end of the cycle and ti the time at the start of the cycle 2 5 biomass lipid content the lipid content in the biomass was determined by colorimetric reaction using phosphoric acid and vanillin 33 2 6 harvesting of microalga isolation of microalgae from the culture medium was done by flocculation using chitosan cas 9012 76 4 at different concentrations and different ph values to determine the best doses so as to achieve the highest algae removal from the culture medium 34 a jar test was conducted varying ph and chitosan concentration in order to obtain the condition at which most biomass could be harvested chitosan was chosen as flocculant since it is cheap requires low dose for harvesting and it is biodegradable 35 and has been used in microalgae harvesting giving successful results 19 2 7 extraction of lipids from the microalga lipid extraction was carried out with methanol cas 67 56 1 acetone cas 67 64 1 and ethoxyethanol cas 110 80 5 at 60 c and using sonication according to the methodology as described in 36 2 8 carbohydrate content in the tetraselmis sp biomass the carbohydrate content was determined by hydrolysis with h2so4 cas 7664 93 9 and colorimetric reaction with phenol according to the methodology as described in 37 2 9 lipid content and fatty acids profile lipid transesterification was carried out using a basic catalyst sodium methoxide cas 124 41 4 and a methanol cas 67 56 1 to oil ratio of 5 1 at 60 c for 1 h 38 the fatty acids profile was carried out at the research and industry services unit usaii of the faculty of chemistry unam using a chromatograph coupled to a perkin elmer mass spectrometer helium was used as the carrier gas the temperature ramp used was as follows the oven was kept at 60 c for 3 min then the temperature was increased at a rate of 10 c min 1 up to 300 c and maintained for 5 min 39 a mixture of 37 fatty acid methyl esters from supelco was used as standard 2 10 statistical analysis all experiments were done by triplicate n 3 an analysis of variance was made to determine if there was inter experimental significant difference and said differences were determined by a tukey s test the confidence interval was of 5 α 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out by the r software 3 results and analysis 3 1 tetraselmis sp culture at the beginning of the culture there is a ph increase fig 2 which corresponds to the microalga growth fig 3 this increase in ph could be the reason of the slow adaptation phase of the microalga since a rise in ph decreases the inorganic carbon availability in culture medium thus limiting the microalga growth 40 then there is a decrease in ph close to day 20 fig 2 which corresponds to the stage where no biomass increase was observed fig 3 the lack of a biomass increase may be an indicator of a decrease in photosynthetic activity and the reason for a new decrease in ph once the lowest ph value is reached it starts increasing fig 2 again due to the microalga growth until day 60 fig 3 the decrease in ph after day 60 is due to the extraction of half the volume of the culture medium and the addition of new culture medium with lower ph the ph peaks and valleys after day 60 and then after day 80 correspond to the microalga growth and the extraction and addition of culture medium due to the semi continuous culture it is seen that the biomass peaks fig 3 match with the ph peaks fig 2 where values close to 9 and above are reached this is due to a greater photosynthetic activity of the microalgae there were no pronounced stationary phases in the culture fig 3 in this case when the microalga reaches the highest biomass production it appears that the death phase starts almost instantly this results in a lipid peak that then starts declining fig 3 the reason behind this is that in the fed batch process the addition of new culture medium once the nutrients reached a low concentration stopped the progression of the stationary phase there is a microalga acclimation stage between culture days 0 28 from day 0 7 the microalga grows exponentially then stops growing and the biomass concentration stays substantially unchanged until day 28 when the microalga starts growing again exponentially the acclimation state was long because the microalga was grown in 4 l erlenmeyer flasks before being inoculated into the hrap and took time to adapt to the volume change and the paddle wheel shearing force the first batch growing cycle is from day 28 62 the second batch cycle from day 63 78 the third cycle from day 79 92 and the fourth cycle from day 93 105 the decrease of nitrogen orthophosphates and cod are shown in fig 4 concentration peaks on the graphs are due to the addition of culture medium once the microalga reached the stationary phase which is also the timepoint where half the volume of the culture is extracted during the acclimation phase of around 28 days a slower decrease of nitrogen orthophosphates and organic matter is observed from day 30 the decrease in these concentrations is accelerated fig 4 due to the microalga growth fig 3 the concentration of organic matter total nitrogen and orthophosphates reached a minimum before the addition of culture medium showing a plateau these plateaus are shorter in each subsequent culturing cycle shorter nutrient plateaus are indicative of shorter variation intervals which means a greater control of the culture the kinetics of cod removal has a tendency to increase in each culturing cycle which could be the reason for the shorter plateaus if the kinetics of the removal tends to increase then the plateaus could reach a minimum leading to a continuous culturing nevertheless the kinetics of nitrogen removal increased only from the first culture cycle and then remained constant for orthophosphates there is also an increase from cycle 1 to cycle 2 but then there is a decrease in the kinetics of the removal at cycle 3 which stays constant at cycle 4 table 2 from day 63 79 another batch growth cycle took place as shown in fig 3 after 77 days of culturing a maximum lipid concentration is observed 60 7 mg l 1 on day 79 the lipid content decreased and this same day there was a new replacement of culturing medium lipids are used as an indicator of culture medium replacement lipids could be used for biofuel production and are a key component in biomass for aquaculture feed so the lipid content in the biomass is of great importance the next batch growth cycle took place from day 80 92 when the highest lipid content was observed on day 91 of culturing 75 2 mg l 1 the last batch growth cycle was from day 93 105 when the highest lipid content was obtained on day 105 77 6 mg l 1 it can be seen that when the nutrient concentration in the culture medium is low fig 4 the lipid content starts increasing fig 3 this is due to the stress conditions the microalga is subjected to thus causing it to build up lipid as backup energy 41 table 2 shows the biomass and lipid productivity the specific growth rates and the removal percentages and kinetics of nutrient removal for total nitrogen orthophosphates and cod the first batch growth cycle presents the lowest values of specific growth rates biomass and lipid productivity and nutrient removal kinetics though removal percentages are similar to other cycles table 2 this was due to the time the microalga took to grow since the first batch growth cycle lasted more than 30 days and in the next cycles the growth only took more than 10 days almost a third of the first cycle nitrogen and orthophosphate removals were about 95 with average removal kinetics of 3 11 mg l 1 day 1 and 0 81 mg l 1 day 1 respectively cod removal percentage was 61 4 on average with average removal kinetics of 6 67 mg l 1 day 1 this indicates that the microalga utilized most of the nitrogen and phosphorus present in the wastewater for growing but did not use all the carbon present therein this may be due to a low c n p ratio 15 9 5 1 in the culture medium or due to a lack of ph control in the culture medium causing that part of the phosphates and the ammonium were removed by precipitation and gasification respectively nutrient concentrations at the beginning of each batch culturing cycle were quite similar despite the nutrient removal percentages being quite similar in all the batch culturing cycles although the microalga consumed almost the same amount of nutrients there is a difference in biomass productivity which gets bigger as the microalga batch growth cycles progress this could be due to the utilization of nutrients for storage purposes during the first batch cycles and thereafter only for reproduction in batch culturing cycle 4 the productivity reaches 64 1 mg l 1 day 1 which may be due to the fact that the microalga has already adapted to the culture so later on a continuous culturing could occur once the productivity stabilizes however the lipid productivity increases but only up to cycle 3 and then it declines from cycle 3 4 but it is still higher than that of cycle 2 table 2 this could be due to culturing factors such as the ph reaches its maximum values at the beginning of this batch culture cycle and decreases as the cycle progressed an increase in ph could reduce lipid content 42 and also could affect microalga growth since the reduced lipid productivity at cycle 4 is due to a lower specific growth rate than in cycle 3 the kinetics of nitrogen removal increases as the batch growth cycles progress however this is not the case for orthophosphates since the kinetics increases from the first to the second cycle and then decreases table 2 due to the plateaus as seen in fig 4 the kinetics of cod increases from cycle 1 2 but in cycle 3 there is a slight decline and then in cycle 4 it increases again table 2 the water quality produced by the treatment significantly improves as the nitrogen and phosphorus contents decrease over 90 and the organic matter decreases over 60 measured as cod allowing the reuse of said water in the culture system or making the discharged less environmentally harmful than the discharge of untreated effluents 3 2 biomass harvesting from culture medium once 35 l of culture were removed a coagulation flocculation process with chitosan was carried out to separate the biomass from the culture medium the chitosan dose at which most of the biomass was removed is 80 mg l 1 at ph 11 by the coagulation flocculation process with chitosan about 70 biomass can be removed from the culture medium in a cost effective way thanks to the low energy expenditure since chitosan interacts with the charges at the microalga cell wall to produce flocculation an increase in the chitosan dose or a ph variation does not necessarily mean an increase in biomass removal particularly for saline waters where there is interference with the number of ions present in the medium this is the reason for a low biomass harvesting efficiency 3 3 determination of lipids in tetraselmis sp biomass in the acclimation phase between days 0 and 28 during the first days of culturing the lipid content increases as biomass increases lipid content drops when biomass stops increasing and it keeps a constant concentration until the biomass starts increasing again during the batch culturing cycles there is a similar behavior in general at the beginning of the batch culturing cycles the lipid content is high due to the previous stationary phase and the next day it declines to about 40 mg g 1 of biomass then it will increase up to a value slightly higher than 60 mg g 1 of biomass at this timepoint the medium with biomass is extracted and new culture medium is added again fig 3 in the first cycle of the microalga growth the lipid content was 49 28 mg g 1 of dry biomass and in the second third and fourth batch culturing cycles this lipid content increased to 58 23 mg g 1 63 97 mg g 1 and 65 32 mg g 1 respectively in this study an average lipid productivity of 5 57 mg l 1 day 1 was obtained from the second to fourth batch growth cycles this lipid productivity is lower than the one obtained by 43 for t suecica 24 mg l 1 day 1 after about 9 months of culture and up to 49 mg l 1 day 1 after an additional month with a culture medium replacement every 3 4 days in a closed photobioreactor this is an indicative sign that keeping the culture for a long time while reducing the time intervals for replacing the culture media thereby practically reaching a continuous culture will lead to an increased lipid productivity in the microalga by means of increasing the lipid content and the specific growth rate of the microalga at each peak in fig 3 a lipid extraction was carried out obtaining 5 29 g 7 13 g 8 64 g and 9 56 g from the first second third and fourth batch growth cycles respectively the increase in lipid content at each batch growth cycle is indicative of an induction of lipid synthesis by the microalga and therefore a continuous culture could eventually be carried out 3 4 fatty acids profile the fatty acid methyl esters concentrations found in the different culture cycles are shown in table 3 although cultures show that microalgal lipids have a tendency to increase table 2 this is not reflected in the number of fatty acids as shown the concentration of saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to decrease in every batch culturing cycle microalgae contain different groups of lipids in addition to triacylglycerols they contain sterols and polar lipids 42 so the lipid content increases but the decrease in fatty acid concentration may be due to the accumulation of a type of lipids different from fatty acids the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids remains constant during the first 3 batch culturing cycles showing a decrease in the fourth batch culturing cycle this decline is due to the absence of γ linolenic acid generally there is a tendency for most fatty acids to decrease in concentration in the batch culturing cycles except for the linoleic acid which concentration tends to increase up to batch culturing cycle 3 and at cycle 4 the concentration of all the fatty acids decrease algal oils are an energy source for aquatic animals featured as monounsaturated fatty acids and a source of essential fatty acids featured as polyunsaturated fatty acids 18 in our case monounsaturated fatty acid percentages were 38 2 for batch culturing cycles 2 and 4 which is similar to the 38 7 reported by 18 with lower percentages for cycles 1 and 3 34 8 and 36 7 respectively highly unsaturated fatty acids contain carbon chains of 20 or more carbon atoms with 3 or more unsaturated bonds they work as an energy supply for animals form cell membrane components and bioactive substances regulate lipid metabolism and promote the immune function 18 in the first batch culturing cycle 11 4 of these kind of fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and arachidonic acid were obtained slightly lower than 13 5 as reported by 18 however this percentage was considerably lower in the subsequent batch growth cycles with values of 2 1 in cycle 2 and slightly higher than 1 in cycles 3 and 4 the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids with 1 2 or 3 unsaturated bonds was 31 in batch growth cycle 1 and higher than 40 in subsequent cycles in the first batch culturing cycle there is a proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids higher than polyunsaturated fatty acids however in subsequent batch culturing cycles said proportion changed to higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids than monounsaturated fatty acids in the first batch culturing cycle there is a ω6 ω3 fatty acid ratio of about 0 5 table 3 meaning that there is a higher proportion of ω3 fatty acids however in the following batch culturing cycles said proportion increases to values even higher than 1 5 table 3 which represent an increase in ω6 fatty acids and a reduction in ω3 fatty acids 3 5 determination of carbohydrates in the tetraselmis sp biomass after extracting the lipids from the tetraselmis sp biomass the determination of carbohydrates in the residual biomass was carried out resulting in 13 3 0 4 carbohydrates in the dry microalga biomass the carbohydrate content obtained is higher compared to the study by 44 where the carbohydrate content was 6 5 after 14 days of culturing t suecica in municipal wastewater however in the study by 45 who cultured tetraselmis sp in urban wastewater a carbohydrate content of 57 2 after 20 days of continuous culture was obtained far higher than the carbohydrate content in the present study said lower carbohydrate content may be due to the fact that the microalga of the present study was maintained with low concentration of nutrients up to the stationary phase resulting in that the carbohydrates at the beginning of the stationary phase are being gradually transformed into lipids reducing the cell carbohydrate content based on the carbohydrate content a theoretical calculation of the potential bioethanol amount obtained from the microalga biomass was performed using the equation suggested in 46 ethanol yield from the tetraselmis sp biomass is 8 8 ml l 1 this yield is higher than the one obtained by 44 where the yield of ethanol from t suecica was 1 7 ml l 1 however this is much lower than the one obtained in the study by 45 43 9 ml l 1 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study suggest that tetraselmis sp has the potential for treating wastewater from mariculture effluents given that higher removals of total nitrogen phosphates and chemical oxygen demand were obtained biomass is produced throughout the culturing process with increasing amounts of biomass in every batch growth cycle therefore it has the potential to be used for producing added value products whereby the wastewater treatment costs can be reduced for example it may be used as food source for aquaculture species in marine aquaculture due to the presence of high contents of omega 3 fatty acids such as linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid during the first batch culturing cycle fatty acids could be used in biodiesel production after extracting the lipids the biomass could be used to obtain bioethanol or biomethane reducing even more the wastewater treatment costs declaration of competing interest authors manuel sacristán de alva and víctor manuel luna pabello have no conflict of

13573,this study investigates the capability of tetraselmis sp for treating mariculture wastewater in a 70 l high rate algal pond and determines the feasibility of using the resulting biomass the culture medium contained 45 mg l 1 nitrates 10 mg l 1 nitrites 30 mg l 1 ammonium 17 mg l 1 orthophosphates and 270 mg o2 l 1 of dissolved organic matter as chemical oxygen demand cod the culture was kept under a 12 h 12 h light darkness photoperiod using a photosynthetically active photon flux density of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 and a temperature of 23 2 c a 4 cycle growth semicontinuous culture was used obtaining on average 1 19 g l 1 dry biomass with lipid content of 62 16 mg g 1 in the first batch culture cycle 11 4 of highly non saturated fatty acids were obtained and a significant decrease thereof was observed in subsequent batch culture cycles nutrient removals were 95 5 0 4 total nitrogen 94 4 0 5 ortho phosphates and 61 4 3 9 cod these results show the feasibility of mariculture wastewater treatment using the studied microalga with the advantage of producing biomass containing accumulated lipids and usable as food for mariculture species thus it may be possible to reduce the cost of wastewater treatment and of culturing marine species keywords phycoremediation tetraselmis mariculture wastewater microalgal biomass nutrient removal 1 introduction aquaculture and marine aquaculture systems are used to culture aquatic animals and plants such as fishes mollusks shellfishes and aquatic plants 1 this activity produces wastewater and a deficient planning and operation can adversely impact the integrity of the coastline environment 2 generally aquaculture systems are concentrated in small areas increasing the amount of locally discharged nutrients this contributes to eutrophication increasing the occurrence intensity and duration of hypoxic conditions in coastal waters around the world as the production of the aquaculture industry increases eutrophication increases too 3 uncontrolled growth of fish and shrimp farms means greater volumes of effluents being discharged to several sites many cultures are carried out in ponds generating effluents that are discharged not only during drainage and water makeup but also during rains leading to non specific pollution sources 4 as the aquaculture industry intensively develops its environmental impact increases water discharges from this industry negatively affect the environment as the demand of fish and shellfish production for food increases 5 the environmental impacts of marine aquaculture depend on various factors such as species culture method feed hydrography etc 6 however there is a high generation of particulates soluble organic wastes and soluble inorganic excretory waste that is discharged to the environment 7 producing substantial impact on the nutrient load in coastal areas incrementing biodeposition and altering the sediments quality 8 the non soluble fraction of wastes is accumulated as sediments near the discharge area so the major impact is in the sea bottom where there is an increasing oxygen demand causing anoxic conditions and toxic gases production thereby reducing the benthic diversity 6 all of these result in variations in the water column composition and alteration of the biogeochemical cycles waste discharge causes an increase in nutrient levels turbidity and organic matter and a decrease in ph oxygen concentration and conductivity the extensive use of chemicals affects coastal bacterial and plankton communities and increases the presence of opportunistic predators that affect the ecosystem ecology 8 there is a need for a wastewater treatment of the discharged water to prevent harmful effects to the ecosystem conventional systems cannot efficiently remove nitrogen and phosphorus present in wastewaters consequently more efficient and cost effective processes are required one of the main methods to deal with saline wastewater is the non treated or partially treated direct discharge to the ocean via outfalls 9 biological treatment systems like sequencing batch reactors activated sludge biodiscs and membrane bioreactors have high removal efficiencies but the efficiencies tend to decrease at higher salinities or nutrient loads 10 other methods used are reverse osmosis filtration and electrodialysis 11 but these are expensive another alternative is electrocoagulation capable of high efficiency removals of nitrogen and phosphorous 12 but it generates sludge that requires further processing microalgae can remove nitrogen and phosphorous at high efficiencies by promoting algal growth and regulating metabolic activities 13 processes using microalgae are known for being a promising option for wastewater treatment 14 however to reduce the overall treatment costs said processes must produce commercially valuable byproducts 15 phycoremediation is directly related to microalgae growth so factors that promote growth could increase remediation efficiency and enhance biomass productivity the resulting biomass has several applications such as biofuels biofertilizers and aquaculture nutrition 16 for this reason high rate algal ponds hraps are an excellent option as they combine the presence of microalgae capable of removing nitrogen and phosphorus from water and the provision of oxygen to heterotrophic bacteria decomposing organic matter 17 an additional advantage is the low costs of construction operation and maintenance of hraps currently microalgae that are used as food in aquaculture are cultured using artificial means requiring high volumes of fresh water so a recirculation system may be implemented where the wastewater production is used for the microalgae culture which subsequently can be used as food for the aquaculture species in parallel the generated wastewater can be treated by recycling the nutrients present in it for microalgae biomass obtention that would be used for byproducts production and the treated water could either be re used in said aquaculture operation or discharged to the ecosystem with no negative effects this would reduce the costs associated with purchasing food for the aquaculture operation as well as the reliance on resources such as water and nutrients for culturing the microalgae 18 microalgae also could be harvested to obtain other byproducts this process can account for 20 up to 30 of the cost of biomass processing 19 depending on the harvesting technology several factors such as cell age shape species density and size influence the harvesting process in general harvesting involves two steps thickening that can be achieved by flocculation flotation and or sedimentation and a second step of further dewatering that could be performed by centrifugation or filtration 20 marine algae of the genus tetraselmis are widely used in aquaculture as a source of food for certain fishes oysters and mollusks tetraselmis algae are 10 and 20 μm unicellular flagellated algae capable of being produced at large scale facilities due to their ability to withstand a wide salt concentration range 0 35 21 and temperature range 2 34 c their nutritional requirements are minimal since their growth does not depend on vitamins and they assimilate nitrogen from ammonium urea nitrates or amino acids 22 batch cultures require maintaining strain inocula and cleaning reactors between runs which increases the consumables demand and results in low productivity a semicontinuous or continuous culture has advantages over batch culture because the productivity achieved in batch culture can be maintained in optimized semicontinuous or continuous processes culture cycle duration can be adjusted to changing environment conditions and in this case biomass production and accumulation of relevant products occur within the same reactor 23 also a semicontinuous culture has a lower cost and the composition of the biomass can be more consistent 24 therefore this study has focused on cultivating tetraselmis sp in a hrap fed in a semicontinuous manner with water that simulate a marine aquaculture effluent the objective of the study is to determine the capability of tetraselmis sp to remove nutrients so these nutrients could be recycled and transformed to microalgal biomass that in turn can be transformed to value added byproducts such as food for marine aquaculture species or for biofuel production obtaining low cost reusable treated water and high biomass productivity and lipid accumulation in the microalga results in the ability to obtain byproducts that could reduce the costs of treating wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 physicochemical characterization of water the synthetic wastewater used in this study was prepared based on the characterization made of the actual wastewater effluents from growing commercial marine species such as octopus shrimp seabass corvina snapper and ornamental species collected at the facilities of the yucatan academic unit of unam located in sisal yucatan mexico 21 164468574129128 n 90 04835312636192 w phosphorous nitrites ammonia nitrogen and nitrates were measured by spectrophotometry 25 26 ph and dissolved oxygen were determined via electrodes 27 culture medium salinity was determined by using an instant ocean hydrometer and chemical oxygen demand cod was determined by the closed reflux colorimetric method described by 28 2 2 culture of the microalga tetraselmis sp was donated by the ceparium of the live feed laboratory of the multidisciplinary unit of teaching and research in sisal yucatan of the sciences faculty unam this microalga was cultivated in a hrap with the following dimensions 1 1 m length 0 8 m wide and 0 1 m deep having a culture capacity of 70 l fig 1 the reactor is a plug flow type reactor with recirculation 29 the hrap was kept under a greenhouse at a temperature within the range of 21 26 c the culture was kept under a 12 h 12 h light darkness photoperiod using an active photosynthetically photon flux density ppfd of 1500 μmol m 2 s 1 provided by 27 w grow led par 38 lamps grupo adapta the culture was kept under constant agitation by a paddle wheel in the hrap previous to inoculation of the hrap tetraselmis sp was cultured in 4 l erlenmeyer flasks at the same conditions described before the culture is maintained until the exponential phase and once the death phase is reached half of the culture volume 35 l is removed then additional wastewater 35 l is added simulating the mariculture effluent thereby obtaining a microalga semicontinuous culture this was repeated 3 times 2 3 wastewater simulating a mariculture effluent the characterization of the marine aquaculture wastewater is presented in table 1 artificial seawater was prepared using instant ocean sea salt with a salinity of 31 g kg 1 then 370 mg l 1 sodium acetate cas 17 09 3 15 6 mg l 1 k3po4 cas 7778 53 2 110 1 mg l 1 nh4 2so4 cas 7783 20 2 7 5 mg l 1 nano2 cas 7632 00 0 and 73 4 mg l 1 kno3 cas 7757 79 1 were added to the seawater in order to match the nutrient concentration of a previously characterized wastewater coming from culturing shrimp octopus european bass corvina snapper and ornamental species at the multidisciplinary unit of the unam in sisal yucatan mexico 2 4 microalga growth the microalga growth was determined by measuring the optical density of the culture at 680 nm the optical density to biomass dry weight ratio was previously determined 30 the specific growth rate and biomass and lipid productivity were calculated according to 31 the nutrient removal kinetics were calculated according to 32 by the following equation r s i s f t f t i where r is the removal rate of the nutrient si is the nutrient concentration at the beginning of the culture sf is the nutrient concentration at the end of the cycle tf is the time at the end of the cycle and ti the time at the start of the cycle 2 5 biomass lipid content the lipid content in the biomass was determined by colorimetric reaction using phosphoric acid and vanillin 33 2 6 harvesting of microalga isolation of microalgae from the culture medium was done by flocculation using chitosan cas 9012 76 4 at different concentrations and different ph values to determine the best doses so as to achieve the highest algae removal from the culture medium 34 a jar test was conducted varying ph and chitosan concentration in order to obtain the condition at which most biomass could be harvested chitosan was chosen as flocculant since it is cheap requires low dose for harvesting and it is biodegradable 35 and has been used in microalgae harvesting giving successful results 19 2 7 extraction of lipids from the microalga lipid extraction was carried out with methanol cas 67 56 1 acetone cas 67 64 1 and ethoxyethanol cas 110 80 5 at 60 c and using sonication according to the methodology as described in 36 2 8 carbohydrate content in the tetraselmis sp biomass the carbohydrate content was determined by hydrolysis with h2so4 cas 7664 93 9 and colorimetric reaction with phenol according to the methodology as described in 37 2 9 lipid content and fatty acids profile lipid transesterification was carried out using a basic catalyst sodium methoxide cas 124 41 4 and a methanol cas 67 56 1 to oil ratio of 5 1 at 60 c for 1 h 38 the fatty acids profile was carried out at the research and industry services unit usaii of the faculty of chemistry unam using a chromatograph coupled to a perkin elmer mass spectrometer helium was used as the carrier gas the temperature ramp used was as follows the oven was kept at 60 c for 3 min then the temperature was increased at a rate of 10 c min 1 up to 300 c and maintained for 5 min 39 a mixture of 37 fatty acid methyl esters from supelco was used as standard 2 10 statistical analysis all experiments were done by triplicate n 3 an analysis of variance was made to determine if there was inter experimental significant difference and said differences were determined by a tukey s test the confidence interval was of 5 α 0 05 all statistical analyses were carried out by the r software 3 results and analysis 3 1 tetraselmis sp culture at the beginning of the culture there is a ph increase fig 2 which corresponds to the microalga growth fig 3 this increase in ph could be the reason of the slow adaptation phase of the microalga since a rise in ph decreases the inorganic carbon availability in culture medium thus limiting the microalga growth 40 then there is a decrease in ph close to day 20 fig 2 which corresponds to the stage where no biomass increase was observed fig 3 the lack of a biomass increase may be an indicator of a decrease in photosynthetic activity and the reason for a new decrease in ph once the lowest ph value is reached it starts increasing fig 2 again due to the microalga growth until day 60 fig 3 the decrease in ph after day 60 is due to the extraction of half the volume of the culture medium and the addition of new culture medium with lower ph the ph peaks and valleys after day 60 and then after day 80 correspond to the microalga growth and the extraction and addition of culture medium due to the semi continuous culture it is seen that the biomass peaks fig 3 match with the ph peaks fig 2 where values close to 9 and above are reached this is due to a greater photosynthetic activity of the microalgae there were no pronounced stationary phases in the culture fig 3 in this case when the microalga reaches the highest biomass production it appears that the death phase starts almost instantly this results in a lipid peak that then starts declining fig 3 the reason behind this is that in the fed batch process the addition of new culture medium once the nutrients reached a low concentration stopped the progression of the stationary phase there is a microalga acclimation stage between culture days 0 28 from day 0 7 the microalga grows exponentially then stops growing and the biomass concentration stays substantially unchanged until day 28 when the microalga starts growing again exponentially the acclimation state was long because the microalga was grown in 4 l erlenmeyer flasks before being inoculated into the hrap and took time to adapt to the volume change and the paddle wheel shearing force the first batch growing cycle is from day 28 62 the second batch cycle from day 63 78 the third cycle from day 79 92 and the fourth cycle from day 93 105 the decrease of nitrogen orthophosphates and cod are shown in fig 4 concentration peaks on the graphs are due to the addition of culture medium once the microalga reached the stationary phase which is also the timepoint where half the volume of the culture is extracted during the acclimation phase of around 28 days a slower decrease of nitrogen orthophosphates and organic matter is observed from day 30 the decrease in these concentrations is accelerated fig 4 due to the microalga growth fig 3 the concentration of organic matter total nitrogen and orthophosphates reached a minimum before the addition of culture medium showing a plateau these plateaus are shorter in each subsequent culturing cycle shorter nutrient plateaus are indicative of shorter variation intervals which means a greater control of the culture the kinetics of cod removal has a tendency to increase in each culturing cycle which could be the reason for the shorter plateaus if the kinetics of the removal tends to increase then the plateaus could reach a minimum leading to a continuous culturing nevertheless the kinetics of nitrogen removal increased only from the first culture cycle and then remained constant for orthophosphates there is also an increase from cycle 1 to cycle 2 but then there is a decrease in the kinetics of the removal at cycle 3 which stays constant at cycle 4 table 2 from day 63 79 another batch growth cycle took place as shown in fig 3 after 77 days of culturing a maximum lipid concentration is observed 60 7 mg l 1 on day 79 the lipid content decreased and this same day there was a new replacement of culturing medium lipids are used as an indicator of culture medium replacement lipids could be used for biofuel production and are a key component in biomass for aquaculture feed so the lipid content in the biomass is of great importance the next batch growth cycle took place from day 80 92 when the highest lipid content was observed on day 91 of culturing 75 2 mg l 1 the last batch growth cycle was from day 93 105 when the highest lipid content was obtained on day 105 77 6 mg l 1 it can be seen that when the nutrient concentration in the culture medium is low fig 4 the lipid content starts increasing fig 3 this is due to the stress conditions the microalga is subjected to thus causing it to build up lipid as backup energy 41 table 2 shows the biomass and lipid productivity the specific growth rates and the removal percentages and kinetics of nutrient removal for total nitrogen orthophosphates and cod the first batch growth cycle presents the lowest values of specific growth rates biomass and lipid productivity and nutrient removal kinetics though removal percentages are similar to other cycles table 2 this was due to the time the microalga took to grow since the first batch growth cycle lasted more than 30 days and in the next cycles the growth only took more than 10 days almost a third of the first cycle nitrogen and orthophosphate removals were about 95 with average removal kinetics of 3 11 mg l 1 day 1 and 0 81 mg l 1 day 1 respectively cod removal percentage was 61 4 on average with average removal kinetics of 6 67 mg l 1 day 1 this indicates that the microalga utilized most of the nitrogen and phosphorus present in the wastewater for growing but did not use all the carbon present therein this may be due to a low c n p ratio 15 9 5 1 in the culture medium or due to a lack of ph control in the culture medium causing that part of the phosphates and the ammonium were removed by precipitation and gasification respectively nutrient concentrations at the beginning of each batch culturing cycle were quite similar despite the nutrient removal percentages being quite similar in all the batch culturing cycles although the microalga consumed almost the same amount of nutrients there is a difference in biomass productivity which gets bigger as the microalga batch growth cycles progress this could be due to the utilization of nutrients for storage purposes during the first batch cycles and thereafter only for reproduction in batch culturing cycle 4 the productivity reaches 64 1 mg l 1 day 1 which may be due to the fact that the microalga has already adapted to the culture so later on a continuous culturing could occur once the productivity stabilizes however the lipid productivity increases but only up to cycle 3 and then it declines from cycle 3 4 but it is still higher than that of cycle 2 table 2 this could be due to culturing factors such as the ph reaches its maximum values at the beginning of this batch culture cycle and decreases as the cycle progressed an increase in ph could reduce lipid content 42 and also could affect microalga growth since the reduced lipid productivity at cycle 4 is due to a lower specific growth rate than in cycle 3 the kinetics of nitrogen removal increases as the batch growth cycles progress however this is not the case for orthophosphates since the kinetics increases from the first to the second cycle and then decreases table 2 due to the plateaus as seen in fig 4 the kinetics of cod increases from cycle 1 2 but in cycle 3 there is a slight decline and then in cycle 4 it increases again table 2 the water quality produced by the treatment significantly improves as the nitrogen and phosphorus contents decrease over 90 and the organic matter decreases over 60 measured as cod allowing the reuse of said water in the culture system or making the discharged less environmentally harmful than the discharge of untreated effluents 3 2 biomass harvesting from culture medium once 35 l of culture were removed a coagulation flocculation process with chitosan was carried out to separate the biomass from the culture medium the chitosan dose at which most of the biomass was removed is 80 mg l 1 at ph 11 by the coagulation flocculation process with chitosan about 70 biomass can be removed from the culture medium in a cost effective way thanks to the low energy expenditure since chitosan interacts with the charges at the microalga cell wall to produce flocculation an increase in the chitosan dose or a ph variation does not necessarily mean an increase in biomass removal particularly for saline waters where there is interference with the number of ions present in the medium this is the reason for a low biomass harvesting efficiency 3 3 determination of lipids in tetraselmis sp biomass in the acclimation phase between days 0 and 28 during the first days of culturing the lipid content increases as biomass increases lipid content drops when biomass stops increasing and it keeps a constant concentration until the biomass starts increasing again during the batch culturing cycles there is a similar behavior in general at the beginning of the batch culturing cycles the lipid content is high due to the previous stationary phase and the next day it declines to about 40 mg g 1 of biomass then it will increase up to a value slightly higher than 60 mg g 1 of biomass at this timepoint the medium with biomass is extracted and new culture medium is added again fig 3 in the first cycle of the microalga growth the lipid content was 49 28 mg g 1 of dry biomass and in the second third and fourth batch culturing cycles this lipid content increased to 58 23 mg g 1 63 97 mg g 1 and 65 32 mg g 1 respectively in this study an average lipid productivity of 5 57 mg l 1 day 1 was obtained from the second to fourth batch growth cycles this lipid productivity is lower than the one obtained by 43 for t suecica 24 mg l 1 day 1 after about 9 months of culture and up to 49 mg l 1 day 1 after an additional month with a culture medium replacement every 3 4 days in a closed photobioreactor this is an indicative sign that keeping the culture for a long time while reducing the time intervals for replacing the culture media thereby practically reaching a continuous culture will lead to an increased lipid productivity in the microalga by means of increasing the lipid content and the specific growth rate of the microalga at each peak in fig 3 a lipid extraction was carried out obtaining 5 29 g 7 13 g 8 64 g and 9 56 g from the first second third and fourth batch growth cycles respectively the increase in lipid content at each batch growth cycle is indicative of an induction of lipid synthesis by the microalga and therefore a continuous culture could eventually be carried out 3 4 fatty acids profile the fatty acid methyl esters concentrations found in the different culture cycles are shown in table 3 although cultures show that microalgal lipids have a tendency to increase table 2 this is not reflected in the number of fatty acids as shown the concentration of saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids tend to decrease in every batch culturing cycle microalgae contain different groups of lipids in addition to triacylglycerols they contain sterols and polar lipids 42 so the lipid content increases but the decrease in fatty acid concentration may be due to the accumulation of a type of lipids different from fatty acids the concentration of unsaturated fatty acids remains constant during the first 3 batch culturing cycles showing a decrease in the fourth batch culturing cycle this decline is due to the absence of γ linolenic acid generally there is a tendency for most fatty acids to decrease in concentration in the batch culturing cycles except for the linoleic acid which concentration tends to increase up to batch culturing cycle 3 and at cycle 4 the concentration of all the fatty acids decrease algal oils are an energy source for aquatic animals featured as monounsaturated fatty acids and a source of essential fatty acids featured as polyunsaturated fatty acids 18 in our case monounsaturated fatty acid percentages were 38 2 for batch culturing cycles 2 and 4 which is similar to the 38 7 reported by 18 with lower percentages for cycles 1 and 3 34 8 and 36 7 respectively highly unsaturated fatty acids contain carbon chains of 20 or more carbon atoms with 3 or more unsaturated bonds they work as an energy supply for animals form cell membrane components and bioactive substances regulate lipid metabolism and promote the immune function 18 in the first batch culturing cycle 11 4 of these kind of fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid epa and arachidonic acid were obtained slightly lower than 13 5 as reported by 18 however this percentage was considerably lower in the subsequent batch growth cycles with values of 2 1 in cycle 2 and slightly higher than 1 in cycles 3 and 4 the percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids with 1 2 or 3 unsaturated bonds was 31 in batch growth cycle 1 and higher than 40 in subsequent cycles in the first batch culturing cycle there is a proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids higher than polyunsaturated fatty acids however in subsequent batch culturing cycles said proportion changed to higher amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids than monounsaturated fatty acids in the first batch culturing cycle there is a ω6 ω3 fatty acid ratio of about 0 5 table 3 meaning that there is a higher proportion of ω3 fatty acids however in the following batch culturing cycles said proportion increases to values even higher than 1 5 table 3 which represent an increase in ω6 fatty acids and a reduction in ω3 fatty acids 3 5 determination of carbohydrates in the tetraselmis sp biomass after extracting the lipids from the tetraselmis sp biomass the determination of carbohydrates in the residual biomass was carried out resulting in 13 3 0 4 carbohydrates in the dry microalga biomass the carbohydrate content obtained is higher compared to the study by 44 where the carbohydrate content was 6 5 after 14 days of culturing t suecica in municipal wastewater however in the study by 45 who cultured tetraselmis sp in urban wastewater a carbohydrate content of 57 2 after 20 days of continuous culture was obtained far higher than the carbohydrate content in the present study said lower carbohydrate content may be due to the fact that the microalga of the present study was maintained with low concentration of nutrients up to the stationary phase resulting in that the carbohydrates at the beginning of the stationary phase are being gradually transformed into lipids reducing the cell carbohydrate content based on the carbohydrate content a theoretical calculation of the potential bioethanol amount obtained from the microalga biomass was performed using the equation suggested in 46 ethanol yield from the tetraselmis sp biomass is 8 8 ml l 1 this yield is higher than the one obtained by 44 where the yield of ethanol from t suecica was 1 7 ml l 1 however this is much lower than the one obtained in the study by 45 43 9 ml l 1 4 conclusions the results obtained in this study suggest that tetraselmis sp has the potential for treating wastewater from mariculture effluents given that higher removals of total nitrogen phosphates and chemical oxygen demand were obtained biomass is produced throughout the culturing process with increasing amounts of biomass in every batch growth cycle therefore it has the potential to be used for producing added value products whereby the wastewater treatment costs can be reduced for example it may be used as food source for aquaculture species in marine aquaculture due to the presence of high contents of omega 3 fatty acids such as linolenic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid during the first batch culturing cycle fatty acids could be used in biodiesel production after extracting the lipids the biomass could be used to obtain bioethanol or biomethane reducing even more the wastewater treatment costs declaration of competing interest authors manuel sacristán de alva and víctor manuel luna pabello have no conflict of

13574,pulsed uv puv technology is accepted commercially for disinfection within the food packaging industry but has yet to be deployed by the water wastewater sector this is partly due to a lack of robust independently validated data for submerged or flow through treatment applications this study evaluated the efficacy of puv for water disinfection under flow through conditions bacterial pathogens of interest in the food and water wastewater sector namely escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and listeria innocua surrogate for l monocytogenes were used to investigate the potential for photoreactivation and or dark repair post puv flow through disinfection a continuous flow low pressure uv was also analysed under similar experimental conditions bacterial inactivation via flow through puv was dependant on energy output with e coli exhibiting greatest sensitivity to puv treatment 5 3 log 10 inactivation after treatment at 1539 mj cm 2 output in uv range 300 nm l innocua exhibited the highest puv resistance 3 0 log 10 inactivation after treatment at 1539 mj cm 2 output in uv range 300 nm under similar treatment conditions greater photoreactivation occurred at lower puv outputs for both s aureus and e coli after flow through puv treatment thus exposure of treated bacteria to natural light immediately post flow through puv treatment should be avoided to minimise photoreactivation the lpuv demonstrated inactivation of all bacteria below the limit of detection 1 cfu ml and inhibited the occurrence of photoreactivation this study highlights the importance of considering bacterial repair potential and the need for further development of puv technology for such applications keywords ultraviolet applications bacterial disinfection wastewater treatment cell injury pulsed uv disease mitigation 1 introduction ultraviolet uv disinfection is a well established technology across a variety of different sectors including aquaculture ballast water treatment municipal wastewater treatment drinking water treatment agriculture dairy and the beverage industry 1 3 uv disinfection is typically seen as being user friendly free from toxic hazardous chemicals effective against chlorine resistant microorganisms and exhibiting shorter contact times in comparison to chlorine treatment 4 5 low pressure uv lpuv and medium pressure uv mpuv are currently the de facto uv disinfection systems used for water wastewater disinfection applications typically uv light is generated within the lamps when a voltage is applied across a mercury gas mixture which results in the discharge of photons the type of uv light produced is dependent upon the mercury vapour pressure lpuv lamps produce monochromatic light at 253 7 nm under low vapour pressure while mpuv lamps produce a polychromatic light due to higher vapour pressures 6 pulsed uv puv disinfection is a relatively new uv technology which differs to mercury vapour based lpuv mpuv light by utilising xenon gas to generate a high energy electron pulse which typically lasts microseconds puv systems generally comprise three parts the power supply the pulse configuration system and the flash lamp 7 an alternating current is stored in a capacitor where energy is discharged to create an intense pulse of light which spans across the polychromatic broadspectrum of uv visible and infrared light 200 1000 nm 8 the high peak power stored in the capacitor is a trademark of this system which has been shown in some cases to offer shorter treatment times 9 10 in addition the power emitted from pulsed uv lamps is generally at least an order of magnitude higher than the power emitted from lpuv lamps this is reflected in the respective energy outputs of both systems for microbial inactivation 11 12 the application of puv light as a microbial disinfection method within the food industry has been approved by the united states food drugs authority fda under code 21cfr179 41 7 13 puv disinfection is considered a favourable alternative to conventional thermal chemical disinfection processes owing to shorter treatment times however currently it is predominantly applied as a disinfection method for food packaging and to a lesser extent as a decontamination method for food products themselves 14 the vast majority of the published literature pertaining to puv studies describe experimentation analysis performed under static conditions i e samples are fixed below the lamp of those studies which have evaluated the disinfection potential of the system using a continuous flow through experimental set up authors reported log inactivation in terms of flow rates and number of passes through the system no uv doses were reported krishnamurthy et al 15 investigated the puv inactivation efficiency of staphylococcus aureus via flow through milk treatment results from this study reported bacterial inactivation rates of between 0 55 and 7 26 log10 cfu ml which were dependent on the distance of the lamp from the sample the flow rate and the number of passes i e the amount of times the medium was recycled through the system complete inactivation of s aureus 7 23log10 was achieved at a lamp distance of 8 cm and a flow rate of 20 ml min for a one pass treatment no uv doses were reported uslu et al 16 evaluated the potential of flow through puv for the disinfection of escherichia coli e coli and bacillus subtilis b subtilis in wastewater in this case complete inactivation of e coli 7 23 log10 and b subtilis 7 13 log10 was achieved at a flow rate of 2 l min for a one pass treatment in a synthetic wastewater mix the variation in the sample media used creates difficulty in comparing both studies as uv absorption rates may vary depending on the medium 17 further detail on uv dose would also be necessary for comparison this is an issue which limits wider comparisons within the literature in general in addition comparisons were not drawn between puv flow through treatment and lpuv disinfection while uv treatment is an effective disinfection method which produces no disinfection by products typically associated with chemical disinfection a primary drawback includes that of microbial dna damage repair post uv disinfection uv induced molecular lesions may be repaired or replaced by the microorganism either by i using enzymes that require light to repair dna i e photoreactivation phr or ii employing enzymes that replace damaged dna with undamaged nucleotides excision or dark repair 18 20 in the water wastewater disinfection sector phr is of primary concern when incorporating uv systems into disinfection processes as microbial re growth following exposure to sunlight can influence system effectiveness 21 literature investigating the photoreactivation potential of various pathogens in wastewater effluent post lpuv treatment has established the relationship between increasing uv dose and decreasing microbial photoreactivation rates 22 25 however in the case of bacterial phr dark repair post pulsed uv disinfection study findings are mixed lee et al 26 reported no phr or dark repair activity of e coli in distilled water mixed with humic acids after puv treatment at 9 mj cm2 dose measured as the portion of uv energy within 200 400 nm range of the broadspectrum lamp while maclean et al 27 confirmed photoreactivation of s aureus after a puv exposure 320 500 nm wavelength range of 1500 mj cm2 and also surmised a lower uv output dose during treatment would most likely result in increased bacterial photoreactivation rates kramer et al 28 investigated the phr potential of e coli and l innocua after pulsed light exposure on a polysaccharide surface and reported photoreactivation for both test bacteria with relative recovery being puv energy dependant in all cases pulsed uv disinfection analysis took place under static or batch experimental set up with fixed sample treatment indeed the vast majority of phr dark repair studies in water typically involve prior uv disinfection carried out via batch analysis 21 24 29 32 limited uv disinfection studies have evaluated the potential of bacterial reactivation after flow through uv disinfection for liquid treatments and to the best knowledge of the authors all were performed with conventional uv systems in this study the efficiency of uv inactivation for e coli s aureus and l innocua pathogens relevant in the food and water wastewater sectors was studied using lpuv and puv systems in single pass flow through configuration this also constitutes the first study to comprehensively compare bacterial photoreactivation and or dark repair immediately following flow through pulsed uv treatment this study would be of general interest to the water wastewater sector with a particular focus on the implementation of strategies of wastewater reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 lpuv and puv systems the puv system comprised a bench scale pulsed power source puv 01 samtech ltd glasgow which was used to power a low pressure 60 kpa xenon filled flashlamp heraeus noblelight xap type nl4006 series constructed from a clear uv transparent quartz tube and produced a high intensity beam of polychromatic pulsed light 200 1100 nm the lamp was placed 10 75 cm above a sterilised aluminium flow through vessel with a plan surface area of 290 cm2 sample depth of 5 5 cm and hold up volume of 750 ml through which water was pumped with a peristaltic pump at specified flow rates fig 1 a the system was enclosed and a smooth aluminium cover was used on the inside of the lamp cover to reflect uv light onto the sample the puv system allowed for the input voltage and the pulse rate to be varied between 400 and 1000 v and for a pulse frequency of between 0 1 and 10 pulses per second pps the energy output of the lamp total energy and energy in specific wavelength ranges was calculated by analysing lamp characteristics as supplied and verified by testing by the manufacturer the area of the vessel the pulse frequency and the hydraulic residence time hrt table 1 see supplementary information for system details figure s1 and table s1 the range of energy outputs chosen for this study were selected based on previous puv system analysis outlined in fitzhenry et al 33 and fitzhenry 34 these outputs would approximate low medium and high energy output capabilities from this lamp based on the characteristic curves for the puv lamp the expected energy outputs could be calculated to include only the wavelengths below 300 nm i e comprises uv c and some of the uv b spectrum this was done so provide context for in situ measurements taken at 280 nm described in section 2 3 the continuous flow monochromatic lpuv system deployed in this study lcd 412 plus s i t a halpin hayward ltd had a fixed power output of 40 w at a uv c wavelength of 254 nm an internal empty volume of 2 5 l and chamber dimensions of 95 cm length x6 cm diameter fig 1 b the lamp dimensions were 84 3 cm in length x1 6 cm diameter the lamp irradiation was 30 mj cm2 at 1 s residence time the uv energy output could be altered by varying the influent flow rate thereby altering the hrt and thus the exposure time the flow rate used in the experiments was the maximum allowable 24 6 l min which corresponded to a hrt of 0 47 s this equates to samples being exposed a uv output of 14 mj cm2 0 47 s x 30 mj cm2 this was the lowest exposure energy output achievable and resulted in almost full inactivation for all pathogens table 1 2 2 experimental setup table 1 summarises the experiments carried out with the lpuv and puv systems in this study in the case of the lpuv system only one energy output was analysed 14 mj cm2 for the flow through puv system four different uv outputs were evaluated ranging from 486 mj cm2 to 2052 mj cm2 2 3 uv dose determination of puv system the uv dose refers to the uv energy received by the sample i e the uv exposure of the sample the uv output is energy emitted from the lamp in the uv spectrum previous studies have shown the distance of the lamp from the sample to have an impact upon puv fluence distribution and measurements 35 therefore it was decided to measure the uv dose at the distances used in this study to allow for comparison to the calculated uv output the uv and uv c dose received by the sample from the puv system was analysed using a thermopile power detector model xlp12 3s h2 in gentec eo quebec canada and integra software in addition to two longpass colour glass filters fgl 400 which filters out wavelengths above 400 nm to give the uv range 200 400 nm and fgl 280 which filters out wavelengths above 280 nm to give the uv c range 200 280 nm thorlabs gmbh dachau germany the percentage transmission of both filters was as follows for the 400 nm filter transmission at wavelengths greater than 400 nm was 89 4 and for the 280 nm filter transmission for wavelengths greater than 280 nm was 91 6 thorlabs gmbh dachau germany the detector 12 mm aperture was situated at the bottom of a metal cylinder 5 cm in depth through which the light was directed downwards towards the cylindrical detector surface the detector was placed on the aluminium vessel with the sensor being 10 75 cm below the xenon lamp pulse energies were measured three times at each voltage and each voltage setting was analysed on three separate occasions to determine consistency deviation of detector readings to give nine broadspectrum energy readings in total after which an average value was obtained power was measured in irradiance units mw cm2 the filters were then placed separately directly on top of the detector at the base of the metal tube and the power measurements were taken as previously described the differences in the power values obtained with and without the filters were used to calculate the power emitted from the lamp within the uv and the uv c range the calculated uv output and equivalent measured uv and uv c dose are listed in table 2 at a distance of 10 75 cm there is a significant difference between the output of the lamp and the dose measured as approximated by the inverse square law other factors contributing to the relatively low uv and uv c dose relative to the lamp output is the broadspectrum nature of the output and heat generated within the puv system this has been previously noted in fitzhenry et al 2019 33 it should be noted that the filters were removed for the disinfection studies and were only used to determine uv dose 2 4 bacterial analysis via uv treatment the bacterial strains used to investigate inactivation photoreactivation and dark repair post lpuv and puv disinfection were escherichia coli atcc 25922 staphylococcus aureus dsm 1104 and listeria innocua dsm 20649 these were chosen as they had been recently identified as pathogens of interest in wastewater streams from dairy processing facilities in ireland 42 the strain dsm 20649 was used as a non pathogenic surrogate for listeria monocytogenes 36 all three freeze dried cultures were reconstituted using tryptic soy agar tsa sigma aldrich wicklow ireland and tryptic soy broth tsb fisher scientific dublin ireland at 37 c for 18 24 hours fresh cultures were then inoculated aseptically on to cryobeads pro lab microbank cruinn diagnostics dublin ireland for long term storage at 80 c the fresh cultures were also cultured on tsa slopes as working culture stocks and stored at 4 c in the fridge working stock cultures were discarded every three months and replaced with fresh working cultures to avoid contamination issues prior to the photoreactivation experimentation the bacteria were exposed to both puv and lpuv disinfection as a prerequisite to phr dark repair analysis for experimental analysis one colony of each strain was inoculated into 80 ml of luria broth lb sigma aldrich wicklow ireland for e coli culture and tsb fisher scientific dublin ireland for l innocua and s aureus the broth s were cultured on a rotary shaker at 90 rpm for 24 h at 37 c for lpuv runs batches of tap water 20 l were spiked with 10 ml of broth strains to give a starting bacterial concentration of 6 log10 0 5 while for puv runs 2 5 l of distillate water was spiked with 1 ml of broth strains to give a starting bacterial concentration of 6 log10 0 5 the distillation system in the laboratory produced a limited volume of water daily and could not meet the volumes required for lpuv analysis thus tap water was used instead experimental analysis was carried out to ensure there were no differences in inactivation rates of bacteria e coli was used as the test strain via lpuv between both mediums data not shown influent and effluent samples were analysed in duplicate pre and post uv treatment via pour plate technique 1 ml as per standard methods 43 using tryptone bile x glucuronide tbx agar vwr dublin ireland for e coli and tsa sigma aldrich wicklow ireland for s aureus and l innocua each uv inactivation experiment was performed at least three times the limit of detection was 1 cfu ml see section 2 6 for log inactivation calculations 2 5 photoreactivation and dark repair analysis immediately following uv treatment effluent samples were placed under light and dark conditions to study potential bacterial phr dark repair for photoreactivation experiments duplicate sample aliquots 40 ml were placed into open petri dishes diameter of 90 mm surface area of 58 cm2 at a distance of 9 cm from two compact fluorescent lamps 23 w power luminous flux lm 1450 which emitted light in the 300 700 nm spectral range osram model dpro mitw 23 w 840 e27 previous studies have reported the photolyase enzyme for bacterial phr to respond significantly to blue light in the 360 500 nm range 27 for dark repair experiments duplicate sample aliquots 20 ml were aseptically transferred to 60 ml tubes covered with aluminium foil and placed into a sealed box in the dark for the same duration of time as the photoreactivation experiments both the light and dark experimental analysis was carried out in the same incubator velp scientifica at 20 1 c sample volumes of 1 ml were collected aseptically from both the light and dark sample experiments at a series of time intervals ranging from 0 to 120 min post uv treatment the samples were analysed in duplicate via pour plate technique 1 ml as per standard methods 43 using tbx agar vwr dublin ireland for e coli and tsa sigma aldrich wicklow ireland for s aureus 2 6 quantitative analysis bacterial inactivation via uv treatment using

bacterial photoreactivation and dark repair expressed as a percentage was determined with eq 2 adapted from methods used in maclean et al 27 and shafaei et al 25 where nt is the concentration at time

continuous flow lpuv and flow through puv disinfection results for the lpuv system showed almost complete inactivation of all three bacterial strains at the uvc output of 14 mj cm2 fig 2 log10 inactivations of 5 3 0 3 6 0 0 2 and 5 9 0 1 were observed from starting bacterial populations of 6 0 log10 0 5 for s aureus e coli and l innocua respectively at 14 mj cm2 therefore given the lpuv system was operating at the shortest hrt and thus the lowest uv output achievable no other hrts were subsequently investigated the inactivation of vegetative bacteria in water via lpuv is well established previous studies have shown e coli and s aureus to be inactivated by 5 6 log10 in water via batch lpuv disinfection at uv doses of 10 mj cm2 4 37 thus results in this study are in line with findings in the literature which illustrate vegetative cells are readily inactivated by lpuv disinfection at relatively low uv energies research investigating bacterial inactivation in water wastewater via flow through puv systems is limited in this study bacterial inactivation via flow through puv disinfection was linearly dependent on energy with e coli being the most sensitive and l innocua exhibiting the most puv resistance fig 3 the maximum inactivation observed for e coli 5 3 0 3 log10 was achieved at a lamp uv output 300 nm of 1539 mj cm2 while a higher uv output 300 nm of 2052 mj cm2 inactivated the gram positive bacteria s aureus and l innocua by 5 2 0 6 log10 and 4 3 0 3 log10 respectively this finding is consistent with farrell 38 who reported gram positive bacteria s aureus and l monocytogenes to be more resistant to puv light in comparison to gram negative bacteria e coli in a static experimental set up uslu et al 17 analysed the inactivation of e coli via flow through puv disinfection in synthetic wastewater with the addition of multiple pass analysis whereby the sample was recirculated back under the puv lamp for a second disinfection step in the aforementioned study the uv dose system output was not described rather the flow rate and broadspectrum energy output j per litre treated was given results showed complete inactivation of e coli in synthetic wastewater at flow rates of 10 l min equivalent to a broadband energy of 39 7 j l for a two pass treatment a similar study 39 investigated the inactivation of l innocua via flow through puv for water treatment a puv dose of 4 000 mj cm2 at a flow rate of 1 l min was required for 2 log10 l innocua inactivation in water krishnamurthy et al 16 tested the inactivation of s aureus in milk under flow through puv experimental conditions and also adopted a multi pass disinfection method akin to uslu et al 17 log10 reductions were reported as a function of flow rate lamp distance and number of sample passes complete inactivation of s aureus was obtained at 8 cm sample distance single pass and 20 ml min flow rate however no uv dose energy output was reported interestingly it was also noted that a decrease in puv energy was a polynomial function of the lamp distance i e inactivation rates were higher at 8 cm lamp distance than those achieved at 5 cm lamp distance 16 finally fitzhenry et al 33 recently reported a uv output 300 nm of approximately 2 000 mj cm2 was required to inactivate bacillus spp endospores by approx 2 log10 in water via flow through puv disinfection these studies show that with flow through pulsed uv technology as investigated to date the use of multi pass is necessary for the inactivation of s aureus and e coli in the case of l innocua a single pass may be possible however to date clear information on the necessary uv dose has not been available this study presents inactivation rates for various uv outputs for the puv technology this data is key as the overall capacity of the lamp in terms of uv energy output will be a key determining factor alongside the desired pathogen removal rates as to whether single pass or multi pass should be deployed 3 2 bacterial photoreactivation dark repair post uv treatment experimental results for the potential photoreactivation of the three pathogens following lpuv disinfection at 14 mj cm2 indicated that bacterial concentrations after light and dark repair analysis were negligible see supporting information figure s2 previous research 24 has reported phr for e coli post lpuv treatment whereby water samples exposed to uv dose of 5 mj cm2 were subsequently placed under sunlight lamps for 4 h before photoreactivation was observed while photoreactivation of e coli was reported after lpuv treatment at 5 mj cm2 the same study 24 reported a lack of photoreactivation when the bacteria were exposed to a higher uv dose of 15 mj cm2 sanz et al 23 reported a similar conclusion when investigating the photorepair potential of total coliforms post lpuv treatment in a wastewater treatment facility their results showed a significant decrease of photoreactivation potential at high uv doses indicating the severity of the uv damage at high doses can prohibit dna lesion repair therefore perhaps in the case of the experimental analysis carried out in this study the applied lpuv output of 14 mj cm2 may have inhibited the ability of the bacteria to photoreactivate dark repair unfortunately limitations regarding decreasing the system energy output of the lpuv system did not allow for analysis of bacterial phr dark repair post lower lpuv outputs nonetheless considering the high inactivation efficiencies found for the three experimental bacterial strains and the lack of photoreactivation dark repair at the minimum uv output possible 14 mj cm2 and at a relatively high flow rate 24 6 l min equating to 0 47 s hrt the results further highlight the suitability of the lpuv system as an effective technology to inactivate s aureus e coli and l innocua the particular strain of l innocua dsm 20649 selected for this study appeared to be impacted by the photoreactivation experimental conditions previous studies have discussed various light sources used in phr experiments including the spectrum output the power the temperature which influences sunlight simulation and the colour of the light it was noted that the photolyase enzyme for bacterial photoreactivation responds significantly to blue light in the 360 500 nm range and that l monocytogenes and s aureus exhibit maximum photoreactivation potential between 360 380 nm 27 therefore these factors were taken into consideration when deciding the optimum conditions for photoreactivation experiments fig 4 a shows the results of the photoreactivation and dark repair experiments for l innocua post flow through puv treatments at puv outputs 300 nm of 486 1026 and 2052 mj cm2 while minimal dark repair was observed for l innocua populations of l innocua survivors post puv irradiation were observed to decrease in numbers during the period of photoreactivation conditions upon further investigation it was confirmed that l innocua was inactivated by the compound fluorescent lamp with no prior uv exposure fig 4b thus it was decided to eliminate it from the photoreactivation analysis for confirmation purposes similar analysis was carried out on e coli and s aureus whereby the strains were exposed to the compound light only without prior exposure to puv the results confirmed that the photoreactivation experimental conditions were not impacting upon cell viability as was the case with l innocua fig 4 b a previous study reported photoreactivation of the same strain of l innocua as was used in this study 28 kramer et al 28 investigated the photoreactivation of puv treated l innocua dsm 20649 and used a 30 w fluorescent lamp with a spectrum output of between 400 and 650 nm for phr analysis these results showed photoreactivation rates of between 102 and 106 cfu ml after 24 h of lamp exposure on tryptic soy agar at 37 c depending on the puv fluence applied the reasons for l innocua becoming inactivated under the compound lamp in this study are not entirely clear perhaps the slightly lower spectrum output of the lamp and the difference in experimental conditions illumination on agar and not water as was the case in this study in the kramer et al 28 study were more conducive to l innocua photoreactivation analysis i e agar medium designed to enable bacterial growth as opposed to water medium however in this study it was considered important to use a lamp with a spectrum below 400 nm due to reasons stated above i e photolyase activity and favoured photoreactivation potential at the wavelengths between 360 380 nm moreover s aureus and e coli were not negatively affected by the lamp photoreactivation conditions while photoreactivation analysis of l innocua could not be completed in this study details surrounding the specifics of experimental design and the particular bulbs used for puv treatments may be noteworthy for future studies photoreactivation was observed for both e coli and s aureus post flow through puv treatment at various energy outputs over time fig 5 a and 5 b results for s aureus at the lowest output of 486 mj cm2 showed a sharp increase in phr between 10 and 60 min after which inactivation were relatively stable however this was not constant and the phr increased slightly again after this time point increases in the percentage photoreactivation of s aureus were less pronounced at higher uv system outputs with negligible phr occurring at any time point after puv treatment at 2052 mj cm2 fig 5 a analysis of e coli photoreactivation over time shows a slightly different trend to that of s aureus post puv treatment fig 5 b at 486 mj cm2 the phr of e coli steadily increased between 15 and 90 min before a tailing effect was observed at 1026 mj cm2 the percentage of photoreactivation e coli was relatively low while at 1539 mj cm2 it was found to be negligible therefore it was decided to not investigate photoreactivation of e coli at higher uv system outputs previous studies 21 have suggested that a time based comparison for photoreactivation experiments cannot be performed due to variations in lamp intensities i e the energy outputs of lamps can vary even where they are the same model however in the present research study a time based comparison between s aureus and e coli was possible as the same experimental set up and lamp was used for both bacteria and should be noted for future studies of this kind photoreactivation has been observed previously 28 for e coli post static puv treatment on gel mediums with a recovery rate of up to 2 log10 following a puv dose of 450 1000 mj cm2 maclean et al 27 investigated the phr potential of s aureus and l monocytogenes post puv treatment under static experimental conditions and observed a photoreactivation response after puv treatments of 1500 mj cm2 and 3400 mj cm2 within 320 500 nm range respectively the study found approximately 2 of s aureus bacteria photoreactivated after a puv exposure of 1500 mj cm2 phr exposure time not given similarly results in the present study found 1 7 of the s aureus population photoreactivated after 1500 mj cm2 puv energy exposure at 90 min however in this case a flow through experimental set up was applied while maclean et al 27 did report a low degree of phr for s aureus at the puv output energy applied it was surmised that a less intense uv energy output would likely result in a higher degree of photoreactivation which was the finding in this study the majority of photoreactivation occurred within the first hour for s aureus and the first 90 min for e coli thus avoiding bacterial exposure to light immediately after flow through puv disinfection may be important when attempting to maintain high inactivation rates for both s aureus and e coli however it should also be noted that this study did not investigate delayed exposure to light i e phr after some dark incubation thus caution may need to be exercised in this case also nonetheless as is the case with lpuv disinfection bacterial photoreactivation is reported to be avoidable when a high uv energy is applied 23 24 the maximum pathogen photoreactivation and dark repair after 120 min following flow through puv treatment is shown in fig 6 as indicated in fig 5 s aureus exhibited higher phr rates in comparison to e coli this trend appeared consistent for dark repair analysis of s aureus at 486 mj cm2 albeit the percentage of reactivated bacteria was low for example in the case of s aureus 0 75 of the surviving bacterial population post puv treatment at 486 mj cm2 repaired under dark experimental conditions in comparison to 0 29 of e coli at the same uv output aside from slight bacterial reactivation at the lowest puv output dark repair for both strains was found to be minimal after puv flow through treatments of 1026 mj cm2 and above potential reasons for the lack of dark repair exhibited by bacteria in this study may be due the length of dark exposure time applied during the experimental analysis jungfer et al 40 reported the activation of bacterial dark repair mechanisms reca mrna protein to be dependent on experimental incubation time which was found to vary depending on the bacterial strain for example a dark incubation time of two hours induced reca in drinking water bacteria caulobacter crescentus in contrast enterococcus faecium required an incubation period of six hours before dark repair mechanisms were observed 40 however previous studies 23 41 have also reported bacterial dark repair to occur within approximately 100 min of incubation post uv disinfection after which a bacterial decay period was observed nebot sanz et al 23 confirmed dark repair analysis carried out in conjunction with photoreactivation analysis did occur but to a lower degree that in light repair conditions moreover the authors 23 concluded maximum dark repair of bacteria occurred sooner in comparison to maximum bacterial photoreactivation in this study stable photoreactivation rates were achieved during the maximum experimental exposure time of 120 min and for this reason dark repair experimental analysis was also carried out for the same duration some of the differences in findings between studies may be attributed to the variation in gram positive and negative composition in terms of cell membrane s and amount of cell wall material present peptidoglycan 38 it is possible that low uv outputs also puts less biocidal stress on the treated bacterial cells with potentially greater ability to repair as less physical genomic and metabolic damage lower doses may not cause irreversible damage 4 conclusions this constitutes the first study to demonstrate that bacterial s aureus and e coli photoreactivation is possible post flow through puv disinfection and that the level of bacterial photoreactivation is dependent upon the output energy applied during prior uv disinfection treatment furthermore it was shown that dark repair is less significant when compared to light repair the results agree with similar studies in the literature involving static and continuous flow uv disinfection studies whereby the uv dose output applied during the uv disinfection phase influences the degree to which bacteria can repair should flow through puv systems be considered for full scale operation as a disinfection system for water reuse wastewater treatment sufficient energy should be applied to avoid bacterial reactivation the immediate exposure of bacteria to light post flow through puv treatment should also be avoided to minimise photoreactivation of both s aureus and e coli the continuous flow lpuv system used in this study successfully inactivated all three bacteria to a higher degree than the puv system deployed with significantly lower energy consumption the lpuv was also successful in the inhibition of e coli and s aureus photoreactivation post lpuv treatment the study confirmed the suitability of existing lpuv as a technology in achieving adequate inactivation percentages with limited potential for repair in both light and dark conditions however further work would be required in the development of puv systems to enable them be efficiently and cost effectively deployed in larger scale water wastewater treatment scenarios as with all disinfection technology the required doses for adequate removal of targeted pathogens will depend on the nature of the wastewater being treated declaration of competing interest the authors

13574,pulsed uv puv technology is accepted commercially for disinfection within the food packaging industry but has yet to be deployed by the water wastewater sector this is partly due to a lack of robust independently validated data for submerged or flow through treatment applications this study evaluated the efficacy of puv for water disinfection under flow through conditions bacterial pathogens of interest in the food and water wastewater sector namely escherichia coli staphylococcus aureus and listeria innocua surrogate for l monocytogenes were used to investigate the potential for photoreactivation and or dark repair post puv flow through disinfection a continuous flow low pressure uv was also analysed under similar experimental conditions bacterial inactivation via flow through puv was dependant on energy output with e coli exhibiting greatest sensitivity to puv treatment 5 3 log 10 inactivation after treatment at 1539 mj cm 2 output in uv range 300 nm l innocua exhibited the highest puv resistance 3 0 log 10 inactivation after treatment at 1539 mj cm 2 output in uv range 300 nm under similar treatment conditions greater photoreactivation occurred at lower puv outputs for both s aureus and e coli after flow through puv treatment thus exposure of treated bacteria to natural light immediately post flow through puv treatment should be avoided to minimise photoreactivation the lpuv demonstrated inactivation of all bacteria below the limit of detection 1 cfu ml and inhibited the occurrence of photoreactivation this study highlights the importance of considering bacterial repair potential and the need for further development of puv technology for such applications keywords ultraviolet applications bacterial disinfection wastewater treatment cell injury pulsed uv disease mitigation 1 introduction ultraviolet uv disinfection is a well established technology across a variety of different sectors including aquaculture ballast water treatment municipal wastewater treatment drinking water treatment agriculture dairy and the beverage industry 1 3 uv disinfection is typically seen as being user friendly free from toxic hazardous chemicals effective against chlorine resistant microorganisms and exhibiting shorter contact times in comparison to chlorine treatment 4 5 low pressure uv lpuv and medium pressure uv mpuv are currently the de facto uv disinfection systems used for water wastewater disinfection applications typically uv light is generated within the lamps when a voltage is applied across a mercury gas mixture which results in the discharge of photons the type of uv light produced is dependent upon the mercury vapour pressure lpuv lamps produce monochromatic light at 253 7 nm under low vapour pressure while mpuv lamps produce a polychromatic light due to higher vapour pressures 6 pulsed uv puv disinfection is a relatively new uv technology which differs to mercury vapour based lpuv mpuv light by utilising xenon gas to generate a high energy electron pulse which typically lasts microseconds puv systems generally comprise three parts the power supply the pulse configuration system and the flash lamp 7 an alternating current is stored in a capacitor where energy is discharged to create an intense pulse of light which spans across the polychromatic broadspectrum of uv visible and infrared light 200 1000 nm 8 the high peak power stored in the capacitor is a trademark of this system which has been shown in some cases to offer shorter treatment times 9 10 in addition the power emitted from pulsed uv lamps is generally at least an order of magnitude higher than the power emitted from lpuv lamps this is reflected in the respective energy outputs of both systems for microbial inactivation 11 12 the application of puv light as a microbial disinfection method within the food industry has been approved by the united states food drugs authority fda under code 21cfr179 41 7 13 puv disinfection is considered a favourable alternative to conventional thermal chemical disinfection processes owing to shorter treatment times however currently it is predominantly applied as a disinfection method for food packaging and to a lesser extent as a decontamination method for food products themselves 14 the vast majority of the published literature pertaining to puv studies describe experimentation analysis performed under static conditions i e samples are fixed below the lamp of those studies which have evaluated the disinfection potential of the system using a continuous flow through experimental set up authors reported log inactivation in terms of flow rates and number of passes through the system no uv doses were reported krishnamurthy et al 15 investigated the puv inactivation efficiency of staphylococcus aureus via flow through milk treatment results from this study reported bacterial inactivation rates of between 0 55 and 7 26 log10 cfu ml which were dependent on the distance of the lamp from the sample the flow rate and the number of passes i e the amount of times the medium was recycled through the system complete inactivation of s aureus 7 23log10 was achieved at a lamp distance of 8 cm and a flow rate of 20 ml min for a one pass treatment no uv doses were reported uslu et al 16 evaluated the potential of flow through puv for the disinfection of escherichia coli e coli and bacillus subtilis b subtilis in wastewater in this case complete inactivation of e coli 7 23 log10 and b subtilis 7 13 log10 was achieved at a flow rate of 2 l min for a one pass treatment in a synthetic wastewater mix the variation in the sample media used creates difficulty in comparing both studies as uv absorption rates may vary depending on the medium 17 further detail on uv dose would also be necessary for comparison this is an issue which limits wider comparisons within the literature in general in addition comparisons were not drawn between puv flow through treatment and lpuv disinfection while uv treatment is an effective disinfection method which produces no disinfection by products typically associated with chemical disinfection a primary drawback includes that of microbial dna damage repair post uv disinfection uv induced molecular lesions may be repaired or replaced by the microorganism either by i using enzymes that require light to repair dna i e photoreactivation phr or ii employing enzymes that replace damaged dna with undamaged nucleotides excision or dark repair 18 20 in the water wastewater disinfection sector phr is of primary concern when incorporating uv systems into disinfection processes as microbial re growth following exposure to sunlight can influence system effectiveness 21 literature investigating the photoreactivation potential of various pathogens in wastewater effluent post lpuv treatment has established the relationship between increasing uv dose and decreasing microbial photoreactivation rates 22 25 however in the case of bacterial phr dark repair post pulsed uv disinfection study findings are mixed lee et al 26 reported no phr or dark repair activity of e coli in distilled water mixed with humic acids after puv treatment at 9 mj cm2 dose measured as the portion of uv energy within 200 400 nm range of the broadspectrum lamp while maclean et al 27 confirmed photoreactivation of s aureus after a puv exposure 320 500 nm wavelength range of 1500 mj cm2 and also surmised a lower uv output dose during treatment would most likely result in increased bacterial photoreactivation rates kramer et al 28 investigated the phr potential of e coli and l innocua after pulsed light exposure on a polysaccharide surface and reported photoreactivation for both test bacteria with relative recovery being puv energy dependant in all cases pulsed uv disinfection analysis took place under static or batch experimental set up with fixed sample treatment indeed the vast majority of phr dark repair studies in water typically involve prior uv disinfection carried out via batch analysis 21 24 29 32 limited uv disinfection studies have evaluated the potential of bacterial reactivation after flow through uv disinfection for liquid treatments and to the best knowledge of the authors all were performed with conventional uv systems in this study the efficiency of uv inactivation for e coli s aureus and l innocua pathogens relevant in the food and water wastewater sectors was studied using lpuv and puv systems in single pass flow through configuration this also constitutes the first study to comprehensively compare bacterial photoreactivation and or dark repair immediately following flow through pulsed uv treatment this study would be of general interest to the water wastewater sector with a particular focus on the implementation of strategies of wastewater reuse 2 materials and methods 2 1 lpuv and puv systems the puv system comprised a bench scale pulsed power source puv 01 samtech ltd glasgow which was used to power a low pressure 60 kpa xenon filled flashlamp heraeus noblelight xap type nl4006 series constructed from a clear uv transparent quartz tube and produced a high intensity beam of polychromatic pulsed light 200 1100 nm the lamp was placed 10 75 cm above a sterilised aluminium flow through vessel with a plan surface area of 290 cm2 sample depth of 5 5 cm and hold up volume of 750 ml through which water was pumped with a peristaltic pump at specified flow rates fig 1 a the system was enclosed and a smooth aluminium cover was used on the inside of the lamp cover to reflect uv light onto the sample the puv system allowed for the input voltage and the pulse rate to be varied between 400 and 1000 v and for a pulse frequency of between 0 1 and 10 pulses per second pps the energy output of the lamp total energy and energy in specific wavelength ranges was calculated by analysing lamp characteristics as supplied and verified by testing by the manufacturer the area of the vessel the pulse frequency and the hydraulic residence time hrt table 1 see supplementary information for system details figure s1 and table s1 the range of energy outputs chosen for this study were selected based on previous puv system analysis outlined in fitzhenry et al 33 and fitzhenry 34 these outputs would approximate low medium and high energy output capabilities from this lamp based on the characteristic curves for the puv lamp the expected energy outputs could be calculated to include only the wavelengths below 300 nm i e comprises uv c and some of the uv b spectrum this was done so provide context for in situ measurements taken at 280 nm described in section 2 3 the continuous flow monochromatic lpuv system deployed in this study lcd 412 plus s i t a halpin hayward ltd had a fixed power output of 40 w at a uv c wavelength of 254 nm an internal empty volume of 2 5 l and chamber dimensions of 95 cm length x6 cm diameter fig 1 b the lamp dimensions were 84 3 cm in length x1 6 cm diameter the lamp irradiation was 30 mj cm2 at 1 s residence time the uv energy output could be altered by varying the influent flow rate thereby altering the hrt and thus the exposure time the flow rate used in the experiments was the maximum allowable 24 6 l min which corresponded to a hrt of 0 47 s this equates to samples being exposed a uv output of 14 mj cm2 0 47 s x 30 mj cm2 this was the lowest exposure energy output achievable and resulted in almost full inactivation for all pathogens table 1 2 2 experimental setup table 1 summarises the experiments carried out with the lpuv and puv systems in this study in the case of the lpuv system only one energy output was analysed 14 mj cm2 for the flow through puv system four different uv outputs were evaluated ranging from 486 mj cm2 to 2052 mj cm2 2 3 uv dose determination of puv system the uv dose refers to the uv energy received by the sample i e the uv exposure of the sample the uv output is energy emitted from the lamp in the uv spectrum previous studies have shown the distance of the lamp from the sample to have an impact upon puv fluence distribution and measurements 35 therefore it was decided to measure the uv dose at the distances used in this study to allow for comparison to the calculated uv output the uv and uv c dose received by the sample from the puv system was analysed using a thermopile power detector model xlp12 3s h2 in gentec eo quebec canada and integra software in addition to two longpass colour glass filters fgl 400 which filters out wavelengths above 400 nm to give the uv range 200 400 nm and fgl 280 which filters out wavelengths above 280 nm to give the uv c range 200 280 nm thorlabs gmbh dachau germany the percentage transmission of both filters was as follows for the 400 nm filter transmission at wavelengths greater than 400 nm was 89 4 and for the 280 nm filter transmission for wavelengths greater than 280 nm was 91 6 thorlabs gmbh dachau germany the detector 12 mm aperture was situated at the bottom of a metal cylinder 5 cm in depth through which the light was directed downwards towards the cylindrical detector surface the detector was placed on the aluminium vessel with the sensor being 10 75 cm below the xenon lamp pulse energies were measured three times at each voltage and each voltage setting was analysed on three separate occasions to determine consistency deviation of detector readings to give nine broadspectrum energy readings in total after which an average value was obtained power was measured in irradiance units mw cm2 the filters were then placed separately directly on top of the detector at the base of the metal tube and the power measurements were taken as previously described the differences in the power values obtained with and without the filters were used to calculate the power emitted from the lamp within the uv and the uv c range the calculated uv output and equivalent measured uv and uv c dose are listed in table 2 at a distance of 10 75 cm there is a significant difference between the output of the lamp and the dose measured as approximated by the inverse square law other factors contributing to the relatively low uv and uv c dose relative to the lamp output is the broadspectrum nature of the output and heat generated within the puv system this has been previously noted in fitzhenry et al 2019 33 it should be noted that the filters were removed for the disinfection studies and were only used to determine uv dose 2 4 bacterial analysis via uv treatment the bacterial strains used to investigate inactivation photoreactivation and dark repair post lpuv and puv disinfection were escherichia coli atcc 25922 staphylococcus aureus dsm 1104 and listeria innocua dsm 20649 these were chosen as they had been recently identified as pathogens of interest in wastewater streams from dairy processing facilities in ireland 42 the strain dsm 20649 was used as a non pathogenic surrogate for listeria monocytogenes 36 all three freeze dried cultures were reconstituted using tryptic soy agar tsa sigma aldrich wicklow ireland and tryptic soy broth tsb fisher scientific dublin ireland at 37 c for 18 24 hours fresh cultures were then inoculated aseptically on to cryobeads pro lab microbank cruinn diagnostics dublin ireland for long term storage at 80 c the fresh cultures were also cultured on tsa slopes as working culture stocks and stored at 4 c in the fridge working stock cultures were discarded every three months and replaced with fresh working cultures to avoid contamination issues prior to the photoreactivation experimentation the bacteria were exposed to both puv and lpuv disinfection as a prerequisite to phr dark repair analysis for experimental analysis one colony of each strain was inoculated into 80 ml of luria broth lb sigma aldrich wicklow ireland for e coli culture and tsb fisher scientific dublin ireland for l innocua and s aureus the broth s were cultured on a rotary shaker at 90 rpm for 24 h at 37 c for lpuv runs batches of tap water 20 l were spiked with 10 ml of broth strains to give a starting bacterial concentration of 6 log10 0 5 while for puv runs 2 5 l of distillate water was spiked with 1 ml of broth strains to give a starting bacterial concentration of 6 log10 0 5 the distillation system in the laboratory produced a limited volume of water daily and could not meet the volumes required for lpuv analysis thus tap water was used instead experimental analysis was carried out to ensure there were no differences in inactivation rates of bacteria e coli was used as the test strain via lpuv between both mediums data not shown influent and effluent samples were analysed in duplicate pre and post uv treatment via pour plate technique 1 ml as per standard methods 43 using tryptone bile x glucuronide tbx agar vwr dublin ireland for e coli and tsa sigma aldrich wicklow ireland for s aureus and l innocua each uv inactivation experiment was performed at least three times the limit of detection was 1 cfu ml see section 2 6 for log inactivation calculations 2 5 photoreactivation and dark repair analysis immediately following uv treatment effluent samples were placed under light and dark conditions to study potential bacterial phr dark repair for photoreactivation experiments duplicate sample aliquots 40 ml were placed into open petri dishes diameter of 90 mm surface area of 58 cm2 at a distance of 9 cm from two compact fluorescent lamps 23 w power luminous flux lm 1450 which emitted light in the 300 700 nm spectral range osram model dpro mitw 23 w 840 e27 previous studies have reported the photolyase enzyme for bacterial phr to respond significantly to blue light in the 360 500 nm range 27 for dark repair experiments duplicate sample aliquots 20 ml were aseptically transferred to 60 ml tubes covered with aluminium foil and placed into a sealed box in the dark for the same duration of time as the photoreactivation experiments both the light and dark experimental analysis was carried out in the same incubator velp scientifica at 20 1 c sample volumes of 1 ml were collected aseptically from both the light and dark sample experiments at a series of time intervals ranging from 0 to 120 min post uv treatment the samples were analysed in duplicate via pour plate technique 1 ml as per standard methods 43 using tbx agar vwr dublin ireland for e coli and tsa sigma aldrich wicklow ireland for s aureus 2 6 quantitative analysis bacterial inactivation via uv treatment using

bacterial photoreactivation and dark repair expressed as a percentage was determined with eq 2 adapted from methods used in maclean et al 27 and shafaei et al 25 where nt is the concentration at time

continuous flow lpuv and flow through puv disinfection results for the lpuv system showed almost complete inactivation of all three bacterial strains at the uvc output of 14 mj cm2 fig 2 log10 inactivations of 5 3 0 3 6 0 0 2 and 5 9 0 1 were observed from starting bacterial populations of 6 0 log10 0 5 for s aureus e coli and l innocua respectively at 14 mj cm2 therefore given the lpuv system was operating at the shortest hrt and thus the lowest uv output achievable no other hrts were subsequently investigated the inactivation of vegetative bacteria in water via lpuv is well established previous studies have shown e coli and s aureus to be inactivated by 5 6 log10 in water via batch lpuv disinfection at uv doses of 10 mj cm2 4 37 thus results in this study are in line with findings in the literature which illustrate vegetative cells are readily inactivated by lpuv disinfection at relatively low uv energies research investigating bacterial inactivation in water wastewater via flow through puv systems is limited in this study bacterial inactivation via flow through puv disinfection was linearly dependent on energy with e coli being the most sensitive and l innocua exhibiting the most puv resistance fig 3 the maximum inactivation observed for e coli 5 3 0 3 log10 was achieved at a lamp uv output 300 nm of 1539 mj cm2 while a higher uv output 300 nm of 2052 mj cm2 inactivated the gram positive bacteria s aureus and l innocua by 5 2 0 6 log10 and 4 3 0 3 log10 respectively this finding is consistent with farrell 38 who reported gram positive bacteria s aureus and l monocytogenes to be more resistant to puv light in comparison to gram negative bacteria e coli in a static experimental set up uslu et al 17 analysed the inactivation of e coli via flow through puv disinfection in synthetic wastewater with the addition of multiple pass analysis whereby the sample was recirculated back under the puv lamp for a second disinfection step in the aforementioned study the uv dose system output was not described rather the flow rate and broadspectrum energy output j per litre treated was given results showed complete inactivation of e coli in synthetic wastewater at flow rates of 10 l min equivalent to a broadband energy of 39 7 j l for a two pass treatment a similar study 39 investigated the inactivation of l innocua via flow through puv for water treatment a puv dose of 4 000 mj cm2 at a flow rate of 1 l min was required for 2 log10 l innocua inactivation in water krishnamurthy et al 16 tested the inactivation of s aureus in milk under flow through puv experimental conditions and also adopted a multi pass disinfection method akin to uslu et al 17 log10 reductions were reported as a function of flow rate lamp distance and number of sample passes complete inactivation of s aureus was obtained at 8 cm sample distance single pass and 20 ml min flow rate however no uv dose energy output was reported interestingly it was also noted that a decrease in puv energy was a polynomial function of the lamp distance i e inactivation rates were higher at 8 cm lamp distance than those achieved at 5 cm lamp distance 16 finally fitzhenry et al 33 recently reported a uv output 300 nm of approximately 2 000 mj cm2 was required to inactivate bacillus spp endospores by approx 2 log10 in water via flow through puv disinfection these studies show that with flow through pulsed uv technology as investigated to date the use of multi pass is necessary for the inactivation of s aureus and e coli in the case of l innocua a single pass may be possible however to date clear information on the necessary uv dose has not been available this study presents inactivation rates for various uv outputs for the puv technology this data is key as the overall capacity of the lamp in terms of uv energy output will be a key determining factor alongside the desired pathogen removal rates as to whether single pass or multi pass should be deployed 3 2 bacterial photoreactivation dark repair post uv treatment experimental results for the potential photoreactivation of the three pathogens following lpuv disinfection at 14 mj cm2 indicated that bacterial concentrations after light and dark repair analysis were negligible see supporting information figure s2 previous research 24 has reported phr for e coli post lpuv treatment whereby water samples exposed to uv dose of 5 mj cm2 were subsequently placed under sunlight lamps for 4 h before photoreactivation was observed while photoreactivation of e coli was reported after lpuv treatment at 5 mj cm2 the same study 24 reported a lack of photoreactivation when the bacteria were exposed to a higher uv dose of 15 mj cm2 sanz et al 23 reported a similar conclusion when investigating the photorepair potential of total coliforms post lpuv treatment in a wastewater treatment facility their results showed a significant decrease of photoreactivation potential at high uv doses indicating the severity of the uv damage at high doses can prohibit dna lesion repair therefore perhaps in the case of the experimental analysis carried out in this study the applied lpuv output of 14 mj cm2 may have inhibited the ability of the bacteria to photoreactivate dark repair unfortunately limitations regarding decreasing the system energy output of the lpuv system did not allow for analysis of bacterial phr dark repair post lower lpuv outputs nonetheless considering the high inactivation efficiencies found for the three experimental bacterial strains and the lack of photoreactivation dark repair at the minimum uv output possible 14 mj cm2 and at a relatively high flow rate 24 6 l min equating to 0 47 s hrt the results further highlight the suitability of the lpuv system as an effective technology to inactivate s aureus e coli and l innocua the particular strain of l innocua dsm 20649 selected for this study appeared to be impacted by the photoreactivation experimental conditions previous studies have discussed various light sources used in phr experiments including the spectrum output the power the temperature which influences sunlight simulation and the colour of the light it was noted that the photolyase enzyme for bacterial photoreactivation responds significantly to blue light in the 360 500 nm range and that l monocytogenes and s aureus exhibit maximum photoreactivation potential between 360 380 nm 27 therefore these factors were taken into consideration when deciding the optimum conditions for photoreactivation experiments fig 4 a shows the results of the photoreactivation and dark repair experiments for l innocua post flow through puv treatments at puv outputs 300 nm of 486 1026 and 2052 mj cm2 while minimal dark repair was observed for l innocua populations of l innocua survivors post puv irradiation were observed to decrease in numbers during the period of photoreactivation conditions upon further investigation it was confirmed that l innocua was inactivated by the compound fluorescent lamp with no prior uv exposure fig 4b thus it was decided to eliminate it from the photoreactivation analysis for confirmation purposes similar analysis was carried out on e coli and s aureus whereby the strains were exposed to the compound light only without prior exposure to puv the results confirmed that the photoreactivation experimental conditions were not impacting upon cell viability as was the case with l innocua fig 4 b a previous study reported photoreactivation of the same strain of l innocua as was used in this study 28 kramer et al 28 investigated the photoreactivation of puv treated l innocua dsm 20649 and used a 30 w fluorescent lamp with a spectrum output of between 400 and 650 nm for phr analysis these results showed photoreactivation rates of between 102 and 106 cfu ml after 24 h of lamp exposure on tryptic soy agar at 37 c depending on the puv fluence applied the reasons for l innocua becoming inactivated under the compound lamp in this study are not entirely clear perhaps the slightly lower spectrum output of the lamp and the difference in experimental conditions illumination on agar and not water as was the case in this study in the kramer et al 28 study were more conducive to l innocua photoreactivation analysis i e agar medium designed to enable bacterial growth as opposed to water medium however in this study it was considered important to use a lamp with a spectrum below 400 nm due to reasons stated above i e photolyase activity and favoured photoreactivation potential at the wavelengths between 360 380 nm moreover s aureus and e coli were not negatively affected by the lamp photoreactivation conditions while photoreactivation analysis of l innocua could not be completed in this study details surrounding the specifics of experimental design and the particular bulbs used for puv treatments may be noteworthy for future studies photoreactivation was observed for both e coli and s aureus post flow through puv treatment at various energy outputs over time fig 5 a and 5 b results for s aureus at the lowest output of 486 mj cm2 showed a sharp increase in phr between 10 and 60 min after which inactivation were relatively stable however this was not constant and the phr increased slightly again after this time point increases in the percentage photoreactivation of s aureus were less pronounced at higher uv system outputs with negligible phr occurring at any time point after puv treatment at 2052 mj cm2 fig 5 a analysis of e coli photoreactivation over time shows a slightly different trend to that of s aureus post puv treatment fig 5 b at 486 mj cm2 the phr of e coli steadily increased between 15 and 90 min before a tailing effect was observed at 1026 mj cm2 the percentage of photoreactivation e coli was relatively low while at 1539 mj cm2 it was found to be negligible therefore it was decided to not investigate photoreactivation of e coli at higher uv system outputs previous studies 21 have suggested that a time based comparison for photoreactivation experiments cannot be performed due to variations in lamp intensities i e the energy outputs of lamps can vary even where they are the same model however in the present research study a time based comparison between s aureus and e coli was possible as the same experimental set up and lamp was used for both bacteria and should be noted for future studies of this kind photoreactivation has been observed previously 28 for e coli post static puv treatment on gel mediums with a recovery rate of up to 2 log10 following a puv dose of 450 1000 mj cm2 maclean et al 27 investigated the phr potential of s aureus and l monocytogenes post puv treatment under static experimental conditions and observed a photoreactivation response after puv treatments of 1500 mj cm2 and 3400 mj cm2 within 320 500 nm range respectively the study found approximately 2 of s aureus bacteria photoreactivated after a puv exposure of 1500 mj cm2 phr exposure time not given similarly results in the present study found 1 7 of the s aureus population photoreactivated after 1500 mj cm2 puv energy exposure at 90 min however in this case a flow through experimental set up was applied while maclean et al 27 did report a low degree of phr for s aureus at the puv output energy applied it was surmised that a less intense uv energy output would likely result in a higher degree of photoreactivation which was the finding in this study the majority of photoreactivation occurred within the first hour for s aureus and the first 90 min for e coli thus avoiding bacterial exposure to light immediately after flow through puv disinfection may be important when attempting to maintain high inactivation rates for both s aureus and e coli however it should also be noted that this study did not investigate delayed exposure to light i e phr after some dark incubation thus caution may need to be exercised in this case also nonetheless as is the case with lpuv disinfection bacterial photoreactivation is reported to be avoidable when a high uv energy is applied 23 24 the maximum pathogen photoreactivation and dark repair after 120 min following flow through puv treatment is shown in fig 6 as indicated in fig 5 s aureus exhibited higher phr rates in comparison to e coli this trend appeared consistent for dark repair analysis of s aureus at 486 mj cm2 albeit the percentage of reactivated bacteria was low for example in the case of s aureus 0 75 of the surviving bacterial population post puv treatment at 486 mj cm2 repaired under dark experimental conditions in comparison to 0 29 of e coli at the same uv output aside from slight bacterial reactivation at the lowest puv output dark repair for both strains was found to be minimal after puv flow through treatments of 1026 mj cm2 and above potential reasons for the lack of dark repair exhibited by bacteria in this study may be due the length of dark exposure time applied during the experimental analysis jungfer et al 40 reported the activation of bacterial dark repair mechanisms reca mrna protein to be dependent on experimental incubation time which was found to vary depending on the bacterial strain for example a dark incubation time of two hours induced reca in drinking water bacteria caulobacter crescentus in contrast enterococcus faecium required an incubation period of six hours before dark repair mechanisms were observed 40 however previous studies 23 41 have also reported bacterial dark repair to occur within approximately 100 min of incubation post uv disinfection after which a bacterial decay period was observed nebot sanz et al 23 confirmed dark repair analysis carried out in conjunction with photoreactivation analysis did occur but to a lower degree that in light repair conditions moreover the authors 23 concluded maximum dark repair of bacteria occurred sooner in comparison to maximum bacterial photoreactivation in this study stable photoreactivation rates were achieved during the maximum experimental exposure time of 120 min and for this reason dark repair experimental analysis was also carried out for the same duration some of the differences in findings between studies may be attributed to the variation in gram positive and negative composition in terms of cell membrane s and amount of cell wall material present peptidoglycan 38 it is possible that low uv outputs also puts less biocidal stress on the treated bacterial cells with potentially greater ability to repair as less physical genomic and metabolic damage lower doses may not cause irreversible damage 4 conclusions this constitutes the first study to demonstrate that bacterial s aureus and e coli photoreactivation is possible post flow through puv disinfection and that the level of bacterial photoreactivation is dependent upon the output energy applied during prior uv disinfection treatment furthermore it was shown that dark repair is less significant when compared to light repair the results agree with similar studies in the literature involving static and continuous flow uv disinfection studies whereby the uv dose output applied during the uv disinfection phase influences the degree to which bacteria can repair should flow through puv systems be considered for full scale operation as a disinfection system for water reuse wastewater treatment sufficient energy should be applied to avoid bacterial reactivation the immediate exposure of bacteria to light post flow through puv treatment should also be avoided to minimise photoreactivation of both s aureus and e coli the continuous flow lpuv system used in this study successfully inactivated all three bacteria to a higher degree than the puv system deployed with significantly lower energy consumption the lpuv was also successful in the inhibition of e coli and s aureus photoreactivation post lpuv treatment the study confirmed the suitability of existing lpuv as a technology in achieving adequate inactivation percentages with limited potential for repair in both light and dark conditions however further work would be required in the development of puv systems to enable them be efficiently and cost effectively deployed in larger scale water wastewater treatment scenarios as with all disinfection technology the required doses for adequate removal of targeted pathogens will depend on the nature of the wastewater being treated declaration of competing interest the authors
