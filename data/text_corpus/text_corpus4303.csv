21515,five reduced scale shaking table tests have been performed to investigate the deformation behavior of a block type quay wall under strong earthquakes the quay wall was resting on a high relative density inclined seabed the underlying seabed inclination and bottom block slopes have been considered as two parameters for mitigating the wall displacement the experimental results indicated that the dominant mode of the wall failure under strong base acceleration was the sliding of the wall increasing the bottom block inclination from 0 to 10 significantly decreased the lateral displacement and the backfill settlements which can increase the safety of port facilities since the high bottom inclination can cause the wall to overturn a 7 degree angle was selected as the optimal degree for the presented wall model furthermore it was observed that making the bottom block inclined without the seabed being inclined did not effectively reduce the wall displacement keywords hunchbacked

and studied the effects of deformable panels installed behind a caisson quay wall to investigate the reduction of displacements settlements and tilting of the wall moghadam et al 2009 sugano et al investigated two different wall bottom angles to reduce the lateral deformations of a caisson quay wall to mitigate the damage sugano et al 2004 block type quay walls despite their simple and economical construction are a type of gravity wall that have experienced extensive damages in recent earthquakes sadrekarimi et al performed 1 g shaking table tests on hunchbacked gravity quay walls with different breaking points refer to blocks 3 and 4 in fig 1 and concluded that changing the location of the breaking point behind a wall may help achieve smaller displacements against earthquake hazards sadrekarimi et al 2008 they also showed that increasing the density of subsoil changed the dominant deformation mode of the quay wall to the sliding mode sadrekarimi 2011 yuksel et al also used 1 g physical modeling tests to investigate the seismic behavior of broken back quay walls with two locations of breaking points they found that a wall with a breaking point in its lower level is more stable against earthquake shaking in other words a wall with a lower breaking point level exhibits smaller deformation than a quay wall with a higher breaking point level yuksel et al 2017 in all the above studies the displacements of block type quay walls were found to be increased with increasing the base acceleration since many block type gravity quay walls have failed as a result of earthquake shaking researchers have continued to investigate seismic improvement of the block type walls this study attempts to analyze the effect of the inclined base of a wall as a damage reduction method to minimize the deformation of a hunchbacked wall in other words the optimal wall bottom angle for a specific block type quay wall to minimize the displacement under strong earthquake shakings 0 35 g is found and reported for the first time a series of 1 g shaking table experiments with different base block angles were performed in each test horizontal and vertical deformations of the model and backfill settlement profiles were measured and reported 2 physical model instrumentations the tests were conducted using the manual shaking table facility at iran university of science and technology a plexiglas container with internal dimensions of 180 cm length 46 cm width and 70 cm height was used for the model to fully observe and record the behavior of the models seven transducers were installed two linear variable differential transformers lvdt manufactured by gefran company were placed at the top of the wall block no 11 in fig 1 to record wall vertical settlements and horizontal displacements as lvdt1 and lvdt2 two pore water pressure transducers ppt from the sensor system technology company were installed such that one of them was placed beneath the wall in the seabed and the other one in the seabed farther away from the wall at 14 cm offset from the bottom of the container as ppt1 and ppt2 respectively and finally three accelerometers manufactured by tokyo sokki kenkyujo company were installed as acc1 at the bottom of the container acc2 on the block no 1 and acc3 at the top of the wall on block no 11 the monitoring system for recording the acceleration consisted of a high tech data logger with a capacity of reading 2000 samples per second hz fig 1 shows the model cross section and instrumentation and table 1 presents the characteristics of the monitoring devices 3 materials 3 1 soil and rock firuzkuh silica sand and crushed limestone were used in all tests as the seabed and backfill soils respectively and a coarse limestone material was employed as the backfill soil table 2 shows the physical properties of the seabed and backfill soils to uniformly distribute the weight of the quay wall on the seabed a 2 cm thick rubble mound layer with nominal diameter of dn50 of 6 mm was used beneath the walls in addition quarry stone gravel with dn50 of 4 5 cm was placed in front of the first row of concrete wall blocks in order to increase the sliding resistance sadrekarimi et al 2008 the soils grain size distributions of all tested soils are presented in fig 2 it should be noted that checking the hydraulic criteria of foundation materials or the nominal diameter of the toe protection was not the concern of this study 3 2 concrete blocks the tested wall in this study was vertically made of eleven concrete blocks with 4 cm horizontal widths for each segment this wall included ten concrete segment rows and a 44 cm long concrete cap as block no 11 on top of the wall due to the container width 46 cm eleven blocks each 4 cm and total of 44 cm were needed to horizontally construct the wall table 3 the specific weight of all concrete pieces was 2400 kn m3 a shear key 4 5 mm height and 10 mm wide was considered for each segment to increase friction between the top and bottom of each block to avoid relative sliding between the blocks the bottom first row concrete blocks of the wall were designed with four specific baseline angles of 0 3 7 and 10 4 scaling factor a geometrical scaling factor n of 25 was selected to transform the obtained data from the reduced scale model to the prototype size table 4 shows the similitude scaling relations between the model and the prototype altaee and fellenius 1994 however 1 g model tests cannot reproduce the field stress level and accordingly the stress strain behavior of the tested soil under low effective stress should be different from that of the prototype towhata 2008 this condition may change the soil behavior from contractive to dilative in other words the same prototype density in the 1 g reduced scale model test is not suitable for the model to simulate the prototype soil behavior to compensate for lower confining pressures in the models the soil in the model should be prepared in looser condition than the prototype condition which satisfies the similitude dilatancy in this regard vargas monge proposed eq 1 for toyoura sand in ring shear tests vargas monge 1998 by considering the undrained brittleness index constant through a combined change of the relative density and the effective stress level 1 e m e p 1 0 053 e p l o g μ where em and ep stand for the void ratios of the model and prototype respectively and μ is the scaling factor 25 the soil critical state line csl slope of the backfill soil was measured to be 0 053 sadrekarimi 2011 but the csl of the tested underlying soil from the triaxial tests of the present study was 0 03 by considering the above mentioned equation and assuming the void ratio of the prototype seabed equal to 0 646 dr 90 the void ratio of the model was specified to be 0 688 which is equivalent to a relative density of 77 this relative density is categorized as a dense state for sand in this regard the model relative densities of backfill limestone quarry stone and rubble mound were determined and are reported in table 2 since the coefficient of uniformity cu and particle shapes are controlling the csl sadrekarimi 2011 sukumaran and ashmawy 2001 therefore csl slopes of backfill rubble mound and the quarry stone between the model and the prototype were considered to be the same values fig 3 illustrates the csl graphs of all defined materials in this study the aim of using these experimental data was to estimate dynamic behaviors of the model at small stresses rather than an accurate model of a specific prototype scale hence it should be mentioned that the interpretation from the test results to the prototype behavior should be carefully performed due to the limitation of any 1g tests 5 model preparation the model preparation method was intended to simulate plain strain condition once the eleven wall concrete blocks were placed in a row a 1 mm gap was left between two individual elements as a result of the uneven surface of the concrete blocks such that they filled the entire gap width 46 cm it is therefore important to polish and lubricate both inner sides of the container before each test to avoid the side effect of the container since the ratio of backfill length around 100 cm to wall height 44 cm was efficiently larger by two times the boundaries of the model container did not have a significant effect on the model responses lee and chen 1998 ishihara et al 1996 the moist tamping method and the calculated sand weight required for a specified container volume were used to obtain the desired relative density dr of the firuzkuh seabed sand the soil layers were constructed every 5 cm until reaching just beneath the wall and backfill simulating the field construction layer the top layer of the soil under the wall was cut and prepared with the required angle to show the seabed deformation a 10 cm square mesh of dyed sand was deposited in front of the container after constructing the seabed a 2 cm thick rubble mound layer was poured and leveled between the wall and seabed the first row of concrete blocks was placed on top of the rubble mound then the quarry stone layer was placed in front of the wall carbon dioxide and water were circulated respectively from the bottom of the model container to saturate the seabed to avoid the upward gradient of water the percolation process was carried out using a very low discharge amount once the water reached the expected level the remaining concrete blocks were placed and the backfill soil was poured simultaneously using the pluviation method to achieve a model relative density of 52 similar to sadrekarimi et al 2008 these stages were repeated until construction of the wall was completed the angle of the underlying seabed beneath the wall and the wall s bottom concrete block angles were considered to be 0 3 7 and 10 sinusoidal excitations with a frequency of 2 8 hz similar to dominant frequency in most earthquakes psarropoulos et al 2005 for about 20s were applied to the model tests however the acceleration time histories in fig 6 are presented for 40 s 6 results and discussion this study presents the results of five shaking table tests the quay wall tested in this research was similar to the quay wall modeled by sadrekarimi as type ii sadrekarimi 2011 the main difference between this study and the mentioned research is that he focused on the effect of the hunchback quay wall breaking point level and the effect of seabed relative density on wall deformation while the present study focusses on the effect of wall bottom inclination on wall deformation furthermore this study applies a higher base acceleration than what he used fig 4 reveals that the dominant failure mode of the wall used in this research for the dense seabed due to strong peak accelerations of earthquakes sadrekarimi et al 2008 is sliding in addition test 05 is a control test used to confirm that the bottom of the wall should not have different angles than the surface of the seabed fig 5 this fact was considered in tests 1 4 to study the behavior of various underlying seabed inclinations under the wall the excess pore water pressure ratio ru time histories of the seabed were not presented here due to its negligible values 6 1 acceleration in order to consider all extracted peaks of the acceleration data the average of peaks during each time history of the accelerometers table 5 were calculated figs 6 and 7 show the time histories of base acceleration acc1 the middle transducer at the toe of the wall acc2 and the top transducer at the wall cap acc3 for the five tests respectively which were recorded for 40 s duration these selected data show the amplifications of the wall in acc3 relative to acc1 and acc2 relative to acc1 the two wall amplifications values acc3 acc1 acc2 acc1 for all inclined soil tests show an increase with rising the soil degree inclination while the optimum inclination degree 7 degrees indicates the least amplification amounts also the wall amplifications of acc2 acc1 present fewer values compared to acc3 acc1 which it means amplification is increased with increase in wall height as seen the obtained amplifications of test 01 with zero degree inclination are comparable with those obtained by yuksel et al for 0 35 g input acceleration yuksel et al 2017 and the amplifications of test 05 show that the induced wall acceleration significantly increases if seabed inclination is not parallel with the bottom block inclination 6 2 displacements the movement of block type walls generally involves the simultaneous sliding δb of the base wall shear deformation of the seabed δsh and wall rotation δro the lateral displacement of the wall base is determined by adding the amount of base wall sliding displacement of block no 1 δb during each shaking cycle δsh was measured by the amount of horizontal twist of sand grids specifically under the wall and the wall rotation δro which was measured by subtracting the value of bottom lateral displacements δb δsh from the total measured horizontal upper wall displacement displacement of block no 11 δtot the observation method the direct measurement method was employed after each test to deduce the middle wall δmid and bottom wall δb δsh displacements through the visible side of the model sadrekarimi 2011 to mitigate the damages that may occur to the ports as a result of wall sliding and backfill settlements 0 3 7 and 10 for the seabed inclination beneath the wall were considered in this study table 5 figs 8 12 and table 6 illustrate the results of the measured displacements in which a zero degree inclination fig 8 was selected as a criterion for comparison of the displacements with the other four tests fig 9 demonstrates that compared with a zero degree inclination model a 3 degree angle is not sufficient enough to substantially reduce the lateral displacement fig 10 illustrates that a seven degree base inclination decreased the lateral displacement and rotation angle by 40 50 the observation from fig 11 indicates that the wall with a 10 degree inclination angle experiences smaller displacement than the others due to a larger inclination degree of the soil beneath the bottom blocks however due to the high inclination angle 10 the wall is overturned towards the sea in other words since the seismic force fails to overcome the sliding resistance force most of the driving forces caused by earthquake motions are exerted to overturn the wall until it eventually falls based on the above stated observations the seven degree inclination can be considered as the optimal inclination due to its smaller rotation and lateral displacements in addition increasing the soil slope beneath the wall significantly decreases the lateral displacement due to increased interactions between the blocks and underlying soil in cases where the underlying soil slope and bottom block have an inclination degree of more than the optimal degree the wall may overturn test 5 fig 12 illustrates the effectiveness of inclination beneath the soil in which the bottom blocks have 3 degree inclinations and are placed on a 3 degree angle rubble mound layer while the angle of the underlying seabed inclination is zero in test 05 where only the bottom block has a 3 degree inclination the lateral displacement and rotation values of the upper blocks are more than the results in test 02 and these results confirm that for inducing more sliding resistance and reducing wall movements the underlying seabed and bottom block inclination must be parallel the results of the seabed shear deformation δsh for all five tests of this study depict that the high relative density seabed causes a significant decrease in the shear displacement of the seabed and the recorded displacements were less than 8 mm also wall rotation displacements δro illustrate a low value due to high relative density of the seabed other than the results of test 05 which show around fourfold the displacement value the displacements obtained in tests 1 4 ranged between 5 and 13 mm fig 13 shows that the displacement of block no 6 against the variation of the toe wall acceleration ranged from 0 37 to 0 44 as shown in this figure the block displacement is increased from 5 mm to 33 mm respectively the wall model with the optimum inclination degree 7 degrees and under 0 4 g wall acceleration illustrates a smaller block displacement around 50 decrease than those of the test models at 0 3 10 degrees inclination and under similar wall acceleration in other words the construction of an inclined bed beneath the wall as opposed to a zero angle seabed model enables the wall to withstand stronger earthquakes fig 14 demonstrates the corresponding results of the sliding mode for some tests of this study and those of the similar experiments reported by sadrekarimi et al sadrekarimi 2011 compared with the zero degree slope block models the optimal inclination angle 7 in test 03 shows a 50 decrease in the lateral displacement nevertheless the loading duration of the mentioned previous tests was half the present loading duration in addition the optimal model of this research test 03 proves that idea of 7 degree base inclination angle is as efficient as the quay wall with a higher breaking point type i since the tested walls exhibit similar deformations fig 15 also presents horizontal displacement time histories at the wall cap which are slightly higher than those observed in the middle and the base of the wall as revealed in this figure test 01 and test 02 show identical deformations test 04 indicates a wall collapse test 03 shows the least displacement due to its optimum inclination angle and test 05 as a result of its significant seaward rotation shows more deformation than test 02 at the wall cap yuksel et al 2017 studied the deformation of hunchbacked gravity quay walls with two breaking points at two elevations one of these quay walls is similar to that used in the present study with the difference that their wall did not have a shear key on each block fig 16 depicts normalized lateral displacements by z where z is a height parameter and is considered to be zero at the top of the cap against each normalized block height by wall height h for the same base acceleration test 01 and test 02 show good agreement with the results of yuksel et al which means that the shear key effectiveness is fairly limited also the significantly smaller normalized horizontal displacement of test 03 makes it possible to confirm the optimal inclination degree the high lateral deformation observed in test 05 was even more undesirable than the zero degrees inclination of yuksel et al and those of the other tests conducted in the present research it can thus be concluded that the optimal underlying seabed inclination is an effective method to mitigate the wall displacement caused by an earthquake fig 17 also exhibits the wall tilting angles θ of four tests presented by yuksel et al 2017 and also results of this study this figure confirms that the tilting angles for a base acceleration of more than 0 2 g moderately increases and the largest rotation angle 4 degrees occurs for 0 35 g acceleration furthermore the tilting angles of tests 01 and 02 of this research in contrast with the yuksel et al results show a similar trend test 03 with a 50 decrease depicts the least tilting angle among the six tests while test 05 is fairly high due to its conditions as control test 6 3 settlements the surface settlement profile of the backfill induced by seismic shaking was monitored by the variation of surface elevations sadrekarimi et al reported that maximum settlement for the lower seabed relative density appeared immediately behind the wall while maximum settlement for the higher relative density appeared at farther distances around 0 5 h wall height behind the quay wall sadrekarimi et al 2008 the 1999 chi chi earthquake mw 7 7 of taichung harbor taiwan caused a 1 7 m lateral displacement of quay walls towards the sea it also induced a 94 cm permanent settlement in the port area around 100 120 m behind the walls this ground vertical deformation imposed serious damages to port facilities such as cranes and storehouses whitman and lambe 1986 likewise large vertical deformations occurred during the 1995 kobe earthquake dewoolkar et al 2000 immediately behind the caisson blocks of the quay wall in port island fig 18 presents the settlement profile of the backfill along with the distance from the quay wall which includes a variety of vertical deformations the optimal model test in this study test 03 shows that in comparison with test 01 at zero degree inclination the settlement for the optimal degree inclination 7 is significantly reduced from 46 mm to 19 mm at around 0 5 h distance behind the wall which occurs far from the quay wall blocks fig 19 illustrates the normalized settlement which is the maximum deformations divided by the backfill soil height against the base acceleration for each test as revealed in this figure the settlement results of test 01 and that of yuksel et al 2017 are approximately similar for 0 35 g acceleration while test 03 as the optimal degree inclination of this research and with similar acceleration shows a much smaller value in comparison with the yuksel et al model 7 conclusion considering the significant damages of gravity type quay walls resulted from seaward displacements and their vulnerability to earthquakes a series of 1 g shaking table tests with 0 35 g base acceleration and 2 8 hz frequency were conducted to investigate the deformation performance of a broken back block type quay wall this study introduced and tested the idea of using an optimal bottom block angle the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the amplifications of the acceleration in the wall acc3 compared to acc1 and acc2 compared to acc1 for all the tests ranged between 1 0 and 1 9 the reported values of test 01 with zero degree inclination in this research are compatible with the results presented by yuksel et al for a similar input acceleration of 0 35 g yuksel et al 2017 2 this research revealed that at strong base excitation of 0 35 g such shear keys are not very effective in the stability of quay wall block type 3 optimal bottom block inclination for the studied wall showed satisfactory performances for the tested walls the observed displacement for a 7 degree bottom inclination showed about 50 less displacement than the other bottom inclinations 0 3 and 10 in addition the optimal bottom inclination was as efficient as those obtained from the higher breaking point wall of the sadrekarimi research type i which had presented better behavior than the lower breaking point for a wall similar to the present study sadrekarimi 2011 4 backfill settlements for all tested quay walls were related to the wall displacement therefore the decrease in the displacement and tilting of the wall also decreased the backfill settlements by about 50 for the optimal wall bottom inclination 7 degree which can be resulted in less damage to port facilities such as cranes pavements and etc 5 for the quay wall with a 10 degree bottom inclination the quay wall was overturned by the same input base acceleration this is probably due to much less displacement at the bottom than the upper of the wall and as a results the overturning factor of safety becomes less than the same safety factor for walls with other bottom inclination angles 0 3 7 in summary the optimal degree for broken back block type gravity quay walls significantly improved the dynamic behavior of the wall and backfill displacement tilting and settlement for the assumed conditions in this research credit authorship contribution statement

wall was completed the angle of the underlying seabed beneath the wall and the wall s bottom concrete block angles were considered to be 0 3 7 and 10 sinusoidal excitations with a frequency of 2 8 hz similar to dominant frequency in most earthquakes psarropoulos et al 2005 for about 20s were applied to the model tests however the acceleration time histories in fig 6 are presented for 40 s 6 results and discussion this study presents the results of five shaking table tests the quay wall tested in this research was similar to the quay wall modeled by sadrekarimi as type ii sadrekarimi 2011 the main difference between this study and the mentioned research is that he focused on the effect of the hunchback quay wall breaking point level and the effect of seabed relative density on wall deformation while the present study focusses on the effect of wall bottom inclination on wall deformation furthermore this study applies a higher base acceleration than what he used fig 4 reveals that the dominant failure mode of the wall used in this research for the dense seabed due to strong peak accelerations of earthquakes sadrekarimi et al 2008 is sliding in addition test 05 is a control test used to confirm that the bottom of the wall should not have different angles than the surface of the seabed fig 5 this fact was considered in tests 1 4 to study the behavior of various underlying seabed inclinations under the wall the excess pore water pressure ratio ru time histories of the seabed were not presented here due to its negligible values 6 1 acceleration in order to consider all extracted peaks of the acceleration data the average of peaks during each time history of the accelerometers table 5 were calculated figs 6 and 7 show the time histories of base acceleration acc1 the middle transducer at the toe of the wall acc2 and the top transducer at the wall cap acc3 for the five tests respectively which were recorded for 40 s duration these selected data show the amplifications of the wall in acc3 relative to acc1 and acc2 relative to acc1 the two wall amplifications values acc3 acc1 acc2 acc1 for all inclined soil tests show an increase with rising the soil degree inclination while the optimum inclination degree 7 degrees indicates the least amplification amounts also the wall amplifications of acc2 acc1 present fewer values compared to acc3 acc1 which it means amplification is increased with increase in wall height as seen the obtained amplifications of test 01 with zero degree inclination are comparable with those obtained by yuksel et al for 0 35 g input acceleration yuksel et al 2017 and the amplifications of test 05 show that the induced wall acceleration significantly increases if seabed inclination is not parallel with the bottom block inclination 6 2 displacements the movement of block type walls generally involves the simultaneous sliding δb of the base wall shear deformation of the seabed δsh and wall rotation δro the lateral displacement of the wall base is determined by adding the amount of base wall sliding displacement of block no 1 δb during each shaking cycle δsh was measured by the amount of horizontal twist of sand grids specifically under the wall and the wall rotation δro which was measured by subtracting the value of bottom lateral displacements δb δsh from the total measured horizontal upper wall displacement displacement of block no 11 δtot the observation method the direct measurement method was employed after each test to deduce the middle wall δmid and bottom wall δb δsh displacements through the visible side of the model sadrekarimi 2011 to mitigate the damages that may occur to the ports as a result of wall sliding and backfill settlements 0 3 7 and 10 for the seabed inclination beneath the wall were considered in this study table 5 figs 8 12 and table 6 illustrate the results of the measured displacements in which a zero degree inclination fig 8 was selected as a criterion for comparison of the displacements with the other four tests fig 9 demonstrates that compared with a zero degree inclination model a 3 degree angle is not sufficient enough to substantially reduce the lateral displacement fig 10 illustrates that a seven degree base inclination decreased the lateral displacement and rotation angle by 40 50 the observation from fig 11 indicates that the wall with a 10 degree inclination angle experiences smaller displacement than the others due to a larger inclination degree of the soil beneath the bottom blocks however due to the high inclination angle 10 the wall is overturned towards the sea in other words since the seismic force fails to overcome the sliding resistance force most of the driving forces caused by earthquake motions are exerted to overturn the wall until it eventually falls based on the above stated observations the seven degree inclination can be considered as the optimal inclination due to its smaller rotation and lateral displacements in addition increasing the soil slope beneath the wall significantly decreases the lateral displacement due to increased interactions between the blocks and underlying soil in cases where the underlying soil slope and bottom block have an inclination degree of more than the optimal degree the wall may overturn test 5 fig 12 illustrates the effectiveness of inclination beneath the soil in which the bottom blocks have 3 degree inclinations and are placed on a 3 degree angle rubble mound layer while the angle of the underlying seabed inclination is zero in test 05 where only the bottom block has a 3 degree inclination the lateral displacement and rotation values of the upper blocks are more than the results in test 02 and these results confirm that for inducing more sliding resistance and reducing wall movements the underlying seabed and bottom block inclination must be parallel the results of the seabed shear deformation δsh for all five tests of this study depict that the high relative density seabed causes a significant decrease in the shear displacement of the seabed and the recorded displacements were less than 8 mm also wall rotation displacements δro illustrate a low value due to high relative density of the seabed other than the results of test 05 which show around fourfold the displacement value the displacements obtained in tests 1 4 ranged between 5 and 13 mm fig 13 shows that the displacement of block no 6 against the variation of the toe wall acceleration ranged from 0 37 to 0 44 as shown in this figure the block displacement is increased from 5 mm to 33 mm respectively the wall model with the optimum inclination degree 7 degrees and under 0 4 g wall acceleration illustrates a smaller block displacement around 50 decrease than those of the test models at 0 3 10 degrees inclination and under similar wall acceleration in other words the construction of an inclined bed beneath the wall as opposed to a zero angle seabed model enables the wall to withstand stronger earthquakes fig 14 demonstrates the corresponding results of the sliding mode for some tests of this study and those of the similar experiments reported by sadrekarimi et al sadrekarimi 2011 compared with the zero degree slope block models the optimal inclination angle 7 in test 03 shows a 50 decrease in the lateral displacement nevertheless the loading duration of the mentioned previous tests was half the present loading duration in addition the optimal model of this research test 03 proves that idea of 7 degree base inclination angle is as efficient as the quay wall with a higher breaking point type i since the tested walls exhibit similar deformations fig 15 also presents horizontal displacement time histories at the wall cap which are slightly higher than those observed in the middle and the base of the wall as revealed in this figure test 01 and test 02 show identical deformations test 04 indicates a wall collapse test 03 shows the least displacement due to its optimum inclination angle and test 05 as a result of its significant seaward rotation shows more deformation than test 02 at the wall cap yuksel et al 2017 studied the deformation of hunchbacked gravity quay walls with two breaking points at two elevations one of these quay walls is similar to that used in the present study with the difference that their wall did not have a shear key on each block fig 16 depicts normalized lateral displacements by z where z is a height parameter and is considered to be zero at the top of the cap against each normalized block height by wall height h for the same base acceleration test 01 and test 02 show good agreement with the results of yuksel et al which means that the shear key effectiveness is fairly limited also the significantly smaller normalized horizontal displacement of test 03 makes it possible to confirm the optimal inclination degree the high lateral deformation observed in test 05 was even more undesirable than the zero degrees inclination of yuksel et al and those of the other tests conducted in the present research it can thus be concluded that the optimal underlying seabed inclination is an effective method to mitigate the wall displacement caused by an earthquake fig 17 also exhibits the wall tilting angles θ of four tests presented by yuksel et al 2017 and also results of this study this figure confirms that the tilting angles for a base acceleration of more than 0 2 g moderately increases and the largest rotation angle 4 degrees occurs for 0 35 g acceleration furthermore the tilting angles of tests 01 and 02 of this research in contrast with the yuksel et al results show a similar trend test 03 with a 50 decrease depicts the least tilting angle among the six tests while test 05 is fairly high due to its conditions as control test 6 3 settlements the surface settlement profile of the backfill induced by seismic shaking was monitored by the variation of surface elevations sadrekarimi et al reported that maximum settlement for the lower seabed relative density appeared immediately behind the wall while maximum settlement for the higher relative density appeared at farther distances around 0 5 h wall height behind the quay wall sadrekarimi et al 2008 the 1999 chi chi earthquake mw 7 7 of taichung harbor taiwan caused a 1 7 m lateral displacement of quay walls towards the sea it also induced a 94 cm permanent settlement in the port area around 100 120 m behind the walls this ground vertical deformation imposed serious damages to port facilities such as cranes and storehouses whitman and lambe 1986 likewise large vertical deformations occurred during the 1995 kobe earthquake dewoolkar et al 2000 immediately behind the caisson blocks of the quay wall in port island fig 18 presents the settlement profile of the backfill along with the distance from the quay wall which includes a variety of vertical deformations the optimal model test in this study test 03 shows that in comparison with test 01 at zero degree inclination the settlement for the optimal degree inclination 7 is significantly reduced from 46 mm to 19 mm at around 0 5 h distance behind the wall which occurs far from the quay wall blocks fig 19 illustrates the normalized settlement which is the maximum deformations divided by the backfill soil height against the base acceleration for each test as revealed in this figure the settlement results of test 01 and that of yuksel et al 2017 are approximately similar for 0 35 g acceleration while test 03 as the optimal degree inclination of this research and with similar acceleration shows a much smaller value in comparison with the yuksel et al model 7 conclusion considering the significant damages of gravity type quay walls resulted from seaward displacements and their vulnerability to earthquakes a series of 1 g shaking table tests with 0 35 g base acceleration and 2 8 hz frequency were conducted to investigate the deformation performance of a broken back block type quay wall this study introduced and tested the idea of using an optimal bottom block angle the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the amplifications of the acceleration in the wall acc3 compared to acc1 and acc2 compared to acc1 for all the tests ranged between 1 0 and 1 9 the reported values of test 01 with zero degree inclination in this research are compatible with the results presented by yuksel et al for a similar input acceleration of 0 35 g yuksel et al 2017 2 this research revealed that at strong base excitation of 0 35 g such shear keys are not very effective in the stability of quay wall block type 3 optimal bottom block inclination for the studied wall showed satisfactory performances for the tested walls the observed displacement for a 7 degree bottom inclination showed about 50 less displacement than the other bottom inclinations 0 3 and 10 in addition the optimal bottom inclination was as efficient as those obtained from the higher breaking point wall of the sadrekarimi research type i which had presented better behavior than the lower breaking point for a wall similar to the present study sadrekarimi 2011 4 backfill settlements for all tested quay walls were related to the wall displacement therefore the decrease in the displacement and tilting of the wall also decreased the backfill settlements by about 50 for the optimal wall bottom inclination 7 degree which can be resulted in less damage to port facilities such as cranes pavements and etc 5 for the quay wall with a 10 degree bottom inclination the quay wall was overturned by the same input base acceleration this is probably due to much less displacement at the bottom than the upper of the wall and as a results the overturning factor of safety becomes less than the same safety factor for walls with other bottom inclination angles 0 3 7 in summary the optimal degree for broken back block type gravity quay walls significantly improved the dynamic behavior of the wall and backfill displacement tilting and settlement for the assumed conditions in this research credit authorship contribution statement

21516,this paper presents a nonlinear analysis method for laterally loaded large diameter monopiles the method accounts for the effects of pile diameter and soil deformation on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction by considering a modified modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction the solution considers the force and moment equilibrium of soil pile system to calculate the response of the monopile to lateral loads the influence of the soil side friction reaction on the ultimate horizontal resistance is evaluated considering the degradation of modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction due to large pile displacement the predictions of the developed method compared favorably with the results obtained from full scale field tests centrifuge model tests and laboratory model tests as well as existing analytical methods the developed analytical method is then applied to study the rigid rotation behaviour of offshore monopiles the results demonstrated that under lateral loading at the pile head the depth for rigid rotation point lies within 0 62l 0 73l l is pile length and the depth of the rotation point increases as the pile diameter increases it was also found that the load eccentricity has a significant effect on the depth of the rotation point keywords offshore wind power large diameter monopile lateral load sand nonlinear analysis 1 introduction offshore wind farms offer significant potential for sustainable and cost efficient means of electrical power generation extensive research is dedicated to expanding this green energy source to harness more power from offshore locations large diameter monopile is the most common foundation form used in offshore wind farm installations breton and moe 2009 pérez collazo et al 2015 because it can provide sufficient and reliable resistance for large cyclic lateral loads caused by wind and wave loads damgaad et al 2014 large horizontal displacement of monopile is a major challenge for offshore wind turbine operation therefore accurate prediction of the lateral response of the monopile is necessary for reliable and sustainable operation of the wind turbine the p y curve method is widely used in engineering practice to calculate the lateral response of large diameter monopiles however the functions that relates the soil reaction p to the pile displacement y used in this method were based on pile tests with a diameter of 0 61 m and an aspect ratio of 34 4 reese et al 1974 nonlinearity of soil around the pile could be simulated by the p y curve method therefore the method is recommended for design of offshore piles in the guidelines of american petroleum institute api american petroleum institute 2014 and det norske veritas dnv det norske veritas 2013 however when the p y curves are applied to the calculation of laterally loaded rigid piles installed in sand with an aspect ratio length diameter l d 4 to 8 the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction is overestimated o neill and murchison 1983 tak kim et al 2004 wiemann 2006 ashford and juirnarongrit 2003 evaluated pile diameter effect on initial modulus of subgrade reaction but considering pile diameter less than 1 5 m and aspect ratio more than 10 similarly sørensen 2009 2010 conducted numerical investigation of laterally loaded large diameter monopiles and proposed a formula to modify the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction considering the pile diameter kallehave et al 2012 evaluated the effect of pile diameter on the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction considering the stress bulb due to pressure at soil pile interface thieken et al 2015 evaluated the p y curve method by using three dimensional numerical simulations and confirmed the significant effect of the pile diameter on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for piles installed in sand zhang zhang et al 2005 evaluated the soil horizontal ultimate resistance and noted that the soil lateral friction resistance should be considered in calculating the pile lateral ultimate bearing capacity he also reported that the ultimate resistance determined using the p y curves method was less than the experiment results bouzid 2018 compared the predictions of existing modified methods of p y curve and the three dimensional finite element model the results showed that when the api p y method was applied to analyze the offshore monopile the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction was overestimated and the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity was underestimated the stress strain relationship of the soil in the vicinity of pile changes with the increase in pile diameter ashford and juirnarongrit 2003 as the pile movement engages a larger volume of soil in addition the lateral shear resistance of soil around the pile increases as the pile diameter increases ashour 2014 however the effect of pile diameter and the lateral shear resistance are not considered in the conventional p y curve method therefore when the p y curve method is used to calculate the horizontal displacement of large diameter piles the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction is overestimated and the ultimate soil resistance is underestimated another major drawback of the p y curve method is that it does not account for the continuous nature of the soil medium in order to account for the continuity of the soil medium ashour and co workers introduced the strain wedge model ashour 1998 ashour and norris 2000 which provides a theoretical link between the classic winkler foundation model and the complex three dimensional soil pile interaction norris 1986 allotey and el naggar allotey and el naggar 2008 utilized the strain wedge model to derive p y curves that can consider the soil continuity and pile properties and then studied the effect of pile head conditions soil properties pile shape and bending stiffness on the p y curves based on the strain wedge model and p y curve approach ashour 2014 developed an analysis model for large diameter monopile and discussed the influence of soil friction resistance on the lateral bearing characteristics of piles heidari et al 2014 studied the dynamic characteristics of laterally loaded piles by using the strain wedge model and indicated that the soil lateral friction resistance should be considered in summary reliable determination of the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction is necessary for accurate evaluation of the response of laterally loaded large diameter monopile using the popular p y curve method this paper proposes a modified formula to evaluate the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction which takes into consideration the effects of pile diameter and soil depth in addition the side friction on the pile shaft is accounted for in the calculation of ultimate soil resistance the proposed method also accounts for the degradation of the horizontal subgrade modulus as the pile displacement and hence soil deformation increases based on the proposed p y curve formulation a nonlinear analysis method is proposed to calculate the response of laterally loaded large diameter monopile which can account for different levels of horizontal displacement of offshore monopiles installed in sand in order to validate the proposed method and assess its performance for large diameter piles it is applied to analyze full scale pile load tests centrifuge model pile tests and laboratory pile model tests and its predictions are compared with those obtained from existing methods finally the depth of rotation point of rigid offshore monopile is investigated employing the proposed method 2 theoretical analysis the typical aspect ratio l d of monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines ranges from 4 to 8 under lateral load and bending moment h 0 and m 0 the monopiles used for offshore wind turbine installations undergo rigid rotation georgiadis et al 1992 prasad and chari 1999 ahmed and hawlader 2016 therefore three assumptions are stipulated in the current analysis as follows 1 the monopile is rigid under lateral load h 0 and m 0 there is a rotation point of the pile at some depth below the ground surface as shown in fig 1 a 2 the ultimate resistance of soil around the pile p u increases linearly with depth z as shown in fig 1 b i 1 p u m h z where m h is the influence coefficient of the depth on the ultimate soil resistance kn m 2 3 the relationship of soil resistance p and the pile displacement y is nonlinear as shown in fig 2 thus the soil is assumed to be an elastic plastic material when the horizontal displacement of the pile reaches a certain level the soil around the pile will reach the ultimate soil resistance state 3 modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction installation of monopiles with different diameter induces corresponding level of disturbance to the soil surrounding the pile thus piles with different diameter could cause different strain levels in the surrounding soil khouri 1984 and correspondingly the pile diameter can significantly affect the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction yang et al 2016 negro et al 2017 however the change of soil strain levels caused by variation of pile diameter is not properly accounted for in the conventional p y curve method in this section a numerical model is developed and verified to account for the strain level when determining the subgrade modulus 3 1 modified method for modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction terzaghi 1955 proposed an equation to evaluate the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction as a function of the soil elastic modulus e s considering the pile diameter i e 2 n h e s d where n h is the initial coefficient of subgrade reaction 103 kn m 3 for e s in kpa and d in m janbu 1963 evaluated the soil elastic modulus from an extensive experimental program considering different states of stress duncan and chang 1970 reviewed these experimental results and proposed an equation to evaluate the elastic modulus e s considering different confining pressure σ3 i e 3 e s k σ at σ 3 σ at λ 4 σ 3 k 0 γ z where k is reference value of soil elastic modulus and λ represents the relationship of e s with minimum principal stress of soil both are a function of sandy soil relative density σ 3 is the minimum principal stress of soil kpa σat is the atmospheric pressure 101 kpa k 0 is coefficient of earth pressure at rest z is depth m γ is the unit weight kn m 3 reese et al 1974 proposed that the variation of modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction with depth can be expressed by 5 k h n h z where k h is modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction kpa combining eqs 2 5 the following relationship is obtained 6 k h e s z z 0 n where n is a coefficient of depth effect and is a function of sand relative density z 0 is reference depth m considering available guidance on effect of pile diameter on soil resistance and pile side friction resistance stevens and audibert 1979 china academy of building 2008 the influence of pile diameter on the soil modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction may be given by 7 k h d d 0 m where d 0 is reference diameter m is an exponent which is a function of sand relative density kallehave kallehave et al 2012 developed a modified formula for modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction to account for the effect of pile diameter and confining pressure on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction i e 8 k h n h z 0 d d 0 m z z 0 n where n h is the coefficient of subgrade reaction see fig 3 d 0 is 1 0 m z 0 is 2 5 m it should be noted that the values of λ m and n in eqs 2 7 vary with the sand relative density however the values of m and n are fixed 0 5 and 0 6 respectively in eq 8 in order to establish reasonable values of m and n a series of numerical simulations is carried out using the computer program flac3d for laterally loaded large diameter monopile installed in sand considering three levels of sand relative density initially a flac3d model is developed to simulate field tests of piles installed in sand li 2017 luo et al 2018 and the model was verified using the experimental results obtained from field tests the parameters of the tested monopile model are summarized in table 1 and the soil model parameters are summarized in table 2 the monopile is assumed to behave in a linear elastic manner in the numerical model and is modeled as a solid cylinder with an equivalent bending stiffness of the hollow steel pipe pile the soil behaviour is simulated as linear elastic perfectly plastic material with mohr coulomb failure criterion the soil pile interaction is simulated using interfaces at the monopile base and along the side interface the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of both interfaces are specified as 109 pa m the contact surface parameters c and ϕ are taken as 0 6 times the strength parameter of adjacent soil itasca 2012 the length and width of soil domain are 6 8 m 20d in each direction and the depth is 6 8 m 20d mesh refinement is firstly investigated to ensure accurate results soil domain is discretized using radial cylinder mesh and the radial ratio of mesh is 1 2 size of element is 0 1 m in the depth direction the boundary conditions involved constraining the side and bottom displacements of the mesh nodes at the bottom and side boundaries fig 4 presents an overview of the half model the lateral load is applied in increments and each load increment is 10 kn and height of applied lateral load is 0 4 m in order to account for effect of pile installation on change of stress and soil properties adjacent to the pile the simulation is divided into three construction steps the geostatic equilibrium of soil domain under self weight is considered first at the same time the variation of the soil elastic modulus with depth is determined using eq 3 and considering k 1400 and λ 0 56 by parameters of soil in table 2 secondly zone of soil at the location of the monopile is excavated removed from the model and the monopile is driven into this zone the geostatic equilibrium of the overall model is balanced again under self weight in the last step of simulation the lateral load is applied and the lateral response of the monopile is analyzed the performance of the numerical model was verified by comparing its predictions with the observed experimental results the comparisons included p y curves obtained at different levels below the pile head along the pile shaft 2d 3d and 6d load displacement response at pile head and pile deflection bending moment and shear force profiles along the pile shaft fig 5 shows excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental p y curves at the specified elevations at the same time the comparison of lateral load displacement at groundline shows excellent agreement between calculated and observed responses as presented in fig 6 similarly fig 7 shows excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental data of bending moment the excellent agreement between the numerical model predictions and experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the established numerical model in this study the verified flac3d model was then used to analyze the lateral response of large diameter monopoles installed in three different sand profiles characterized with the soil parameters presented in table 3 the pile diameter varied from 2 to 8 m while the aspect ratio was maintained at 6 which is typical for monopiles used as foundation for offshore wind turbine the lateral load is applied to the pile section at 2 0 m above ground the calculated response from the numerical model are processed to establish the p y curves the initial modulus of subgrade reaction at the same depth for different pile diameters as well as initial modulus of the same pile diameter at different depths are derived from the p y curves eqs 9 and 10 are then used to normalize the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction 9 k x k 2 d x d 2 m 10 k y k 1 z y z 1 n where k 2 is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for d 2 m k x is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for any value of d x k 1 is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for depth 1 m below ground surface k y is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for any depth z y the obtained results are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 displays the fitted curve of the exponent m that describe the effect of pile diameter on initial modulus for three different values of sand relative density it is noted from fig 8 that m 0 5 for piles in dense and medium dense sands and m 0 6 for loose sand represent the obtained results well fig 9 shows the fitted curve of exponential n that describe the depth effect on the initial modulus for piles installed in three different values of sand relative density fig 9 shows that n 0 5 0 6 and 0 65 are proposed for dense medium dense and loose sand respectively these observations are used to develop the modified equation for the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction as shown in table 4 3 2 degradation of the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction bhushan bhushan et al 1981a prakash prakash and kumar 1996 and kumar kumar et al 2006 studied the relation between the horizontal displacement and modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction has been investigated extensively it was found that the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction decreased as the pile horizontal displacement increased based on field tests of piles installed in sand with different relative density bhushan bhushan et al 1981a proposed a function to relate the initial modulus to the pile horizontal displacement under lateral load i e 11 n h n h 0 066 y 0 d 0 48 where n h is the constant of the degraded subgrade reaction due to horizontal displacement of the pile n h is the constant of the subgrade reaction defined by the sand relative density and angle of internal friction fig 3 y 0 is the pile horizontal displacement at groundline m 4 ultimate soil resistance as shown in fig 10 the horizontal soil resistance comprises two components normal soil reaction in front of pile and the ultimate frictional resistance along the pile side briaud and smith 1983 smith 1987 el naggar 2018 thus the ultimate soil resistance may be given by 12 p u f q where f is the ultimate horizontal frictional resistance kn m 1 q is the ultimate normal soil resistance kn m 1 f and q can be calculated by 13 f ξ τ max d 14 q η p max d 15 p max k p 2 γ z 16 τ max k 0 γ z tan δ where ξ and η are 1 0 and 0 8 circular pile briaud and smith 1983 p max is maximum earth pressure in front of pile kpa τ max is maximum side shear stress around pile kpa k p is the coefficient of rankine passive earth pressure δ is 0 5 0 7 φ steel pipe pile or 1 0 φ bored pile of friction angle for the soil around pile el naggar 2018 kulhawy et al 1983 kulhawy and fang 1991 combining eqs 12 16 eq 17 is obtained as follows 17 p u ξ k 0 γ tan δ η k p 2 γ d z fig 11 compares the calculated soil resistance from eq 17 with the measured test values of barton and finn 1983 as well as those calculated employing the methods proposed by broms 1964 reese breton and moe 2009 and fleming fleming et al 1992 fig 11 shows that the calculated ultimate soil resistance values using eq 17 are in better agreement with the measured values than the other methods therefore eq 17 is used in the present study to calculate the ultimate horizontal soil resistance 5 proposed analytical method based on the assumptions stated previously and the results obtained from analysis described above the load displacement response of laterally loaded monopile can be schematically described in fig 12 and a nonlinear analytical method for the laterally loaded monopile is established correspondingly as shown in fig 12 three cases are considered for the soil resistance around the pile and its distribution along the shaft case 1 pile horizontal displacement is small and soil does not experience yield at any point along the shaft case 2 only soil above the rotation point experiences yield case 3 soil along the entire pile shaft experiences yield the details of all three cases and the corresponding analytical model aspects are discussed below 5 1 case 1 no soil yield the lateral load h 0 and bending moment m 0 are applied to the pile head and both are small such that the induced shear stress in the soil does not reach its ultimate resistance as shown in fig 12 a it is assumed that the horizontal displacement of pile at the mudline ground level is y 0 and the pile rotates about a point at t depth z x as shown in fig 12 a the horizontal displacement of the pile at any depth along its shaft is expressed by 18 y x z x y 0 since soil does not reach the ultimate state using the modified equation for determining the soil modulus along with the m and exponentials listed in table 4 and eq 18 the soil resistance at any depth can be expressed by 19 p k h y 0 066 n h z 0 d m 0 48 d 0 m z z 0 n x z x y 0 0 52 eq 19 can be simplified as 20 p n h y 0 0 52 x z z n x 21 n h 0 066 n h z 0 d m 0 48 d 0 m 1 z 0 n the horizontal force and bending moment equilibrium equations of the soil pile interaction are established as 22 h 0 0 l p d z h 0 c x l n 1 n 1 l n 2 n 2 0 23 m 0 0 l p z d z m 0 c x l n 2 n 2 l n 3 n 3 0 where c n h y 0 0 52 x in the above formulas by solving eqs 22 and 23 the horizontal displacement y 0 and the depth x of the rotation point can be obtained the response of laterally loaded pile at any depth can be then calculated consequently the soil resistance and horizontal displacement and bending moment of pile can be determined at any depth 5 2 case 2 partial soil yield the lateral load h 0 and m 0 at pile head reach such certain levels such that the shear stresses in the soil above the rotation point of pile approaches its ultimate resistance as shown in fig

z z n x a z l at the depth z a the soil resistance reaches its ultimate value therefore eqs 24 and 25 are equal at z a and correspondingly the depth to rotation point x can be determined by 26 x n h y

case 3 limitation of soil yield when the lateral load h 0 and bending moment m 0 at the pile are large enough the shear stresses reach the ultimate soil resistance both above and below the rotation

conditions the flowchart of the calculation procedure is shown in fig 13 6 verification and comparison for the proposed analytical method in order to verify the developed method it is applied to analyze field pile tests bhushan et al 1981b centrifugal model tests of piles georgiadis et al 1992 and model pile tests zhu et al 2015 the calculated responses are compared with experimental observations as well as the predictions of an analytical method zhang 2009 p y curve methods murchison et al 1984 and api american petroleum institute 2014 and hardening p y curve method zhu et al 2015 6 1 case study 1 field tests bhushan et al 1981b carried out field tests with seven full scale bored piles with diameter varying from 0 61 to 1 22 m and embedded depth of 5 2 m and 5 5 m test piles 4 and 5 and test piles 6 and 7 were installed in sites b and c respectively for test piles 4 and 5 d 0 61 m and 0 91 m and the embedment length l 5 2 m the top soil layer of site b was 0 9 m thick silty sand was followed by a gravelly layer 4 3 m thick the unit weight of the both soil layers was 16 5 kn m 3 the angle of internal friction φ 36 and 42 for top and bottom layers respectively in both analytical models i e zhang 2009 and present approximate φ 40 was used for both layers test piles 6 and 7 were installed in site c and had d 0 91 m and 1 22 m respectively their embedment depth l 5 5 m site c also contained two soil layers top layer was 1 8 m thick comprised silty sand underlain by a gravelly layer 3 7 m thick the unit weight of both layers was 16 5 kn m 3 their angles of internal friction φ 36 and 42 respectively an approximate φ 38 was used in the analytical model zhang 2009 for both layers fig 14 and fig 15 compare the predictions of the present model with both the zhang model and experimental observations for test piles 4 and 5 and piles 6 and 7 respectively figs 14 and 15 show that excellent agreement exists between the calculated groundline horizontal displacement from the present model and the measured response on the other hand the zhang model provide acceptable predictions when the displacement is less than 5 mm as the horizontal displacement increases more than 5 mm the predictions of the zhang model diverge from the measured response and that calculated from the present solution this is because the present method accounts for the pile diameter effect on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction while the zhang method does not the calculated depth of pile rotation point using the zhang model is about 3 94 m for piles 4 and 5 which is about 0 75 l for piles 6 and 7 the calculated depth of rotation point is about 4 2 m which is equal to 0 76l the present method predicts the rotation point for piles 4 5 6 and 6 to be 0 71l 3 74 m 0 72l 3 89 m 0 71l and 4 06 m 0 74l the maximum difference in calculated values from both models is less than 7 6 2 case study 2 centrifugal tests georgiadis et al 1992 conducted centrifuge model tests with a pile diameter of 24 47 mm and a pile length of 181 mm with the scaling factor of 50 g the prototype pile diameter was 1 224 m and the embedment length was 9 05 m the unit weight of soil was 16 3 kn m 3 and its φ 36 the present non linear analysis method is used to calculate the pile head displacement under lateral load and the results are compared with the measured response as well as that calculated using the api p y curve method and murchinson o neil method murchison et al 1984 as shown in fig 16 as can be noted from fig 16 both the api and the murchinson o neil methods overestimate the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction and consequently underestimate the horizontal displacements because these methods do not account for the effect of pile diameter on the other hand the calculated results using the present method are in good agreement with the experimental measurements for displacement greater than 50 mm the maximum difference between the calculated responses from the present model and the experimental results is less than 20 6 3 case study 3 model tests zhu et al 2015 conducted six lateral load 1 g model tests to simulate a monopile foundation for offshore wind turbine with an aspect ratio of 5 5 the buried depth was 0 915 m and the pile diameter was 0 165 m the soil saturated unit weight was 18 8 kn m 3and its relative density was 70 a hardening p y curve model was developed based on the results of the model tests fig 17 compares the calculated response from the present model with the measured response as well as the responses calculated using the hardening p y model considering the rotation point at 0 75l 0 8l or 0 85l the lateral load versus groundline displacement are also predicted in fig 17 by using this current method it is noted from fig 17 that the predictions of the present model agree well with the measured data meanwhile ss the groundline displacement increased the predictions of the hardening p y curve model divert from the test results with maximum error of 60 0 85l and 80 0 8l and 112 0 75l this is because the hardening p y curve model does not account for the yield state of soil around the pile or the degradation of the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction on the other hand the proposed model accounts for both phenomena as the horizontal displacement level increases 7 parametric study for the proposed analytical method monopile foundations of offshore wind turbines experience rigid body rotation under lateral loading conditions in order to explore the variation of rotation point depth the proposed nonlinear analysis method is used to calculate the depth of rotation point of laterally loaded monopile considering important design parameters including load eccentricity m 0 h 0 pile diameter d and aspect ratio l d the soil and pile parameters considered in the analysis are φ 35 and unit weight 18 kn m 3 d ranges from 4 m to 9 m and l d varies from 4 to 8 the lateral force h 0 2 mn and the load eccentricity m 0 h 0 is varied from 0 to 120 m the calculated results are presented in fig 18 and fig 19 fig 18 shows the variation of the depth of point of rotation with load eccentricity as expected the rotation point moves upward as the load eccentricity increases however the depth of rotation point plateaus at approximately 0 62l when the load eccentricity exceeds 100 it is also noted from fig 18 that the ratio of depth of point of rotation to pile length l 0 l increases as d increases and for the range of problem parameters considered herein varies between 0 62l and 0 73l fig 19 displays the variation of l 0 l with of the pile aspect ratio l d it is noted from fig 19 that l 0 l as pile diameter increases and as l d increases for the range of d and l d considered in this analysis l 0 l varies between 0 65l and 0 69l finally inspecting figs 18 and 19 it can be concluded that load eccentricity has a more significant effect on depth of rotation point than l d 8 conclusions a modification is introduced to the equation used to calculate horizontal subgrade reaction modulus of sand accounting for effect of pile diameter furthermore the proposed equation can account for horizontal subgrade modulus degradation as pile displacement increases consequently an analytical method is developed for calculating the response of laterally loaded monopile installed in sand considering the effects of sand compactness pile diameter and degradation of soil stiffness the developed model is incorporated into a matlab code that can consider different states of stress within the soil the performance of the developed method was verified by comparing its predictions with testing results of full scale piles centrifuge model piles and 1 g model piles as well as available analytical models for lateral response analysis the verified model was then used to conduct a parametric study to evaluate the influence of load eccentricity m 0 h 0 pile diameter d and aspect ratio l d on depth of rotation point l 0 the following conclusions may be drawn based on the results of the study 1 this proposed method for calculating the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction accounts reasonably well for the effect of pile diameter on the reaction modulus and stress strain characteristics of soil near the pile 2 the excellent agreement between the predictions of the proposed analytical model and experimental results verifies its suitability for applications to analysis and design of large diameter monopiles used as foundations for offshore wind turbines 3 for large diameter piles the predictions of the proposed model are more accurate than those obtained from existing methods e g zhang model api p y curve method p y curve method of o neil and hardening p y curve of zhu 4 for rigid monopiles installed in sand and subjected to lateral load the rotation point is at a depth of approximately 0 62l 0 73l 5 the depth of monopile rotation point increases as pile diameter d and as aspect ratio l d increase 6 the load eccentricity m 0 h 0 has a significant effect on the depth of monopile rotation point up to 100 after which its effect is marginal credit

21516,this paper presents a nonlinear analysis method for laterally loaded large diameter monopiles the method accounts for the effects of pile diameter and soil deformation on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction by considering a modified modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction the solution considers the force and moment equilibrium of soil pile system to calculate the response of the monopile to lateral loads the influence of the soil side friction reaction on the ultimate horizontal resistance is evaluated considering the degradation of modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction due to large pile displacement the predictions of the developed method compared favorably with the results obtained from full scale field tests centrifuge model tests and laboratory model tests as well as existing analytical methods the developed analytical method is then applied to study the rigid rotation behaviour of offshore monopiles the results demonstrated that under lateral loading at the pile head the depth for rigid rotation point lies within 0 62l 0 73l l is pile length and the depth of the rotation point increases as the pile diameter increases it was also found that the load eccentricity has a significant effect on the depth of the rotation point keywords offshore wind power large diameter monopile lateral load sand nonlinear analysis 1 introduction offshore wind farms offer significant potential for sustainable and cost efficient means of electrical power generation extensive research is dedicated to expanding this green energy source to harness more power from offshore locations large diameter monopile is the most common foundation form used in offshore wind farm installations breton and moe 2009 pérez collazo et al 2015 because it can provide sufficient and reliable resistance for large cyclic lateral loads caused by wind and wave loads damgaad et al 2014 large horizontal displacement of monopile is a major challenge for offshore wind turbine operation therefore accurate prediction of the lateral response of the monopile is necessary for reliable and sustainable operation of the wind turbine the p y curve method is widely used in engineering practice to calculate the lateral response of large diameter monopiles however the functions that relates the soil reaction p to the pile displacement y used in this method were based on pile tests with a diameter of 0 61 m and an aspect ratio of 34 4 reese et al 1974 nonlinearity of soil around the pile could be simulated by the p y curve method therefore the method is recommended for design of offshore piles in the guidelines of american petroleum institute api american petroleum institute 2014 and det norske veritas dnv det norske veritas 2013 however when the p y curves are applied to the calculation of laterally loaded rigid piles installed in sand with an aspect ratio length diameter l d 4 to 8 the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction is overestimated o neill and murchison 1983 tak kim et al 2004 wiemann 2006 ashford and juirnarongrit 2003 evaluated pile diameter effect on initial modulus of subgrade reaction but considering pile diameter less than 1 5 m and aspect ratio more than 10 similarly sørensen 2009 2010 conducted numerical investigation of laterally loaded large diameter monopiles and proposed a formula to modify the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction considering the pile diameter kallehave et al 2012 evaluated the effect of pile diameter on the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction considering the stress bulb due to pressure at soil pile interface thieken et al 2015 evaluated the p y curve method by using three dimensional numerical simulations and confirmed the significant effect of the pile diameter on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for piles installed in sand zhang zhang et al 2005 evaluated the soil horizontal ultimate resistance and noted that the soil lateral friction resistance should be considered in calculating the pile lateral ultimate bearing capacity he also reported that the ultimate resistance determined using the p y curves method was less than the experiment results bouzid 2018 compared the predictions of existing modified methods of p y curve and the three dimensional finite element model the results showed that when the api p y method was applied to analyze the offshore monopile the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction was overestimated and the ultimate horizontal bearing capacity was underestimated the stress strain relationship of the soil in the vicinity of pile changes with the increase in pile diameter ashford and juirnarongrit 2003 as the pile movement engages a larger volume of soil in addition the lateral shear resistance of soil around the pile increases as the pile diameter increases ashour 2014 however the effect of pile diameter and the lateral shear resistance are not considered in the conventional p y curve method therefore when the p y curve method is used to calculate the horizontal displacement of large diameter piles the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction is overestimated and the ultimate soil resistance is underestimated another major drawback of the p y curve method is that it does not account for the continuous nature of the soil medium in order to account for the continuity of the soil medium ashour and co workers introduced the strain wedge model ashour 1998 ashour and norris 2000 which provides a theoretical link between the classic winkler foundation model and the complex three dimensional soil pile interaction norris 1986 allotey and el naggar allotey and el naggar 2008 utilized the strain wedge model to derive p y curves that can consider the soil continuity and pile properties and then studied the effect of pile head conditions soil properties pile shape and bending stiffness on the p y curves based on the strain wedge model and p y curve approach ashour 2014 developed an analysis model for large diameter monopile and discussed the influence of soil friction resistance on the lateral bearing characteristics of piles heidari et al 2014 studied the dynamic characteristics of laterally loaded piles by using the strain wedge model and indicated that the soil lateral friction resistance should be considered in summary reliable determination of the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction is necessary for accurate evaluation of the response of laterally loaded large diameter monopile using the popular p y curve method this paper proposes a modified formula to evaluate the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction which takes into consideration the effects of pile diameter and soil depth in addition the side friction on the pile shaft is accounted for in the calculation of ultimate soil resistance the proposed method also accounts for the degradation of the horizontal subgrade modulus as the pile displacement and hence soil deformation increases based on the proposed p y curve formulation a nonlinear analysis method is proposed to calculate the response of laterally loaded large diameter monopile which can account for different levels of horizontal displacement of offshore monopiles installed in sand in order to validate the proposed method and assess its performance for large diameter piles it is applied to analyze full scale pile load tests centrifuge model pile tests and laboratory pile model tests and its predictions are compared with those obtained from existing methods finally the depth of rotation point of rigid offshore monopile is investigated employing the proposed method 2 theoretical analysis the typical aspect ratio l d of monopile foundations for offshore wind turbines ranges from 4 to 8 under lateral load and bending moment h 0 and m 0 the monopiles used for offshore wind turbine installations undergo rigid rotation georgiadis et al 1992 prasad and chari 1999 ahmed and hawlader 2016 therefore three assumptions are stipulated in the current analysis as follows 1 the monopile is rigid under lateral load h 0 and m 0 there is a rotation point of the pile at some depth below the ground surface as shown in fig 1 a 2 the ultimate resistance of soil around the pile p u increases linearly with depth z as shown in fig 1 b i 1 p u m h z where m h is the influence coefficient of the depth on the ultimate soil resistance kn m 2 3 the relationship of soil resistance p and the pile displacement y is nonlinear as shown in fig 2 thus the soil is assumed to be an elastic plastic material when the horizontal displacement of the pile reaches a certain level the soil around the pile will reach the ultimate soil resistance state 3 modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction installation of monopiles with different diameter induces corresponding level of disturbance to the soil surrounding the pile thus piles with different diameter could cause different strain levels in the surrounding soil khouri 1984 and correspondingly the pile diameter can significantly affect the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction yang et al 2016 negro et al 2017 however the change of soil strain levels caused by variation of pile diameter is not properly accounted for in the conventional p y curve method in this section a numerical model is developed and verified to account for the strain level when determining the subgrade modulus 3 1 modified method for modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction terzaghi 1955 proposed an equation to evaluate the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction as a function of the soil elastic modulus e s considering the pile diameter i e 2 n h e s d where n h is the initial coefficient of subgrade reaction 103 kn m 3 for e s in kpa and d in m janbu 1963 evaluated the soil elastic modulus from an extensive experimental program considering different states of stress duncan and chang 1970 reviewed these experimental results and proposed an equation to evaluate the elastic modulus e s considering different confining pressure σ3 i e 3 e s k σ at σ 3 σ at λ 4 σ 3 k 0 γ z where k is reference value of soil elastic modulus and λ represents the relationship of e s with minimum principal stress of soil both are a function of sandy soil relative density σ 3 is the minimum principal stress of soil kpa σat is the atmospheric pressure 101 kpa k 0 is coefficient of earth pressure at rest z is depth m γ is the unit weight kn m 3 reese et al 1974 proposed that the variation of modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction with depth can be expressed by 5 k h n h z where k h is modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction kpa combining eqs 2 5 the following relationship is obtained 6 k h e s z z 0 n where n is a coefficient of depth effect and is a function of sand relative density z 0 is reference depth m considering available guidance on effect of pile diameter on soil resistance and pile side friction resistance stevens and audibert 1979 china academy of building 2008 the influence of pile diameter on the soil modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction may be given by 7 k h d d 0 m where d 0 is reference diameter m is an exponent which is a function of sand relative density kallehave kallehave et al 2012 developed a modified formula for modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction to account for the effect of pile diameter and confining pressure on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction i e 8 k h n h z 0 d d 0 m z z 0 n where n h is the coefficient of subgrade reaction see fig 3 d 0 is 1 0 m z 0 is 2 5 m it should be noted that the values of λ m and n in eqs 2 7 vary with the sand relative density however the values of m and n are fixed 0 5 and 0 6 respectively in eq 8 in order to establish reasonable values of m and n a series of numerical simulations is carried out using the computer program flac3d for laterally loaded large diameter monopile installed in sand considering three levels of sand relative density initially a flac3d model is developed to simulate field tests of piles installed in sand li 2017 luo et al 2018 and the model was verified using the experimental results obtained from field tests the parameters of the tested monopile model are summarized in table 1 and the soil model parameters are summarized in table 2 the monopile is assumed to behave in a linear elastic manner in the numerical model and is modeled as a solid cylinder with an equivalent bending stiffness of the hollow steel pipe pile the soil behaviour is simulated as linear elastic perfectly plastic material with mohr coulomb failure criterion the soil pile interaction is simulated using interfaces at the monopile base and along the side interface the normal stiffness and shear stiffness of both interfaces are specified as 109 pa m the contact surface parameters c and ϕ are taken as 0 6 times the strength parameter of adjacent soil itasca 2012 the length and width of soil domain are 6 8 m 20d in each direction and the depth is 6 8 m 20d mesh refinement is firstly investigated to ensure accurate results soil domain is discretized using radial cylinder mesh and the radial ratio of mesh is 1 2 size of element is 0 1 m in the depth direction the boundary conditions involved constraining the side and bottom displacements of the mesh nodes at the bottom and side boundaries fig 4 presents an overview of the half model the lateral load is applied in increments and each load increment is 10 kn and height of applied lateral load is 0 4 m in order to account for effect of pile installation on change of stress and soil properties adjacent to the pile the simulation is divided into three construction steps the geostatic equilibrium of soil domain under self weight is considered first at the same time the variation of the soil elastic modulus with depth is determined using eq 3 and considering k 1400 and λ 0 56 by parameters of soil in table 2 secondly zone of soil at the location of the monopile is excavated removed from the model and the monopile is driven into this zone the geostatic equilibrium of the overall model is balanced again under self weight in the last step of simulation the lateral load is applied and the lateral response of the monopile is analyzed the performance of the numerical model was verified by comparing its predictions with the observed experimental results the comparisons included p y curves obtained at different levels below the pile head along the pile shaft 2d 3d and 6d load displacement response at pile head and pile deflection bending moment and shear force profiles along the pile shaft fig 5 shows excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental p y curves at the specified elevations at the same time the comparison of lateral load displacement at groundline shows excellent agreement between calculated and observed responses as presented in fig 6 similarly fig 7 shows excellent agreement between the calculated and experimental data of bending moment the excellent agreement between the numerical model predictions and experimental results verifies the effectiveness of the established numerical model in this study the verified flac3d model was then used to analyze the lateral response of large diameter monopoles installed in three different sand profiles characterized with the soil parameters presented in table 3 the pile diameter varied from 2 to 8 m while the aspect ratio was maintained at 6 which is typical for monopiles used as foundation for offshore wind turbine the lateral load is applied to the pile section at 2 0 m above ground the calculated response from the numerical model are processed to establish the p y curves the initial modulus of subgrade reaction at the same depth for different pile diameters as well as initial modulus of the same pile diameter at different depths are derived from the p y curves eqs 9 and 10 are then used to normalize the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction 9 k x k 2 d x d 2 m 10 k y k 1 z y z 1 n where k 2 is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for d 2 m k x is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for any value of d x k 1 is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for depth 1 m below ground surface k y is the initial modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction for any depth z y the obtained results are presented in fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 displays the fitted curve of the exponent m that describe the effect of pile diameter on initial modulus for three different values of sand relative density it is noted from fig 8 that m 0 5 for piles in dense and medium dense sands and m 0 6 for loose sand represent the obtained results well fig 9 shows the fitted curve of exponential n that describe the depth effect on the initial modulus for piles installed in three different values of sand relative density fig 9 shows that n 0 5 0 6 and 0 65 are proposed for dense medium dense and loose sand respectively these observations are used to develop the modified equation for the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction as shown in table 4 3 2 degradation of the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction bhushan bhushan et al 1981a prakash prakash and kumar 1996 and kumar kumar et al 2006 studied the relation between the horizontal displacement and modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction has been investigated extensively it was found that the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction decreased as the pile horizontal displacement increased based on field tests of piles installed in sand with different relative density bhushan bhushan et al 1981a proposed a function to relate the initial modulus to the pile horizontal displacement under lateral load i e 11 n h n h 0 066 y 0 d 0 48 where n h is the constant of the degraded subgrade reaction due to horizontal displacement of the pile n h is the constant of the subgrade reaction defined by the sand relative density and angle of internal friction fig 3 y 0 is the pile horizontal displacement at groundline m 4 ultimate soil resistance as shown in fig 10 the horizontal soil resistance comprises two components normal soil reaction in front of pile and the ultimate frictional resistance along the pile side briaud and smith 1983 smith 1987 el naggar 2018 thus the ultimate soil resistance may be given by 12 p u f q where f is the ultimate horizontal frictional resistance kn m 1 q is the ultimate normal soil resistance kn m 1 f and q can be calculated by 13 f ξ τ max d 14 q η p max d 15 p max k p 2 γ z 16 τ max k 0 γ z tan δ where ξ and

earth pressure δ is 0 5 0 7 φ steel pipe pile or 1 0 φ bored pile of friction angle for the soil around pile el naggar 2018 kulhawy et al 1983 kulhawy and fang 1991 combining eqs 12 16 eq 17 is obtained as follows 17 p u ξ k 0 γ tan δ η k p 2 γ d z fig 11 compares the calculated soil resistance from eq 17 with the measured test values of barton and finn 1983 as well as those calculated employing the methods proposed by broms 1964 reese breton and moe 2009 and fleming fleming et al 1992 fig 11 shows that the calculated ultimate soil resistance values using eq 17 are in better agreement with the measured values than the other methods therefore eq 17 is used in the present study to calculate the ultimate horizontal soil resistance 5 proposed analytical method based on the assumptions stated previously and the results obtained from analysis described above the load displacement response of laterally loaded monopile can be schematically described in fig 12 and a nonlinear analytical method for the laterally loaded monopile is established correspondingly as shown in fig 12 three cases are considered for the soil resistance around the pile and its distribution along the shaft case 1 pile horizontal displacement is small and soil does not experience yield at any point along the shaft case 2 only soil above the rotation point experiences yield case 3 soil along the entire pile shaft experiences yield the details of all three cases and the corresponding analytical model aspects are discussed below 5 1 case 1 no soil yield the lateral load h 0 and bending moment m 0 are applied to the pile head and both are small such that the induced shear stress in the soil does not reach its ultimate resistance as shown in fig 12 a it is assumed that the horizontal displacement of pile at the mudline ground level is y 0 and the pile rotates about a point at t depth z x as shown in fig 12 a the horizontal displacement of the pile at any depth along its shaft is expressed by 18 y x z x y 0 since soil does not reach the ultimate state using the modified equation for determining the soil modulus along with the m and exponentials listed in table 4 and eq 18 the soil resistance at any depth can be expressed by 19 p k h y 0 066 n h z 0 d m 0 48 d 0 m z z 0 n x z x y 0 0 52 eq 19 can be simplified as 20 p n h y 0 0 52 x z z n x 21 n h 0 066 n h z 0 d m 0 48 d 0 m 1 z 0 n the horizontal force and bending moment equilibrium equations of the soil pile interaction are established as 22 h 0 0 l p d z h 0 c x l n 1 n 1 l n 2 n 2 0 23 m 0 0 l p z d z m 0 c x l n 2 n 2 l n 3 n 3 0 where c n h y 0 0 52 x in the above formulas by solving eqs 22 and 23 the horizontal displacement y 0 and the depth x of the rotation point can be obtained the response of laterally loaded pile at any depth can be then calculated consequently the soil resistance and horizontal displacement and bending moment of pile can be determined at any depth 5 2 case 2 partial soil yield the lateral load h 0 and m 0 at pile head reach such certain levels such that the shear stresses in the soil above the rotation point of pile approaches its ultimate resistance as shown in fig 12 b denoting the depth at which soil reaches its ultimate resistance z a the horizontal soil resistance can be expressed as 24 p p u ξ k 0 γ tan δ η k p 2 γ d z m h z 0 z a 25 p k h y n h y 0 0 52 x z z n x a z l at the depth z a the soil resistance reaches its ultimate value therefore eqs 24 and 25 are equal at z a and correspondingly the depth to rotation point x can be determined by 26 x n h y 0 0 52 a n n h y 0 0 52 a n 1 m h accordingly the horizontal force and bending moment equilibrium equations are given by 27 h 0 1 2 m h a 2 c x l n 1 a n 1 n 1 l n 2 a n 2 n 2 0 28 m 0 1 3 m h a 3 c x

case 3 limitation of soil yield when the lateral load h 0 and bending moment m 0 at the pile are large enough the shear stresses reach the ultimate soil resistance both above and below the rotation point as shown in fig 12 c consequently the depth of soil yield above the rotation is z a while the depth of soil yield below the rotation point is z t for this loading condition the pile horizontal displacement is very large and is unsafe for the supported structure and this state is defined as limitation of yield the soil resistance along the pile shaft is given by 29 p p u ξ k 0 γ tan δ η k p

force and bending moment for the no yield partial yield and limitation of yield are encoded in matlab program to iteratively consider the appropriate state based on the loading level and soil conditions the flowchart of the calculation procedure is shown in fig 13 6 verification and comparison for the proposed analytical method in order to verify the developed method it is applied to analyze field pile tests bhushan et al 1981b centrifugal model tests of piles georgiadis et al 1992 and model pile tests zhu et al 2015 the calculated responses are compared with experimental observations as well as the predictions of an analytical method zhang 2009 p y curve methods murchison et al 1984 and api american petroleum institute 2014 and hardening p y curve method zhu et al 2015 6 1 case study 1 field tests bhushan et al 1981b carried out field tests with seven full scale bored piles with diameter varying from 0 61 to 1 22 m and embedded depth of 5 2 m and 5 5 m test piles 4 and 5 and test piles 6 and 7 were installed in sites b and c respectively for test piles 4 and 5 d 0 61 m and 0 91 m and the embedment length l 5 2 m the top soil layer of site b was 0 9 m thick silty sand was followed by a gravelly layer 4 3 m thick the unit weight of the both soil layers was 16 5 kn m 3 the angle of internal friction φ 36 and 42 for top and bottom layers respectively in both analytical models i e zhang 2009 and present approximate φ 40 was used for both layers test piles 6 and 7 were installed in site c and had d 0 91 m and 1 22 m respectively their embedment depth l 5 5 m site c also contained two soil layers top layer was 1 8 m thick comprised silty sand underlain by a gravelly layer 3 7 m thick the unit weight of both layers was 16 5 kn m 3 their angles of internal friction φ 36 and 42 respectively an approximate φ 38 was used in the analytical model zhang 2009 for both layers fig 14 and fig 15 compare the predictions of the present model with both the zhang model and experimental observations for test piles 4 and 5 and piles 6 and 7 respectively figs 14 and 15 show that excellent agreement exists between the calculated groundline horizontal displacement from the present model and the measured response on the other hand the zhang model provide acceptable predictions when the displacement is less than 5 mm as the horizontal displacement increases more than 5 mm the predictions of the zhang model diverge from the measured response and that calculated from the present solution this is because the present method accounts for the pile diameter effect on the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction while the zhang method does not the calculated depth of pile rotation point using the zhang model is about 3 94 m for piles 4 and 5 which is about 0 75 l for piles 6 and 7 the calculated depth of rotation point is about 4 2 m which is equal to 0 76l the present method predicts the rotation point for piles 4 5 6 and 6 to be 0 71l 3 74 m 0 72l 3 89 m 0 71l and 4 06 m 0 74l the maximum difference in calculated values from both models is less than 7 6 2 case study 2 centrifugal tests georgiadis et al 1992 conducted centrifuge model tests with a pile diameter of 24 47 mm and a pile length of 181 mm with the scaling factor of 50 g the prototype pile diameter was 1 224 m and the embedment length was 9 05 m the unit weight of soil was 16 3 kn m 3 and its φ 36 the present non linear analysis method is used to calculate the pile head displacement under lateral load and the results are compared with the measured response as well as that calculated using the api p y curve method and murchinson o neil method murchison et al 1984 as shown in fig 16 as can be noted from fig 16 both the api and the murchinson o neil methods overestimate the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction and consequently underestimate the horizontal displacements because these methods do not account for the effect of pile diameter on the other hand the calculated results using the present method are in good agreement with the experimental measurements for displacement greater than 50 mm the maximum difference between the calculated responses from the present model and the experimental results is less than 20 6 3 case study 3 model tests zhu et al 2015 conducted six lateral load 1 g model tests to simulate a monopile foundation for offshore wind turbine with an aspect ratio of 5 5 the buried depth was 0 915 m and the pile diameter was 0 165 m the soil saturated unit weight was 18 8 kn m 3and its relative density was 70 a hardening p y curve model was developed based on the results of the model tests fig 17 compares the calculated response from the present model with the measured response as well as the responses calculated using the hardening p y model considering the rotation point at 0 75l 0 8l or 0 85l the lateral load versus groundline displacement are also predicted in fig 17 by using this current method it is noted from fig 17 that the predictions of the present model agree well with the measured data meanwhile ss the groundline displacement increased the predictions of the hardening p y curve model divert from the test results with maximum error of 60 0 85l and 80 0 8l and 112 0 75l this is because the hardening p y curve model does not account for the yield state of soil around the pile or the degradation of the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction on the other hand the proposed model accounts for both phenomena as the horizontal displacement level increases 7 parametric study for the proposed analytical method monopile foundations of offshore wind turbines experience rigid body rotation under lateral loading conditions in order to explore the variation of rotation point depth the proposed nonlinear analysis method is used to calculate the depth of rotation point of laterally loaded monopile considering important design parameters including load eccentricity m 0 h 0 pile diameter d and aspect ratio l d the soil and pile parameters considered in the analysis are φ 35 and unit weight 18 kn m 3 d ranges from 4 m to 9 m and l d varies from 4 to 8 the lateral force h 0 2 mn and the load eccentricity m 0 h 0 is varied from 0 to 120 m the calculated results are presented in fig 18 and fig 19 fig 18 shows the variation of the depth of point of rotation with load eccentricity as expected the rotation point moves upward as the load eccentricity increases however the depth of rotation point plateaus at approximately 0 62l when the load eccentricity exceeds 100 it is also noted from fig 18 that the ratio of depth of point of rotation to pile length l 0 l increases as d increases and for the range of problem parameters considered herein varies between 0 62l and 0 73l fig 19 displays the variation of l 0 l with of the pile aspect ratio l d it is noted from fig 19 that l 0 l as pile diameter increases and as l d increases for the range of d and l d considered in this analysis l 0 l varies between 0 65l and 0 69l finally inspecting figs 18 and 19 it can be concluded that load eccentricity has a more significant effect on depth of rotation point than l d 8 conclusions a modification is introduced to the equation used to calculate horizontal subgrade reaction modulus of sand accounting for effect of pile diameter furthermore the proposed equation can account for horizontal subgrade modulus degradation as pile displacement increases consequently an analytical method is developed for calculating the response of laterally loaded monopile installed in sand considering the effects of sand compactness pile diameter and degradation of soil stiffness the developed model is incorporated into a matlab code that can consider different states of stress within the soil the performance of the developed method was verified by comparing its predictions with testing results of full scale piles centrifuge model piles and 1 g model piles as well as available analytical models for lateral response analysis the verified model was then used to conduct a parametric study to evaluate the influence of load eccentricity m 0 h 0 pile diameter d and aspect ratio l d on depth of rotation point l 0 the following conclusions may be drawn based on the results of the study 1 this proposed method for calculating the modulus of horizontal subgrade reaction accounts reasonably well for the effect of pile diameter on the reaction modulus and stress strain characteristics of soil near the pile 2 the excellent agreement between the predictions of the proposed analytical model and experimental results verifies its suitability for applications to analysis and design of large diameter monopiles used as foundations for offshore wind turbines 3 for large diameter piles the predictions of the proposed model are more accurate than those obtained from existing methods e g zhang model api p y curve method p y curve method of o neil and hardening p y curve of zhu 4 for rigid monopiles installed in sand and subjected to lateral load the rotation point is at a depth of approximately 0 62l 0 73l 5 the depth of monopile rotation point increases as pile diameter d and as aspect ratio l d increase 6 the load eccentricity m 0 h 0 has a significant effect on the depth of monopile rotation point up to 100 after which its effect is marginal credit

21517,the recovery of underwater vehicles using a pneumatic inflatable collar provides an economical approach to the re use of the vehicles and or collar however limited high fidelity numerical studies have been conducted to examine this approach accordingly in this study a multi disciplinary co simulation is conducted the results show helical floating processes exhibiting random rolling and yawing motions with the mechanisms stated as follows a a symmetric flow around the vehicle collar conjunction body is generated owing to a small incidence angle b symmetric vortex pairs are generated on the leeside of the conjunction body owing to the inflation of the collar acting as a source c an accelerated pitching angular rotation suppresses the detached vortices on the leeside of the airbag to be attached pairs and asymmetric vortices are shed from the tail fins d the deceleration of the pitching motion induced by the damping of water results in the formation of a detached horse shoe vortex and the horse shoe vortex forms two detached vortices which flow downstream and interact with the asymmetric tail fin vortices and e the rolling and yawing motions of the conjunction body intensify the asymmetric characteristics of the collar and tail fin vortices augmenting the pitching and rolling motions and inducing the helical floating process in general the pitching angular velocity induced by the collar inflation governs the mechanisms for the evolutionary processes of flow patterns and determines the floating process keywords underwater vehicle recovery pneumatic inflatable collar helical floating process multi disciplinary co simulation random rolling and yawing mechanism 1 introduction different recovery techniques have been developed for the economical re use of underwater vehicles such as explorers and exercise torpedoes by generating a positive buoyant force for the successful recovery of these vehicles such as load emission after a cruising process or exercise section stretching or pneumatic airbag inflation currie et al 2014 prats et al 2012 yakimenko et al 2008 generally the load emission method is not applicable to modern exercise torpedoes owing to requirements for instruments in the inner spaces of the torpedoes in addition load emission cannot increase the buoyant force of the torpedo thus for torpedoes with negative buoyant forces a relatively small positive buoyant force is obtained the exercise section stretching method employs two pieces of shells for stretching thereby restricting the inner space for instruments also the limitation of the stretching length confines the magnitude of the positive buoyant force with the increases in the magnitude of the negative buoyant forces of torpedoes pneumatic airbag inflation procedures have also been developed for upward floating techniques these are widely employed for modern torpedoes such as mk54 mu90 and yc3t 80 compared to the traditional methods pneumatic airbag inflation can generate a relatively larger magnitude of a positive buoyant force with a smaller reservation space moreover it provides safe reliable and stable performance with a relatively small shock to the buoyant forces along with convenience in debugging employing repair and reutilisation making it the preferred approach to exercise torpedo recovery in the published literature experimental studies have usually been employed lv 2005 to investigate the impacts of the initial incidence angle cruise depth cruise velocity airbag volume etc on the upward floating characteristics of an exercise torpedo for example chunyu li li et al 2008 tested the fairing safety release of a rising device for torpedo recovery sharp k et al sharp et al 2001 optimised a launch recovery system and employed a modified vehicle in cocoon deployment and recovery technique for large vehicle systems however experimental studies are confined by the test field and test instruments moreover the processing costs for exercise torpedoes are also relatively high and exercise torpedoes can fall if insufficient buoyant forces are generated in addition security issues have been found to occur during the test process thus there is an urgent need for numerical simulations to capture the upward floating process induced by an inflatable pneumatic airbag collar there should be accurate simulation of the airbag collar expansion process and the fluid forces induced by the torpedo parts and airbag collar expansion as well as a six degree of freedom 6dof calculation for torpedo floating owing to complexities in large dimension grid deformations and the large displacements in torpedo motion limited numerical literature is available on this topic thus the most recent related studies on pneumatic airbag inflation cfd 6dof and cfd deforming mesh will be referred to separately as follows the ls dyna software is usually selected for the explicit analysis of airbag inflation and soft landings owing to its featured functions in regard to airbag analysis for example ls dyna was employed to validate the results of calculations by abaqus explicit for the soft landing analysis of a lunar lander spacecraft under three loading cases by guang zheng et al 2018 lei chen et al 2014 extended an explicit non uniform rational basis spline based isogeometric framework for thin elements in shell membrane structures to allow for finite membrane stretching as well as for large deflections and bending strains in the present study ls dyna is used to model the underwater airbag inflation

li et al 2018a simulated multi fin kinematics and hydrodynamics in steady swimming pufferfish by using deforming prism tetrahedron meshes andrew j brune et al 2016 conducted an uncertainty analysis for the fsi of a deformable hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator with unstructured meshes the methods employed in the relevant research are listed as shown in table 1 in the appendix in this study it is necessary to solve for the coupling motions of large local deformations and rigid body motions 6dof simultaneously so as to provide a reference for the engineering design of the floating recovery of the vehicle meanwhile for a highly accurate simulation based on unsteady navier stokes equations it is recommended to use a fully whole computational fluid zone and to avoid interfacing techniques among different fluid zones in addition a structured mesh around body is suggested for a high resolution of the body geometry in the present study an inflatable airbag collar is selected for producing a positive buoyant force for underwater vehicle recovery and an accurate numerical simulation method is developed for simulating the floating process of the vehicle in still water the difficulties to overcome are as follows 1 mesh distortions or negative volume problems induced by large scale local surface mesh displacements during airbag inflation where the maximum total displacement magnitude is on the order of the vehicle diameter 2 large 6dof motions induced by vehicle motions including translational and rotational motions and 3 the need to employ structured meshes around the vehicle for an accurate simulation while avoiding any interface techniques in the cfd computation to address these problems a practical and applicable calculation procedure is designed the floating process of a torpedo like underwater vehicle is studied and the mechanisms of the floating process are discussed 2 computational framework 2 1 calculation procedure the flow chart for the loosely coupled 6dof cfd simulation is illustrated in fig 1 the underwater vehicle recovery is realized by the inflation of an airbag collar to generate a positive buoyant force the rigid body motion is calculated at each time step to simulate the free motion of the vehicle under water the underwater airbag inflation is calculated independently using ls dyna in the present study the time history of the inflation volume is referred to as airbag volume increment in section 2 2 which describes the inflation displacements of each surface mesh node on the airbag in section 2 3 after mesh smoothing and remeshing navier stokes equations are solved to obtain forces exerted on the vehicle and airbag a 6dof solver is then used to calculate the angular acceleration values and translational acceleration values when the vehicle is evidently flowing upward the simulation is terminated an in house 6dof solver is developed and integrated into ansys fluent as a user defined function udf further details on meshing strategy cfd methodology and 6dof equations are discussed in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 respectively 2 2 airbag volume increment the time history of the airbag volume is calculated using ls dyna for example when the vehicle is 20 m underwater and given an initial total pressure of 35 mpa in a 1 4 l bottle the inflation process is presented as shown in fig 2 the airbag nearly expanded to a body of revolution the two separated parts are the shields around the airbag the time histories of airbag volumes for different initial total pressure cases in a 1 4 l bottle under a 20 m depth are plotted in fig 3 thus by referring to the volume values between two steps the volume increments can be obtained 2 3 airbag inflation by carefully examining the airbag configuration it can be seen that small pits would occur during the inflation process these small pits may not evidently influence the inflation process but for mesh deformation during cfd analysis where the first grid layer thickness is usually on the order of 10 5 m these pits could distort the mesh around the airbag they might even cause negative mesh element volume to occur thereby terminating the calculation thus the inflation shape is simplified as a body of revolving arcs as shown in fig 4 for every volume value the circular centre coordinates o and the radius of the arc o c can be calculated the revolving axis is taken as the body axis of the vehicle the coordinates of every mesh node on the airbag surface during airbag inflation are calculated by keeping their arclength ratios constant during deformation as depicted in fig 5 for example node n is updated to be n node e is updated to be e and node m is updated to be m whereas their arclength ratios are the same c n c n d c n c n d after calculating the node displacement vectors n n e e m m etc the node coordinates are updated then mesh smoothing can be conducted 2 4 mesh deformation and remeshing different deformation techniques have been proposed such as transfinite interpolation eriksson 1982 delaunay mapping liu et al 2006 spring analogy blom 2000 and linear elastic solids to account for the large scale deformation in pneumatic collar inflation a linearly elastic solid model is adopted for mesh smoothing the mesh motion is governed by a set of equations as follows 1 σ y 0 σ y λ t r ε y i 2 μ ε y ε y 1 2 y y t here σ is the stress tensor ε is the strain tensor and y is the grid displacement for the 6dof solution only the ratio between the shear modulus μ and lamé s first parameter λ matters this ratio is parameterised through poisson s ratio as follows 2 v 1 2 1 μ λ in the present study the value of v is set as 0 45 a hanging node adaption procedure is used for local remeshing to delete negative volume mesh elements and improve the mesh quality 2 5 reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with respect to dynamic meshes the integral form of the conservation equation for a general scalar φ on an arbitrary control volume v whose boundary is moving can be written as follows 3 d d t v ρ φ d v v ρ φ u u g d a 0 in the above ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity vector u g is the mesh velocity of the moving mesh and v is used to represent the boundary of the control volume v in the present study the transition shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter et al 2006 is selected to account for the flow unsteadiness induced by the adverse pressure gradients from the blunt bodies of the vehicle and pneumatic inflatable collar and the flow transition effect the turbulence kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω are obtained from transport equations as follows 4 ρ k t x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k ρ ω t x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω the transport equation for the intermittency γ is defined as follows 5 ρ γ t x j ρ u j γ p γ 1 e γ 1 p γ 2 e γ 2 x j μ μ t γ x j the transport equation for the transition momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t is as follows 6 r e θ t t ρ u j r e θ t x j p θ t x j σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t x j the transition model interacts with the sst turbulence model by modification of the k equation as follows 7 ρ k t x j ρ k u j p k d k x j μ σ k μ t k x j for an incompressible water flow the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent scheme is used for the velocity pressure coupling and the momentum and turbulence equations are all discretised using a second order upwind scheme a second order implicit time marching scheme is selected for unsteady simulations 2 6 six degree of freedom 6dof equations the 6dof solver uses the object s forces and moments to compute the translational and angular motion of the centre of mass of the vehicle the governing equation for the translational motion of the centre of gravity is solved for in the inertial coordinate system as follows 8 v m 1 m f m in the above v m is the translational motion of the centre of mass m is the mass and f m is the force vector induced by the cross flow buoyant effect and gravity the angular motion of the object ω is computed using body coordinates as follows 9 ω l 1 m b ω l ω b here l is the inertia tensor m b is the moment vector of the body and ω b is the rigid body angular velocity vector the moments are transformed from earth coordinates to body coordinates as follows 10 m b r m e r is the transformation matrix and is determined as follows r cos θ cos ψ sin θ cos θ sin ψ sin θ cos ψ cos ϕ sin ψ sin ϕ c o s θ c o s ϕ s i n θ sin ψ c o s ϕ cos ψ s i n ϕ s i n θ c o s ψ sin ϕ s i

length of the vehicle is l the diameter is d the axial range of the airbag zone and the mass centre location is shown the buoyant centre of the airbag is evidently closer to the vehicle warhead than it is to the mass centre mixed hexahedron pyramid tetrahedron meshes are generated for this model as shown in fig 7 the dimensions of the cuboid computational zone are 280 m 160 m 120 m and the zone is filled with water the vehicle is placed at a height h from the upper surface of the computational zone mimicking the underwater depth structured hexahedron meshes are generated around the vehicle and the first grid layer thickness is set as 5 10 6 m satisfying the demand of y 1 in the transition sst turbulence model the stretching ratio of the grid layer thickness normal to the vehicle surface is set to be 1 1 so as to well capture the wall bounded flow characteristics in the present study the hexahedron pyramid meshes act as the 6dof motion with the vehicle and the local airbag inflation deforms the airbag surface mesh after the airbag surface mesh deformation the mesh smoothing and local cell remeshing are employed cross sectional views of mixed meshes at the z 0 plane at different times are presented in fig 8 the time histories of the mass centre and euler angles and the control effects and control mechanisms of airbag inflation on the floating process are discussed below 3 2 floating process at different incidence angles the time histories of airbag inflation are different for different water depths as shown in fig 9 with an increase of the water depth the hydrostatic pressure also increases inducing a slower inflation process the floating processes of the vehicle are computed for a 50 m depth and different initial pitch angles i e 5 0 4 5 4 0 3 5 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 the floating process can be roughly divided into two processes a a direct pitching up and upward floating process which emerges at initial pitch angles in the range 5 0 3 0 and b a pitching down and diving process followed by a pitching up and upward floating process which occurs at initial pitch angles in the range 3 5 5 0 the mass centre histories at the initial pitch angles of 5 0 3 5 and 5 0 are shown in fig 10 by examining the group of figures it can be seen that the x component of the mass centre displacement is limited with the decrease of the derivative value of the longitudinal x component the vertical y component and lateral z component evidently increase and a helical upward floating motion is seen from fig 10 it can be seen that in the time range 0 0 s 1 75 s the pitching angle varies sharply with time in contrast the rolling or yawing angles vary smoothly with time as the time exceeds 1 75 s the pitching angle is approximately 50 and evident variations in the rolling or yawing angles with time are observed the reason for this phenomenon will be discussed below the typical upward floating processes from a 5 0 initial pitch angle are plotted in fig 11 the vehicle first exhibits a diving motion as the upward force is smaller than the downward force with the inflation of the airbag the buoyant force increases inducing a gradually increased pitch up moment when the pitch angle exceeds 0 the fluid dynamic force provided by the water flow will lift thus the downward acceleration is reduced and the vehicle continuously pitches up when the total net force asserted on vehicle becomes upward the vehicle accelerates to move upward the pitching angle increases to approach a vertical state and then continually pitches backward a typical upward floating process from a 5 0 initial pitch angle is plotted in fig 12 the difference between the 5 0 and 5 0 initial pitch angle cases is that in the latter the water lift is large enough to overcome gravity thus the up floating and pitching up motion occurs directly in the 5 0 case this motion process is similar to the up floating process in the 5 0 case 3 3 discussion of floating process the time histories plotted in fig 10 illustrate the results of the fluid dynamic forces asserted on the conjunction body of the airbag and vehicle to shed light on fluid the dynamic forces typical surface pressure contours at different times are plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 for 5 0 and 5 0 initial pitch angles respectively from fig 13 it can be seen that the surface pressure contours are symmetric about the z 0 plane at t 0 075 s and 0 65 s then pressure contour asymmetry is observed at the tail fin and after body at t 1 00 s the range of the flow asymmetry enlarges from the tail fin to the body of vehicle t 1 40 s and then a rolling and yawing motion is induced t 2 00 s after t 2 00 s the pressure contours are wholly asymmetric indicating that the leeside flows are fully unsteady the rolling and yawing motion further amplifies the flow unsteadiness on the leeward side of vehicle airbag conjunction body a fully unsteady flow is formed and the rolling and yawing motions are intensified t 2 00 s and 3 00 s the pressure contours at t 0 075 s are symmetric about the z 0 plane whereas at t 0 60 s the leeward pressure contours are evidently asymmetric near the airbag this asymmetric flow propagates to the tail fin and aft body of the vehicle t 1 15 s inducing the rolling and yawing motion of the vehicle the subsequent processes t 2 00 s 2 55 s and 3 25 s are similar to those of the 5 case to provide insights into the rolling and yawing motion of the vehicle airbag conjunction body the angular velocity components at initial pitch angles of 5 0 and 5 0 are plotted as shown in fig 15 it is seen from these figures that for the 5 0 case a sharp increase of the pitch angular velocity occurs at 0 20 s and a discernible rolling and yawing angular velocity occurs after 0 65 s for the 5 0 case a sharp increase of the pitch angular velocity occurs directly at the start of motion and the discernible rolling and yawing angular velocity occur after 0 60 s the delayed occurrence of the discernible rolling and yawing angular velocity is owing to the delayed occurrence of the asymmetric pressure distributions relative to symmetric pressure distributions the total forces asserted on the vehicle airbag conjunction body can be divided into body forces and fluid dynamic forces the body forces include the time invariant gravity of the conjunction body and the time variant buoyant force as determined by the airbag volume curves plotted in fig 9 the fluid dynamic forces are induced by the motion of the conjunction body as well as the inflation of the airbag to provide deeper insight into the mechanisms in the variation of the fluid dynamic forces spatial streamlines are plotted in fig 16 corresponding to the initial pitch angle of 5 0 it is seen from fig 16 that at t 0 the vehicle moves at a 0 incidence angle it will move downstream as the total force is downward the downward motion is not only dampened by the water but also by the inflation of the airbag the inflating airbag acts similar to that of a source i e it pushes the surrounding water around this source effect makes the virtual thickness of the airbag configuration much larger resulting in the increase of its camber when the camber of the airbag configuration is relatively small the flow across it is smooth without separation at t 0 075 s the pitching angular velocity is small and the vertical translational speed is also very small thus the flow pattern is symmetric about the z 0 plane at t 0 20 s the inflating airbag source generates a larger pitching up moment but the incidence angle is relatively small and the camber of virtual airbag configuration is not large enough to generate flow separation thus the flow patterns are also symmetric about the z 0 plane at t 0 40 s the camber increases and generates symmetric separating vortex pairs on the leeside of vehicle airbag conjunction body that flow downstream at these three time points the pitching angular velocity has not generated vortex shedding from the tail fins thus the flow patterns are determined by the translational motion at t 0 65 s asymmetric detached vortices are shed from the tail fins owing to the sufficiently large pitching angular velocity this accelerated pitching angular velocity suppresses the detached vortices on the leeside of airbag to be attached pairs as the time increases to 1 00 s the flow patterns are similar but the flow asymmetry has introduced a rolling and yawing angular velocity thus the flow asymmetry is observed on the vehicle head and airbag the suppression effort on the vortex pairs on the leeside of the airbag can be sustained until the pitching angular velocity is evidently decelerated at t 1 40 s the pitching angular velocity is evidently decelerated owing to the water damping induced by the pitching motion accordingly the attached vortex pairs separate from the airbag surface forming a horse shoe vortex levchenya et al 2010 this horse shoe vortex pair interacts with the asymmetry vortices shed from the tail fins as they shed downstream the horse shoe vortex pair disappears and only the two separated vortices on the leeside of the airbag can be seen owing to the rolling and yawing motion of the conjunction body as well as the unsteady asymmetric influence of the tail fin vortices the leeward vortices retain their asymmetry producing rolling and yawing motions during the floating process t 2 00 s 2 35 s and 3 00 s in the present study the pitching angular velocity governs the mechanisms for the evolutionary processes of the flow patterns and the mechanisms discussed for the 5 0 case are applicable to different initial pitch angles 4 concluding remarks based on structured meshes around a conjunction body a high fidelity multi disciplinary co simulation without any interface techniques was conducted for the floating process of an underwater vehicle as induced by pneumatic collar inflation time history curves are presented to depict the floating process of the underwater vehicle as induced by the pneumatic collar inflation it is found that a helical up floating motion is the final result from different initial pitch angles the mechanisms for the random rolling and yawing motion are as follows a a symmetric flow around the vehicle collar conjunction body is generated owing to small incidence angle as determined by the initial translational velocity and small vertical velocity during the moving process b the inflation of the collar acts similarly to a source for enlarging the camber of the collar configuration generating symmetric vortex pairs on the leeside of the conjunction body c the accelerated pitching angular rotation resulting from the collar inflation suppresses the detached vortices on the leeside of the airbag to be attached pairs and asymmetric vortices are shed from the tail fins d with the increase of the pitching angular velocities to certain values the water damping becomes large enough to decelerate the pitching motion resulting in the formation of a detached horse shoe vortex and the horse shoe vortex forms two detached vortices as they flow downstream and interact with the asymmetric tail fin vortices and e the rolling and yawing motions of the conjunction body result from the asymmetric flow crossing the conjunction body and these motions intensify the asymmetrical characteristics of the collar vortices and tail fin vortices thereby augmenting the pitching and rolling motion and inducing a helical floating process in general the collar inflation produces a pitching angular velocity and then the flow pattern evolves from symmetric to asymmetric resulting in the helical floating process author s contribution huixue dang be responsible for the

intensify the asymmetric characteristics of the collar and tail fin vortices augmenting the pitching and rolling motions and inducing the helical floating process in general the pitching angular velocity induced by the collar inflation governs the mechanisms for the evolutionary processes of flow patterns and determines the floating process keywords underwater vehicle recovery pneumatic inflatable collar helical floating process multi disciplinary co simulation random rolling and yawing mechanism 1 introduction different recovery techniques have been developed for the economical re use of underwater vehicles such as explorers and exercise torpedoes by generating a positive buoyant force for the successful recovery of these vehicles such as load emission after a cruising process or exercise section stretching or pneumatic airbag inflation currie et al 2014 prats et al 2012 yakimenko et al 2008 generally the load emission method is not applicable to modern exercise torpedoes owing to requirements for instruments in the inner spaces of the torpedoes in addition load emission cannot increase the buoyant force of the torpedo thus for torpedoes with negative buoyant forces a relatively small positive buoyant force is obtained the exercise section stretching method employs two pieces of shells for stretching thereby restricting the inner space for instruments also the limitation of the stretching length confines the magnitude of the positive buoyant force with the increases in the magnitude of the negative buoyant forces of torpedoes pneumatic airbag inflation procedures have also been developed for upward floating techniques these are widely employed for modern torpedoes such as mk54 mu90 and yc3t 80 compared to the traditional methods pneumatic airbag inflation can generate a relatively larger magnitude of a positive buoyant force with a smaller reservation space moreover it provides safe reliable and stable performance with a relatively small shock to the buoyant forces along with convenience in debugging employing repair and reutilisation making it the preferred approach to exercise torpedo recovery in the published literature experimental studies have usually been employed lv 2005 to investigate the impacts of the initial incidence angle cruise depth cruise velocity airbag volume etc on the upward floating characteristics of an exercise torpedo for example chunyu li li et al 2008 tested the fairing safety release of a rising device for torpedo recovery sharp k et al sharp et al 2001 optimised a launch recovery system and employed a modified vehicle in cocoon deployment and recovery technique for large vehicle systems however experimental studies are confined by the test field and test instruments moreover the processing costs for exercise torpedoes are also relatively high and exercise torpedoes can fall if insufficient buoyant forces are generated in addition security issues have been found to occur during the test process thus there is an urgent need for numerical simulations to capture the upward floating process induced by an inflatable pneumatic airbag collar there should be accurate simulation of the airbag collar expansion process and the fluid forces induced by the torpedo parts and airbag collar expansion as well as a six degree of freedom 6dof calculation for torpedo floating owing to complexities in large dimension grid deformations and the large displacements in torpedo motion limited numerical literature is available on this topic thus the most recent related studies on pneumatic airbag inflation cfd 6dof and cfd deforming mesh will be referred to separately as follows the ls dyna software is usually selected for the explicit analysis of airbag inflation and soft landings owing to its featured functions in regard to airbag analysis for example ls dyna was employed to validate the results of calculations by abaqus explicit for the soft landing analysis of a lunar lander spacecraft under three loading cases by guang zheng et al 2018 lei chen et al 2014 extended an explicit non uniform rational basis spline based isogeometric framework for thin elements in shell membrane structures to allow for finite membrane stretching as well as for large deflections and bending strains in the present study ls dyna is used to model the underwater airbag inflation

li et al 2018a simulated multi fin kinematics and hydrodynamics in steady swimming pufferfish by using deforming prism tetrahedron meshes andrew j brune et al 2016 conducted an uncertainty analysis for the fsi of a deformable hypersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator with unstructured meshes the methods employed in the relevant research are listed as shown in table 1 in the appendix in this study it is necessary to solve for the coupling motions of large local deformations and rigid body motions 6dof simultaneously so as to provide a reference for the engineering design of the floating recovery of the vehicle meanwhile for a highly accurate simulation based on unsteady navier stokes equations it is recommended to use a fully whole computational fluid zone and to avoid interfacing techniques among different fluid zones in addition a structured mesh around body is suggested for a high resolution of the body geometry in the present study an inflatable airbag collar is selected for producing a positive buoyant force for underwater vehicle recovery and an accurate numerical simulation method is developed for simulating the floating process of the vehicle in still water the difficulties to overcome are as follows 1 mesh distortions or negative volume problems induced by large scale local surface mesh displacements during airbag inflation where the maximum total displacement magnitude is on the order of the vehicle diameter 2 large 6dof motions induced by vehicle motions including translational and rotational motions and 3 the need to employ structured meshes around the vehicle for an accurate simulation while avoiding any interface techniques in the cfd computation to address these problems a practical and applicable calculation procedure is designed the floating process of a torpedo like underwater vehicle is studied and the mechanisms of the floating process are discussed 2 computational framework 2 1 calculation procedure the flow chart for the loosely coupled 6dof cfd simulation is illustrated in fig 1 the underwater vehicle recovery is realized by the inflation of an airbag collar to generate a positive buoyant force the rigid body motion is calculated at each time step to simulate the free motion of the vehicle under water the underwater airbag inflation is calculated independently using ls dyna in the present study the time history of the inflation volume is referred to as airbag volume increment in section 2 2 which describes the inflation displacements of each surface mesh node on the airbag in section 2 3 after mesh smoothing and remeshing navier stokes equations are solved to obtain forces exerted on the vehicle and airbag a 6dof solver is then used to calculate the angular acceleration values and translational acceleration values when the vehicle is evidently flowing upward the simulation is terminated an in house 6dof solver is developed and integrated into ansys fluent as a user defined function udf further details on meshing strategy cfd methodology and 6dof equations are discussed in section 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 respectively 2 2 airbag volume increment the time history of the airbag volume is calculated using ls dyna for example when the vehicle is 20 m underwater and given an initial total pressure of 35 mpa in a 1 4 l bottle the inflation process is presented as shown in fig 2 the airbag nearly expanded to a body of revolution the two separated parts are the shields around the airbag the time histories of airbag volumes for different initial total pressure cases in a 1 4 l bottle under a 20 m depth are plotted in fig 3 thus by referring to the volume values between two steps the volume increments can be obtained 2 3 airbag inflation by carefully examining the airbag configuration it can be seen that small pits would occur during the inflation process these small pits may not evidently influence the inflation process but for mesh deformation during cfd analysis where the first grid layer thickness is usually on the order of 10 5 m these pits could distort the mesh around the airbag they might even cause negative mesh element volume to occur thereby terminating the calculation thus the inflation shape is simplified as a body of revolving arcs as shown in fig 4 for every volume value the circular centre coordinates o and the radius of the arc o c can be calculated the revolving axis is taken as the body axis of the vehicle the coordinates of every mesh node on the airbag surface during airbag inflation are calculated by keeping their arclength ratios constant during deformation as depicted in fig 5 for example node n is updated to be n node e is updated to be e and node m is updated to be m whereas their arclength ratios are the same c n c n d c n c n d after calculating the node displacement vectors n n e e m m etc the node coordinates are updated then mesh smoothing can be conducted 2 4 mesh deformation and remeshing different deformation techniques have been proposed such as transfinite interpolation eriksson 1982 delaunay mapping liu et al 2006 spring analogy blom 2000 and linear elastic solids to account for the large scale deformation in pneumatic collar inflation a linearly elastic solid model is adopted for mesh smoothing the mesh motion is governed by a set of equations as follows 1 σ y 0 σ y λ t r ε y i 2 μ ε y ε y 1 2 y y t here σ is the stress tensor ε is the strain tensor and y is the grid displacement for the 6dof solution only the ratio between the shear modulus μ and lamé s first parameter λ matters this ratio is parameterised through poisson s ratio as follows 2 v 1 2 1 μ λ in the present study the value of v is set as 0 45 a hanging node adaption procedure is used for local remeshing to delete negative volume mesh elements and improve the mesh quality 2 5 reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations with respect to dynamic meshes the integral form of the conservation equation for a general scalar φ on an arbitrary control volume v whose boundary is moving can be written as follows 3 d d t v ρ φ d v v ρ φ u u g d a 0 in the above ρ is the fluid density u is the flow velocity vector u g is the mesh velocity of the moving mesh and v is used to represent the boundary of the control volume v in the present study the transition shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model menter et al 2006 is selected to account for the flow unsteadiness induced by the adverse pressure gradients from the blunt bodies of the vehicle and pneumatic inflatable collar and the flow transition effect the turbulence kinetic energy k and the specific dissipation rate ω are obtained from transport equations as follows 4 ρ k t x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k ρ ω t x i ρ ω u i x j γ ω ω x j g ω y ω d ω the transport equation for the intermittency γ is defined as follows 5 ρ γ t x j ρ u j γ p γ 1 e γ 1 p γ 2 e γ 2 x j μ μ t γ x j the transport equation for the transition momentum

equation as follows 7 ρ k t x j ρ k u j p k d k x j μ σ k μ t k x j for an incompressible water flow the semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent scheme is used for the velocity pressure coupling and the momentum and turbulence equations are all discretised using a second order upwind scheme a second order implicit time marching scheme is selected for unsteady simulations 2 6 six degree of freedom 6dof equations the 6dof solver uses the object s forces and moments to compute the translational and angular motion of the centre of mass of the vehicle the governing equation for the translational motion of the centre of gravity is solved for in the inertial coordinate system as follows 8 v m 1 m f m in the above v m is the translational motion of the centre of mass m is the mass and f m is the force vector induced by the cross flow buoyant effect and gravity the angular motion of the object ω is computed using body coordinates as follows 9 ω l 1 m b ω l ω b here l is the inertia tensor m b is the moment vector of the body and ω b is the rigid body angular velocity vector the moments are transformed from earth coordinates to body coordinates as follows 10 m b r m e

length of the vehicle is l the diameter is d the axial range of the airbag zone and the mass centre location is shown the buoyant centre of the airbag is evidently closer to the vehicle warhead than it is to the mass centre mixed hexahedron pyramid tetrahedron meshes are generated for this model as shown in fig 7 the dimensions of the cuboid computational zone are 280 m 160 m 120 m and the zone is filled with water the vehicle is placed at a height h from the upper surface of the computational zone mimicking the underwater depth structured hexahedron meshes are generated around the vehicle and the first grid layer thickness is set as 5 10 6 m satisfying the demand of y 1 in the transition sst turbulence model the stretching ratio of the grid layer thickness normal to the vehicle surface is set to be 1 1 so as to well capture the wall bounded flow characteristics in the present study the hexahedron pyramid meshes act as the 6dof motion with the vehicle and the local airbag inflation deforms the airbag surface mesh after the airbag surface mesh deformation the mesh smoothing and local cell remeshing are employed cross sectional views of mixed meshes at the z 0 plane at different times are presented in fig 8 the time histories of the mass centre and euler angles and the control effects and control mechanisms of airbag inflation on the floating process are discussed below 3 2 floating process at different incidence angles the time histories of airbag inflation are different for different water depths as shown in fig 9 with an increase of the water depth the hydrostatic pressure also increases inducing a slower inflation process the floating processes of the vehicle are computed for a 50 m depth and different initial pitch angles i e 5 0 4 5 4 0 3 5 3 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 3 0 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 the floating process can be roughly divided into two processes a a direct pitching up and upward floating process which emerges at initial pitch angles in the range 5 0 3 0 and b a pitching down and diving process followed by a pitching up and upward floating process which occurs at initial pitch angles in the range 3 5 5 0 the mass centre histories at the initial pitch angles of 5 0 3 5 and 5 0 are shown in fig 10 by examining the group of figures it can be seen that the x component of the mass centre displacement is limited with the decrease of the derivative value of the longitudinal x component the vertical y component and lateral z component evidently increase and a helical upward floating motion is seen from fig 10 it can be seen that in the time range 0 0 s 1 75 s the pitching angle varies sharply with time in contrast the rolling or yawing angles vary smoothly with time as the time exceeds 1 75 s the pitching angle is approximately 50 and evident variations in the rolling or yawing angles with time are observed the reason for this phenomenon will be discussed below the typical upward floating processes from a 5 0 initial pitch angle are plotted in fig 11 the vehicle first exhibits a diving motion as the upward force is smaller than the downward force with the inflation of the airbag the buoyant force increases inducing a gradually increased pitch up moment when the pitch angle exceeds 0 the fluid dynamic force provided by the water flow will lift thus the downward acceleration is reduced and the vehicle continuously pitches up when the total net force asserted on vehicle becomes upward the vehicle accelerates to move upward the pitching angle increases to approach a vertical state and then continually pitches backward a typical upward floating process from a 5 0 initial pitch angle is plotted in fig 12 the difference between the 5 0 and 5 0 initial pitch angle cases is that in the latter the water lift is large enough to overcome gravity thus the up floating and pitching up motion occurs directly in the 5 0 case this motion process is similar to the up floating process in the 5 0 case 3 3 discussion of floating process the time histories plotted in fig 10 illustrate the results of the fluid dynamic forces asserted on the conjunction body of the airbag and vehicle to shed light on fluid the dynamic forces typical surface pressure contours at different times are plotted in fig 13 and fig 14 for 5 0 and 5 0 initial pitch angles respectively from fig 13 it can be seen that the surface pressure contours are symmetric about the z 0 plane at t 0 075 s and 0 65 s then pressure contour asymmetry is observed at the tail fin and after body at t 1 00 s the range of the flow asymmetry enlarges from the tail fin to the body of vehicle t 1 40 s and then a rolling and yawing motion is induced t 2 00 s after t 2 00 s the pressure contours are wholly asymmetric indicating that the leeside flows are fully unsteady the rolling and yawing motion further amplifies the flow unsteadiness on the leeward side of vehicle airbag conjunction body a fully unsteady flow is formed and the rolling and yawing motions are intensified t 2 00 s and 3 00 s the pressure contours at t 0 075 s are symmetric about the z 0 plane whereas at t 0 60 s the leeward pressure contours are evidently asymmetric near the airbag this asymmetric flow propagates to the tail fin and aft body of the vehicle t 1 15 s inducing the rolling and yawing motion of the vehicle the subsequent processes t 2 00 s 2 55 s and 3 25 s are similar to those of the 5 case to provide insights into the rolling and yawing motion of the vehicle airbag conjunction body the angular velocity components at initial pitch angles of 5 0 and 5 0 are plotted as shown in fig 15 it is seen from these figures that for the 5 0 case a sharp increase of the pitch angular velocity occurs at 0 20 s and a discernible rolling and yawing angular velocity occurs after 0 65 s for the 5 0 case a sharp increase of the pitch angular velocity occurs directly at the start of motion and the discernible rolling and yawing angular velocity occur after 0 60 s the delayed occurrence of the discernible rolling and yawing angular velocity is owing to the delayed occurrence of the asymmetric pressure distributions relative to symmetric pressure distributions the total forces asserted on the vehicle airbag conjunction body can be divided into body forces and fluid dynamic forces the body forces include the time invariant gravity of the conjunction body and the time variant buoyant force as determined by the airbag volume curves plotted in fig 9 the fluid dynamic forces are induced by the motion of the conjunction body as well as the inflation of the airbag to provide deeper insight into the mechanisms in the variation of the fluid dynamic forces spatial streamlines are plotted in fig 16 corresponding to the initial pitch angle of 5 0 it is seen from fig 16 that at t 0 the vehicle moves at a 0 incidence angle it will move downstream as the total force is downward the downward motion is not only dampened by the water but also by the inflation of the airbag the inflating airbag acts similar to that of a source i e it pushes the surrounding water around this source effect makes the virtual thickness of the airbag configuration much larger resulting in the increase of its camber when the camber of the airbag configuration is relatively small the flow across it is smooth without separation at t 0 075 s the pitching angular velocity is small and the vertical translational speed is also very small thus the flow pattern is symmetric about the z 0 plane at t 0 20 s the inflating airbag source generates a larger pitching up moment but the incidence angle is relatively small and the camber of virtual airbag configuration is not large enough to generate flow separation thus the flow patterns are also symmetric about the z 0 plane at t 0 40 s the camber increases and generates symmetric separating vortex pairs on the leeside of vehicle airbag conjunction body that flow downstream at these three time points the pitching angular velocity has not generated vortex shedding from the tail fins thus the flow patterns are determined by the translational motion at t 0 65 s asymmetric detached vortices are shed from the tail fins owing to the sufficiently large pitching angular velocity this accelerated pitching angular velocity suppresses the detached vortices on the leeside of airbag to be attached pairs as the time increases to 1 00 s the flow patterns are similar but the flow asymmetry has introduced a rolling and yawing angular velocity thus the flow asymmetry is observed on the vehicle head and airbag the suppression effort on the vortex pairs on the leeside of the airbag can be sustained until the pitching angular velocity is evidently decelerated at t 1 40 s the pitching angular velocity is evidently decelerated owing to the water damping induced by the pitching motion accordingly the attached vortex pairs separate from the airbag surface forming a horse shoe vortex levchenya et al 2010 this horse shoe vortex pair interacts with the asymmetry vortices shed from the tail fins as they shed downstream the horse shoe vortex pair disappears and only the two separated vortices on the leeside of the airbag can be seen owing to the rolling and yawing motion of the conjunction body as well as the unsteady asymmetric influence of the tail fin vortices the leeward vortices retain their asymmetry producing rolling and yawing motions during the floating process t 2 00 s 2 35 s and 3 00 s in the present study the pitching angular velocity governs the mechanisms for the evolutionary processes of the flow patterns and the mechanisms discussed for the 5 0 case are applicable to different initial pitch angles 4 concluding remarks based on structured meshes around a conjunction body a high fidelity multi disciplinary co simulation without any interface techniques was conducted for the floating process of an underwater vehicle as induced by pneumatic collar inflation time history curves are presented to depict the floating process of the underwater vehicle as induced by the pneumatic collar inflation it is found that a helical up floating motion is the final result from different initial pitch angles the mechanisms for the random rolling and yawing motion are as follows a a symmetric flow around the vehicle collar conjunction body is generated owing to small incidence angle as determined by the initial translational velocity and small vertical velocity during the moving process b the inflation of the collar acts similarly to a source for enlarging the camber of the collar configuration generating symmetric vortex pairs on the leeside of the conjunction body c the accelerated pitching angular rotation resulting from the collar inflation suppresses the detached vortices on the leeside of the airbag to be attached pairs and asymmetric vortices are shed from the tail fins d with the increase of the pitching angular velocities to certain values the water damping becomes large enough to decelerate the pitching motion resulting in the formation of a detached horse shoe vortex and the horse shoe vortex forms two detached vortices as they flow downstream and interact with the asymmetric tail fin vortices and e the rolling and yawing motions of the conjunction body result from the asymmetric flow crossing the conjunction body and these motions intensify the asymmetrical characteristics of the collar vortices and tail fin vortices thereby augmenting the pitching and rolling motion and inducing a helical floating process in general the collar inflation produces a pitching angular velocity and then the flow pattern evolves from symmetric to asymmetric resulting in the helical floating process author s contribution huixue dang be responsible for the

21518,this paper focuses on motion controller design for x rudder underwater vehicles with four independent stern rudders where the conventional ganging method for maneuvering is not applicable to realize the cooperation of the stern rudders motion controller of an x rudder underwater vehicle is divided into two parts a dynamics controller and a control allocator the controller design is conducted under both scenarios that model parameters are known and unknown for known models the desired maneuvering moments are generated by model based sliding mode control method for unknown models non model based iterative sliding mode control method is utilized to calculate virtual steering rudder commands the control allocator of both methods are based on sequential quadratic programming to solve the mixed minimum problem with varied evaluation criterions and constraints by conducting numerical simulations under various conditions the functionality of the two proposed control methods are verified and comparison in terms of accuracy energy saving and computation consumption are also discussed in detail keywords x rudder underwater vehicles iterative sliding mode control allocation non linear programming 1 introduction x rudder underwater vehicles are characterized by the rudder s layout which is like the shape of x and distinguished from the cruciform rudder dubbioso et al 2017 this new layout is first adopted in uss albacore agss 569 and proved to be superior in improving maneuvering ability comparing with traditional layout kim and hong 2011 however it had not been extended to next generation of naval submarines for manual operation and safety with the development of software and hardware of automation x rudder was successfully introduced by sweden in gotland class submarine and netherlands in walrus class submarine to meet imperious tactical demand of excellent maneuverability for minisubs to avoid serious accidents such as hitting the bottom in neritic region besides x rudder has other advantages including better rudder authority indirectly helping improve propulsive efficiency free of risk of damage while docking on seabed or in shipyard and higher safety when rudder stuck encountered therefore x rudder was successfully adopted in many other submarines later such as germany u212 japanese soryu class etc moreover there is also growing application of x rudder in other civilian or military underwater vehicles nakamura and hyakudome 2019 in traditional control system of underwater vehicles ganging has been used to associate the rotational movements a vehicle to its control surfaces oppenheimer et al 2010 in other words a yawing command is transformed into vertical rudder deflection while a pitching command is transformed into identical left and right elevator deflections however ganging method can t be adopted to x rudder underwater vehicles because every control surface will contribute its effort to both heading and pitch therefore research on control of x rudder underwater vehicles becomes necessary from the point view of exploiting its potential maneuverability actually the x rudder underwater vehicles are usually streamlined and the motion direction can be controlled by body direction for those vehicles control moments including rolling moment yaw moment and pitch moment should be taken into account but rudder exerted forces including drag force sway force and heave force are usually treated as disturbances in this way we can suppose that four control planes are utilized to produce three control moments although the x rudder underwater vehicle is globally under actuated in its own cartesian space part of cartesian space dof surge sway heave can be ignored in the choosen control problem then this can be classified into an over actuated control problem therefore control allocation method is required to deal with the control problem faced by x rudder underwater vehicles skulstad et al 2018 adopted the cascaded control structure and utilized neural network for transformation between desired generalized forces and the individual thruster commands independent of specific actuator parameters for reducing energy consumption an array energy consumption factor was introduced and an allocation optimization algorithm was formulated in yang et al 2018 a common control structure is a three layer construction for over actuated mechanical system with actuators redundancy johansen and fossen 2013 xia et al 2018 firstly a high level motion control algorithm is designed to produce virtual control efforts i e forces and moments which are necessary to guarantee the overall motion control objectives backstepping control xia et al 2015 and sliding mode control are commonly employed in this step for underwater vehicles secondly a control allocation algorithm is proposed to coordinate the redundant set of actuators i e fins and thrusters such that the desired virtual control efforts can be obtained jointly by the actuators a daisy chaining control allocation strategy is implemented for an over actuated hover capable auv in tanakitkorn et al 2018 thirdly a low level actuator control algorithm will be utilized to drive each individual actuator by adopting this control structure the high level motion control algorithm can be designed without considering the detailed knowledge about the actuators instead actuator saturation rate limitations and other constraints can be handled in control allocation chen 2016 according to the existing literature there are four mathematical formulations proposed for describing the control allocation problem bodson 2002 which have considered the cases that the exact solution of the control allocation problem may not exist and the solution may not be unique firstly the direct allocation problem is to coordinates the redundant set of actuators to match the virtual control efforts in the given direction secondly the error minimization problem is to search for the control input that minimizes the control allocation error in case that the desired virtual efforts are beyond the capabilities of the actuators due to considerable input limitations chocron et al 2018 thirdly the control minimization problem is essentially a secondary optimization problem if the solutions to the error minimization problem are feasible but not unique in this case a solution referring to minimum control inputs will be selected among all feasible solutions for energy saving and minimization of actuator tear and wear fourthly the mixed minimization problem is to combine the error and control minimization problems into a single multi objective problem that may cost less time and computing resource but with better numerical properties baldini et al 2018 in addition a balancing parameter is introduced and set small to give priority to error minimization over control minimization because control performance should be guaranteed first when choosing the right optimization formulation for an over actuated system its physical limitations computing ability and the actuator s characteristics should all be taken into account for x rudder underwater vehicles deflection range and speed of each control surface are restricted by mechanical or safety reasons peng et al 2018 besides more energy consumption caused by frequent steering and increased longitudinal drag resistance owing to great rudder angle are undesirable zhang et al 2017 furthermore hydrodynamic forces and moments jointly produced by four stern rudders are supposed to meet the commanded virtual efforts as close as possible to achieve better motion control performance in summary the mixed minimization problem should be adopted to deal with control allocation problem of x rudder underwater vehicles no matter in normal operation condition or actuator failure condition however a standard multi objective optimization formulation is insufficient to handle this allocation problem therefore additional objectives constraints and formulations that accommodate models with unknown parameters need adaptation cui et al 2017 will be considered into the standard multi objective optimization formulation there are many solvers for the mixed minimization problems derived from control allocation one is the nonlinear programming method which is actually an iterative numerical optimization method combining the sequential quadratic programming algorithm and active set algorithm boukouvala et al 2016 this method can approximate the nonlinear multi objective function by solving a quadratic single objective function per iteration then the computational complexity can be greatly simplified another one is the dynamic optimum seeking method iyasere et al 2012 which reformulates the nonlinear optimization formulation as a lyapunov function and derives the allocation update law finally although the allocation results are asymptotically optimal and require the least computation consumption the disadvantages including allocation accuracy degradation and potential convergence problems are inevitable the other one is the fixed point method which is also an iterative numerical method but the updating law is extremely simple burken et al 2001 convergence of this method is guaranteed but it may take much time for control allocation problem of x rudder underwater vehicles the nonlinear programming method is adopted after considering allocation performance computational complexity and convergence together to sum up control allocation of x rudder underwater vehicles can be achieved by solving mixed minimization problem using nonlinear programming method comparing with pseudo inverse method the optimization based method can take other constraints and objectives into consideration while the pseudo inverse method can only deal with control error minimization problem moreover the optimization based allocation method can be extended to fault conditions where one or more actuators are broken down this is what the pseudo inverse method can t realize in this paper we will carry out the motion control and allocation research on x rudder underwater vehicles in cases that the hydrodynamic coefficients are known and unknown separately the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 in order to realize control of x rudder underwater vehicles when hydrodynamic coefficients are known a model based sliding mode control method is proposed in this method steering moments are treated as virtual control efforts and produced by a sliding mode dynamics controller then these virtual steering moments will be allocated by utilizing optimization method 2 in case that the hydrodynamic coefficients are unknown a non model based iterative sliding mode method is proposed in this method virtual horizontal and vertical rudder commands are treated as control efforts produced by an increment feedback dynamics controller then allocation is divided into two conditions pseudo inverse method is used for allocation firstly if the allocation results are unsatisfactory optimization method will be used instead to the best of the authors knowledge there is no previous literature about control and allocation problem of x rudder underwater vehicles when the model knowledge is unknown in addition performance of the two allocation methods will be compared quantitatively in terms of allocation error and magnitude of control input the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the decoupled hydrodynamic models of underwater vehicles in horizontal and vertical plane and derives the expression of control efforts of x rudder section 3 proposes two different motion control and allocation methods respectively and states the complete deriving and proving process section 4 validates the functionality of the proposed methods by numerical simulations using simulink and presents the merits and drawbacks of each method after analyses in quantitatively section 5 demonstrates the conclusion of this work 2 modeling of x rudder underwater vehicles the x rudder underwater vehicle in this paper is a streamline autonomous underwater vehicle which is 70 m long and weights over 1 5 10 6 k g it is proposed only for research purpose and derived from a public hydrodynamic model without any interest conflict for modeling of the vehicle s dynamics two reference frames are defined as shown in fig 1 according to the technical terms system recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc and the society of naval architects and marine engineers sname fossen 2011 one is the earth fixed reference frame e another is the body fixed reference frame b fixed at the centre of gravity symbols u v w are the body fixed linear velocities p q r are the angular velocities x y z are the positions in e and φ θ ψ denote the attitude described in e usually a 6 dof model will be proposed to describe the vehicle s full motions but in dynamics controller design the 6 dof model is often decoupled and the 3 dof model is used instead from the point view of simplification for x rudder underwater vehicle with great inertia in this paper one can assume that its rolling angle is too small to consider so that the full motions can be decoupled into a horizontal subsystem described by u v r and a vertical subsystem described by u w q in uncoupled horizontal subsystem roll motion is usually ignored for reducing the complexity of the problem then only u v r will be considered here as most literature do if the forward speed u is stabilized by a forward speed controller which considers the effect caused by the motion on other axes forward speed can be eliminated from the longitudinal equations of motion and the dynamic model of horizontal subsystem can be derived as 1 m y v v y r r y u r m u r y u v u v y v v v v y r r r r τ v i z z n r r n v v n u v u v n u r u r n v v v v n r r r r τ r where m is the mass of the vehicle i z z is the inertial tensor along z axis τ v and τ r are sway force and yaw moment separately y v y r y u v y u r y v v y r r n r n v n u v n u r n v v n r r are the hydrodynamic coefficients which can be directly or indirectly obtained in advance by practical experiments for further simplification let 2 a 1 v m y v a 2 v y r a 1 r

the dynamic model of horizontal subsystem reduces to 3 v a 2 r f 1 v a 2 r τ v a 2 v f 1 r a 2 v τ r a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r r a 1 v f 1 r a 1 v τ r a 1 r f 1 v a 1 r τ v a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r finally one can obtain the simplest form of the dynamic model 4 v f v b 1 v τ v b 2 v τ r r f r b 1 r τ v b 2 r τ r where 5 f v a 2 r f 1 v a 2 v f 1 r a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r b 1 v a 2 r a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r b 2 v a 2 v a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r f r a 1 v f 1 r a 1 r f 1 v a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r b 1 r a 1 r a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r b 2 r a 1 v a 1 v a 2 r a 2 v a 1 r where b is also an intermediate variable and does not have the exact physical meaning in uncoupled vertical subsystem only u w q will be considered then the dynamic model can be presented as 6 m z w w z q q z u q m u q z u w u w z w w w w z q q q q τ w i y y m q q m w w m w u w m q u q m w w w w m q q q q m θ sin θ τ q where i y y is the inertial tensor along y axis τ w s and τ q s are heave force and pitch moment separately z w z q z u w z u q z w w z q q m w m q m u w m u q m q q m w w are the hydrodynamic coefficients which can be directly or indirectly obtained in advance by practical experiments for further simplification let 7 a 1 w m z w a 2 w z q a 1 q m w a 2 q i y y m q q f 1 w z u q m u q z w u w z w w w w z q q q q f 1 q m u w u w m q u q m w w w w m q q q q m θ sin θ then the dynamic model of vertical subsystem reduces to 8 w a 2 q f 1 w a 2 q τ w a 2 w f 1 q a 2 w τ q a 1 w a 2 q a 2 w a 1 q q a 1 w f 1 q a 1 w τ q a 1 q f 1 w a 1 q τ w a 1 w a 2 q a 2 w a 1 q finally one can obtain the simplest form of the dynamic model 9 w f w b 1 w τ w b 2 w τ q q f q b 1 q τ w b 2 q τ q where 10 f w a 2 q f 1 w a 2 w f 1 q a 1 w a 2 q a 2 w a 1 q b 1 w a 2 q a 1 w a 2 q a 2 w a 1 q b 2

dynamics parameter uncertainty and time varying property and external disturbance liu et al 2017 are not characterized this is supposed to be acceptable because these characteristics and corresponding treatments are beyond the scope of this paper in general the derived models can be used for controller design in this paper s research for deriving detailed relationship between maneuvering forces and moments τ τ v τ r τ w τ q before allocation we assume that the control efforts are linear with the deflection define the positive deflection in fig 2 then the relationship can be presented as 11 τ v y δ 1 u 2 δ 1 y δ 2 u 2 δ 2 y δ 3 u 2 δ 3 y δ 4 u 2 δ 4 τ w z δ 1 u 2 δ 1 z δ 2 u 2 δ 2 z δ 3 u 2 δ 3 z δ 4 u 2 δ 4 τ q m δ 1 u 2 δ 1 m δ 2 u 2 δ 2 m δ 3 u 2 δ 3 m δ 4 u 2 δ 4 τ r n δ 1 u 2 δ 1 n δ 2 u 2 δ 2 n δ 3 u 2 δ 3 n δ 4 u 2 δ 4 where y δ z δ m δ n δ are the corresponding hydrodynamic parameters related to the rudders usually roll torque τ p is undesired as it may make the attitude unstable and enhance the difficulty of dynamics control although the roll motion is not considered in the dynamic model it is necessary to pay more attention to τ p which is actually an indicator of allocation performance define τ p as 12 τ p k δ 1 u 2 δ 1 k δ 2 u 2 δ 2 k δ 3 u 2 δ 3 k δ 4 u 2 δ 4 where k δ is the hydrodynamic parameter of s rudder in fact the relationship between τ and δ is more complex than the formulation described above because of time variance and nonlinearity of the rudder s hydrodynamic parameters however the simplification will not affect motion control because the allocation errors can be compensated by motion control algorithm hejia and ming 2012 therefore the linearized formulations are acceptable and can be used for allocation 3 motion controller design 3 1 structure of the proposed control method in this subsection structure of the proposed control method will be illustrated aiming at the control problems of basic movements including heading and pitch a cascaded control structure is designed as shown in fig 3 in this structure external disturbances model uncertainties and actuator saturation are not addressed especially because this paper only focuses on making the x rudder underwater vehicles perform the basic maneuvers which are important for successful completion of other various tasks solutions to above problems will be included in future works in fig 3 the motion controller is divided into two control subsystems dynamic controller and control allocator dynamic controller mainly consists of a heading controller and a pitch controller which are designed to produce virtual control efforts usually some factors such as disturbances uncertainties etc should be handled in the dynamic controller but these will be neglected in this paper for the reasons illustrated above control allocator is also important because it is designed to transform the virtual control efforts into the real actuator s control inputs whereas the actuator s limitations such as saturation rate limitation etc can be considered by adopting the dynamic controller and the control allocator above x rudder underwater vehicles are guaranteed to complete the basic maneuver well based on which x rudder underwater vehicles can also carry out some other tasks such as path following trajectory tracking etc if a proper guidance law is utilized 3 2 method i model based sliding mode controller in this subsection sliding mode control will be introduced to design dynamics controller in case that the vehicle s model and its hydrodynamic coefficients are available as is known it will cost much to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients by model tests or by cfd analyses therefore there are also many underwater vehicles without known coefficients where model based methods are inapplicable aiming at this problem non model based iterative sliding mode control will also be proposed in this paper and discussed in section 3 2 3 2 1 heading controller sliding mode control has been widely used in underwater vehicles for its superior capability of dealing with system uncertainties parameter perturbations and external disturbances however a normal sliding mode algorithm has inherent chattering problem which is detrimental to the actuators in order to eliminate this negative effect an advanced sliding mode method with power approaching law zhang et al 2013 and boundary layer is proposed in this paper according to the horizontal dynamic model in eq 9 the design model of heading control can be expressed as 13 ψ r f r b 1 r τ v b 2 r τ r where b 2 r is actually much greater than b 1 r thus the control effort of τ v can be ignored define heading error e ψ and its derivatives as 14 e ψ ψ ψ d e ψ ψ ψ d e ψ ψ ψ d where ψ d is the desired heading angle next select the sliding surface s ψ as 15 s ψ e ψ c ψ e ψ where c ψ is a positive constant to derive the control law the lyapunov candidate v 1 is defined as 16 v 1 1 2 s ψ 2 and its derivative v 1 can be derived as 17 v 1 s ψ s ψ s ψ e ψ c ψ e ψ s ψ ψ ψ d c ψ e ψ s ψ f r b 2 r τ r ψ d c ψ e ψ basing on lyapunov stability theory one can design the control law as 18 τ r 1 b 2 r ψ d f r c ψ e ψ k ψ s ψ α ψ s a t s ψ where k ψ and α ψ are positive design constants and the definition of s a t s is given as 19 s a t s 1 s δ s δ s δ 1 s δ where δ is the thickness of boundary layer by analyzing the control law in eq 17 it can be found that the control law can guarantee the dynamic system converge as fast as possible when s δ and achieve smooth approach when s δ in other words the designed control law has fast convergency speed and the chattering problem is also relieved for further stability analysis substituting eq 18 and eq 19 into eq 17 then the derivative v 1 can be rewritten as 20 v 1 s ψ k ψ s ψ α ψ s a t s ψ for further analysis of v 1 its sign should be discussed in five conditions listed as 21 s δ v 1 k ψ s ψ α ψ 1 0 δ s 0 v 1 k ψ δ s ψ α ψ 2 0 s 0 v 1 0 0 s δ v 1 k ψ δ s ψ α ψ 2 0 s δ v 1 k ψ s ψ α ψ 1 0 therefore v 1 0 is guaranteed and the heading error e ψ is guaranteed to converge to the origin 3 2 2 pitch controller similarly the design model of pitch control can be expressed as 22 θ q f q b 1 q τ w b 2 q τ q where b 2 q is much larger than b 1 q so the control effort of t w can be neglected also define pitch error e θ and its derivative as 23 e θ θ θ d e θ θ θ d e θ θ θ d where θ d is the demanded pitch angle then define the sliding surface s θ as 24 s θ e θ c θ e θ where c θ 0 finally the pitch control law can be given as 25 τ q 1 b 2 q θ d f q c θ e θ k θ s θ α θ s a t s θ with positive design constants k θ and α θ in addition stability of the pitch controller can be proved in the same way as presented in heading controller design 3 2 3 allocation of maneuvering forces and moments in this subsection the multi objective optimization problem presented in eq 26 will be used for allocation which takes actuator saturation and rate limitations into consideration 26 min j ξ τ τ d t τ τ d 1 ξ δ t δ s t 0 ξ 1 τ d τ r τ q τ p t τ f δ δ δ k 1 δ δ min δ δ max δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 t in this optimization problem the former part of the objective function j represents the allocation error and the latter part represents the magnitude of control inputs for underwater vehicles the greater the control inputs are the greater the longitudinal resistance become besides greater resistance means more energy consuming ξ is a weight coefficient for balancing allocation errors and control inputs τ d is the desired control effort produced by heading and pitch controller τ q usually be set zero is included in τ d so that rolling torque can be limited as less as possible even to zero f δ is the mapping relationship between rudder commands δ and produced moments τ expressed by eq 11 and eq 12 δ is the actuators rate limitation viz the maximum rudder speed to solve this optimization problem sequential quadratic programming sqp algorithm is applied for detailed computing process one can refer to boggs and tolle 1995 domain iterative calculation process is given as step1 choose initial state of optimization variable δ 0 and hessian matrix h 0 step2 solve qp subproblem get search direction d k step3 update optimization variable δ k and hessian matrix h k based on d k step4 calculation of objective function in the form of lagrange function l k step5 determine whether j k is convergent if yes jump to step 6 otherwise repeat step 2 5 step6 end iteration 3 3 method ii non model based iterative sliding mode controller in this subsection iterative sliding mode increment feedback control will be introduced to design dynamics controller in case that the vehicle s model and its hydrodynamic coefficients are unknown and the model based methods are inapplicable 3 3 1 increment feedback heading controller actually the proposed iterative sliding mode increment feedback control is a model independent method and it is utilized to produce virtual rudder commands which are quite distinct from the steering moments in method i moreover the virtual rudder commands are similar to the rudder commands used in cross rudder vehicles and its expressions have nothing to do with hydrodynamic coefficients for deriving the control law define heading error ψ e ψ d ψ and the iterative sliding surfaces are given as 27 s 1 1 ψ e k 1 1 tanh k 0 1 ψ e ψ e s 2 1 s 1 1 k 2 1 tanh s 1 1 d t s 3 1 s 2 1 k 3 1 tanh s 2 1 s 2 1 s 4 1 s 3 1 k 4 1 tanh s 3 1 s 3 1 where k 0 1 k 1 1 k 2 1 k 3 1 k 4 1 r are parameters to be designed basing on the iterative sliding surfaces the increment feedback heading control law is designed as 28 δ v r k 5 1 s 4 1 ε 1 tanh s 4 1 where δ v r is the virtual horizontal rudder command and k 5 1 ε 1 r when determining the above parameters a recommended procedure is given as 1 select k 0 1 by k 0 1 max ψ e 3 and let k 5 1 and ε 1 approximate the max rudder speed 2 start from k 1 1 1 adjust k 1 1 to get the desired response with k 2 1 k 3 1 k 4 1 1 3 keep the tuned k 1 1 adjust k 2 1 to get the desired response with k 3 1 k 4 1 1 4 keep the tuned k 1 1 and k 2 1 adjust k 3 1 to get the desired response with k 4 1 1 5 after tuning of k 1 1 k 2 1 k 3 1 and k 4 1 one can adjust k 5 1 and ε 1 to obtain varied responses it should be pointed out that the chattering problem here is relieved and smooth control inputs can be obtained by adopting the control law presented in eq 27 and eq 28 the reasons are as follows firstly the s i g n function is removed which is often used in traditional sliding mode and is considered as the dominant cause of chattering secondly the controller is actually a high order sliding mode controller which has been proved by other literature to avoid the chattering problem thirdly integration has the function of filtering and it is introduced into the control law for stability analysis a lyapunov candidate is selected as 29 v 2 1 2 s 4 1 2 and its derivative can be derived as 30 v 2 s 4 1 s 4 1 s 4 1 δ v r s 4 1 δ v r multiplying eq 28 by s 4 1 one can obtain 31 s 4 1 δ v r s 4 1 k 5 1 s 4 1 ε 1 tanh s 4 1 k 5 1 s 4 1 2 ε 1 s 4 1 tanh s 4 1 0 where s 4 1 tanh s 4 1 0 is guaranteed for further proof expanding s 4 1 as follows 32 s 4 1 k 4 1 tanh s 3 1 k 3 1 1 tanh 2 s 2 1 s 2 1 s 2 1 k 4 1 tanh s 3 1 k 3 1 k 2 1 tanh s 1 1 cosh 2 s 2 1 k 2 1 k 1 1 k 0 1 ψ e cosh 2 k 0 1 ψ e ψ e cosh 2 s 1 1 according to the error s definition presented in eq 14 it is clear that ψ e δ v r 0 and ψ e δ v r 0 furthermore s 1 1 and s 3 1 are only relevant to ψ e and ψ e respectively so it can be obtained that 33 s 1 1 δ v r 0 s 3 1 δ v r 0 differentiating eq 32 by δ v r and taking eq 33 into consideration one can obtain that 34 s 4 1 δ v r δ v r k 2 1 ψ e cosh 2 s 1 1 k 2 1 cosh 2 s 1 1 r δ v r by analyzing eq 34 according to eq 1 and eq 11 the derivative of s 4 1 to δ v r can be derived as 35 s 4 1 δ v r 0 since r δ v r 0 substituting eqs 31 and 35 into eq 30 it is obvious that 36 v 2 s 4 1 δ v r s 4 1 δ v r 0 above all stability of proposed iterative sliding mode based increment feedback heading controller is proved 3 3 2 increment feedback pitch controller for pitch control define pitch error θ e θ d θ and the iterative sliding surfaces are selected as 37 s 1 2 θ e k 1 2 tanh k 0 2 θ e θ e s 2 2 s 1 2 k 2 2 tanh s 1 2 d t s 3 2 s 2 2 k 3 2 tanh s 2 2 s 2 2 s 4 2 s 3 2 k 4 2 tanh s 3 2 s 3 2 similarly the increment feedback pitch control law is designed as 38 δ v s k 5 2 s 4 2 ε 2 tanh s 4 2 where δ v s is the virtual vertical rudder command k 0 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 k 5 2 ε 2 r are design parameters 3 3 3 allocation of virtual rudder commands a fixed mapping translation between virtual rudder commands and actuator s control inputs can be used for allocation in method ii define the fixed mapping g δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 as 39 g δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ v r 1 4 δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ v s 1 4 δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ 13 d δ 3 δ 1 δ 24 d δ 4 δ 2 where δ 13 d and δ 24 d are differential angle which can produce rolling torque and usually be set as zero hong and chitre 2015 then the inverse mapping i n v g can be derived as 40 i n v g δ 1 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 13 d δ 3 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 13 d δ 2 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 24 d δ 4 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 24 d as is illustrated above δ 13 d and δ 24 d are usually set zero a simplest mapping translation yields to 41 δ 1 δ 3 δ v r δ v s δ 2 δ 4 δ v r δ v s in normal conditions this fixed mapping translation can deal with most allocation examples however if δ v r δ v s 20 then δ 2 δ 4 40 is obtained obviously the allocation results are beyond the actuator s limitations in other words the mapping translation is not applicable to all allocation cases and an optimization based allocation method should be introduced as a supplement taking actuator constraints and energy consumption into consideration the optimization problem can be formulated as 42 min j ξ δ v δ v d t δ v δ v d 1 ξ δ t δ s t 0 ξ 1 δ v d δ v r δ v s 0 0 t δ v g δ δ k δ k 1 δ δ min δ δ max δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 t in this optimization problem δ v d is the demanded virtual rudder commands produced by dynamics controller in which the desired differential rudder commands δ 13 d and δ 24 d are set zero δ v is the mapping result by using g δ presented in eq 39 this optimization problem is proposed to find a combination of δ to minimize the allocation error and control inputs in case that the fixed mapping translation is invalid sqp algorithm can be used to solve this optimization problem similarly the complete allocation strategy in method ii is illustrated in fig 4 firstly pseudo inverse tohidi et al 2016 of the fixed mapping will be used to find the actuator s control inputs if the results satisfy its limitations the solution is supposed to be valid otherwise it is invalid and the optimization based allocation method will be adopted for reallocation by adopting this strategy computation consumption can be greatly reduced because the iterative optimization computation is conducted only when necessary 4 numerical simulations in order to test the performance of the proposed methods numerical simulations are carried out by using simulink a common numerical simulation platform an open access hydrodynamic model is selected as the simulation model and the domain hydrodynamic parameters are listed in table 1 firstly simulations of heading and pitch control are carried out to demonstrate the fundamental function of every control method then simulations of path following in 3d space are conducted to verify whether the methods meet the basic practical requirements the detailed simulation scenarios are listed in table 2 for comparison of the performance control errors resultant drag force and computation consumption will be considered as criterions 4 1 case 1 heading and pitch control to verify the basic function of the proposed methods heading and pitch control simulation is carried out in this subsection suppose the vehicle is located at the position x 0 y 0 z 0 0 0 50 m with initial attitude φ 0 θ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 at the beginning of the simulations and the desired heading angle and pitch angle are set as ψ d 60 and θ d 10 in the simulation the surge velocity keeps at 5 knots constantly the control parameters of method i and method ii after tuning are listed as c ψ 0 5 k ψ 0 1 α ψ 0 001 c θ 0 5 k θ 0 1 α θ 0 001 k 0 1 0 15 k 1 1 1 1 k 2 1 0 9 k 3 1 2 k 4 1 0 1 ε 1 8 k 0 2 0 1 k 1 2 0 8 k 2 2 0 9 k 3 2 2 k 4 2 0 1 ε 2 5 heading and pitch control simulation without disturbances is carried out in scenario 1 fig 5 shows the heading and pitch control results when adopting different methods it can be seen that all the methods can make the vehicle approach the desired heading and pitch smoothly and remain stable eventually however the convergence rate is different method i is more effective in heading and pitch adjustment than method ii while pid control has the moderate performance for further analysis other factors such as the amplitude and frequency of control inputs should be taken into consideration as it is shown in fig 6 the control inputs produced by method i is heavier than those produced by method ii this is consistent with the fact that the better maneuverability a vehicle has the more control inputs it demands however the control inputs produced by method ii are smoother than by method ii and pid when there is no need for strong maneuverability smooth control inputs are preferred because more control inputs mean more energy consumption oscillate means noise and rapid change of control inputs will cause shock in actuator drivelines fig 7 presents another meaningful conclusion both in the results of method i and method ii the control inputs of rudder 1 are equivalent to rudder 3 throughout the simulation the same relationship also exists between rudder 2 and rudder 4 by conducting further analyses it can be concluded that synchronous movement of the diagonal control planes help to reduce the rolling torque to its minimum because their control efforts are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction therefore it is meaningful that the optimization process could be significantly simplified by assuming that the diagonal rudders move synchronously in other words computation consumption could be significantly reduced because the variables are reduced to two from four however this simplification can only be conducted when four rudders are operational and it will become illegal when one or more rudders break down quantitative comparisons including the mean square error mse mean absolute error mae max rudder deflection max and average rudder deflection aver are listed in table 3 according to max and average rudder deflection control inputs produced by method ii are gentle without dramatic changes but it takes more time to approach desired attitude except that method ii should still be preferred when there is no need for high maneuverability because of its superiority of low noise and energy saving allocation accuracy of both methods are also worth of analyses control efforts before and after allocation are shown in fig 8 as it is shown there are nearly no allocation errors in both methods except that minor errors still exist in the first 30 s when adopting method i actually the unexpected errors are reasonable because the max steering moment τ r and max pitch moment τ q are unavailable at the same time and this is a general characteristic of x rudder when great steering moment and pitch moment are demanded at the same time it is necessary to guarantee the pitch moment first and this is what the allocation methods do in addition the rolling torque after control allocation by these two control methods is nearly equal to zero so that the control allocation methods are proved to be valid in rolling torque elimination for quantitative analysis of allocation accuracy mse and mae are calculated and listed in table 4 since the units of control efforts are nm and degree in method i and method ii respectively allocation errors are normalized and represented in the form of fractional errors for fair comparison as the table shows mae are below 5 throughout the entire voyage which means that the allocation performance of both methods are satisfying and can be adopted in practical application computation consumption of both methods are shown in fig 9 the maximum iterations of each method are 14 and 9 respectively which illustrates that the optimization process of method i needs more time to converge the minimum iterations both are 7 and this happens when the desired heading and pitch are nearly approached the average iterations are 9 and 7 respectively which also indicates method ii costs less computation resource relatively in addition distribution of iterations of method ii is well centralized which means its stability is superior in summary method ii has faster convergence speed and better stability than method i in order to test the robustness to the environmental disturbances scenario 2 is designed and this is the simulation of heading and pitch control under disturbances in this simulation the disturbing forces and moments can be described as f y 0 11 10 5 sin 2 π 100 t 100 n f z 0 11 10 5 cos 2 π 100 t 100 n t y f y 40 n m t z f z 40 n m where f y is the lateral disturbing force f z is the vertical disturbing force t y is the disturbing moment along y axis t z is the disturbing moment along z axis the simulation results are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 as it is shown the disturbances cause the heading and pitch to fluctuate but it has less effect on heading control than on pitch control in general the performance of method i and method ii are nearly the same and both are better than pid therefore the robustness of method i and method ii against external disturbances are proofed besides there is no violent chattering in control inputs of both methods in other words smooth control inputs are obtained 4 2 case 2 path following in 3d space path following in 3d space is an important task for underwater vehicles to complete this task line of sight path following algorithm presented in xia et al 2019 xiang et al 2017 is adopted in this paper in this case we assume that the initial position of the vehicle is x 0 y 0 z 0 0 0 50 and the initial attitude is φ 0 θ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 way points are set as w p 1 0 0 50 w p 2 800 0 100 w p 3 1000 0 100 w p 4 1000 3000 100 w p 5 4000 3000 100 w p 6 4000 0 100 w p 7 7000 0 100 and the surge velocity keeps at 5 knots throughout the simulation the simulation in scenario 3 is path following without disturbances the desired and actual trajectory of the vehicle are presented in fig 12 it can be seen that both the proposed methods in general can make the vehicle move along the desired path but the vehicle will deviate from path every time it dives or turns when this happens the vehicle will then go back to the path quickly under control of the proposed methods path projections are shown in fig 13 in this figure deviation at every turning is obvious and one can find the turning radius is about 180 m besides tracking performance of different methods are nearly the same on horizontal plane but variant on vertical plane another interesting finding is that the vehicle tends to dive down when it begins to turn and this happens at 220s 450s 860s and 1120s in fig 14 one can consider this behavior as the vehicle s hydrodynamic characteristics control inputs are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that control inputs produced by all methods are smooth except slight chattering when using method ii however the slight chattering can only be found at turning begins this is different from the fact that chattering usually arises at the end of correction if sliding mode control is adopted actually chattering at turning begins is caused by curvature discontinuity in the desired path which will result in great derivatives of heading or pitch error in order to avoid this problem sharp corner in desired path should be replaced with smooth curve matched with turning ability of the vehicle control efforts before and after allocation are shown in fig 16 as it is shown the allocation errors are almost zero no matter in horizontal plane or vertical plane though great maneuvering forces are required at 210s 830s 1500s and 2100s in addition the rolling torque is also limited to zero and this is consistent with the optimization objectives table 5 shows the results of quantitative analyses one can find that allocation errors of both methods in path following are small enough but method ii behaves more precisely since the relative errors are below 0 5 surprisingly computation iterations in path following are presented in fig 17 most optimization periods only require 6 or 7 iterations but 13 or 14 iterations are demanded for method i when desired control efforts become greater in general iteration distribution in this case is almost the same with the distribution in case 1 to verify the disturbance handling ability and robustness of the proposed methods path following simulation is carried out with same environmental disturbances in scenario 4 the disturbances considered in this scenario are the same as that in scenario 2 the desired path and initial conditions chosen here are the same as that in scenario 3 the path following results of scenario 4 are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 it can be seen that under the effect of disturbances path following errors in this scenario are bigger than that in scenario 3 whereas tracking errors of method ii is the smallest and tracking errors of pid is the biggest moreover oscillation can be observed in the results of method i and pid comparing with the results in scenario 3 one can find that tracking performance of method ii seems not to degenerate when encountering disturbances and the whole tracking process are smooth therefore it can be concluded that method ii has better robustness to environmental disturbances than method i and pid when path following 4 3 discussions combining the numerical results and corresponding analyses above some discussions can be drawn 1 from the aspect of functionality both method i control allocation of maneuvering forces and moments and method ii control allocation of virtual rudder commands are capable of governing the vehicle to complete various maneuvers such as heading adjustment depth adjustment path following in 3d space etc 2 from the aspect of maneuverability and energy saving the vehicles adopting method i will respond to commands more quickly than that using method ii the negatives are that it requires more and fast rudder deflection increases longitudinal drag resistance and produces shock and noise in driveline 3 from the aspect of allocation accuracy though both methods behave well in allocation accuracy method ii is superior nevertheless especially great horizontal and vertical control efforts are required at the same time allocation algorithm of method i will balance the control efforts and cause greater allocation errors inevitably 4 from the aspect of computation consuming when small control efforts are required 6 or 7 computing iterations are sufficient for both methods however if greater control efforts are needed up to 14 computing iterations are indispensable for method i while 6 to 8 iterations are common for method ii in all cases 5 from the aspect of parameter tuning and adaptability parameter tuning of method ii is more difficult than method i and pid but it would become easy if the right tuning procedure is adopted however method ii has better robustness against disturbances and its control performance is more satisfactory besides chattering is more likely to arise when adopting method i and pid in case of great disturbances to sum up each control allocation method has its advantages and disadvantages which method should be adopted to x rudder underwater vehicles depends on the requirement of maneuverability first or smoothness first except that the computation ability should also be taken into account 5 conclusion in this paper motion control methods for x rudder underwater vehicles are investigated for both circumstances that the hydrodynamic models are known and unknown under a successive control scheme the motion controller is constructed by a dynamics controller and a control allocator for hydrodynamic models which are known a model based sliding mode control is used to obtain steering moments which later be allocated by solving constrained nonlinear programming problem for hydrodynamic models which are unknown virtual cross rudder commands are generated by non model based iterative sliding mode increment feedback control and then be allocated based on a hypothetical mapping relationship in order to verify the functionality of the motion controllers numerical simulations are conducted and the results are analyzed in terms of maneuverability allocation accuracy energy saving and computation consuming the simulation results demonstrated that both methods can achieve satisfactory performance in heading control pitch control and path following but method i can make better maneuverability and method ii can guarantee smooth control inputs and better robustness against disturbances though the proposed methods are proved robust to disturbances to some extent extended disturbance observers and adaptive attitude tracking controller should still be investigated for more precise motion control therefore an extension of the work to include such adaptive motion control is highly relevant for future work except that actuators usually have varied response characteristics and the synchronism has great effect on allocation performance so characteristic compensation method remains a topic for future work besides rudder failure is a common fault for underwater vehicles and this will cause serious accidents since x rudder has inherent advantage in fault tolerant control it should also be integrated into motion controller to

21518,this paper focuses on motion controller design for x rudder underwater vehicles with four independent stern rudders where the conventional ganging method for maneuvering is not applicable to realize the cooperation of the stern rudders motion controller of an x rudder underwater vehicle is divided into two parts a dynamics controller and a control allocator the controller design is conducted under both scenarios that model parameters are known and unknown for known models the desired maneuvering moments are generated by model based sliding mode control method for unknown models non model based iterative sliding mode control method is utilized to calculate virtual steering rudder commands the control allocator of both methods are based on sequential quadratic programming to solve the mixed minimum problem with varied evaluation criterions and constraints by conducting numerical simulations under various conditions the functionality of the two proposed control methods are verified and comparison in terms of accuracy energy saving and computation consumption are also discussed in detail keywords x rudder underwater vehicles iterative sliding mode control allocation non linear programming 1 introduction x rudder underwater vehicles are characterized by the rudder s layout which is like the shape of x and distinguished from the cruciform rudder dubbioso et al 2017 this new layout is first adopted in uss albacore agss 569 and proved to be superior in improving maneuvering ability comparing with traditional layout kim and hong 2011 however it had not been extended to next generation of naval submarines for manual operation and safety with the development of software and hardware of automation x rudder was successfully introduced by sweden in gotland class submarine and netherlands in walrus class submarine to meet imperious tactical demand of excellent maneuverability for minisubs to avoid serious accidents such as hitting the bottom in neritic region besides x rudder has other advantages including better rudder authority indirectly helping improve propulsive efficiency free of risk of damage while docking on seabed or in shipyard and higher safety when rudder stuck encountered therefore x rudder was successfully adopted in many other submarines later such as germany u212 japanese soryu class etc moreover there is also growing application of x rudder in other civilian or military underwater vehicles nakamura and hyakudome 2019 in traditional control system of underwater vehicles ganging has been used to associate the rotational movements a vehicle to its control surfaces oppenheimer et al 2010 in other words a yawing command is transformed into vertical rudder deflection while a pitching command is transformed into identical left and right elevator deflections however ganging method can t be adopted to x rudder underwater vehicles because every control surface will contribute its effort to both heading and pitch therefore research on control of x rudder underwater vehicles becomes necessary from the point view of exploiting its potential maneuverability actually the x rudder underwater vehicles are usually streamlined and the motion direction can be controlled by body direction for those vehicles control moments including rolling moment yaw moment and pitch moment should be taken into account but rudder exerted forces including drag force sway force and heave force are usually treated as disturbances in this way we can suppose that four control planes are utilized to produce three control moments although the x rudder underwater vehicle is globally under actuated in its own cartesian space part of cartesian space dof surge sway heave can be ignored in the choosen control problem then this can be classified into an over actuated control problem therefore control allocation method is required to deal with the control problem faced by x rudder underwater vehicles skulstad et al 2018 adopted the cascaded control structure and utilized neural network for transformation between desired generalized forces and the individual thruster commands independent of specific actuator parameters for reducing energy consumption an array energy consumption factor was introduced and an allocation optimization algorithm was formulated in yang et al 2018 a common control structure is a three layer construction for over actuated mechanical system with actuators redundancy johansen and fossen 2013 xia et al 2018 firstly a high level motion control algorithm is designed to produce virtual control efforts i e forces and moments which are necessary to guarantee the overall motion control objectives backstepping control xia et al 2015 and sliding mode control are commonly employed in this step for underwater vehicles secondly a control allocation algorithm is proposed to coordinate the redundant set of actuators i e fins and thrusters such that the desired virtual control efforts can be obtained jointly by the actuators a daisy chaining control allocation strategy is implemented for an over actuated hover capable auv in tanakitkorn et al 2018 thirdly a low level actuator control algorithm will be utilized to drive each individual actuator by adopting this control structure the high level motion control algorithm can be designed without considering the detailed knowledge about the actuators instead actuator saturation rate limitations and other constraints can be handled in control allocation chen 2016 according to the existing literature there are four mathematical formulations proposed for describing the control allocation problem bodson 2002 which have considered the cases that the exact solution of the control allocation problem may not exist and the solution may not be unique firstly the direct allocation problem is to coordinates the redundant set of actuators to match the virtual control efforts in the given direction secondly the error minimization problem is to search for the control input that minimizes the control allocation error in case that the desired virtual efforts are beyond the capabilities of the actuators due to considerable input limitations chocron et al 2018 thirdly the control minimization problem is essentially a secondary optimization problem if the solutions to the error minimization problem are feasible but not unique in this case a solution referring to minimum control inputs will be selected among all feasible solutions for energy saving and minimization of actuator tear and wear fourthly the mixed minimization problem is to combine the error and control minimization problems into a single multi objective problem that may cost less time and computing resource but with better numerical properties baldini et al 2018 in addition a balancing parameter is introduced and set small to give priority to error minimization over control minimization because control performance should be guaranteed first when choosing the right optimization formulation for an over actuated system its physical limitations computing ability and the actuator s characteristics should all be taken into account for x rudder underwater vehicles deflection range and speed of each control surface are restricted by mechanical or safety reasons peng et al 2018 besides more energy consumption caused by frequent steering and increased longitudinal drag resistance owing to great rudder angle are undesirable zhang et al 2017 furthermore hydrodynamic forces and moments jointly produced by four stern rudders are supposed to meet the commanded virtual efforts as close as possible to achieve better motion control performance in summary the mixed minimization problem should be adopted to deal with control allocation problem of x rudder underwater vehicles no matter in normal operation condition or actuator failure condition however a standard multi objective optimization formulation is insufficient to handle this allocation problem therefore additional objectives constraints and formulations that accommodate models with unknown parameters need adaptation cui et al 2017 will be considered into the standard multi objective optimization formulation there are many solvers for the mixed minimization problems derived from control allocation one is the nonlinear programming method which is actually an iterative numerical optimization method combining the sequential quadratic programming algorithm and active set algorithm boukouvala et al 2016 this method can approximate the nonlinear multi objective function by solving a quadratic single objective function per iteration then the computational complexity can be greatly simplified another one is the dynamic optimum seeking method iyasere et al 2012 which reformulates the nonlinear optimization formulation as a lyapunov function and derives the allocation update law finally although the allocation results are asymptotically optimal and require the least computation consumption the disadvantages including allocation accuracy degradation and potential convergence problems are inevitable the other one is the fixed point method which is also an iterative numerical method but the updating law is extremely simple burken et al 2001 convergence of this method is guaranteed but it may take much time for control allocation problem of x rudder underwater vehicles the nonlinear programming method is adopted after considering allocation performance computational complexity and convergence together to sum up control allocation of x rudder underwater vehicles can be achieved by solving mixed minimization problem using nonlinear programming method comparing with pseudo inverse method the optimization based method can take other constraints and objectives into consideration while the pseudo inverse method can only deal with control error minimization problem moreover the optimization based allocation method can be extended to fault conditions where one or more actuators are broken down this is what the pseudo inverse method can t realize in this paper we will carry out the motion control and allocation research on x rudder underwater vehicles in cases that the hydrodynamic coefficients are known and unknown separately the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows 1 in order to realize control of x rudder underwater vehicles when hydrodynamic coefficients are known a model based sliding mode control method is proposed in this method steering moments are treated as virtual control efforts and produced by a sliding mode dynamics controller then these virtual steering moments will be allocated by utilizing optimization method 2 in case that the hydrodynamic coefficients are unknown a non model based iterative sliding mode method is proposed in this method virtual horizontal and vertical rudder commands are treated as control efforts produced by an increment feedback dynamics controller then allocation is divided into two conditions pseudo inverse method is used for allocation firstly if the allocation results are unsatisfactory optimization method will be used instead to the best of the authors knowledge there is no previous literature about control and allocation problem of x rudder underwater vehicles when the model knowledge is unknown in addition performance of the two allocation methods will be compared quantitatively in terms of allocation error and magnitude of control input the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the decoupled hydrodynamic models of underwater vehicles in horizontal and vertical plane and derives the expression of control efforts of x rudder section 3 proposes two different motion control and allocation methods respectively and states the complete deriving and proving process section 4 validates the functionality of the proposed methods by numerical simulations using simulink and presents the merits and drawbacks of each method after analyses in quantitatively section 5 demonstrates the conclusion of this work 2 modeling of x rudder underwater vehicles the x rudder underwater vehicle in this paper is a streamline autonomous underwater vehicle which is 70 m long and weights over 1 5 10 6 k g it is proposed only for research purpose and derived from a public hydrodynamic model without any interest conflict for modeling of the vehicle s dynamics two reference frames are defined as shown in fig 1 according to the technical terms system recommended by the international towing tank conference ittc and the society of naval architects and marine engineers sname fossen 2011 one is the earth fixed reference frame e another is the body fixed reference frame b fixed at the centre of gravity symbols u v w are the body fixed linear velocities p q r are the angular velocities x y z are the positions in e and φ θ ψ denote the attitude described in e usually a 6 dof model will be proposed to describe the vehicle s full motions but in dynamics controller design the 6 dof model is often decoupled and the 3 dof model is used instead from the point view of simplification for x rudder underwater vehicle with great inertia in this paper one can assume that its rolling angle is too small to consider so that the full motions can be decoupled into a horizontal subsystem described by u v r and a vertical subsystem described by u w q in uncoupled horizontal subsystem roll motion is usually ignored for reducing the complexity of the problem then only u v r will be considered here as most literature do if the forward speed u is stabilized by a forward speed controller which considers the effect caused by the motion on other axes forward speed can be eliminated from the longitudinal equations of motion and the dynamic model of horizontal subsystem can be derived as 1 m y v v y r r y u r m u r y u v u v y v v v v y r r r r τ v i z z n r r n v v n u v u v n u

intermediate variable and does not have the exact physical meaning in uncoupled vertical subsystem only u w q will be considered then the dynamic model can be presented as 6 m z w w z q q z u q m u q z u w u w z w w w w z q q q q τ w i y y m q q m w w m w u w m q u q m w w w w m q q q q m θ sin θ τ q where i y y is the inertial tensor along y axis τ w s and τ q s are heave force and pitch moment

dynamics parameter uncertainty and time varying property and external disturbance liu et al 2017 are not characterized this is supposed to be acceptable because these characteristics and corresponding treatments are beyond the scope of this paper in general the derived models can be used for controller design in this paper s research for deriving detailed relationship between maneuvering forces and moments τ τ v τ r τ w τ q before allocation we assume that the control efforts are linear with the deflection define the positive deflection in fig 2 then the relationship can be presented as 11 τ v y

and enhance the difficulty of dynamics control although the roll motion is not considered in the dynamic model it is necessary to pay more attention to τ p which is actually an indicator of allocation performance define τ p as 12 τ p k δ 1 u 2 δ 1 k δ 2 u 2 δ 2 k δ 3 u 2 δ 3 k δ 4 u 2 δ 4 where k δ is the hydrodynamic parameter of s rudder in fact the relationship between τ and δ is more complex than the formulation described above because of time variance and nonlinearity of the rudder s hydrodynamic parameters however the simplification will not affect motion control because the allocation errors can be compensated by motion control algorithm hejia and ming 2012 therefore the linearized formulations are acceptable and can be used for allocation 3 motion controller design 3 1 structure of the proposed control method in this subsection structure of the proposed control method will be illustrated aiming at the control problems of basic movements including heading and pitch a cascaded control structure is designed as shown in fig 3 in this structure external disturbances model uncertainties and actuator saturation are not addressed especially because this paper only focuses on making the x rudder underwater vehicles perform the basic maneuvers which are important for successful completion of other various tasks solutions to above problems will be included in future works in fig 3 the motion controller is divided into two control subsystems dynamic controller and control allocator dynamic controller mainly consists of a heading controller and a pitch controller which are designed to produce virtual control efforts usually some factors such as disturbances uncertainties etc should be handled in the dynamic controller but these will be neglected in this paper for the reasons illustrated above control allocator is also important because it is designed to transform the virtual control efforts into the real actuator s control inputs whereas the actuator s limitations such as saturation rate limitation etc can be considered by adopting the dynamic controller and the control allocator above x rudder underwater vehicles are guaranteed to complete the basic maneuver well based on which x rudder underwater vehicles can also carry out some other tasks such as path following trajectory tracking etc if a proper guidance law is utilized 3 2 method i model based sliding mode controller in this subsection sliding mode control will be introduced to design dynamics controller in case that the vehicle s model and its hydrodynamic coefficients are available as is known it will cost much to obtain the hydrodynamic coefficients by model tests or by cfd analyses therefore there are also many underwater vehicles without known coefficients where model based methods are inapplicable aiming at this problem non model based iterative sliding mode control will also be proposed in this paper and discussed in section 3 2 3 2 1 heading controller sliding mode control has been widely used in underwater vehicles for its superior capability of dealing with system uncertainties parameter perturbations and external disturbances however a normal sliding mode algorithm has inherent chattering problem which is detrimental to the actuators in order to eliminate this negative effect an advanced sliding mode method with power approaching law zhang et al 2013 and boundary layer is proposed in this paper according to the horizontal dynamic model in eq 9 the design model of heading control can be expressed as 13 ψ r f r b 1 r τ v b 2 r τ r where b 2 r is actually much greater than b 1 r thus the control effort of τ v can be ignored define heading error e ψ and its derivatives as 14 e ψ ψ ψ d e ψ ψ ψ d e ψ ψ ψ d where ψ d is the desired heading angle next select the sliding surface s ψ as 15 s ψ e ψ c ψ e ψ where c ψ is a positive constant to derive the control law the lyapunov candidate v 1 is defined as 16 v 1 1 2 s ψ 2 and its derivative v 1 can be derived as 17 v 1 s ψ s ψ s ψ e ψ c ψ e ψ s ψ ψ ψ d c ψ e ψ s ψ f r b 2 r τ r ψ d c ψ e ψ basing on lyapunov stability theory one can design the control law as 18 τ r 1 b 2 r ψ d f r c ψ e ψ k ψ s ψ α ψ s a t s ψ where k ψ and α ψ are positive design constants and the definition of s a t s is given as 19 s a t s 1 s δ s δ s δ 1 s δ where δ is the thickness of boundary layer by analyzing the control law in eq 17 it can be found that the control law can guarantee the dynamic system converge as fast as possible when s δ and achieve smooth approach when s δ in other words the designed control law has fast convergency speed and the chattering problem is also relieved for further stability analysis substituting eq 18 and eq 19 into eq 17 then the derivative v 1 can be rewritten as 20 v 1 s ψ k ψ s ψ α ψ s a t s ψ for further analysis of v 1 its sign should be discussed in five conditions listed as 21 s δ v 1 k ψ s ψ α ψ 1 0 δ s 0 v 1 k ψ δ s ψ α ψ 2 0 s 0 v 1 0 0 s δ v 1 k ψ δ s ψ α ψ 2 0 s δ v 1 k ψ s ψ α ψ 1 0 therefore v 1 0 is guaranteed and the heading error e ψ is guaranteed to converge to the origin 3 2 2 pitch controller similarly the design model of pitch control can be expressed as 22 θ q f q b 1 q τ w b 2 q τ q where b 2 q is much larger than b 1 q so the control effort of t w can be neglected also define pitch error e θ and its derivative as 23 e θ θ θ d e θ θ θ d e θ θ θ d where θ d is the demanded pitch angle then define the sliding surface s θ as 24 s θ e θ c θ e θ where c θ 0 finally the pitch control law can be given as 25 τ q 1 b 2 q θ d f q c θ e θ k θ s θ α θ s a t s θ with positive design constants k θ and α θ in addition stability of the pitch controller can be proved in the same way as presented in heading controller design 3 2 3 allocation of maneuvering forces and moments in this subsection the multi objective optimization problem presented in eq 26 will be used for allocation which takes actuator saturation and rate limitations into consideration 26 min j ξ τ τ d t τ τ d 1 ξ δ t δ s t 0 ξ 1 τ d τ r τ q τ p t τ f δ δ δ k 1 δ δ min δ δ max δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 t in this optimization problem the former part of the objective function j represents the allocation error and the latter part represents the magnitude of control inputs for underwater vehicles the greater the control inputs are the greater the longitudinal resistance become besides greater resistance means more energy consuming ξ is a weight coefficient for balancing allocation errors and control inputs τ d is the desired control effort produced by heading and pitch controller τ q usually be set zero is included in τ d so that rolling torque can be limited as less as possible even to zero f δ is the mapping relationship between rudder commands δ and produced moments τ expressed by eq 11 and eq 12 δ is the actuators rate limitation viz the maximum rudder speed to solve this optimization problem sequential quadratic programming sqp algorithm is applied for detailed computing process one can refer to boggs and tolle 1995 domain iterative calculation process is given as step1 choose initial state of optimization variable δ 0 and hessian matrix h 0 step2 solve qp subproblem get search direction d k step3 update optimization variable δ k and hessian matrix h k based on d k step4 calculation of objective function in the form of lagrange function l k step5 determine whether j k is convergent if yes jump to step 6 otherwise repeat step 2 5 step6 end iteration 3 3 method ii non model based iterative sliding mode controller in this subsection iterative sliding mode increment feedback control will be introduced to design dynamics controller in case that the vehicle s model and its hydrodynamic coefficients are unknown and the model based methods are inapplicable 3 3 1 increment feedback heading controller actually the proposed iterative sliding mode increment feedback control is a model independent method and it is utilized to produce virtual rudder commands which are quite distinct from the steering moments in method i moreover the virtual rudder commands are similar to the rudder commands used in cross rudder vehicles and its expressions have nothing to do with hydrodynamic coefficients for deriving the control law define heading error ψ e ψ d ψ and the iterative sliding surfaces are given as 27 s 1 1 ψ e k 1 1 tanh k 0 1 ψ e ψ e s 2 1 s 1 1 k 2 1 tanh s 1 1 d t s 3 1 s 2 1 k 3 1 tanh s 2 1 s 2 1 s 4 1 s 3 1 k 4 1 tanh s 3 1 s 3 1 where k 0 1 k 1 1 k 2 1 k 3 1 k 4 1 r are parameters to be designed basing on the iterative sliding surfaces the increment feedback heading control law is designed as 28 δ v r k 5 1 s 4 1 ε 1 tanh s 4 1 where δ v r is the virtual horizontal rudder command and k 5 1 ε 1 r when determining the above parameters a recommended procedure is given as 1 select k 0 1 by k 0 1 max ψ e 3 and let k 5 1 and ε 1 approximate the max rudder speed 2 start from k 1 1 1 adjust k 1 1 to get the desired response with k 2 1 k 3 1 k 4 1 1 3 keep the tuned k 1 1 adjust k 2 1 to get the desired response with k 3 1 k 4 1 1 4 keep the tuned k 1 1 and k 2 1 adjust k 3 1 to get the desired response with k 4 1 1 5 after tuning of k 1 1 k 2 1 k 3 1 and k 4 1 one can adjust k 5 1 and ε 1 to obtain varied responses it should be pointed out that the chattering problem here is relieved and smooth control inputs can be obtained by adopting the control law presented in eq 27 and eq 28 the reasons are as follows firstly the s i g n function is removed which is often used in traditional sliding mode and is considered as the dominant cause of chattering secondly the controller is actually a high order sliding mode controller which has been proved by other literature to avoid the chattering problem thirdly integration has the function of filtering and it is introduced into the control law for stability analysis a lyapunov candidate is selected as 29 v 2 1 2 s 4 1 2 and its derivative can be derived as 30 v 2 s 4 1 s 4 1 s 4 1 δ v r s 4 1 δ v r multiplying eq 28 by s 4 1 one can obtain 31 s 4 1 δ v r s 4 1 k 5 1 s 4 1 ε 1 tanh s 4 1 k 5 1 s 4 1 2 ε 1 s 4 1 tanh s 4 1 0 where s 4 1 tanh s 4 1 0 is guaranteed for further proof expanding s 4 1 as follows 32 s 4 1 k 4 1 tanh s 3 1 k 3 1 1 tanh 2 s 2 1 s 2 1 s 2 1 k 4 1 tanh s 3 1 k 3 1 k 2 1 tanh s 1 1 cosh 2 s 2 1 k 2 1 k 1 1 k 0 1 ψ e cosh 2 k 0 1 ψ e ψ e cosh 2 s 1 1 according to the error s definition presented in eq 14 it is clear that ψ e δ v r 0 and ψ e δ v r 0 furthermore s 1 1 and s 3 1 are only relevant to ψ e and ψ e respectively so it can be obtained that 33 s 1 1 δ v r 0 s 3 1 δ v r 0 differentiating eq 32 by δ v r and taking eq 33 into consideration one can obtain that 34 s 4 1 δ v r δ v r k 2 1 ψ e cosh 2 s 1 1 k 2 1 cosh 2 s 1 1 r δ v r by analyzing eq 34 according to eq 1 and eq 11 the derivative of s 4 1 to δ v r can be derived as 35 s 4 1 δ v r 0 since r δ v r 0 substituting eqs 31 and 35 into eq 30 it is obvious that 36 v 2 s 4 1 δ v r s 4 1 δ v r 0 above all stability of proposed iterative sliding mode based increment feedback heading controller is proved 3 3 2 increment feedback pitch controller for pitch control define pitch error θ e θ d θ and the iterative sliding surfaces are selected as 37 s 1 2 θ e k 1 2 tanh k 0 2 θ e θ e s 2 2 s 1 2 k 2 2 tanh s 1 2 d t s 3 2 s 2 2 k 3 2 tanh s 2 2 s 2 2 s 4 2 s 3 2 k 4 2 tanh s 3 2 s 3 2 similarly the increment feedback pitch control law is designed as 38 δ v s k 5 2 s 4 2 ε 2 tanh s 4 2 where δ v s is the virtual vertical rudder command k 0 2 k 1 2 k 2 2 k 3 2 k 4 2 k 5 2 ε 2 r are design parameters 3 3 3 allocation of virtual rudder commands a fixed mapping translation between virtual rudder commands and actuator s control inputs can be used for allocation in method ii define the fixed mapping g δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 as 39 g δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ v r 1 4 δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ v s 1 4 δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 δ 13 d δ 3 δ 1 δ 24 d δ 4 δ 2 where δ 13 d and δ 24 d are differential angle which can produce rolling torque and usually be set as zero hong and chitre 2015 then the inverse mapping i n v g can be derived as 40 i n v g δ 1 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 13 d δ 3 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 13 d δ 2 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 24 d δ 4 δ v r δ v s 1 2 δ 24 d as is illustrated above δ 13 d and δ 24 d are usually set zero a simplest mapping translation yields to 41 δ 1 δ 3 δ v r δ v s δ 2 δ 4 δ v r δ v s in normal conditions this fixed mapping translation can deal with most allocation examples however if δ v r δ v s 20 then δ 2 δ 4 40 is obtained obviously the allocation results are beyond the actuator s limitations in other words the mapping translation is not applicable to all allocation cases and an optimization based allocation method should be introduced as a supplement taking actuator constraints and energy consumption into consideration the optimization problem can be formulated as 42 min j ξ δ v δ v d t δ v δ v d 1 ξ δ t δ s t 0 ξ 1 δ v d δ v r δ v s 0 0 t δ v g δ δ k δ k 1 δ δ min δ δ max δ δ 1 δ 2 δ 3 δ 4 t in this optimization problem δ v d is the demanded virtual rudder commands produced by dynamics controller in which the desired differential rudder commands δ 13 d and δ 24 d are set zero δ v is the mapping result by using g δ presented in eq 39 this optimization problem is proposed to find a combination of δ to minimize the allocation error and control inputs in case that the fixed mapping translation is invalid sqp algorithm can be used to solve this optimization problem similarly the complete allocation strategy in method ii is illustrated in fig 4 firstly pseudo inverse tohidi et al 2016 of the fixed mapping will be used to find the actuator s control inputs if the results satisfy its limitations the solution is supposed to be valid otherwise it is invalid and the optimization based allocation method will be adopted for reallocation by adopting this strategy computation consumption can be greatly reduced because the iterative optimization computation is conducted only when necessary 4 numerical simulations in order to test the performance of the proposed methods numerical simulations are carried out by using simulink a common numerical simulation platform an open access hydrodynamic model is selected as the simulation model and the domain hydrodynamic parameters are listed in table 1 firstly simulations of heading and pitch control are carried out to demonstrate the fundamental function of every control method then simulations of path following in 3d space are conducted to verify whether the methods meet the basic practical requirements the detailed simulation scenarios are listed in table 2 for comparison of the performance control errors resultant drag force and computation consumption will be considered as criterions 4 1 case 1 heading and pitch control to verify the basic function of the proposed methods heading and pitch control simulation is carried out in this subsection suppose the vehicle is located at the position x 0 y 0 z 0 0 0 50 m with initial attitude φ 0 θ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 at the beginning of the simulations and the desired heading angle and pitch angle are set as ψ d 60 and θ d 10 in the simulation the surge velocity keeps at 5 knots constantly the control parameters of method i and method ii after tuning are listed as c ψ 0 5 k ψ 0 1 α ψ 0 001 c θ 0 5 k θ 0 1 α θ 0 001 k 0 1 0 15 k 1 1 1 1 k 2 1 0 9 k 3 1 2 k 4 1 0 1 ε 1 8 k 0 2 0 1 k 1 2 0 8 k 2 2 0 9 k 3 2 2 k 4 2 0 1 ε 2 5 heading and pitch control simulation without disturbances is carried out in scenario 1 fig 5 shows the heading and pitch control results when adopting different methods it can be seen that all the methods can make the vehicle approach the desired heading and pitch smoothly and remain stable eventually however the convergence rate is different method i is more effective in heading and pitch adjustment than method ii while pid control has the moderate performance for further analysis other factors such as the amplitude and frequency of control inputs should be taken into consideration as it is shown in fig 6 the control inputs produced by method i is heavier than those produced by method ii this is consistent with the fact that the better maneuverability a vehicle has the more control inputs it demands however the control inputs produced by method ii are smoother than by method ii and pid when there is no need for strong maneuverability smooth control inputs are preferred because more control inputs mean more energy consumption oscillate means noise and rapid change of control inputs will cause shock in actuator drivelines fig 7 presents another meaningful conclusion both in the results of method i and method ii the control inputs of rudder 1 are equivalent to rudder 3 throughout the simulation the same relationship also exists between rudder 2 and rudder 4 by conducting further analyses it can be concluded that synchronous movement of the diagonal control planes help to reduce the rolling torque to its minimum because their control efforts are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction therefore it is meaningful that the optimization process could be significantly simplified by assuming that the diagonal rudders move synchronously in other words computation consumption could be significantly reduced because the variables are reduced to two from four however this simplification can only be conducted when four rudders are operational and it will become illegal when one or more rudders break down quantitative comparisons including the mean square error mse mean absolute error mae max rudder deflection max and average rudder deflection aver are listed in table 3 according to max and average rudder deflection control inputs produced by method ii are gentle without dramatic changes but it takes more time to approach desired attitude except that method ii should still be preferred when there is no need for high maneuverability because of its superiority of low noise and energy saving allocation accuracy of both methods are also worth of analyses control efforts before and after allocation are shown in fig 8 as it is shown there are nearly no allocation errors in both methods except that minor errors still exist in the first 30 s when adopting method i actually the unexpected errors are reasonable because the max steering moment τ r and max pitch moment τ q are unavailable at the same time and this is a general characteristic of x rudder when great steering moment and pitch moment are demanded at the same time it is necessary to guarantee the pitch moment first and this is what the allocation methods do in addition the rolling torque after control allocation by these two control methods is nearly equal to zero so that the control allocation methods are proved to be valid in rolling torque elimination for quantitative analysis of allocation accuracy mse and mae are calculated and listed in table 4 since the units of control efforts are nm and degree in method i and method ii respectively allocation errors are normalized and represented in the form of fractional errors for fair comparison as the table shows mae are below 5 throughout the entire voyage which means that the allocation performance of both methods are satisfying and can be adopted in practical application computation consumption of both methods are shown in fig 9 the maximum iterations of each method are 14 and 9 respectively which illustrates that the optimization process of method i needs more time to converge the minimum iterations both are 7 and this happens when the desired heading and pitch are nearly approached the average iterations are 9 and 7 respectively which also indicates method ii costs less computation resource relatively in addition distribution of iterations of method ii is well centralized which means its stability is superior in summary method ii has faster convergence speed and better stability than method i in order to test the robustness to the environmental disturbances scenario 2 is designed and this is the simulation of heading and pitch control under disturbances in this simulation the disturbing forces and moments can be described as f y 0 11 10 5 sin 2 π 100 t 100 n f z 0 11 10 5 cos 2 π 100 t 100 n t y f y 40 n m t z f z 40 n m where f y is the lateral disturbing force f z is the vertical disturbing force t y is the disturbing moment along y axis t z is the disturbing moment along z axis the simulation results are presented in fig 10 and fig 11 as it is shown the disturbances cause the heading and pitch to fluctuate but it has less effect on heading control than on pitch control in general the performance of method i and method ii are nearly the same and both are better than pid therefore the robustness of method i and method ii against external disturbances are proofed besides there is no violent chattering in control inputs of both methods in other words smooth control inputs are obtained 4 2 case 2 path following in 3d space path following in 3d space is an important task for underwater vehicles to complete this task line of sight path following algorithm presented in xia et al 2019 xiang et al 2017 is adopted in this paper in this case we assume that the initial position of the vehicle is x 0 y 0 z 0 0 0 50 and the initial attitude is φ 0 θ 0 ψ 0 0 0 0 way points are set as w p 1 0 0 50 w p 2 800 0 100 w p 3 1000 0 100 w p 4 1000 3000 100 w p 5 4000 3000 100 w p 6 4000 0 100 w p 7 7000 0 100 and the surge velocity keeps at 5 knots throughout the simulation the simulation in scenario 3 is path following without disturbances the desired and actual trajectory of the vehicle are presented in fig 12 it can be seen that both the proposed methods in general can make the vehicle move along the desired path but the vehicle will deviate from path every time it dives or turns when this happens the vehicle will then go back to the path quickly under control of the proposed methods path projections are shown in fig 13 in this figure deviation at every turning is obvious and one can find the turning radius is about 180 m besides tracking performance of different methods are nearly the same on horizontal plane but variant on vertical plane another interesting finding is that the vehicle tends to dive down when it begins to turn and this happens at 220s 450s 860s and 1120s in fig 14 one can consider this behavior as the vehicle s hydrodynamic characteristics control inputs are shown in fig 15 it can be seen that control inputs produced by all methods are smooth except slight chattering when using method ii however the slight chattering can only be found at turning begins this is different from the fact that chattering usually arises at the end of correction if sliding mode control is adopted actually chattering at turning begins is caused by curvature discontinuity in the desired path which will result in great derivatives of heading or pitch error in order to avoid this problem sharp corner in desired path should be replaced with smooth curve matched with turning ability of the vehicle control efforts before and after allocation are shown in fig 16 as it is shown the allocation errors are almost zero no matter in horizontal plane or vertical plane though great maneuvering forces are required at 210s 830s 1500s and 2100s in addition the rolling torque is also limited to zero and this is consistent with the optimization objectives table 5 shows the results of quantitative analyses one can find that allocation errors of both methods in path following are small enough but method ii behaves more precisely since the relative errors are below 0 5 surprisingly computation iterations in path following are presented in fig 17 most optimization periods only require 6 or 7 iterations but 13 or 14 iterations are demanded for method i when desired control efforts become greater in general iteration distribution in this case is almost the same with the distribution in case 1 to verify the disturbance handling ability and robustness of the proposed methods path following simulation is carried out with same environmental disturbances in scenario 4 the disturbances considered in this scenario are the same as that in scenario 2 the desired path and initial conditions chosen here are the same as that in scenario 3 the path following results of scenario 4 are shown in fig 18 and fig 19 it can be seen that under the effect of disturbances path following errors in this scenario are bigger than that in scenario 3 whereas tracking errors of method ii is the smallest and tracking errors of pid is the biggest moreover oscillation can be observed in the results of method i and pid comparing with the results in scenario 3 one can find that tracking performance of method ii seems not to degenerate when encountering disturbances and the whole tracking process are smooth therefore it can be concluded that method ii has better robustness to environmental disturbances than method i and pid when path following 4 3 discussions combining the numerical results and corresponding analyses above some discussions can be drawn 1 from the aspect of functionality both method i control allocation of maneuvering forces and moments and method ii control allocation of virtual rudder commands are capable of governing the vehicle to complete various maneuvers such as heading adjustment depth adjustment path following in 3d space etc 2 from the aspect of maneuverability and energy saving the vehicles adopting method i will respond to commands more quickly than that using method ii the negatives are that it requires more and fast rudder deflection increases longitudinal drag resistance and produces shock and noise in driveline 3 from the aspect of allocation accuracy though both methods behave well in allocation accuracy method ii is superior nevertheless especially great horizontal and vertical control efforts are required at the same time allocation algorithm of method i will balance the control efforts and cause greater allocation errors inevitably 4 from the aspect of computation consuming when small control efforts are required 6 or 7 computing iterations are sufficient for both methods however if greater control efforts are needed up to 14 computing iterations are indispensable for method i while 6 to 8 iterations are common for method ii in all cases 5 from the aspect of parameter tuning and adaptability parameter tuning of method ii is more difficult than method i and pid but it would become easy if the right tuning procedure is adopted however method ii has better robustness against disturbances and its control performance is more satisfactory besides chattering is more likely to arise when adopting method i and pid in case of great disturbances to sum up each control allocation method has its advantages and disadvantages which method should be adopted to x rudder underwater vehicles depends on the requirement of maneuverability first or smoothness first except that the computation ability should also be taken into account 5 conclusion in this paper motion control methods for x rudder underwater vehicles are investigated for both circumstances that the hydrodynamic models are known and unknown under a successive control scheme the motion controller is constructed by a dynamics controller and a control allocator for hydrodynamic models which are known a model based sliding mode control is used to obtain steering moments which later be allocated by solving constrained nonlinear programming problem for hydrodynamic models which are unknown virtual cross rudder commands are generated by non model based iterative sliding mode increment feedback control and then be allocated based on a hypothetical mapping relationship in order to verify the functionality of the motion controllers numerical simulations are conducted and the results are analyzed in terms of maneuverability allocation accuracy energy saving and computation consuming the simulation results demonstrated that both methods can achieve satisfactory performance in heading control pitch control and path following but method i can make better maneuverability and method ii can guarantee smooth control inputs and better robustness against disturbances though the proposed methods are proved robust to disturbances to some extent extended disturbance observers and adaptive attitude tracking controller should still be investigated for more precise motion control therefore an extension of the work to include such adaptive motion control is highly relevant for future work except that actuators usually have varied response characteristics and the synchronism has great effect on allocation performance so characteristic compensation method remains a topic for future work besides rudder failure is a common fault for underwater vehicles and this will cause serious accidents since x rudder has inherent advantage in fault tolerant control it should also be integrated into motion controller to

21519,installation of a mobile jack up rigs with spudcan foundations are sometimes challenge due to uncertain offshore environments prediction of penetration resistance during installation is often necessary to avoid hazards such as punch through failure when the field monitored data deviates with these predictions engineers have to decide how severe this deviation is based on their experience this paper provides a method that can quantify the installation risk by a set of percentile curves of penetration resistance against depth the percentile curves can be quantified through combining a random large deformation finite element method with monte carlo simulation the spatial variability in seabed soils can be considered and the penetration resistance curves through the random soils can be obtained this model was verified by a spudcan installation penetration into deeper seabed finally four field cases in north east brazil and gulf of mexico are investigated results show that the installation risk during spudcan installation can be estimated by comparing the measured preloading and penetration depth values with the percentile curves which indicates the proposed method is capable to help decision making during spudcan installation keywords spudcan foundation uncertainty bearing capacity penetration resistance probabilistic method offshore engineering 1 introduction the mobile jack up drilling rigs are widely used in offshore gas and petroleum exploitation because of their proven flexibility mobility and cost effectiveness randolph et al 2005 as self elevating platform these rigs typically consist of a buoyant triangular hull supported by three or four independent retractable legs each connecting to a saucer shaped polygonal or quasi circular footing called spudcan foundation young et al 1984 the so called spudcan foundations are typically 10 20 m in diameter and penetrate into the seabed up to three times the spudcan diameter endley et al 1981 the prediction of penetration resistance during spudcan installation is very important to avoid any incident considerable studies have been conducted to investigate the penetration resistance of spudcan foundations in uniform soil with a characterized deterministic strength profile craig and chua 1990 hossain et al 2003 2014 hossain and randolph 2009 p zhang et al 2011 stanier 2014 ullah et al 2014 2015 wang and bienen 2016 li et al 2017 li et al 2018 however the seabed soils were often spatially varying because of a combination of geologic environmental and physical chemical factors chiasson et al 1995 dasaka and zhang 2012 ching and phoon 2013 lloret cabot et al 2014 this spatial variability of soils can significantly affect the bearing capacity of the foundations the failure plane becomes asymmetric and tends to follow the weakest path which results in a reduction in the bearing capacity fenton and griffiths 2003 popescu et al 2005 cho and park 2010 ahmed and soubra 2012 nobahar and popescu 2000 and griffiths et al 2002 observed that the mean bearing capacity may decrease by 20 30 for spatially variable soils compared with that of the homogeneous soil with the same mean soil properties l li et al 2017 found that about 70 of the cases in spatially variable soils have smaller vertical bearing capacity than that in the uniform soil cassidy et al 2013 observed that the bearing capacity for pure vertical horizontal and moment loads decreased with increasing variability of the soil strength to investigate the effects of spatial variability of soil yi et al 2020 combined the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel finite element method with random field theory to investigate the penetration responses of spudcan foundation in spatially variable soils in order to consider the uncertainty during spudcan installation houlsby 2010 suggested that the probabilistic percentile of the penetration resistance curves can be used to assess the installation risk the percentile of the penetration resistance was quantified using a database contained 96 field records for spudcans in clay by 2010 they found that the 5th percentile curve can be obtained if the calculated resistance against depth curve is multiplied by 0 64 the 95th percentile curve can be obtained by multiplying 1 42 the bounds between the 5th percentile curve and the 95th curve can provide bounds within which 90 measurements would be expected to fall this result indicates that the percentile curves can be an effective measure to quantify the installation risk however this quantification relies on field records which may be difficult to obtain for many other complex geological conditions this study presents a novel method that is capable of quantifying the installation risk through percentile curves that obtained by combing a random large deformation finite element rldfe method li et al 2020 with monte carlo simulation the uncertainties in seabed soils are represented by random fields which is further mapped into a large deformation finite element model the penetration resistance curves can be fully obtained during spudcan installation given a designated random field the possibilities of different penetration curves considering the spatial variability of soils can then be investigated using monte carlo simulation the percentile curves are further quantified which may be used to quantify the risk of installation finally four cases in north ease brazil and gulf of mexico are presented to demonstrate the proposed method 2 spatial variability in offshore soils soil properties are inherently variable due to complex physical and chemical changes during their weathering and transportation process the spatial variability of the soils has been reported by many researchers wu et al 1987 nadim 1988 randolph et al 1998 bienen et al 2011 li et al 2015a the spatial variation of soils can be characterized by a trend and a residual variability baecher and christian 2003 1 z x t x u x in which z x is the soil property at location x t x is the trend at x and u x is the residual variation the deterministic trend is usually estimated by fitting mathematical functions to the spatial data the residuals around the trend are usually spatially correlated to one another in space this correlation can be represented by an autocorrelation function with a parameter called scale of fluctuation fenton and griffiths 2008 the soil property at two locations which are within the scale of fluctuation is closely related the spatial variation of soils is often simulated by a random field in which the soil properties at different locations are represented by different values there are several random field generation approaches available fenton and griffiths 2008 bari and shahin 2015 jamshidi and kamyab 2015 the expansion optimal linear estimation eole method is employed in this study because of its accuracy and efficiency li and kiureghian 1993 3 random large deformation finite element model there are several methods for analyzing large deformation problems in soils with deterministic strength profiles such as the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method the remeshing and interpolation technique with small strain ritss method and the cel method tho et al 2010 qiu and henke 2011 hossain et al 2014 wang et al 2015 liu et al 1986 ghosh and kikuchi 1991 nazem et al 2006 hu and randolph 1998 yi et al 2020 combined the cel method with random field theory to investigate the penetration responses of spudcan foundation in spatially variable soils the surrounding soil will redistribute during the large deformation which significantly affects the resistance and failure mechanism of the foundation li et al 2020 further proposed a random large deformation finite element method in spatially variable soils which can simulate the redistribution process of random soil this method combined spatially variable soils with finite element models by defining the spatial variable soil properties as field variable and assigning them to the finite element models as the initial condition the large penetration of foundation is simulated by applying a number of load or displacement increments on the foundation in each increment a lagrangian analysis is performed until the finite element mesh is distorted the mesh is then adjusted by remeshing after remeshing the spatially variable soil properties are mapped into the new model using the abaqus built in technique of mesh to mesh solution mapping the accuracy of this mapping technique has been assessed by li et al 2020 and the results are satisfied the rldfe method is implemented through python script which could conduct the random large deformation analysis automatically in abaqus it is convenient to conduct monte carlo simulations for the spatially variable soils using this method therefore the rldfe method was employed to simulate the spudcan penetrating into spatially variable soil a typical circular spudcan foundation with a diameter d of 18 m and a height of 8 83 m is considered in this study the spudcan consists of a top cone a thin upstand a bottom cone and a 60 protruding spigot of height 0 09d see fig 1 the top and bottom slope angle are 30 and 15 from the horizontal respectively the spudcan was modelled as rigid body with applied load related to a reference point rp at the center of the section of the lowest maximum bearing area see fig 2 the soils domain was chosen as 7d in width and 5d in height to ensure that there are no boundary effects the horizontal displacements at both sides of the model were constrained and all degree of freedoms are fixed at the base of the model the soil was modelled as an elastoplastic material obeying a tresca yield criterion the elastic response is defined by the young s modulus and poisson s ratio the poisson s ratio was considered as 0 49 to model the undrained conditions of no volume change and to ensure numerical stability taiebat and carter 2000 the young s modulus e was considered as correlated to the undrained shear strength s u with a ratio of e s u 500 the undrained shear strength of the soils was modelled as random fields the spudcan soil interface was modelled as fully rough by using a tie constraint between the soil and the spudcan the maximum shear stress allowable on the spudcan soil interface was equal to the undrained shear strength of the soil and the tensile stress was allowed to develop on the interface in order to simulate the interface adhesion suction which has been observed in centrifuge testing purwana et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 2012 considering the small grain size of the clay particles the pores on surface of steel are large the failure on the soil spudcan interface is most likely to occur in the soil immediately adjacent to the spudcan instead of a frictional type of failure on the interface the interface setting adopted in the analyses is therefore considered representative of the reality the finite element mesh for the spudcan soil model is shown in fig 2 the minimum elements size is d 60 the numbers of soil elements have been investigated to balance the accuracy and the efficiency of the analysis the load penetration curves obtained with different numbers of elements i e 43800 elements 87 000 elements 114 600 elements and 176 300 elements are depicted in fig 3 note that soil elements around the penetrating spudcan were meshed in a higher density to ensure the accuracy of rldfe analysis the numerical results with 87 000 elements 114 600 elements and 176 300 elements are identical indicating that 87 000 elements are satisfied and hence used in this study 4 results 4 1 model verification for verification a deterministic case of spudcan penetrating was performed the undrained shear strength of the soil was 0 1 kpa at sea bed level and increased linearly with depth at a gradient of 1 2 kpa m as shown in fig 4 a during penetration the soil was disturbed and the undrained shear strength of the soil was redistributed after a penetration of three times diameter of spudcan i e 3d the redistribution of the soil is shown in fig 4b which is similar to that found by tho et al 2010 and hossain and randolph 2009 the penetration resistance at each depth during the installation can be obtained through a simulation this resistance is often expressed by a bearing capacity factor n cd which can be calculated according to the guidance by american bureau of shipping abs 2017 2 n cd q u s u 0 γ v a s u 0 γ h c s u 0 where q u is the penetration resistance s u 0 is the undrained shear strength at the spudcan base level note that for the random soil s u0 is the mean undrained shear strength at the spudcan base level v is the volume of the spudcan a is the largest cross sectional area of the spudcan h c is the cavity depth γ is the effective unit weight of the soil the bearing capacity factor of the spudcan foundation versus normalized penetration depth d d was shown in fig 5 the result of large deformation finite analysis conducted by hossain and randolph 2009 is also shown in the figure notice that for the purpose of verification the result shown in fig 5 does not consider the overburden pressure above the cavity i e the third term of equation 2 which is consistent with hossain and randolph 2009 it can be seen that the bearing capacity factors in both studies converge to a stable value where the full flow mechanism can be observed the final bearing capacity factor in this study is 11 9 which is close to 11 3 from hossain and randolph 2009 therefore the rldfe method is suitable to simulate the installation of the spudcan foundation 4 2 failure mechanism in spatially variable soils the undrained shear strength of seabed soils is often spatially varied and modelled as a log normally distributed random field the undrained shear strength s u increases linearly with depth the trend of the strength is assumed to be the same with that of the deterministic case that is 0 1 kpa at the mudline and a gradient of 1 2 kpa m the cov of the undrained shear strength is 0 3 the autocorrelation function is assumed as square exponential model with the scale of fluctuation of 50 7 m in horizontal direction and 3 8 m in vertical direction phoon and kulhawy 1999 the eole method is employed to generate the random fields of undrained shear strength a visualization of the random fields is shown in fig 6 a the undrained shear strength fluctuating in the spatially variable seabed is shown in fig 6b installation of the spudcan was simulated by penetrating the spudcan into the random soil using the rldfe method the variation of the bearing capacity factor with penetration depth is shown in fig 7 the bearing capacity factor increases with increasing penetration depth at the beginning of penetration because of the increasing undrained shear strength as shown in fig 8 a the shear plane in grey color reached to the surface of the random soil at penetration depth of 1 0d when the spudcan penetrates to 1 3d the bearing capacity factor reduces because the shear strength beneath 2 5d is much weaker which lead to a smaller penetration resistance and in turn a smaller bearing capacity factor the shear plane develops along the weaker soils as shown in fig 8b when the spudcan reaches about 2 6d the bearing capacity increases again because that the underlying soil at the depth of about 3 5d is much stronger as shown in fig 8c finally a localized full flow mechanism is found comparing with the bearing capacity factor curve in uniform soil calculated using eq 2 which increase linearly with the depth the bearing capacity factor in random soils can be much complicated when weaker soils are presented the bearing capacity may decrease significantly which pose great threaten on the installation of spudcan the spatial pattern of the random soils significantly affects the bearing capacity factor therefore another three random soils were investigated and shown in fig 9 in the first random soil 1 as shown in fig 9a the bearing capacity factor decreases at the beginning of penetration as shown in fig 10 beneath the depth of 2 1d the bearing capacity factor becomes increasing in the second random soil 2 the trend of variation of bearing capacity factor is similar to that in uniform soil but the bearing capacity factors in this random soil are smaller than that in uniform soil because of lower undrained shear strength around the spudcan as shown in fig 9b in the third random soil 3 shown in fig 9c the bearing capacity factor reduces with increasing penetration depth due to the weak soil around spudcan as the spudcan reaches about 1 1d the bearing capacity factor increases at the penetration depth of 2 3d the bearing capacity factor reduces slightly in summary the spatial variability of the soils has a great influence on the bearing capacity factor therefore taking into account the spatial variation in the soil properties will enable to quantify the variation into bearing capacity and lead to a more reasonable assessment of the installation risk 4 3 probabilistic percentile of the penetration resistance the percentile of the penetration resistance at various depths can be quantified by analyzing the probabilistic distribution of the resistance considering the spatial variability of the soils in this section the possibilities of the penetration resistance in random soils are investigated through monte carlo simulation 4 3 1 4 3 1 monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulations are performed for 400 random soils and the subsequent random large deformation finite element analysis in this section to statistically investigate the penetration resistance the 400 random soils have a maximum error of 3 of the mean value of the undrained shear strength li et al 2015b the penetration resistance versus the penetration depth curves of spudcan foundation in the 400 random soils are shown in fig 11 a for the purpose of comparison the penetration resistance curve in the uniform soil with soil properties the same as the trend of the random soils is calculated according to eq 3 recommended by abs 2017 3 q u n cd s u 0 γ v a γ h c in order to obtain the bearing capacity factor n cd a parametric study was carried out all of the results from the spudcan penetration analysis with parameters in table 1 are depicted in fig 12 it can be seen that all of the results tend to converge which is consistent with that from hossain and randolph 2009 the bearing capacity factor can be calculated by the following equation 4 n cd 9 1 1 0 1 d d 11 6 the cavity depth h c in eq 3 are calculated by the method proposed by hossain and randolph 2009 5 h c d s uh γ d 0 55 1 4 s uh γ d where s uh is undrained shear strength at the backflow depth where the soil becomes back flow to the top of the spudcan see more details in hossain and randolph 2009 it is found that the penetration resistance of the spudcan foundation in random soils can be larger or smaller than the calculated penetration resistance in uniform soils for example the penetration resistance of about 39 cases in random soils are smaller than that in uniform soils at the penetration resistance of 1 0d to facilitate the comparison a resistance ratio η between the random soils and uniform soil is defined as 6 η q u r a n q u c a l where q u r a n is the penetration resistance in random soil and q u c a l is the penetration resistance calculated by eq 3 if η is less than 1 the penetration resistance estimated using eq 3 is overestimated and in turn the foundation will be in an unconservative side the probabilistic density of the resistance ratio at various depth is presented in fig 11b the resistance ratio is found to follow normal distribution at each depth when the penetration depth reached 1 0d the resistance ratio is less than 1 in 39 of the random cases as the spudcan penetrates into deeper depth the percentage of resistance ratio that less than 1 become larger which indicated that the penetration resistance tends to smaller than that in uniform soil for example there are only 38 8 of random cases that have resistance ratio larger than 1 when the spudcan penetrates into 3 0d fig 13 shows the variation of the mean value and the standard deviation of the resistance ratio with penetration depths the mean resistance ratio is larger than 1 when the penetration depths are less than 1 14d after 1 14d the mean resistance ratio is smaller than 1 the standard deviation of the resistance ratio is about 0 035 0 046 the mean values can be fitted by an exponential function as in eq 7 and the standard deviations can be fitted by a square exponential function as in eq 8 7 μ η a 1 e x p a 2 d d a 3 e x p a 4 d d 8 σ η b 1 e x p d d b 2 b 3 2 b 4 e x p d d b 5 b 6 2 where ai i 1 2 4 and bj j 1 2 6 are fitting parameters and listed in table 2 these statistical properties of penetration resistance are then used to calculate percentiles of the penetration resistance 4 3 2 4 3 2 percentiles of the penetration resistance a percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall for example a resistance ratio of 0 95 for the 25th percentile indicates that 25 percent of the resistance ratio are below 0 95 as the probabilistic distribution of resistance ratio follows normal distribution the percentile p η at a given resistance ratio η can be calculated by the following equation 9 p η 1 2 π σ η η e x p η μ η 2 2 σ η 2 d η the resistance ratios for several common percentiles are given in table 3 the mean value and the standard deviation of the resistance ratio at different depths can be calculated by eq 7 and eq 8 for example at the depth of 1 0d the mean value and the standard deviation are 1 0 and 0 04 respectively therefore at this depth the resistance ratio for the 5th percentile is 0 93 i e 1 0 1 64 0 04 0 93 and the resistance ratio for the 95th percentile is 1 07 i e 1 0 1 64 0 04 1 07 this result indicates that if the penetration resistance calculated by eq 3 against depth curve is multiplied by 0 93 and 1 07 these curves would provide a bound within which 90 of the penetration resistance would be expected to fall therefore according to table 3 a set of percentiles can be attained and were shown in fig 14 the percentile of the penetration resistance can be used to help decision at practical engineering if the measured field data fall within the 25th to 75th percentiles the spudcan behavior is as expected and the risk is very low if the observed field data lie outside 5th to 95th percentiles the risk of a rare event becomes higher which should ring alarm bells for the engineer houlsby 2010 5 field case study field cases of installation of spudcan foundations are presented in this section to demonstrate the proposed method how to provide a quantitative assessment of the installation risk one case in subsection 5 1 is in north east brazil reported by rapoport and young 1988 three cases in subsection 5 2 are in gulf of mexico reported by menzies and roper 2008 all of these four cases are penetration of spudcan foundations into normally consolidated clay seabed which is detailed in table 4 5 1 field case in north east brazil rapoport and young 1988 reported a case concerning installation of a three legged drilling unit into seabed in north east brazil the diameter of the spudcan is 12 2 m the undrained shear strength of the soil at sea bed level is 5 0 kpa and the gradient is 1 1 kpa m the effective unit weight of the soil is 6 7 kn m3 according to the conditions of the sea bed soil the vertical bearing capacity of the spudcan foundation at various penetration depths can be calculated using the abs method the penetration curves predicted by abs method are shown in fig 15 when the preload of 31 6 mn was required the predicted penetration depth was about 16 5 m however during installation the required preload was not reached when penetrating to 16 5 m the observed penetration depth in field is about 17 0 m under a preload of 31 6 mn in order to assess the risk during the spudcan installation in this case the quantitative percentiles proposed in this paper are employed according to table 3 the resistance ratio for the 5th and 95th percentiles are μ η 1 64 σ η and μ η 1 64 σ η respectively the penetration resistance calculated by abs method against depth curve is multiplied by μ η 1 64 σ η to give the 5th percentile curve and multiplied by μ η 1 64 σ η to give the curve with 95th percentile as shown in fig 15 these two curves would provide a bound within which 90 of the penetration resistance would be expected to fall for example at the penetration depth of 16 5 m the mean value and the standard deviation are 0 99 and 0 037 respectively thus the resistance ratio for the 5th and 95th percentiles are 0 93 and 1 05 respectively the penetration resistance calculated by abs method at the depth of 16 5 m is 31 6 mn therefore at the penetration depth of 16 5 m the 5th percentile penetration resistance is 29 4 mn and the 95th percentile penetration resistance is 33 2 mn this result indicates that at a depth of 16 5 m the possible preload ranges from 29 4 mn to 33 2 mn with a probability of 90 the results also indicate that the largest penetration depth should not exceed 17 9 m at which the preload range with 90 probability is from 31 6 mn to 35 6 mn in reality when the penetration depth reached 17 m the preload reached the required preload the penetration depth is very important as it closely relates with the design length of spudcan legs the percentiles proposed in this paper can be used to predict the range of the penetration depth of the spudcan foundation in this case with a preload of 31 6 mn the penetration depth on the curve with 95th percentile is 15 4 m and the penetration depth on the curve with 5th percentile is 17 9 m which indicate that the penetration depth has 90 probability to fall in the range of 15 4 m 17 9 m the actual penetration depth of 17 0 m falls in this predicted range 5 2 field cases in gulf of mexico menzies and roper 2008 reported spudcan penetration with measured load penetration records at gulf of mexico three cases are used in this study to demonstrate how the predicted percentile curves help quantifying installation risk the soil properties of these three cases are summarized in table 4 the undrained shear strength at mudline ranges from 2 4 kpa to 5 7 kpa and the gradient ranges from 1 18 kpa m to 1 59 kpa m the effective unit weight of the clay ranges from 4 7 kn m3 to 5 5 kn m3 strain softening phenomenon of the clay was observed which is different from the case in north east brazil thus in this subsection the penetration resistance calculated using abs method is reduced by 20 to consider the strain softening of the clay as suggested by menzies and roper 2008 and hossain et al 2014 fig 16 shows the penetration resistance profile calculated by abs method and that measured in field the predicted 1st 5th 95th and 99th percentiles of these three cases can be obtained using the proposed method and are also shown in fig 16 in the second field case as shown in fig 16a the measured penetration resistance values are lower than that predicted by abs method during the first four loading stages will this low resistance threaten the safety of the installation the additional percentile curves can help the engineer to quantify the risk the measured resistance values are all lying between the 5th and 95th percentile curves which gives a range of resistance and depth with 90 probability as such the engineers can estimate whether the spudcan foundation is safe or not under the next preloading according to this range for example before applying the loading of 54 5 mn at the fifth stage a range of penetration depth i e from 27 6 m to 30 7 m can be provided by the 5th and 95th percentile curves in reality under the preload of 54 5 mn the penetration depth of spudcan foundation is 29 7 m which confirms the estimation based on the percentile curves in the third field case the first measured penetration depth at the loading of 31 2 mn is even larger than that predicted by 1 percentile as shown in fig 16b which indicates that the variability of the seabed soil may be higher than expected and the risk of spudcan installation is relatively high therefore small loading increment and low loading rate should be adopted in reality under the preload of 44 0 mn the spudcan foundation penetrates suddenly from a depth of 18 6 m 21 6 m which confirms the relatively high risk of installation in this field in the fourth field case the measured penetration depth values under the first three preloading levels are between the range bounded by the 1 percentile and the 5 percentile curves which indicates that the seabed soil may be softer than expected as all of the measured values are within the range with 98 probability but out of the range with 95 probability the engineers should pay close attention to the installation in the following preloading process the penetration depths are around the values given by the 1 percentile curve in summary the percentiles proposed in this study was illustrated by the field cases through adopting the percentiles the bounds of the penetration resistance with different probabilities can be obtained furthermore the range of the penetration depth of the spudcan foundation can be attained which is very important for the installation of a foundation 6 summary and conclusions this paper proposed a probabilistic method for quantifying the risk of spudcan installation by establishing a range of percentile curves of penetration resistance against depth the percentile curves were quantified through combing the random large deformation finite element method with monte carlo simulation the spatial variability of the seabed soil can be reasonably considered the results indicate that the spatial variation of the seabed soil can significantly affect the failure mechanism during penetration and the penetration resistance curve a field case study of a spudcan installation in north east brazil was investigated where the required load of 31 6 mn was not attained as expected when penetrating to the predicted 16 5 m the percentile curves were presented and the results show that the penetration depth should be fall in a range of 15 4 m 17 9 m with a probability of 90 at the required preload the estimated range agrees well with the field observation of 17 m another three field cases of the spudcan installation in gulf of mexico were also presented in this paper to demonstrate how the percentile curves are used to estimate the risk and help decision making during spudcan installation it s worth noting that only a set of representative statistical parameters of the soil were adopted in this paper in practice the statistical parameters of the soil should be determined according to the in situ conditions to give more accurate percentile curves credit authorship contribution statement wuzhang luo

21519,installation of a mobile jack up rigs with spudcan foundations are sometimes challenge due to uncertain offshore environments prediction of penetration resistance during installation is often necessary to avoid hazards such as punch through failure when the field monitored data deviates with these predictions engineers have to decide how severe this deviation is based on their experience this paper provides a method that can quantify the installation risk by a set of percentile curves of penetration resistance against depth the percentile curves can be quantified through combining a random large deformation finite element method with monte carlo simulation the spatial variability in seabed soils can be considered and the penetration resistance curves through the random soils can be obtained this model was verified by a spudcan installation penetration into deeper seabed finally four field cases in north east brazil and gulf of mexico are investigated results show that the installation risk during spudcan installation can be estimated by comparing the measured preloading and penetration depth values with the percentile curves which indicates the proposed method is capable to help decision making during spudcan installation keywords spudcan foundation uncertainty bearing capacity penetration resistance probabilistic method offshore engineering 1 introduction the mobile jack up drilling rigs are widely used in offshore gas and petroleum exploitation because of their proven flexibility mobility and cost effectiveness randolph et al 2005 as self elevating platform these rigs typically consist of a buoyant triangular hull supported by three or four independent retractable legs each connecting to a saucer shaped polygonal or quasi circular footing called spudcan foundation young et al 1984 the so called spudcan foundations are typically 10 20 m in diameter and penetrate into the seabed up to three times the spudcan diameter endley et al 1981 the prediction of penetration resistance during spudcan installation is very important to avoid any incident considerable studies have been conducted to investigate the penetration resistance of spudcan foundations in uniform soil with a characterized deterministic strength profile craig and chua 1990 hossain et al 2003 2014 hossain and randolph 2009 p zhang et al 2011 stanier 2014 ullah et al 2014 2015 wang and bienen 2016 li et al 2017 li et al 2018 however the seabed soils were often spatially varying because of a combination of geologic environmental and physical chemical factors chiasson et al 1995 dasaka and zhang 2012 ching and phoon 2013 lloret cabot et al 2014 this spatial variability of soils can significantly affect the bearing capacity of the foundations the failure plane becomes asymmetric and tends to follow the weakest path which results in a reduction in the bearing capacity fenton and griffiths 2003 popescu et al 2005 cho and park 2010 ahmed and soubra 2012 nobahar and popescu 2000 and griffiths et al 2002 observed that the mean bearing capacity may decrease by 20 30 for spatially variable soils compared with that of the homogeneous soil with the same mean soil properties l li et al 2017 found that about 70 of the cases in spatially variable soils have smaller vertical bearing capacity than that in the uniform soil cassidy et al 2013 observed that the bearing capacity for pure vertical horizontal and moment loads decreased with increasing variability of the soil strength to investigate the effects of spatial variability of soil yi et al 2020 combined the coupled eulerian lagrangian cel finite element method with random field theory to investigate the penetration responses of spudcan foundation in spatially variable soils in order to consider the uncertainty during spudcan installation houlsby 2010 suggested that the probabilistic percentile of the penetration resistance curves can be used to assess the installation risk the percentile of the penetration resistance was quantified using a database contained 96 field records for spudcans in clay by 2010 they found that the 5th percentile curve can be obtained if the calculated resistance against depth curve is multiplied by 0 64 the 95th percentile curve can be obtained by multiplying 1 42 the bounds between the 5th percentile curve and the 95th curve can provide bounds within which 90 measurements would be expected to fall this result indicates that the percentile curves can be an effective measure to quantify the installation risk however this quantification relies on field records which may be difficult to obtain for many other complex geological conditions this study presents a novel method that is capable of quantifying the installation risk through percentile curves that obtained by combing a random large deformation finite element rldfe method li et al 2020 with monte carlo simulation the uncertainties in seabed soils are represented by random fields which is further mapped into a large deformation finite element model the penetration resistance curves can be fully obtained during spudcan installation given a designated random field the possibilities of different penetration curves considering the spatial variability of soils can then be investigated using monte carlo simulation the percentile curves are further quantified which may be used to quantify the risk of installation finally four cases in north ease brazil and gulf of mexico are presented to demonstrate the proposed method 2 spatial variability in offshore soils soil properties are inherently variable due to complex physical and chemical changes during their weathering and transportation process the spatial variability of the soils has been reported by many researchers wu et al 1987 nadim 1988 randolph et al 1998 bienen et al 2011 li et al 2015a the spatial variation of soils can be characterized by a trend and a residual variability baecher and christian 2003 1 z x t x u x in which z x is the soil property at location x t x is the trend at x and u x is the residual variation the deterministic trend is usually estimated by fitting mathematical functions to the spatial data the residuals around the trend are usually spatially correlated to one another in space this correlation can be represented by an autocorrelation function with a parameter called scale of fluctuation fenton and griffiths 2008 the soil property at two locations which are within the scale of fluctuation is closely related the spatial variation of soils is often simulated by a random field in which the soil properties at different locations are represented by different values there are several random field generation approaches available fenton and griffiths 2008 bari and shahin 2015 jamshidi and kamyab 2015 the expansion optimal linear estimation eole method is employed in this study because of its accuracy and efficiency li and kiureghian 1993 3 random large deformation finite element model there are several methods for analyzing large deformation problems in soils with deterministic strength profiles such as the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method the remeshing and interpolation technique with small strain ritss method and the cel method tho et al 2010 qiu and henke 2011 hossain et al 2014 wang et al 2015 liu et al 1986 ghosh and kikuchi 1991 nazem et al 2006 hu and randolph 1998 yi et al 2020 combined the cel method with random field theory to investigate the penetration responses of spudcan foundation in spatially variable soils the surrounding soil will redistribute during the large deformation which significantly affects the resistance and failure mechanism of the foundation li et al 2020 further proposed a random large deformation finite element method in spatially variable soils which can simulate the redistribution process of random soil this method combined spatially variable soils with finite element models by defining the spatial variable soil properties as field variable and assigning them to the finite element models as the initial condition the large penetration of foundation is simulated by applying a number of load or displacement increments on the foundation in each increment a lagrangian analysis is performed until the finite element mesh is distorted the mesh is then adjusted by remeshing after remeshing the spatially variable soil properties are mapped into the new model using the abaqus built in technique of mesh to mesh solution mapping the accuracy of this mapping technique has been assessed by li et al 2020 and the results are satisfied the rldfe method is implemented through python script which could conduct the random large deformation analysis automatically in abaqus it is convenient to conduct monte carlo simulations for the spatially variable soils using this method therefore the rldfe method was employed to simulate the spudcan penetrating into spatially variable soil a typical circular spudcan foundation with a diameter d of 18 m and a height of 8 83 m is considered in this study the spudcan consists of a top cone a thin upstand a bottom cone and a 60 protruding spigot of height 0 09d see fig 1 the top and bottom slope angle are 30 and 15 from the horizontal respectively the spudcan was modelled as rigid body with applied load related to a reference point rp at the center of the section of the lowest maximum bearing area see fig 2 the soils domain was chosen as 7d in width and 5d in height to ensure that there are no boundary effects the horizontal displacements at both sides of the model were constrained and all degree of freedoms are fixed at the base of the model the soil was modelled as an elastoplastic material obeying a tresca yield criterion the elastic response is defined by the young s modulus and poisson s ratio the poisson s ratio was considered as 0 49 to model the undrained conditions of no volume change and to ensure numerical stability taiebat and carter 2000 the young s modulus e was considered as correlated to the undrained shear strength s u with a ratio of e s u 500 the undrained shear strength of the soils was modelled as random fields the spudcan soil interface was modelled as fully rough by using a tie constraint between the soil and the spudcan the maximum shear stress allowable on the spudcan soil interface was equal to the undrained shear strength of the soil and the tensile stress was allowed to develop on the interface in order to simulate the interface adhesion suction which has been observed in centrifuge testing purwana et al 2005 zhang et al 2011 2012 considering the small grain size of the clay particles the pores on surface of steel are large the failure on the soil spudcan interface is most likely to occur in the soil immediately adjacent to the spudcan instead of a frictional type of failure on the interface the interface setting adopted in the analyses is therefore considered representative of the reality the finite element mesh for the spudcan soil model is shown in fig 2 the minimum elements size is d 60 the numbers of soil elements have been investigated to balance the accuracy and the efficiency of the analysis the load penetration curves obtained with different numbers of elements i e 43800 elements 87 000 elements 114 600 elements and 176 300 elements are depicted in fig 3 note that soil elements around the penetrating spudcan were meshed in a higher density to ensure the accuracy of rldfe analysis the numerical results with 87 000 elements 114 600 elements and 176 300 elements are identical indicating that 87 000 elements are satisfied and hence used in this study 4 results 4 1 model verification for verification a deterministic case of spudcan penetrating was performed the undrained shear strength of the soil was 0 1 kpa at sea bed level and increased linearly with depth at a gradient of 1 2 kpa m as shown in fig 4 a during penetration the soil was disturbed and the undrained shear strength of the soil was redistributed after a penetration of three times diameter of spudcan i e 3d the redistribution of the soil is shown in fig 4b which is similar to that found by tho et al 2010 and hossain and randolph 2009 the penetration resistance at each depth during the installation can be obtained through a simulation this resistance is often expressed by a bearing capacity factor n cd which can be calculated according to the guidance by american bureau of shipping abs 2017 2 n cd q u s u 0 γ v a s u 0 γ h c s u 0 where q u is the penetration resistance s u 0 is the undrained shear strength at the spudcan base level note that for the random soil s u0 is the mean undrained shear strength at the spudcan base level v is the volume of the spudcan a is the largest cross sectional area of the spudcan h c is the cavity depth γ is the effective unit weight of the soil the bearing capacity factor of the spudcan foundation versus normalized penetration depth d d was shown in fig 5 the result of large deformation finite analysis conducted by hossain and randolph 2009 is also shown in the figure notice that for the purpose of verification the result shown in fig 5 does not consider the overburden pressure above the cavity i e the third term of equation 2 which is consistent with hossain and randolph 2009 it can be seen that the bearing capacity factors in both studies converge to a stable value where the full flow mechanism can be observed the final bearing capacity factor in this study is 11 9 which is close to 11 3 from hossain and randolph 2009 therefore the rldfe method is suitable to simulate the installation of the spudcan foundation 4 2 failure mechanism in spatially variable soils the undrained shear strength of seabed soils is often spatially varied and modelled as a log normally distributed random field the undrained shear strength s u increases linearly with depth the trend of the strength is assumed to be the same with that of the deterministic case that is 0 1 kpa at the mudline and a gradient of 1 2 kpa m the cov of the undrained shear strength is 0 3 the autocorrelation function is assumed as square exponential model with the scale of fluctuation of 50 7 m in horizontal direction and 3 8 m in vertical direction phoon and kulhawy 1999 the eole method is employed to generate the random fields of undrained shear strength a visualization of the random fields is shown in fig 6 a the undrained shear strength fluctuating in the spatially variable seabed is shown in fig 6b installation of the spudcan was simulated by penetrating the spudcan into the random soil using the rldfe method the variation of the bearing capacity factor with penetration depth is shown in fig 7 the bearing capacity factor increases with increasing penetration depth at the beginning of penetration because of the increasing undrained shear strength as shown in fig 8 a the shear plane in grey color reached to the surface of the random soil at penetration depth of 1 0d when the spudcan penetrates to 1 3d the bearing capacity factor reduces because the shear strength beneath 2 5d is much weaker which lead to a smaller penetration resistance and in turn a smaller bearing capacity factor the shear plane develops along the weaker soils as shown in fig 8b when the spudcan reaches about 2 6d the bearing capacity increases again because that the underlying soil at the depth of about 3 5d is much stronger as shown in fig 8c finally a localized full flow mechanism is found comparing with the bearing capacity factor curve in uniform soil calculated using eq 2 which increase linearly with the depth the bearing capacity factor in random soils can be much complicated when weaker soils are presented the bearing capacity may decrease significantly which pose great threaten on the installation of spudcan the spatial pattern of the random soils significantly affects the bearing capacity factor therefore another three random soils were investigated and shown in fig 9 in the first random soil 1 as shown in fig 9a the bearing capacity factor decreases at the beginning of penetration as shown in fig 10 beneath the depth of 2 1d the bearing capacity factor becomes increasing in the second random soil 2 the trend of variation of bearing capacity factor is similar to that in uniform soil but the bearing capacity factors in this random soil are smaller than that in uniform soil because of lower undrained shear strength around the spudcan as shown in fig 9b in the third random soil 3 shown in fig 9c the bearing capacity factor reduces with increasing penetration depth due to the weak soil around spudcan as the spudcan reaches about 1 1d the bearing capacity factor increases at the penetration depth of 2 3d the bearing capacity factor reduces slightly in summary the spatial variability of the soils has a great influence on the bearing capacity factor therefore taking into account the spatial variation in the soil properties will enable to quantify the variation into bearing capacity and lead to a more reasonable assessment of the installation risk 4 3 probabilistic percentile of the penetration resistance the percentile of the penetration resistance at various depths can be quantified by analyzing the probabilistic distribution of the resistance considering the spatial variability of the soils in this section the possibilities of the penetration resistance in random soils are investigated through monte carlo simulation 4 3 1 4 3 1 monte carlo simulation monte carlo simulations are performed for 400 random soils and the subsequent random large deformation finite element analysis in this section to statistically investigate the penetration resistance the 400 random soils have a maximum error of 3 of the mean value of the undrained shear strength li et al 2015b the penetration resistance versus the penetration depth curves of spudcan foundation in the 400 random soils are shown in fig 11 a for the purpose of comparison the penetration resistance curve in the uniform soil with soil properties the same as the trend of the random soils is calculated according to eq 3 recommended by abs 2017 3 q u n cd s u 0 γ v a γ h c in order to obtain the bearing capacity factor n cd a parametric study was carried out all of the results from the spudcan penetration analysis with parameters in table 1 are depicted in fig 12 it can be seen that all of the results tend to converge which is consistent with that from hossain and randolph 2009 the bearing capacity factor can be calculated by the following equation 4 n cd 9 1 1 0 1 d d 11 6 the cavity depth h c in eq 3 are calculated by the method proposed by hossain and randolph 2009 5 h c d s uh γ d 0 55 1 4 s uh γ d where s uh is undrained shear strength at the backflow depth where the soil becomes back flow to the top of the spudcan see more details in hossain and randolph 2009 it is found that the penetration resistance of the spudcan foundation in random soils can be larger or smaller than the calculated penetration resistance in uniform soils for example the penetration resistance of about 39 cases in random soils are smaller than that in uniform soils at the penetration resistance of 1 0d to facilitate the comparison a resistance ratio η between the random soils and uniform soil is defined as 6 η q u r a n q u c a l where q u r a n is the penetration resistance in random soil and q u c a l is the penetration resistance calculated by eq 3 if η is less than 1 the penetration resistance estimated using eq 3 is overestimated and in turn the foundation will be in an unconservative side the probabilistic density of the resistance ratio at various depth is presented in fig 11b the resistance ratio is found to follow normal distribution at each depth when the penetration depth reached 1 0d the resistance ratio is less than 1 in 39 of the random cases as the spudcan penetrates into deeper depth the percentage of resistance ratio that less than 1 become larger which indicated that the penetration resistance tends to smaller than that in uniform soil for example there are only 38 8 of random cases that have resistance ratio larger than 1 when the spudcan penetrates into 3 0d fig 13 shows the variation of the mean value and the standard deviation of the resistance ratio with penetration depths the mean resistance ratio is larger than 1 when the penetration depths are less than 1 14d after 1 14d the mean resistance ratio is smaller than 1 the standard deviation of the resistance ratio is about 0 035 0 046 the mean values can be fitted by an exponential function as in eq 7 and the standard deviations can be fitted by a square exponential function as in eq 8 7 μ η a 1 e x p a 2 d d a 3 e x p a 4 d d 8 σ η b 1 e x p d d b 2 b 3 2 b 4 e x p d d b 5 b 6 2 where ai i 1 2 4 and bj j 1 2 6 are fitting parameters and listed in table 2 these statistical properties of penetration resistance are then used to calculate percentiles of the penetration resistance 4 3 2 4 3 2 percentiles of the penetration resistance a percentile is a measure used in statistics indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations in a group of observations fall for example a resistance ratio of 0 95 for the 25th percentile indicates that 25 percent of the resistance ratio are below 0 95 as the probabilistic distribution of resistance ratio follows normal distribution the percentile p η at a given resistance ratio η can be calculated by the following equation 9 p η 1 2 π σ η η e x p η μ η 2 2 σ η 2 d η the resistance ratios for several common percentiles are given in table 3 the mean value and the standard deviation of the resistance ratio at different depths can be calculated by eq 7 and eq 8 for example at the depth of 1 0d the mean value and the standard deviation are 1 0 and 0 04 respectively therefore at this depth the resistance ratio for the 5th percentile is 0 93 i e 1 0 1 64 0 04 0 93 and the resistance ratio for the 95th percentile is 1 07 i e 1 0 1 64 0 04 1 07 this result indicates that if the penetration resistance calculated by eq 3 against depth curve is multiplied by 0 93 and 1 07 these curves would provide a bound within which 90 of the penetration resistance would be expected to fall therefore according to table 3 a set of percentiles can be attained and were shown in fig 14 the percentile of the penetration resistance can be used to help decision at practical engineering if the measured field data fall within the 25th to 75th percentiles the spudcan behavior is as expected and the risk is very low if the observed field data lie outside 5th to 95th percentiles the risk of a rare event becomes higher which should ring alarm bells for the engineer houlsby 2010 5 field case study field cases of installation of spudcan foundations are presented in this section to demonstrate the proposed method how to provide a quantitative assessment of the installation risk one case in subsection 5 1 is in north east brazil reported by rapoport and young 1988 three cases in subsection 5 2 are in gulf of mexico reported by menzies and roper 2008 all of these four cases are penetration of spudcan foundations into normally consolidated clay seabed which is detailed in table 4 5 1 field case in north east brazil rapoport and young 1988 reported a case concerning installation of a three legged drilling unit into seabed in north east brazil the diameter of the spudcan is 12 2 m the undrained shear strength of the soil at sea bed level is 5 0 kpa and the gradient is 1 1 kpa m the effective unit weight of the soil is 6 7 kn m3 according to the conditions of the sea bed soil the vertical bearing capacity of the spudcan foundation at various penetration depths can be calculated using the abs method the penetration curves predicted by abs method are shown in fig 15 when the preload of 31 6 mn was required the predicted penetration depth was about 16 5 m however during installation the required preload was not reached when penetrating to 16 5 m the observed penetration depth in field is about 17 0 m under a preload of 31 6 mn in order to assess the risk during the spudcan installation in this case the quantitative percentiles proposed in this paper are employed according to table 3 the resistance ratio for the 5th and 95th percentiles are μ η 1 64 σ η and μ η 1 64 σ η respectively the penetration resistance calculated by abs method against depth curve is multiplied by μ η 1 64 σ η to give the 5th percentile curve and multiplied by μ η 1 64 σ η to give the curve with 95th percentile as shown in fig 15 these two curves would provide a bound within which 90 of the penetration resistance would be expected to fall for example at the penetration depth of 16 5 m the mean value and the standard deviation are 0 99 and 0 037 respectively thus the resistance ratio for the 5th and 95th percentiles are 0 93 and 1 05 respectively the penetration resistance calculated by abs method at the depth of 16 5 m is 31 6 mn therefore at the penetration depth of 16 5 m the 5th percentile penetration resistance is 29 4 mn and the 95th percentile penetration resistance is 33 2 mn this result indicates that at a depth of 16 5 m the possible preload ranges from 29 4 mn to 33 2 mn with a probability of 90 the results also indicate that the largest penetration depth should not exceed 17 9 m at which the preload range with 90 probability is from 31 6 mn to 35 6 mn in reality when the penetration depth reached 17 m the preload reached the required preload the penetration depth is very important as it closely relates with the design length of spudcan legs the percentiles proposed in this paper can be used to predict the range of the penetration depth of the spudcan foundation in this case with a preload of 31 6 mn the penetration depth on the curve with 95th percentile is 15 4 m and the penetration depth on the curve with 5th percentile is 17 9 m which indicate that the penetration depth has 90 probability to fall in the range of 15 4 m 17 9 m the actual penetration depth of 17 0 m falls in this predicted range 5 2 field cases in gulf of mexico menzies and roper 2008 reported spudcan penetration with measured load penetration records at gulf of mexico three cases are used in this study to demonstrate how the predicted percentile curves help quantifying installation risk the soil properties of these three cases are summarized in table 4 the undrained shear strength at mudline ranges from 2 4 kpa to 5 7 kpa and the gradient ranges from 1 18 kpa m to 1 59 kpa m the effective unit weight of the clay ranges from 4 7 kn m3 to 5 5 kn m3 strain softening phenomenon of the clay was observed which is different from the case in north east brazil thus in this subsection the penetration resistance calculated using abs method is reduced by 20 to consider the strain softening of the clay as suggested by menzies and roper 2008 and hossain et al 2014 fig 16 shows the penetration resistance profile calculated by abs method and that measured in field the predicted 1st 5th 95th and 99th percentiles of these three cases can be obtained using the proposed method and are also shown in fig 16 in the second field case as shown in fig 16a the measured penetration resistance values are lower than that predicted by abs method during the first four loading stages will this low resistance threaten the safety of the installation the additional percentile curves can help the engineer to quantify the risk the measured resistance values are all lying between the 5th and 95th percentile curves which gives a range of resistance and depth with 90 probability as such the engineers can estimate whether the spudcan foundation is safe or not under the next preloading according to this range for example before applying the loading of 54 5 mn at the fifth stage a range of penetration depth i e from 27 6 m to 30 7 m can be provided by the 5th and 95th percentile curves in reality under the preload of 54 5 mn the penetration depth of spudcan foundation is 29 7 m which confirms the estimation based on the percentile curves in the third field case the first measured penetration depth at the loading of 31 2 mn is even larger than that predicted by 1 percentile as shown in fig 16b which indicates that the variability of the seabed soil may be higher than expected and the risk of spudcan installation is relatively high therefore small loading increment and low loading rate should be adopted in reality under the preload of 44 0 mn the spudcan foundation penetrates suddenly from a depth of 18 6 m 21 6 m which confirms the relatively high risk of installation in this field in the fourth field case the measured penetration depth values under the first three preloading levels are between the range bounded by the 1 percentile and the 5 percentile curves which indicates that the seabed soil may be softer than expected as all of the measured values are within the range with 98 probability but out of the range with 95 probability the engineers should pay close attention to the installation in the following preloading process the penetration depths are around the values given by the 1 percentile curve in summary the percentiles proposed in this study was illustrated by the field cases through adopting the percentiles the bounds of the penetration resistance with different probabilities can be obtained furthermore the range of the penetration depth of the spudcan foundation can be attained which is very important for the installation of a foundation 6 summary and conclusions this paper proposed a probabilistic method for quantifying the risk of spudcan installation by establishing a range of percentile curves of penetration resistance against depth the percentile curves were quantified through combing the random large deformation finite element method with monte carlo simulation the spatial variability of the seabed soil can be reasonably considered the results indicate that the spatial variation of the seabed soil can significantly affect the failure mechanism during penetration and the penetration resistance curve a field case study of a spudcan installation in north east brazil was investigated where the required load of 31 6 mn was not attained as expected when penetrating to the predicted 16 5 m the percentile curves were presented and the results show that the penetration depth should be fall in a range of 15 4 m 17 9 m with a probability of 90 at the required preload the estimated range agrees well with the field observation of 17 m another three field cases of the spudcan installation in gulf of mexico were also presented in this paper to demonstrate how the percentile curves are used to estimate the risk and help decision making during spudcan installation it s worth noting that only a set of representative statistical parameters of the soil were adopted in this paper in practice the statistical parameters of the soil should be determined according to the in situ conditions to give more accurate percentile curves credit authorship contribution statement wuzhang luo
