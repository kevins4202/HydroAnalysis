1245,shallow 30 m reducing groundwater commonly contains abundant dissolved arsenic as in bangladesh we hypothesize that dissolved as in iron fe rich groundwater discharging to rivers is trapped onto fe iii oxyhydroxides which precipitate in shallow riverbank sediments under the influence of tidal fluctuations therefore the goal of this study is to compare the calculated mass of sediment bound as that would be sequestered from dissolved groundwater as that discharges through riverbanks of the meghna river to the observed mass of as trapped within riverbank sediments to calculate groundwater discharge a boussinesq aquifer analytical groundwater flow model was developed and constrained by cyclical seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic heads and river stages observed at three sites along a 13 km reach in central bangladesh at all sites groundwater discharges to the river year round but most of it passes through an intertidal zone created by ocean tides propagating upstream from the bay of bengal in the dry season the annualized groundwater discharge per unit width at the three sites ranges from 173 to 891 m2 yr average 540 m2 yr assuming that riverbanks have been stable since the brahmaputra river avulsed far away from this area 200 years ago and dissolved as is completely trapped within riverbank sediments the mass of accumulated sediment as can be calculated by multiplying groundwater discharge by ambient aquifer as concentrations measured in 1969 wells across all sites the range of calculated sediment as concentrations in the riverbank is 78 849 mg kg which is higher than the observed concentrations 17 599 mg kg this discovery supports the hypothesis that the dissolved as in groundwater discharge to the river is sufficient to account for the observed buried deposits of as along riverbanks keywords arsenic groundwater discharge permeable natural reactive barrier 1 introduction an estimated 94 220 million people around the world consume drinking water with arsenic as concentrations that exceed the world health organization who guideline of 10 μg l podgorski and berg 2020 chronic consumption of drinking water with as concentrations exceeding the who guideline drives higher rates of cardiovascular diseases cancers and diabetes in adults raises infant mortality rates and depresses cognitive development in children argos et al 2010 chen et al 2011 navas acien et al 2005 quansah et al 2015 smith et al 1992 wasserman et al 2004 in spite of more than two decades of interventions 40 million people in bangladesh continue to consume groundwater over the who limit ahmad et al 2018 jamil et al 2019 the dissolved as in shallow aquifers 30 m in bangladesh is derived from the dissolution of as bearing minerals which were eroded from the himalayas transported and deposited by the ganges and brahmaputra rivers on the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta gbmd chakraborty et al 2015 fendorf et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 iron fe oxyhydroxide minerals in particular carry abundant and easily mobilized as fendorf et al 2010 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 nickson et al 2000 zheng et al 2004 these are reductively dissolved in the anoxic organic matter rich groundwater which prevails in bangladesh this leads to the release and reduction of as from as v 2o5 to as iii 2o3 0 roman numerals denote the redox state of as in bangladesh oxic river water chemically contrasts with the highly reducing shallow groundwater that has abundant dissolved as and fe ii fendorf et al 2010 islam et al 2000 van geen et al 2003 in the hyporheic zone hz where groundwater and surface water mix there is a constant replenishment of dissolved oxygen do and dissolved organic matter dom from river water and dissolved fe ii from the groundwater in the process dissolved fe ii is likely oxidized while as absorbs onto the new hydroxide thereby removing as from groundwater that discharges to the river this creates the potential for as to be removed by sorption to fe iii oxyhydroxides that precipitate within the hz berube et al 2018 datta et al 2009 jung et al 2012 jung et al 2015 knowledge of the prevalence of these natural reactive barriers nrbs expanded with the discovery of high sediment as concentrations 700 mg kg in shallow riverbank sediments along freshwater bodies including the meghna river in bangladesh datta et al 2009 jung et al 2015 although the ubiquity and efficacy of these nrbs for removing dissolved as discharging to rivers in bangladesh is still unclear there is widespread evidence of an nrb type phenomenon across various stream river and estuarine settings working along a small mountain stream in montana that was heavily contaminated by historical mine tailings spills nagorski and moore 1999 found that the pore waters within the hz were enriched in dissolved as compared to both the stream water and the adjacent groundwater similar layers have been found along the banks of the cohas brook in new hampshire in the united states mackay et al 2014 and the narayani gandak river in nepal johnston et al 2015 in the waquoit bay estuary in massachusetts sediment enriched with as was observed in the subterranean estuary which was defined as the mixing zone within the sediment between fresh groundwater and seawater bone et al 2006 charette and sholkovitz 2002 charette et al 2005 jung et al 2009 these found that as had accumulated within a layer of fe or manganese mn oxide minerals with high surface charge density these studies confirmed that as trapping on fe iii oxyhydroxides commonly occurs within the steep redox gradient between fresh water rivers and aquifers containing substantial concentrations of dissolved as the dimensions of this redox gradient depend primarily on the hydraulic conductivity k of the sediment but river stage fluctuations driven by seasons tides and dam releases expand the size of this zone and the frequency of mixing between oxidizers and reducers making it more effective at sequestering dissolved fe ii and as laboratory experiments have advanced understanding of the impact of redox oscillations on as mobility in the hz parsons et al 2013 revealed that whereas anoxic conditions mobilize as repetitive cycling between oxidizing and reducing conditions immobilized progressively more dissolved as when the fe iii oxyhydroxides are being reductively dissolved couture et al 2015 observed that as sorbed strongly to the remaining sorbent even as it was concurrently or subsequently reduced from as v to as iii this experimental evidence suggested that these layers have the potential to retain as even under substantial redox fluctuations other minerals besides the surfaces of fe oxyhydroxides may also play an important role in sequestering the dissolved as phan et al 2019 demonstrated that under reducing conditions microbial sulfate so4 reduction led to the sequestration of a portion of dissolved as and newly precipitated sulfide minerals such as mackinawite fes these studies investigated the behavior of as in the hz and identified factors controlling as mobility across temporal and spatial scales brown et al 2007 demonstrated that the mass flux of dissolved as advected from the aquifer into the stream varied seasonally and spatially along a 88 m reach of a stream adjacent to the abandoned brinton arsenic mine in virginia therefore it is necessary to quantify the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater discharge to estimate dissolved as fluxes towards the river in humid regions low lying areas and river valleys tend to receive groundwater cartwright et al 2014 hubbert 1940 krause et al 2007 larkin and sharp 1992 larsen et al 2008 rhodes et al 2017 turco et al 2007 observed hydraulic heads at several transects of shallow aquifer monitoring wells installed along a 10 km reach of the meghna river between 2012 and 2015 suggested the meghna river in the central part of the gbmd generally gains shallow groundwater for most of the year berube et al 2018 knappett et al 2016 these studies however did not quantify groundwater discharge a major goal of this study is to quantify the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater discharge this facilitates answering the following questions 1 what is the seasonal and spatial variability of groundwater discharge along the 13 km reach of the meghna river 2 what is the annual mass flux of dissolved as that groundwater carries into the hz via the shallow aquifer 3 is the cumulative mass flux of dissolved as over the past 200 years since the brahmaputra avulsed to the west of dhaka sufficient to generate the observed enriched sediment as within the hz i e 100 20 000 mg kg in datta et al 2009 1 709 mg kg in jung et al 2015 and 17 599 mg kg in berube et al 2018 we hypothesized that immobilized aqueous as that was advected towards the river can account for this enriched sediment as to test this hypothesis a groundwater flow model constrained by long term high frequency observations of hydraulic heads was developed for a seasonally oscillating river boundary based on the calculated groundwater discharge and the assumption that the dissolved as can be completely trapped within the riverbank sediments the expected mass of as that accumulated in riverbank sediments was calculated by multiplying the groundwater discharge by the locally relevant dissolved as concentrations measured in 1969 tubewells screened within the shallow aquifer along a 13 km reach of the meghna river next these calculated sediment as concentrations were compared to a limited number of observed as concentrations in sediments across the dry season intertidal zone where the majority of the annual groundwater flux discharges to the river 2 study area the study area is a 13 km reach of the meghna river in central bangladesh this reach defines the eastern border of the sub district upazila of araihazar fig 1a the distribution of as concentrations in araihazar has been well characterized owing to 20 years of research by investigators connected to columbia university s arsenic superfund project which evaluated the causes and public health outcomes from long term exposure to as in drinking water argos et al 2010 van geen et al 2014 van geen et al 2003 wasserman et al 2004 zheng et al 2005 the river is located approximately 25 km east of the capital city dhaka approximately 10 km south of this reach the meghna river joins the padma river which carries the discharge of both the ganges and brahmaputra rivers two of the largest rivers in asia ocean tides propagate up the meghna river from the bay of bengal driving 12 h semi diurnal and 14 d neap spring fluctuation periods each of approximately 0 6 m in amplitude within the study reach in addition to the tidal fluctuations the meghna river fluctuates seasonally by approximately 4 m with a peak river stage of 6 5 m above sea level masl and a nadir of 2 5 masl the wet season extends from may through october during which the country receives the vast majority of its rainfall the dry season extends from november through april between 2014 and 2020 four monitoring well transects were installed in the shallow aquifer along the meghna river to study the fate of as discharging to the river these are referred to as sites 1 through 4 s1 s4 fig 1b the distribution of monitoring wells that were utilized in this study within s2 and s4 are presented in fig 1c and d respectively the monitoring wells within transect s1 that were utilized for this study are s1 1a and s1 t5 and were presented in shuai et al 2017 and berube et al 2018 in s3 only one monitoring well s3 1a was screened within the shallow aquifer which is located approximately 250 m away from the dry season riverbank the dimensions of the shallow riverbank aquifer at s1 s4 have been characterized through electrical resistivity tomography ert pedrazas et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 and lithological boreholes berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 from the ground surface to the depth of 40 m there are two main hydro stratigraphic units a shallow sandy aquifer that extends to 20 30 m depth and a clay aquitard with a thickness of 7 m that underlies the shallow aquifer berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 the aquifer varies from very fine to coarse sand and the underlying aquitard is blue clay with high plasticity berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 minor lenses of silty sand and silt were observed at different depths within the aquifer for example at s1 and s2 the shallow aquifer is capped by approximately 1 m of silty sand pedrazas et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 at s4 fig 1d there is a laterally extensive silt layer lying approximately 3 m below land surface with a thickness of 6 m pedrazas et al 2021 3 methodology 3 1 measurements of dissolved and sediment arsenic concentrations in 2012 13 a blanket survey of as concentrations in private tubewells was completed across araihazar in which 48 790 drinking water wells were tested using the its arsenic econo quick kit https sensafe com quick arsenic econo refer to jameel et al 2021 for more details although the accuracy of the test kit was limited compared with laboratory analysis the kit reliably categorized as concentrations as being above or below who 10 μg l and bangladesh 50 μg l drinking water standards george et al 2012 van geen et al 2014 a subset of 1 962 wells within the blanket survey with depths shallower than 20 m and located within 1 km from the west bank of the meghna river shoreline under dry season conditions were utilized to characterize the distribution of dissolved as concentrations in shallow groundwater discharging to the river fig 1b on the eastern side of the river berube et al 2018 measured groundwater as concentrations within 7 monitoring wells along a transect at s1 with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer icp ms additionally dissolved fe was measured in 21 monitoring wells across s1 s4 and 7 private shallow tubewells fig s1 and table s1 dissolved fe concentrations in private tubewells and monitoring wells were measured utilizing a portable spectrophotometer chemetrics inc midland va usa berube 2017 and icp ms respectively berube et al 2018 to investigate as sedimentary concentrations in different groupings of minerals berube 2017 performed separate chemical extractions on seven sediment cores collected along the river banks within the study reach fig 1b three cores were located on the western side and four on the east two of them were located at s1 the concentrations of sediment as utilized in the present study were those measured by 1 2 m hydrochloric acid hcl extractions which had the highest concentrations of solid phase as berube 2017 in this extraction procedure the vast majority of surfaces that the as was attached to were poorly crystallized amorphous fe iii oxyhydroxides and ferrihydrite berube 2017 which sorb as efficiently dixit and hering 2003 3 2 hydraulic properties of the riverbank aquifer to calculate groundwater discharge the hydraulic properties of the aquifer need to be measured slug tests were performed to measure the spatial variability in k across the aquifer duplicate or triplicate measurements were made on each well coefficients of variation c v were typically 2 pneumatic rising head slug tests were performed on all monitoring wells in s2 and s3 the pneumatic method was described in shuai et al 2017 solid slug tests were performed on wells in s4 which used a solid slug attached to a pressure transducer utilizing both falling and rising head tests at all sites k was calculated using the hvorslev method hvorslev 1951 at site 2 k ranged from 8 8 to 14 5 m day amongst 4 monitoring wells with an average of 11 4 m day and a standard deviation sd of 2 6 m day at s3 observed k was 111 5 m day in the single well at that site at s4 k ranged from 4 3 to 51 6 m day amongst 9 monitoring wells with an average of 34 9 m day and a sd of 14 2 m day the value of k at s1 was estimated by shuai et al 2017 which conducted both slug and pumping tests at s1 the values of k measured with slug tests ranged from 18 4 to 34 1 m day amongst 8 monitoring wells with an average of 27 3 m day and a sd of 5 5 m day shuai et al 2017 the average value of transmissivity t obtained from the pumping tests was 450 m2 day shuai et al 2017 the thickness of shallow aquifer b was 20 m therefore the back calculated k from the pumping tests t b was 22 5 m day this falls within the range of k values measured through slug tests indicating the sandy aquifer at that site is relatively homogeneous with respect to k the full list of the k values is presented in table s2 hydraulic conductivities of the shallow aquifer are available from several field studies throughout araihazar in western araihazar approximately 10 km west of s3 stute et al 2007 and mozumder et al 2020a conducted slug tests on 23 monitoring wells over 7 sites and reported k values ranging from 3 6 to 40 2 m day with an average of 17 0 m day and a sd of 10 9 m day approximately 11 km west of s2 knappett et al 2012 conducted slug tests in 50 monitoring wells over 9 transects throughout one village and reported k values ranging from 1 5 to 40 6 m day with an average of 18 6 m day and a sd of 11 8 m day therefore the observed k in the riverbank aquifer sites s1 s2 and s4 are within the range of the inland shallow aquifer but k in the single well in s3 is approximately double the high end value in 94 previously tested wells throughout the area other monitoring wells at s3 within the shallow aquifer were unfortunately not available to further constrain k for this site although it is unlikely this high k value is typical of all depths and locations at s3 the presence of this high k layer that is evidently intercepted by the monitoring well will raise the effective k of the entire aquifer even if it is only a few meters thick fetter 2018 therefore this value was adopted for the aquifer storativity of the shallow aquifer was reported for several nearby sites in addition to s1 mozumder et al 2020a nakaya et al 2011 shuai et al 2017 based on pumping tests conducted in the shallow aquifer at s1 shuai et al 2017 concluded that s was 3 7 10 4 this low value of s combined with the shape of the drawdown curves during the pumping test suggested that this field site is semi confined at least in the early dry season when the pumping test was performed approximately 10 km west of the s3 mozumder et al 2020a conducted a pumping test in the pre holocene aquifer that underlies a 10 15 m thick clay layer that separates it from the overlying holocene aquifer they reported that s was 6 2 10 4 nakaya et al 2011 used 3 10 6 as the value of s for the shallow aquifer located 20 km east of dhaka which was based on a pumping test in this study the value of s derived from shuai et al 2017 was adopted in the subsequent analysis to quantify groundwater discharge along both sides of the meghna river 3 3 river discharge measurements variation in river discharge was measured to compare the magnitude of the calculated groundwater discharge to river discharge during the dry season dynamic river discharge during multiple ebb phases of semidiurnal tidal cycles during jan 4 8 2015 was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp m 9 sontek xylem inc san diego ca usa the adcp was mounted to the front of a boat using a custom built aluminum brace as described in rhodes et al 2017 these measurements were made at northern and southern river cross section sites which were located approximately 10 km apart and encompassed most of the study area fig 1b the measurement location alternated each day between the northern and southern river cross sections at each location measurements were made continuously for approximately 6 h the duration of each river discharge measurement was approximately 45 min therefore 6 8 measurements were made each day over the course of an ebb tide phase 8 h 3 4 water level measurement and surveying pressure transducers model 3001 levelogger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada recorded water levels every 20 min in the aquifer and the river the raw pressures were converted to water table or river stage elevation as described in knappett et al 2016 the distribution of transducers and the corresponding extent of temporal coverage at the river gage and three transects are detailed in table s3 only nine months of observations were available at s4 which cannot fully represent the annual fluctuations at this transect therefore records from s4 were extended to twelve months by regressing water table observations at s4 on a simple linear equation that utilized the observed water table at nearby s3 the detailed steps are described in the text s1 in the supplementary material the elevations of the top of all monitoring wells and river gage were surveyed using repeated real time kinematic rtk surveys with two gps receivers connected through a radio link trimble rtx enabled netr9 and r10 trimble inc sunnyvale ca usa and on site surveys with a total station and dumpy level berube et al 2018 knappett et al 2016 3 5 analytical groundwater flow model groundwater discharge across the river aquifer boundary was quantified by a new analytical solution that was generalizable for both semi confined and unconfined aquifers under the dupuit assumption the one dimensional unsteady groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer fig 2 is governed by the boussinesq equation bear 2013 liang and zhang 2012 the governing equation is as follows 1 k x h h x s y h t where k m day is the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer x m is the horizontal coordinate h m is the hydraulic head in the shallow aquifer with respect to the aquifer bottom s y is the specific yield and t day is time widespread silt or river mud capping on the top of the aquifer is assumed to limit evaporation and infiltration berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 the boundary and initial conditions can be expressed as follows 2 h l t u t 3 h 0 t g t 4 h x 0 f x where u t and g t are the time dependent groundwater level and river stage at the right and left boundaries respectively fig 2 both u t and g t were set equal to observed water levels f x is the initial position of the water table l is the length of the flow domain which varies over sites the term f x is the solution to the steady state solution of d dx h dh dx 0 and needs to satisfy eqs 2 and 3 therefore 5 f x g 2 0 u 2 0 g 2 0 l x 3 6 sediment arsenic estimation the ganges and brahmaputra rivers combined carry the greatest sediment bedload of all major rivers in the world milliman and meade 1983 syvitski and saito 2007 this bedload and the avulsions of river channels that its deposition drives built up the shallow aquifer during the holocene across the gbmd during the holocene the brahmaputra river periodically flowed through the subsiding surma basin acharyya et al 2000 to the east of the tectonically uplifted madhupur tracts in central bangladesh where the capital city of dhaka is located goodbred et al 2014 fig 1a this was the situation in 1770 when the brahmaputra flowed through araihazar joining up with the meghna river islam 2016 sarker et al 2003 around this time the brahmaputra began to avulse towards the west this process was completed by 1830 and since then the brahmaputra has flown through a similar path to the west of the madhupur tracts islam 2016 sarker et al 2003 in contrast to the brahmaputra the meghna river is a low energy river that deposits little new primary sediments downstream of the subsiding surma basin which acts like a sediment trap rahman et al 2018 therefore to calculate the accumulated mass of as in riverbank sediments 200 years was implemented in the model which represented the likely time since deposition of the riverbank aquifer sediments this is an upper time limit for dissolved as to accumulate in riverbank sediments since scouring and accretion of new sediment on the surficial 0 3 m riverbanks does occur during the wet season in riverbank sand with moderate permeability poorly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxides are hypothesized to precipitate and sequester dissolved as from groundwater discharging to the river here we specifically refer to this as a permeable natural reactive barrier pnrb charette and sholkovitz 2002 the term permeable distinguishes sandy riverbanks where advection and dispersion drive mixing from low permeability estuarine marsh silts where similar fe iii oxyhydroxide deposits have been found but the mixing between oxidants and reductants is driven by molecular diffusion and therefore the scale is smaller johnston et al 2011 moffett and gorelick 2016 in this study the thickness of the pnrb h was obtained from sediment cores collected by berube 2017 the length of the pnrb l was estimated as the ratio of fluctuation of the river stage which is driven by semi diurnal and neap spring tidal cycles and the grade of the riverbank fig 3 the riverbank grade was estimated using both on site surveying and the digital terrain elevation data dted collected by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm in google earth the riverbanks are broad and largely free of vegetation and these methods gave similar grades hydrological models genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 pfannkuch and winter 1984 trefry et al 2007 predicted that the direction of groundwater flow tends to be vertical near the groundwater surface water interface as a result groundwater discharges through a narrow zone near the shore where the flow paths converge to estimate the upper limit of accumulated sediment as in pnrb we assumed that all groundwater discharging to the river passed through the pnrb fig 3 and the dissolved as was completely trapped there jung et al 2015 based on the above assumptions the as concentration c as s mg kg in the riverbank sediment over 200 years was calculated as 6 c as s 200 q c as aq 1000 ρlh where q m2 year is the groundwater discharge per unit width which was calculated using the analytical groundwater model developed in section 3 5 c as aq μg l is the dissolved as concentration in groundwater ρ g cm3 is the bulk density which was assumed to be 2 g cm3 jung et al 2015 mozumder et al 2020b and h m and l m are the thickness and length of pnrb respectively under steady state conditions with respect to the pore water chemistry of an aquifer there is no net retardation of the mass flux of a solute since it is at chemical equilibrium with the sorption sites within a continuous plume fetter 2018 therefore there is no retardation term in eq 6 4 results 4 1 analytical solution of the groundwater flow boundary value problem the form of the analytical hydraulic model was chosen for modeling any type of aquifer confined and unconfined that is connected to a river with a regularly oscillating stage the nonlinearity of the governing equation eq 1 means that it is difficult to obtain its analytical solution except for some special cases therefore eq 1 must be linearized and then rewritten as bear 2013 liang and zhang 2012 7 β 2 φ x 2 φ t where φ h 2 and β k h s y in the latter term h is the average of the saturated thickness of the aquifer assuming that φ x t can be written as φ x t v x t w x t we can derive 8 v x t 1 x l g 2 t x l u 2 t 9 w x t n 1 0 t 2 u 2 0 nπ e αt φ n τ e α t τ dτ sin nπ l x where 10 α β nπ l 2 11 φ n τ 2 g t g t u t u t the steps for deriving v x t w x t and φ n are listed text s2 in the supporting information once the functions of g t and u t are obtained and substituted into eq s 8 11 the functions of v x t and w x t can be solved which will derive the function of φ x t then h x t can be easily calculated by taking the square root of φ x t this study focusses on seasonally changing groundwater discharge between the river and the aquifer therefore the short term fluctuations of groundwater level and river stage were neglected the meghna river fluctuates periodically in a relatively symmetrical way over each year owing to a monsoon season which has a duration of approximately 6 months therefore the river stage and groundwater level at the aquifer boundary can be simulated by simple sine functions g t a sin bx c d and u t a sin bt c d the terms a b c d a b c and d are constants that were fit to the observed river stage and water level respectively then h x t can be given by 12 h x t φ x t 1 x l a sin bt c d 2 x l a sin bt c d 2 n 1 2 a sin c d 2 nπ e αt θ t ϕ t sin nπ l x 1 2 where 13 θ t 2 a 2 bd b α b 2 α 2 sin bt c cos bt

discharge per unit width of the aquifer 4 2 estimating groundwater discharge 4 2 1 determining water levels at the model boundaries sine functions that represent river stage and groundwater level at the aquifer boundary have to be determined first so they can be input into the eq 12 the observed water table in wells s1 1a s3 1a and s4 1c was used to constrain the aquifer boundary for the separate models from s1 s3 and s4 respectively the coefficient of determination r2 between observed and fitted water levels at aquifer boundaries exceeds 0 94 fig 4 whereas the root mean square error rmse ranges from 0 27 to 0 31 m this error in the model derived from short term tidal fluctuations during the dry season or episodic flooding during the wet season the water table fluctuates 4 m annually thus the rmse is approximately 7 of the annual fluctuation which is a minor component the relative amounts and timing of monsoon rainfall over the study period have been quite stable weekly precipitation amounts measured along one of the two primary tributaries to the meghna river in sylhet and in nearby dhaka between 2014 and 2020 fig s2 both match the timing of river stage and water table oscillations in any given year the surma basin part of the meghna river watershed receives approximately double the rainfall compared to the study reach fig s3 the stability of recent timing of the monsoon as well as the total amounts provides evidence of the relative stability of the hydrologic cycle in this region over the past 60 years this stability is a key assumption in eq 6 4 2 2 analytical model verification after fitting the sine functions that best represented water levels at the aquifer and river boundaries the performance of the model was challenged against independent water level observations that were not used to generate the predicted shape of the water table over time this was performed for the models at s1 and s4 where a time series of synoptic observations of the water table were available in at least one other monitoring well s1 t5 and s4 3c the values of r2 and rmse at s1 were 0 95 and 0 36 m respectively fig 5a at s4 these corresponding values were 0 97 and 0 33 m respectively fig 5b this successful test indicates that the model accurately represents the seasonal fluctuation in the shape of the water table between the known aquifer boundary condition and river stage 4 2 3 calculating groundwater discharge through the riverbank groundwater discharge was calculated over one year at s1 s3 and s4 fig 6 negative values indicate water flowing from the aquifer to the river gaining river at all sites the river is gaining groundwater for nearly the entire year this agrees with observations reported by other authors studying the seasonally influenced groundwater discharge to rivers located in low lying regions berube et al 2018 krause et al 2007 larsen et al 2008 at s1 groundwater discharge per unit width of the aquifer varied between 233 and 872 m2 yr with an average of 562 m2 yr site 3 had the smallest discharge rate which varied between 104 and 756 m2 yr with an average of 318 m2 yr at s4 discharge varied between 333 and 1094 m2 yr with an average of 754 m2 yr although the specific timing of groundwater discharge variations differed between the three sites the general shape was similar the average groundwater discharge black line in fig 6 over the three sites was calculated which ranged from 173 to 891 m2 yr with an annualized average of 540 m2 yr this average groundwater discharge peaks in january and then reaches a minimum in the early monsoon in july although river discharge during the dry season is highly dynamic over a single semidiurnal tidal cycle fig s4 the relative contribution of groundwater discharge to the river discharge along this study reach is always quite low during january 2015 river discharge ranged from 150 m3 s in the upstream direction north to 3658 m3 s in the downstream direction south over multiple ebb tides with an average of 2100 m3 s for comparison the average groundwater discharge during the month of january was only 0 6 m3 s or 0 03 of river discharge 4 3 predicting sediment as concentrations within the intertidal zone 4 3 1 spatial distribution of dissolved as in groundwater the concentrations of as in 1 962 shallow wells were utilized to represent the distribution of dissolved as in the groundwater along the western bank of the meghna river utilizing the spatial autocorrelation package in arcgis 10 8 1 esri redlands ca usa a spatial dependence of 350 m was found fig s5 then inverse distance weighted idw was used to spatially average dissolved as concentrations over 350 350 m2 squares low concentration zones 50 μg l are located in the northern area whereas high concentration 200 μg l zones are located in the south fig 7 the direction of groundwater flow is generally perpendicular to the riverbank because the hydraulic gradients are large in that direction benner et al 2008 sun et al 2016 therefore the 1 km buffer strip was divided into 37 rectangular zones oriented parallel to the groundwater flow direction these were labeled as 1 to 37 from north to south fig 7 each zone is 350 1000 m2 in size and divided into three 350 350 m2 squares fig 7 for each zone the dissolved as concentration in groundwater discharging to the river was assumed to be the average of the three square zones along the flow path fig 8a on the eastern riverbank only 7 monitoring wells located within s1 were sampled for the groundwater as concentration due to the limited measurements we were not able to perform the same spatial analysis as we did along the western bank therefore the average dissolved as concentration of the 7 wells was utilized to represent the dissolved as concentrations in groundwater discharging to the river at s1 this is 325 143 μg l fig 8a 4 3 2 the dimensions of the intertidal zone and the pnrb the hcl extracted sedimentary as concentrations from 7 cores fig 7 suggested that the depth of pnrb was about 1 m berube 2017 berube et al 2018 other authors studying locations 10 km south of the present study area found evidence of a pnrb at depths of 0 2 m jung et al 2015 therefore we adopted 1 m as the thickness of pnrb h in this study fig 3 surveying using a total station revealed that the riverbank at s1 has an approximate grade of 7 berube et al 2018 in the dry season the river stage fluctuates 1 2 m driven by semi diurnal and neap spring tidal cycles therefore the length of the pnrb l at s1 would be 17 m fig 3 using the same method the bank grades at s2 and s4 were found to be 3 sites 2 and 4 are located in as concentration zones 1 and 31 respectively therefore 3 was assumed to be the representative bank grade of the zone the riverbank grades near s1 s2 and s4 were also estimated from google earth by drawing transects across the bank and extracting elevations from the embedded shuttle radar data these deviated 1 from the surveyed grades thus google earth was utilized to estimate the representative riverbank grades for each zone these grades are detailed in table s4 over 38 zones on the west bank the riverbank grade varies between 3 and 6 based on the 1 2 m total tidal fluctuation amplitudes in river stage this causes the intertidal zone to range from 19 m to 40 m with the average of 28 m 4 3 3 calculated and measured sediment as concentration in pnrb four of seven cores were taken near s1 on the eastern bank fig 7 the average observed sediment as concentrations over 1 m in these cores were 83 599 31 and 17 mg kg respectively the other three cores were located in zones 16 18 and 20 along the west bank fig 7 and the depth averaged observed sediment as concentrations were 588 328 and 231 mg kg respectively fig 8b these measured sediment as concentrations were greatly enriched over values at depths deeper than 1 m at all cores and also hundreds of times greater than the hcl extractable as found in other high as shallow aquifer sites throughout araihazar 1 3 1 5 mg kg in radloff et al 2007 and 0 5 2 9 mg kg in zheng et al 2005 as well as other nearby sites within the holocene aquifer 0 6 mg kg in harvey et al 2002 based on the calculated average groundwater discharge rate over s1 s3 and s4 the estimated dissolved as concentration and the dimensions of pnrb in each zone the predicted corresponding sediment as concentration was calculated utilizing eq 6 fig 8b over 37 zones on the western riverbank zone 28 was predicted to have the highest concentration of 630 144 mg kg in contrast zone 7 was predicted to have the lowest concentration of 78 21 mg kg observed sediment as concentrations were available at four locations at zone 16 the observed concentration 588 mg kg is somewhat higher than the range of predicted concentration of 334 107 mg kg fig 8b in zone 18 however the observed concentration 328 mg kg is close to the predicted concentration of 301 39 mg kg the same is true for zone 20 at s1 the observed concentrations from two cores 83 and 599 mg kg collected at s1 are within the range of predicted concentration which is 849 373 mg kg in contrast to the similarity between the predicted and observed sediment as concentrations far less hcl extractable fe was observed within the sediments than predicted based on the 200 year mass fluxes of dissolved fe eq 6 text s3 in the supporting information 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal changes in groundwater discharge to the river in this study we found that in a low lying delta with a monsoonal climate the seasonal variation in groundwater discharge is impacted by the wet and dry seasons at the beginning of the wet season the river stage rises faster than the water table this is the time that the minimum groundwater discharge occurs at all three sites s1 s3 and s4 fig 6 the interaction between the timing and amounts of precipitation across the meghna river watershed drives differences in the timing of the rising of river stage and the local water table thus the timing of minimum discharge varies year to year table s5 whereas multiple years of water table measurements were made at s1 and s3 at s4 only approximately one year 2020 of measurements were available the average timing of the minimum groundwater discharge varied slightly over the three sites groundwater discharge remains low throughout the wet season and then increases throughout the late wet and early dry season when river stage falls quickly while the local water table remains high during the late dry season february april the local water table converges on the river stage owing to discharge to the river and pumping for agricultural harvey et al 2006 causing flux to decrease some independent measurements are available to compare with these results jung et al 2015 installed 19 seepage meters along the meghna river in gazaria upazila 20 km south of the s4 and measured groundwater discharge in the late wet season oct 31 nov 4 during this period they observed an average groundwater discharge of 22 3 m day with a sd of 6 6 m day jung et al 2015 the average groundwater discharge across all sites modeled in this study during the same time of year was 37 7 m day with a sd of 0 2 m day even during the early dry season when maximum groundwater discharge occurs groundwater still only contributed an additional 0 03 to river discharge over the 13 km study reach of this wide shallow deltaic river 1 5 km wide 10 m deep see section 4 2 3 this estimate however was based on observations and 2 d aquifer models at 3 sites and may have missed much higher transmissivity locations with higher discharge in general across lowland rivers the proportion of groundwater discharge to river discharge varies by season owing to precipitation amounts and intensity as well as river segment poulsen et al 2015 utilized river based differential gaging to measure the discharge of a low order stream in denmark they observed that baseflow increased the stream discharge from 0 7 to 1 0 m3 s over the 2 4 km reach representing a 30 increase utilizing differential gaging on the lower brazos river in central texas rhodes et al 2017 found that groundwater discharge over a 24 km reach of the lowland river varied from a peak of 15 just after a flood event to zero at the end of a two month dry period in contrast along a 122 km reach of the larger havel river in northeastern germany differential gaging revealed that annualized groundwater discharge only contributed 0 8 m3 s or 1 to river discharge 87 9 m3 s krause et al 2007 along a 38 km reach of the lower merced river in california temporal changes in river salinity were utilized to estimate groundwater discharge which was found to contribute 0 1 m3 s or 0 3 7 0 of river discharge which itself ranged from 1 4 to 31 6 m3 s pai et al 2015 together these findings revealed that baseflow commonly comprised only a small portion of river discharge along higher order lowland rivers especially during prolonged dry periods for the meghna river the river s discharge during the early dry season likely derives from draining of wetlands across the surma basin that are connected with the river and store abundant water during the wet season across the basin rahman et al 2020 there were some differences in the magnitude and timing of groundwater discharge across the three sites fig 6 at s1 and s4 the direction of groundwater flow was consistently from the aquifer to the river whereas at s3 a minor amount of water flowed from the river to the aquifer between june and july moreover the magnitude of the discharge at s1 and s4 was consistently larger than at s3 despite the high k at s3 more groundwater discharged to the river at s4 than s1 during most of the year but between august and november s4 produced less discharge than s1 similar patterns in seasonal groundwater discharge have been reported in other studies atkinson et al 2015 lowry et al 2007 poulsen et al 2015 taniguchi et al 2003 unland et al 2013 5 2 predicted sediment arsenic concentrations and its association with sediment fe except for zone 16 the predicted sediment as concentrations 78 849 mg kg calculated by multiplying annual groundwater discharge by the average zonal dissolved as concentration are consistent with or higher than observed fig 8b in zone 16 the observed concentration is 33 higher than the upper limit of that predicted due to the high heterogeneity of dissolved as distribution in shallow groundwater we may have underestimated the average dissolved as concentration in zone 16 which may have contributed to the lower predicted sediment as concentration than observed but in general this near closure of the as mass balance suggests that dissolved as in groundwater is the primary source of the enriched concentrations within the pnrbs in the future sediment as concentrations should be measured in other zones along the west side of the riverbank to further challenge the predicted concentrations presented in this paper jung et al 2015 proposed a similar as accumulation model that can also be used to calculate the expected sediment as concentration in a pnrb that accumulates over a given time period they assumed that groundwater with an average dissolved as concentration of 100 μg l was trapped by the pnrb with a bulk density of 2 g cm3 after 200 years accumulation sediment as concentration in 1 m thick pnrb would be 101 mg kg applying the assumed dissolved as of 100 μg l and the pnrb thickness of 1 m to eq 6 however yields an expected concentration of 130 318 mg kg the reason for the range of predicted sediment as concentrations is from changes in the length of pnrb which ranges from 19 m to 40 m the discrepancy between two sets of results is mainly caused by the different groundwater discharge rates the annual groundwater discharge 10 m yr assumed in jung et al 2015 was estimated over 5 days oct 31 nov 4 measurements the calibrated boussinesq model however predicts seasonal variation in groundwater discharge the estimated annualized discharge rate from this study averaged across all three sites was 25 m yr this is what drives the estimated sediment as concentration higher than that of jung et al 2015 given the differences between estimating groundwater discharge from a riverbank along a river at multiple locations using modeled hydraulic heads and river stage and the more direct but smaller scale measurement of groundwater discharge with seepage meters it is encouraging that the results differ by a factor of about 2 5 the fact that much less hcl extractable sediment fe was found compared to that predicted by eq 6 for the s1 and s3 where both dissolved fe in groundwater and observed sediment fe were available suggests that the fe captured within the pnrb is either released to the river or is transformed into more crystalline forms evidence of the former process was presented in our previous publication berube et al 2018 showed the active release of fe from the sediment to pore waters within the pnrb at s1 during january 2016 arsenic was not released to pore waters at this place and time and was thought to re sorb to remaining fe oxyhydroxides berube et al 2018 also showed far higher concentrations of sediment fe within recalcitrant mineral phases extractable with aqua regia or detected with handheld xrf this contrasted with as which was found to be predominantly in the hcl extractable phase thus although much more work needs to be done characterizing the specific mineralogy and associations between fe and as in riverbank sediments the current evidence points to as being preferentially associated with amorphous or poorly ordered fe oxyhydroxide phases whereas the fe itself is both released to the river and re crystallized 5 3 sources of uncertainty in the groundwater discharge estimates to quantify groundwater discharge and the concentration of sediment as derived from dissolved as in groundwater several assumptions were made which introduced uncertainty in the quantitative values of our findings first we assumed that groundwater completely discharges through the intertidal zone which is 19 40 m inland from the shoreline of the dry season fig 3 during the wet season however the river stage will rise beyond the intertidal zone which will diminish the discharge of groundwater through it based on the observed river stage the intertidal zone is generally inundated between the end of may and early november table s6 during this period the groundwater discharge accounts for approximate 25 of the annual flux therefore we speculate that the actual percentage of groundwater discharge through the intertidal zone is between 75 and 100 this would proportionately lower the real mass flux of dissolved as advecting to the intertidal zone in a direct 1 1 manner second we assumed the riverbank was vertical in the analytical hydraulic model to calculate groundwater discharge but to calculate the accumulation of dissolved as in the pnrb eq 6 groundwater was assumed to discharge across the gently sloping intertidal zone this inconsistency may have impacted the results along the 13 km river reach the bank grade is 3 7 see section 4 3 2 sharp 1977 suggested it was necessary to consider the sloping geometry in an analytical hydraulic model to accurately quantify water exchange between groundwater and surface water doble et al 2012 found that if the riverbank grade increases from 6 to 15 the bank infiltration rates and storage volume will increase 98 and 40 respectively therefore the present study may underestimate the groundwater discharge which will further underestimate the concentration of sediment as third the observed groundwater table and river stage were represented by sine functions in the analytical model sections 4 1 and 4 2 1 these functions do not represent short term water level fluctuations fig 4 and may cause a divergence in calculated groundwater discharge from a model that is constrained by observed boundary conditions at finer frequency to assess the sensitivity of discharge to the frequency of hydraulic head observations at the boundaries a 3 d numerical model was developed within modflow 2000 which is encoded within the groundwater modeling system gms utilizing daily average hydraulic heads additionally for comparison daily groundwater discharge was calculated with darcy s law the general seasonal pattern of groundwater discharge derived from three approaches is consistent fig s6 listed from most to least complex models the average annual groundwater discharge derived from three approaches for the numerical daily boussinesq sine functions and darcy s law daily were 596 740 and 707 m2 yr respectively the least complex model produced an estimated discharge that lay between the numerical and boussinesq model the reason why darcy s law performed similarly to the more complex models that explicitly account for water table storage is the small value of s y 3 7 10 4 used in the studied riverbank aquifer when the aquifer has higher s y and water table storage is important darcy s law will underestimate discharge in both directions and in this case either the boussinesq or the more complex but flexible numerical model will be needed the difference in the calculated discharge between the daily discretized numerical and the analytical model suggests that the newly developed analytical model may over estimate discharge by as much as 23 the advantage of this model over darcy s law is that it can be used to estimate groundwater discharge for any type of the aquifer confined or unconfined in general the advantage of an analytical model over a numerical model is the low computing power greater transparency and therefore reproducibility between studies and the lower likelihood of over fitting observations which can improve the identifiability of the key variables that impact discharge or related reaction processes 5 4 dissolved arsenic in groundwater is sufficient to account for sediment arsenic in a pnrb the buried 5 m and surficial 1 2 m depth sediments with high concentrations of as along the meghna river have been suggested to be formed from groundwater mixing with oxidized river water berube et al 2018 datta et al 2009 jung et al 2015 if all the dissolved as that was transported to the riverbank over the past 200 years since the aquifer building brahmaputra river avulsed to the west was completely trapped within the pnrb the predicted concentrations of sediment as are consistent with or higher than observed using hcl extractions this suggests that groundwater mass fluxes provide sufficient as to account for all the as in the mapped pnrbs earlier published studies on sources of dissolved as within a shallow aquifer underlying a parafluvial zone of the mekong river suggested alternative sources of sediment as along the riverbanks polizzotto et al 2008 proposed that as released from the river derived floodplain sediments replenishes the dissolved sediment as pool in the aquifer which was diminished through mobilization and advection through the aquifer to the mekong river postma et al 2010 found that the river mud has a large pool of reactive fe iii oxyhydroxides with high as content and higher ratio of released as fe than aquifer sediments and river sand therefore present day sediments deposited by a river can be an important contemporary source of dissolved as to aquifers which underlie or are down hydraulic gradient from floodplains although we were not able to directly verify whether the aforementioned alternative sources exist within parafluvial zones of the study reach the calculations suggested that dissolved as in groundwater can approximately account for the of the extremely elevated mass of sedimentary as found in the riverbank 6 conclusions this study quantified the relationship between water exchange between an alluvial aquifer and the tidally fluctuating meghna river and the accumulation of as at the river aquifer interface groundwater discharge was calculated using a newly developed and calibrated analytical model which describes seasonal and spatial variations in discharge over three sites the average groundwater discharge per unit width at each of three calibrated sites ranges from 173 to 891 m2 yr the average across all three sites is 540 m2 yr the negative values indicate that the direction of the flux is consistently from the aquifer to the river this modeled discharge was multiplied by the average dissolved as concentrations measured within shallow private groundwater wells to calculate the expected concentrations of sediment as in the upper 1 m of the riverbanks if indeed all the dissolved as was captured there over 200 years these predicted sediment as concentrations are consistent with or higher than those observed this closure of the mass balance suggests that dissolved as in groundwater discharging to the meghna river is sufficient to account for the enriched sediment as in a pnrb credit authorship contribution statement yibin huang conceptualization

1245,shallow 30 m reducing groundwater commonly contains abundant dissolved arsenic as in bangladesh we hypothesize that dissolved as in iron fe rich groundwater discharging to rivers is trapped onto fe iii oxyhydroxides which precipitate in shallow riverbank sediments under the influence of tidal fluctuations therefore the goal of this study is to compare the calculated mass of sediment bound as that would be sequestered from dissolved groundwater as that discharges through riverbanks of the meghna river to the observed mass of as trapped within riverbank sediments to calculate groundwater discharge a boussinesq aquifer analytical groundwater flow model was developed and constrained by cyclical seasonal fluctuations in hydraulic heads and river stages observed at three sites along a 13 km reach in central bangladesh at all sites groundwater discharges to the river year round but most of it passes through an intertidal zone created by ocean tides propagating upstream from the bay of bengal in the dry season the annualized groundwater discharge per unit width at the three sites ranges from 173 to 891 m2 yr average 540 m2 yr assuming that riverbanks have been stable since the brahmaputra river avulsed far away from this area 200 years ago and dissolved as is completely trapped within riverbank sediments the mass of accumulated sediment as can be calculated by multiplying groundwater discharge by ambient aquifer as concentrations measured in 1969 wells across all sites the range of calculated sediment as concentrations in the riverbank is 78 849 mg kg which is higher than the observed concentrations 17 599 mg kg this discovery supports the hypothesis that the dissolved as in groundwater discharge to the river is sufficient to account for the observed buried deposits of as along riverbanks keywords arsenic groundwater discharge permeable natural reactive barrier 1 introduction an estimated 94 220 million people around the world consume drinking water with arsenic as concentrations that exceed the world health organization who guideline of 10 μg l podgorski and berg 2020 chronic consumption of drinking water with as concentrations exceeding the who

the who limit ahmad et al 2018 jamil et al 2019 the dissolved as in shallow aquifers 30 m in bangladesh is derived from the dissolution of as bearing minerals which were eroded from the himalayas transported and deposited by the ganges and brahmaputra rivers on the ganges brahmaputra meghna delta gbmd chakraborty et al 2015 fendorf et al 2010 mcarthur et al 2001 smedley and kinniburgh 2002 iron fe oxyhydroxide minerals in particular carry abundant and easily mobilized as fendorf et al 2010 harvey et al 2002 mcarthur et al 2004 nickson et al 2000 zheng et al 2004 these are reductively dissolved in the anoxic organic matter rich groundwater which prevails in bangladesh this leads to the release and reduction of as from as v 2o5 to as iii 2o3 0 roman numerals denote the redox state of as in bangladesh oxic river water chemically contrasts with the highly reducing shallow groundwater that has abundant dissolved as and fe ii fendorf et al 2010 islam et al 2000 van geen et al 2003 in the hyporheic zone hz where groundwater and surface water mix there is a constant replenishment of dissolved oxygen do and dissolved organic matter dom from river water and dissolved fe ii from the groundwater in the process dissolved fe ii is likely oxidized while as absorbs onto the new hydroxide thereby removing as from groundwater that discharges to the river this creates the potential for as to be removed by sorption to fe iii oxyhydroxides that precipitate within the hz berube et al 2018 datta et al 2009 jung et al 2012 jung et al 2015 knowledge of the prevalence of these natural reactive barriers nrbs expanded with the discovery of high sediment as concentrations 700 mg kg in shallow riverbank sediments along freshwater bodies including the meghna river in bangladesh datta et al 2009 jung et al 2015 although the ubiquity and efficacy of these nrbs for removing dissolved as discharging to rivers in bangladesh is still unclear there is widespread evidence of an nrb type phenomenon across various stream river and estuarine settings working along a small mountain stream in montana that was heavily contaminated by historical mine tailings spills nagorski and moore 1999 found that the pore waters within the hz were enriched in dissolved as compared to both the stream water and the adjacent groundwater similar layers have been found along the banks of the cohas brook in new hampshire in the united states mackay et al 2014 and the narayani gandak river in nepal johnston et al 2015 in the waquoit bay estuary in massachusetts sediment enriched with as was observed in the subterranean estuary which was defined as the mixing zone within the sediment between fresh groundwater and seawater bone et al 2006 charette and sholkovitz 2002 charette et al 2005 jung et al 2009 these found that as had accumulated within a layer of fe or manganese mn oxide minerals with high surface charge density these studies confirmed that as trapping on fe iii oxyhydroxides commonly occurs within the steep redox gradient between fresh water rivers and aquifers containing substantial concentrations of dissolved as the dimensions of this redox gradient depend primarily on the hydraulic conductivity k of the sediment but river stage fluctuations driven by seasons tides and dam releases expand the size of this zone and the frequency of mixing between oxidizers and reducers making it more effective at sequestering dissolved fe ii and as laboratory experiments have advanced understanding of the impact of redox oscillations on as mobility in the hz parsons et al 2013 revealed that whereas anoxic conditions mobilize as repetitive cycling between oxidizing and reducing conditions immobilized progressively more dissolved as when the fe iii oxyhydroxides are being reductively dissolved couture et al 2015 observed that as sorbed strongly to the remaining sorbent even as it was concurrently or subsequently reduced from as v to as iii this experimental evidence suggested that these layers have the potential to retain as even under substantial redox fluctuations other minerals besides the surfaces of fe oxyhydroxides may also play an important role in sequestering the dissolved as phan et al 2019 demonstrated that under reducing conditions microbial sulfate so4 reduction led to the sequestration of a portion of dissolved as and newly precipitated sulfide minerals such as mackinawite fes these studies investigated the behavior of as in the hz and identified factors controlling as mobility across temporal and spatial scales brown et al 2007 demonstrated that the mass flux of dissolved as advected from the aquifer into the stream varied seasonally and spatially along a 88 m reach of a stream adjacent to the abandoned brinton arsenic mine in virginia therefore it is necessary to quantify the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater discharge to estimate dissolved as fluxes towards the river in humid regions low lying areas and river valleys tend to receive groundwater cartwright et al 2014 hubbert 1940 krause et al 2007 larkin and sharp 1992 larsen et al 2008 rhodes et al 2017 turco et al 2007 observed hydraulic heads at several transects of shallow aquifer monitoring wells installed along a 10 km reach of the meghna river between 2012 and 2015 suggested the meghna river in the central part of the gbmd generally gains shallow groundwater for most of the year berube et al 2018 knappett et al 2016 these studies however did not quantify groundwater discharge a major goal of this study is to quantify the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater discharge this facilitates answering the following questions 1 what is the seasonal and spatial variability of groundwater discharge along the 13 km reach of the meghna river 2 what is the annual mass flux of dissolved as that groundwater carries into the hz via the shallow aquifer 3 is the cumulative mass flux of dissolved as over the past 200 years since the brahmaputra avulsed to the west of dhaka sufficient to generate the observed enriched sediment as within the hz i e 100 20 000 mg kg in datta et al 2009 1 709 mg kg in jung et al 2015 and 17 599 mg kg in berube et al 2018 we hypothesized that immobilized aqueous as that was advected towards the river can account for this enriched sediment as to test this hypothesis a groundwater flow model constrained by long term high frequency observations of hydraulic heads was developed for a seasonally oscillating river boundary based on the calculated groundwater discharge and the assumption that the dissolved as can be completely trapped within the riverbank sediments the expected mass of as that accumulated in riverbank sediments was calculated by multiplying the groundwater discharge by the locally relevant dissolved as concentrations measured in 1969 tubewells screened within the shallow aquifer along a 13 km reach of the meghna river next these calculated sediment as concentrations were compared to a limited number of observed as concentrations in sediments across the dry season intertidal zone where the majority of the annual groundwater flux discharges to the river 2 study area the study area is a 13 km reach of the meghna river in central bangladesh this reach defines the eastern border of the sub district upazila of araihazar fig 1a the distribution of as concentrations in araihazar has been well characterized owing to 20 years of research by investigators connected to columbia university s arsenic superfund project which evaluated the causes and public health outcomes from long term exposure to as in drinking water argos et al 2010 van geen et al 2014 van geen et al 2003 wasserman et al 2004 zheng et al 2005 the river is located approximately 25 km east of the capital city dhaka approximately 10 km south of this reach the meghna river joins the padma river which carries the discharge of both the ganges and brahmaputra rivers two of the largest rivers in asia ocean tides propagate up the meghna river from the bay of bengal driving 12 h semi diurnal and 14 d neap spring fluctuation periods each of approximately 0 6 m in amplitude

the wet season extends from may through october during which the country receives the vast majority of its rainfall the dry season extends from november through april between 2014 and 2020 four

lithological boreholes berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 from the ground surface to the depth of 40 m there are two main hydro stratigraphic units a shallow sandy aquifer that extends to 20 30 m depth and a clay aquitard with a thickness of 7 m that underlies the shallow aquifer berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 shuai et al 2017 the aquifer varies from very fine to coarse sand and the underlying aquitard is blue clay with high plasticity berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 minor lenses of silty sand and silt were observed at different depths within the aquifer

need to be measured slug tests were performed to measure the spatial variability in k across the aquifer duplicate or triplicate measurements were made on each well coefficients of variation c v were typically 2 pneumatic rising head slug tests were performed on all monitoring wells in s2 and s3 the pneumatic method was described in shuai et al 2017 solid slug tests were performed on wells in s4 which used a solid slug attached to a pressure transducer utilizing both falling and rising head tests at all sites k was calculated using the hvorslev method hvorslev 1951 at site 2 k ranged from 8 8 to 14 5 m day amongst 4 monitoring wells with an average of 11 4 m day and a standard deviation sd of 2 6 m day at s3 observed k was 111 5 m day in the single well at that site at s4 k ranged from 4 3 to 51 6 m day amongst 9 monitoring wells with an average of 34 9 m day and a sd of 14 2 m day the value of k at s1 was estimated by shuai et al 2017 which conducted both slug and pumping tests at s1 the values of k measured with slug tests ranged from 18 4 to 34 1 m day amongst 8 monitoring wells with an average of 27 3 m day and a sd of 5 5 m day shuai et al 2017 the average value of transmissivity t obtained from the pumping tests was 450 m2 day shuai et al 2017 the thickness of shallow aquifer b was 20 m therefore the back calculated k from the pumping tests t b was 22 5 m day this falls within the range of k values measured through slug tests indicating the sandy aquifer at that site is relatively homogeneous with respect to k the full list of the k values is presented in table s2 hydraulic conductivities of the shallow aquifer are available from several field studies throughout araihazar in western araihazar approximately 10 km west of s3 stute et al 2007 and mozumder et al 2020a conducted slug tests on 23 monitoring wells over 7 sites and reported k values ranging from 3 6 to 40 2 m day with an average of 17 0 m day and a sd of 10 9 m day approximately 11 km west of s2 knappett et al 2012 conducted slug tests in 50 monitoring wells over 9 transects throughout one village and reported k values ranging from 1 5 to 40 6 m day with an average of 18 6 m day and a sd of 11 8 m day therefore the observed k in the riverbank aquifer sites s1 s2 and s4 are within the range of the inland shallow aquifer but k in the single well in s3 is approximately double the high end value in 94 previously tested wells throughout the area other monitoring wells at s3 within the shallow aquifer were unfortunately not available to further constrain k for this site although it is unlikely this high k value is typical of all depths and locations at s3 the presence of this high k layer that is evidently intercepted by the monitoring well will raise the effective k of the entire aquifer even if it is only a few meters thick fetter 2018 therefore this value was adopted for the aquifer storativity of the shallow aquifer was reported for several nearby sites in addition to s1 mozumder et al 2020a nakaya et al 2011 shuai et al 2017 based on pumping tests conducted in the shallow aquifer at s1 shuai et al 2017 concluded that s was 3 7 10 4 this low value of s combined with the shape of the drawdown curves during the pumping test suggested that this field site is semi confined at least in the early dry season when the pumping test was performed approximately 10 km west of the s3 mozumder et al 2020a conducted a pumping test in the pre holocene aquifer that underlies a 10 15 m thick clay layer that separates it from the overlying holocene aquifer they reported that s was 6 2 10 4 nakaya et al 2011 used 3 10 6 as the value of s for the shallow aquifer located 20 km east of dhaka which was based on a pumping test in this study the value of s derived from shuai et al 2017 was adopted in the subsequent analysis to quantify groundwater discharge along both sides of the meghna river 3 3 river discharge measurements variation in river discharge was measured to compare the magnitude of the calculated groundwater discharge to river discharge during the dry season dynamic river discharge during multiple ebb phases of semidiurnal tidal cycles during jan 4 8 2015 was measured using an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp m 9 sontek xylem inc san diego ca usa the adcp was mounted to the front of a boat using a custom built aluminum brace as described in rhodes et al 2017 these measurements were made at northern and southern river cross section sites which were located approximately 10 km apart and encompassed most of the study area fig 1b the measurement location alternated each day between the northern and southern river cross sections at each location measurements were made continuously for approximately 6 h the duration of each river discharge measurement was approximately 45 min therefore 6 8 measurements were made each day over the course of an ebb tide phase 8 h 3 4 water level measurement and surveying pressure transducers model 3001 levelogger edge solinst canada ltd georgetown ontario canada recorded water levels every 20 min in the aquifer and the river the raw pressures were converted to water table or river stage elevation as described in knappett et al 2016 the distribution of transducers and the corresponding extent of temporal coverage at the river gage and three transects are detailed in table s3 only nine months of observations were available at s4 which cannot fully represent the annual fluctuations at this transect therefore records from s4 were extended to twelve months by regressing water table observations at s4 on a simple linear equation that utilized the observed water table at nearby s3 the detailed steps are described in the text s1 in the supplementary material the elevations of the top of all monitoring wells and river gage were surveyed using repeated real time kinematic rtk surveys with two gps receivers connected through a radio link trimble rtx enabled netr9 and r10 trimble inc sunnyvale ca usa and on site surveys with a total station and dumpy level berube et al 2018 knappett et al 2016 3 5 analytical groundwater flow model groundwater discharge across the river aquifer boundary was quantified by a new analytical solution that was generalizable for both semi confined and unconfined aquifers under the dupuit assumption the one dimensional unsteady groundwater flow in the unconfined aquifer fig 2 is governed by the boussinesq equation bear 2013 liang and zhang 2012 the governing equation is as follows 1 k x h h x s y h t where k m day is the hydraulic conductivity of the shallow aquifer x m is the horizontal coordinate h m is the hydraulic head in the shallow aquifer with respect to the aquifer bottom s y is the specific yield and t day is time widespread silt or river mud capping on the top of the aquifer is assumed to limit evaporation and infiltration berube et al 2018 pedrazas et al 2021 the boundary and initial conditions can be expressed as follows 2 h l t u t 3 h 0 t g t 4 h x 0 f x where u t and g t are the time dependent groundwater level and river stage at the right and left boundaries respectively fig 2 both u t and g t were set equal to observed water levels f x is the initial position of the water table l is the length of the flow domain which varies over sites the term f x is the solution to the steady state solution of d dx h dh dx 0 and needs to satisfy eqs 2 and 3 therefore 5 f x g 2 0 u 2 0 g 2 0 l x 3 6 sediment arsenic estimation the ganges and brahmaputra rivers combined carry the greatest sediment bedload of all major rivers in the world milliman and meade 1983 syvitski and saito 2007 this bedload and the avulsions of river channels that its deposition drives built up the shallow aquifer during the holocene across the gbmd during the holocene the brahmaputra river periodically flowed through the subsiding surma basin acharyya et al 2000 to the east of the tectonically uplifted madhupur tracts in central bangladesh where the capital city of dhaka is located goodbred et al 2014 fig 1a this was the situation in 1770 when the brahmaputra flowed through araihazar joining up with the meghna river islam 2016 sarker et al 2003 around this time the brahmaputra began to avulse towards the west this process was completed by 1830 and since then the brahmaputra has flown through a similar path to the west of the madhupur tracts islam 2016 sarker et al 2003 in contrast to the brahmaputra the meghna river is a low energy river that deposits little new primary sediments downstream of the subsiding surma basin which acts like a sediment trap rahman et al 2018 therefore to calculate the accumulated mass of as in riverbank sediments 200 years was implemented in the model which represented the likely time since deposition of the riverbank aquifer sediments this is an upper time limit for dissolved as to accumulate in riverbank sediments since scouring and accretion of new sediment on the surficial 0 3 m riverbanks does occur during the wet season in riverbank sand with moderate permeability poorly crystalline fe iii oxyhydroxides are hypothesized to precipitate and sequester dissolved as from groundwater discharging to the river here we specifically refer to this as a permeable natural reactive barrier pnrb charette and sholkovitz 2002 the term permeable distinguishes sandy riverbanks where advection and dispersion drive mixing from low permeability estuarine marsh silts where similar fe iii oxyhydroxide deposits have been found but the mixing between oxidants and reductants is driven by molecular diffusion and therefore the scale is smaller johnston et al 2011 moffett and gorelick 2016 in this study the thickness of the pnrb h was obtained from sediment cores collected by berube 2017 the length of the pnrb l was estimated as the ratio of fluctuation of the river stage which is driven by semi diurnal and neap spring tidal cycles and the grade of the riverbank fig 3 the riverbank grade was estimated using both on site surveying and the digital terrain elevation data dted collected by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm in google earth the riverbanks are broad and largely free of vegetation and these methods gave similar grades hydrological models genereux and bandopadhyay 2001 mcbride and pfannkuch 1975 pfannkuch and winter 1984 trefry et al 2007 predicted that the direction of groundwater flow tends to be vertical near the groundwater surface water interface as a result groundwater discharges through a narrow zone near the shore where the flow paths converge to estimate the upper limit of accumulated sediment as in pnrb we assumed that all groundwater discharging to the river passed through the pnrb fig 3 and the dissolved as was completely trapped there jung et al 2015 based on the above assumptions the as concentration c as s mg kg in the riverbank sediment over 200 years was calculated as 6 c as s 200 q c as aq 1000 ρlh where q m2 year is the groundwater discharge per unit width which was calculated using the analytical groundwater model developed in section 3 5 c as aq μg l is the dissolved as concentration in groundwater ρ g cm3 is the bulk density which was assumed to be 2 g cm3 jung et al 2015 mozumder et al 2020b and h m and l m are the thickness and length of pnrb respectively under steady state conditions with respect to the pore water chemistry of an aquifer there is no net retardation of the mass flux of a solute since it is at chemical equilibrium with the sorption sites within a continuous plume fetter 2018 therefore there is no retardation term in eq 6 4 results 4 1 analytical solution of the groundwater flow boundary value problem the form of the analytical hydraulic model was chosen for modeling any type of aquifer confined and unconfined that is connected to a river with a regularly oscillating stage the nonlinearity of the governing equation eq 1 means that it is difficult to obtain its analytical solution except for some special cases therefore eq 1 must be linearized and then rewritten as bear 2013 liang and zhang 2012 7 β 2 φ x 2 φ t where φ h 2 and β k h s y in the latter term h is the average of the saturated thickness of the aquifer assuming that φ x t can be written as φ x t v x t w x t we can derive 8 v x t 1 x l g 2 t x l u 2 t 9 w x t n 1 0 t 2 u 2 0 nπ e αt φ n τ e α t

obtained and substituted into eq s 8 11 the functions of v x t and w x t can be solved which will derive the function of φ x t then h x t can be easily calculated by taking the square root of φ x t this study focusses on seasonally changing groundwater discharge between the river and the aquifer therefore the short term fluctuations of groundwater level and river stage were neglected the meghna river fluctuates periodically in a relatively symmetrical way over each year owing to a monsoon season which has a duration of approximately 6 months therefore the river stage and groundwater level at the aquifer boundary can be simulated by simple sine functions g t a sin bx c d and u t a sin bt c d the terms a b c d a b c and d are constants that were fit to the observed river stage and water level respectively then h x t can be given by 12 h x t φ x t 1 x l a sin bt c d 2 x l a sin bt c d 2 n 1 2 a sin c d 2 nπ e αt θ t ϕ t sin nπ l x 1 2 where 13 θ t 2 a 2 bd b α b 2 α 2 sin bt c cos bt

discharge per unit width of the aquifer 4 2 estimating groundwater discharge 4 2 1 determining water levels at the model boundaries sine functions that represent river stage and groundwater level at the aquifer boundary have to be determined first so they can be input into the eq 12 the observed water table in wells s1 1a s3 1a and s4 1c was used to constrain the aquifer boundary for the separate models from s1 s3 and s4 respectively the coefficient of determination r2 between observed and fitted water levels at aquifer boundaries exceeds 0 94 fig 4 whereas the root mean square error rmse ranges from 0 27 to 0 31 m this error in the model derived from short term tidal fluctuations during the dry season or episodic flooding during the wet season the water table fluctuates 4 m annually thus the rmse is approximately 7 of the annual fluctuation which is a minor component the relative amounts and timing of monsoon rainfall over the study period have been quite stable weekly precipitation amounts measured along one of the two primary tributaries to the meghna river in sylhet and in nearby dhaka between 2014 and 2020 fig s2 both match the timing of river stage and water table oscillations in any given year the surma basin part of the meghna river watershed receives approximately double the rainfall compared to the study reach fig s3 the stability of recent timing of the monsoon as well as the total amounts provides evidence of the relative stability of the hydrologic cycle in this region over the past 60 years this stability is a key assumption in eq 6 4 2 2 analytical model verification after fitting the sine functions that best represented water levels at the aquifer and river boundaries the performance of the model was challenged against independent water level observations that were not used to generate the predicted shape of the water table over time this was performed for the models at s1 and s4 where a time series of synoptic observations of the water table were available in at least one other monitoring well s1 t5 and s4 3c the values of r2 and rmse at s1 were 0 95 and 0 36 m respectively fig 5a at s4 these corresponding values were 0 97 and 0 33 m respectively fig 5b this successful test indicates that the model accurately represents the seasonal fluctuation in the shape of the water table between the known aquifer boundary condition and river stage 4 2 3 calculating groundwater discharge through the riverbank groundwater discharge was calculated over one year at s1 s3 and s4 fig 6 negative values indicate water flowing from the aquifer to the river gaining river at all sites the river is gaining groundwater for nearly the entire year this agrees with observations reported by other authors studying the seasonally influenced groundwater discharge to rivers located in low lying regions berube et al 2018 krause et al 2007 larsen et al 2008 at s1 groundwater discharge per unit width of the aquifer varied between 233 and 872 m2 yr with an average of 562 m2 yr site 3 had the smallest discharge rate which varied between 104 and 756 m2 yr with an average of 318 m2 yr at s4 discharge varied between 333 and 1094 m2 yr with an average of 754 m2 yr although the specific timing of groundwater discharge variations differed between the three sites the general shape was similar the average groundwater discharge black line in fig 6 over the three sites was calculated which ranged from 173 to 891 m2 yr with an annualized average of 540 m2 yr this average groundwater discharge peaks in january and then reaches a minimum in the early monsoon in july although river discharge during the dry season is highly dynamic over a single semidiurnal tidal cycle fig s4 the relative contribution of groundwater discharge to the river discharge along this study reach is always quite low during january 2015 river discharge ranged from 150 m3 s in the upstream direction north to 3658 m3 s in the downstream direction south over multiple ebb tides with an average of 2100 m3 s for comparison the average groundwater discharge during the month of january was only 0 6 m3 s or 0 03 of river discharge 4 3 predicting sediment as concentrations within the intertidal zone 4 3 1 spatial distribution of dissolved as in groundwater the concentrations of as in 1 962 shallow wells were utilized to represent the distribution of dissolved as in the groundwater along the western bank of the meghna river utilizing the spatial autocorrelation package in arcgis 10 8 1 esri redlands ca usa a spatial dependence of 350 m was found fig s5 then inverse distance weighted idw was used to spatially average dissolved as concentrations over 350 350 m2 squares low concentration zones 50 μg l are located in the northern area whereas high concentration 200 μg l zones are located in the south fig 7 the direction of groundwater flow is generally perpendicular to the riverbank because the hydraulic gradients are large in that direction benner et al 2008 sun et al 2016 therefore the 1 km buffer strip was divided into 37 rectangular zones oriented parallel to the groundwater flow direction these were labeled as 1 to 37 from north to south fig 7 each zone is 350 1000 m2 in size and divided into three 350 350 m2 squares fig 7 for each zone the dissolved as concentration in groundwater discharging to the river was assumed to be the average of the three square zones along the flow path fig 8a on the eastern riverbank only 7 monitoring wells located within s1 were sampled for the groundwater as concentration due to the limited measurements we were not able to perform the same spatial analysis as we did along the western bank therefore the average dissolved as concentration of the 7 wells was utilized to represent the dissolved as concentrations in groundwater discharging to the river at s1 this is 325 143 μg l fig 8a 4 3 2 the dimensions of the intertidal zone and the pnrb the hcl extracted sedimentary as concentrations from 7 cores fig 7 suggested that the depth of pnrb was about 1 m berube 2017 berube et al 2018 other authors studying locations 10 km south of the present study area found evidence of a pnrb at depths of 0 2 m jung et al 2015 therefore we adopted 1 m as the thickness of pnrb h in this study fig 3 surveying using a total station revealed that the riverbank at s1 has an approximate grade of 7 berube et al 2018 in the dry season the river stage fluctuates 1 2 m driven by semi diurnal and neap spring tidal cycles therefore the length of the pnrb l at s1 would be 17 m fig 3 using the same method the bank grades at s2 and s4 were found to be 3 sites 2 and 4 are located in as concentration zones 1 and 31 respectively therefore 3 was assumed to be the representative bank grade of the zone the riverbank grades near s1 s2 and s4 were also estimated from google earth by drawing transects across the bank and extracting elevations from the embedded shuttle radar data these deviated 1 from the surveyed grades thus google earth was utilized to estimate the representative riverbank grades for each zone these grades are detailed in table s4 over 38 zones on the west bank the riverbank grade varies between 3 and 6 based on the 1 2 m total tidal fluctuation amplitudes in river stage this causes the intertidal zone to range from 19 m to 40 m with the average of 28 m 4 3 3 calculated and measured sediment as concentration in pnrb four of seven cores were taken near s1 on the eastern bank fig 7 the average observed sediment as concentrations over 1 m in these cores were 83 599 31 and 17 mg kg respectively the other three cores were located in zones 16 18 and 20 along the west bank fig 7 and the depth averaged observed sediment as concentrations were 588 328 and 231 mg kg respectively fig 8b these measured sediment as concentrations were greatly enriched over values at depths deeper than 1 m at all cores and also hundreds of times greater than the hcl extractable as found in other high as shallow aquifer sites throughout araihazar 1 3 1 5 mg kg in radloff et al 2007 and 0 5 2 9 mg kg in zheng et al 2005 as well as other nearby sites within the holocene aquifer 0 6 mg kg in harvey et al 2002 based on the calculated average groundwater discharge rate over s1 s3 and s4 the estimated dissolved as concentration and the dimensions of pnrb in each zone the predicted corresponding sediment as concentration was calculated utilizing eq 6 fig 8b over 37 zones on the western riverbank zone 28 was predicted to have the highest concentration of 630 144 mg kg in contrast zone 7 was predicted to have the lowest concentration of 78 21 mg kg observed sediment as concentrations were available at four locations at zone 16 the observed concentration 588 mg kg is somewhat higher than the range of predicted concentration of 334 107 mg kg fig 8b in zone 18 however the observed concentration 328 mg kg is close to the predicted concentration of 301 39 mg kg the same is true for zone 20 at s1 the observed concentrations from two cores 83 and 599 mg kg collected at s1 are within the range of predicted concentration which is 849 373 mg kg in contrast to the similarity between the predicted and observed sediment as concentrations far less hcl extractable fe was observed within the sediments than predicted based on the 200 year mass fluxes of dissolved fe eq 6 text s3 in the supporting information 5 discussion 5 1 seasonal changes in groundwater discharge to the river in this study we found that in a low lying delta with a monsoonal climate the seasonal variation in groundwater discharge is impacted by the wet and dry seasons at the beginning of the wet season the river stage rises faster than the water table this is the time that the minimum groundwater discharge occurs at all three sites s1 s3 and s4 fig 6 the interaction between the timing and amounts of precipitation across the meghna river watershed drives differences in the timing of the rising of river stage and the local water table thus the timing of minimum discharge varies year to year table s5 whereas multiple years of water table measurements were made at s1 and s3 at s4 only approximately one year 2020 of measurements were available the average timing of the minimum groundwater discharge varied slightly over the three sites groundwater discharge remains low throughout the wet season and then increases throughout the late wet and early dry season when river stage falls quickly while the local water table remains high during the late dry season february april the local water table converges on the river stage owing to discharge to the river and pumping for agricultural harvey et al 2006 causing flux to decrease some independent measurements are available to compare with these results jung et al 2015 installed 19 seepage meters along the meghna river in gazaria upazila 20 km south of the s4 and measured groundwater discharge in the late wet season oct 31 nov 4 during this period they observed an average groundwater discharge of 22 3 m day with a sd of 6 6 m day jung et al 2015 the average groundwater discharge across all sites modeled in this study during the same time of year was 37 7 m day with a sd of 0 2 m day even during the early dry season when maximum groundwater discharge occurs groundwater still only contributed an additional 0 03 to river discharge over the 13 km study reach of this wide shallow deltaic river 1 5 km wide 10 m deep see section 4 2 3 this estimate however was based on observations and 2 d aquifer models at 3 sites and may have missed much higher transmissivity locations with higher discharge in general across lowland rivers the proportion of groundwater discharge to river discharge varies by season owing to precipitation amounts and intensity as well as river segment poulsen et al 2015 utilized river based differential gaging to measure the discharge of a low order stream in denmark they observed that baseflow increased the stream discharge from 0 7 to 1 0 m3 s over the 2 4 km reach representing a 30 increase utilizing differential gaging on the lower brazos river in central texas rhodes et al 2017 found that groundwater discharge over a 24 km reach of the lowland river varied from a peak of 15 just after a flood event to zero at the end of a two month dry period in contrast along a 122 km reach of the larger havel river in northeastern germany differential gaging revealed that annualized groundwater discharge only contributed 0 8 m3 s or 1 to river discharge 87 9 m3 s krause et al 2007 along a 38 km reach of the lower merced river in california temporal changes in river salinity were utilized to estimate groundwater discharge which was found to contribute 0 1 m3 s or 0 3 7 0 of river discharge which itself ranged from 1 4 to 31 6 m3 s pai et al 2015 together these findings revealed that baseflow commonly comprised only a small portion of river discharge along higher order lowland rivers especially during prolonged dry periods for the meghna river the river s discharge during the early dry season likely derives from draining of wetlands across the surma basin that are connected with the river and store abundant water during the wet season across the basin rahman et al 2020 there were some differences in the magnitude and timing of groundwater discharge across the three sites fig 6 at s1 and s4 the direction of groundwater flow was consistently from the aquifer to the river whereas at s3 a minor amount of water flowed from the river to the aquifer between june and july moreover the magnitude of the discharge at s1 and s4 was consistently larger than at s3 despite the high k at s3 more groundwater discharged to the river at s4 than s1 during most of the year but between august and november s4 produced less discharge than s1 similar patterns in seasonal groundwater discharge have been reported in other studies atkinson et al 2015 lowry et al 2007 poulsen et al 2015 taniguchi et al 2003 unland et al 2013 5 2 predicted sediment arsenic concentrations and its association with sediment fe except for zone 16 the predicted sediment as concentrations 78 849 mg kg calculated by multiplying annual groundwater discharge by the average zonal dissolved as concentration are consistent with or higher than observed fig 8b in zone 16 the observed concentration is 33 higher than the upper limit of that predicted due to the high heterogeneity of dissolved as distribution in shallow groundwater we may have underestimated the average dissolved as concentration in zone 16 which may have contributed to the lower predicted sediment as concentration than observed but in general this near closure of the as mass balance suggests that dissolved as in groundwater is the primary source of the enriched concentrations within the pnrbs in the future sediment as concentrations should be measured in other zones along the west side of the riverbank to further challenge the predicted concentrations presented in this paper jung et al 2015 proposed a similar as accumulation model that can also be used to calculate the expected sediment as concentration in a pnrb that accumulates over a given time period they assumed that groundwater with an average dissolved as concentration of 100 μg l was trapped by the pnrb with a bulk density of 2 g cm3 after 200 years accumulation sediment as concentration in 1 m thick pnrb would be 101 mg kg applying the assumed dissolved as of 100 μg l and the pnrb thickness of 1 m to eq 6 however yields an expected concentration of 130 318 mg kg the reason for the range of predicted sediment as concentrations is from changes in the length of pnrb which ranges from 19 m to 40 m the discrepancy between two sets of results is mainly caused by the different groundwater discharge rates the annual groundwater discharge 10 m yr assumed in jung et al 2015 was estimated over 5 days oct 31 nov 4 measurements the calibrated boussinesq model however predicts seasonal variation in groundwater discharge the estimated annualized discharge rate from this study averaged across all three sites was 25 m yr this is what drives the estimated sediment as concentration higher than that of jung et al 2015 given the differences between estimating groundwater discharge from a riverbank along a river at multiple locations using modeled hydraulic heads and river stage and the more direct but smaller scale measurement of groundwater discharge with seepage meters it is encouraging that the results differ by a factor of about 2 5 the fact that much less hcl extractable sediment fe was found compared to that predicted by eq 6 for the s1 and s3 where both dissolved fe in groundwater and observed sediment fe were available suggests that the fe captured within the pnrb is either released to the river or is transformed into more crystalline forms evidence of the former process was presented in our previous publication berube et al 2018 showed the active release of fe from the sediment to pore waters within the pnrb at s1 during january 2016 arsenic was not released to pore waters at this place and time and was thought to re sorb to remaining fe oxyhydroxides berube et al 2018 also showed far higher concentrations of sediment fe within recalcitrant mineral phases extractable with aqua regia or detected with handheld xrf this contrasted with as which was found to be predominantly in the hcl extractable phase thus although much more work needs to be done characterizing the specific mineralogy and associations between fe and as in riverbank sediments the current evidence points to as being preferentially associated with amorphous or poorly ordered fe oxyhydroxide phases whereas the fe itself is both released to the river and re crystallized 5 3 sources of uncertainty in the groundwater discharge estimates to quantify groundwater discharge and the concentration of sediment as derived from dissolved as in groundwater several assumptions were made which introduced uncertainty in the quantitative values of our findings first we assumed that groundwater completely discharges through the intertidal zone which is 19 40 m inland from the shoreline of the dry season fig 3 during the wet season however the river stage will rise beyond the intertidal zone which will diminish the discharge of groundwater through it based on the observed river stage the intertidal zone is generally inundated between the end of may and early november table s6 during this period the groundwater discharge accounts for approximate 25 of the annual flux therefore we speculate that the actual percentage of groundwater discharge through the intertidal zone is between 75 and 100 this would proportionately lower the real mass flux of dissolved as advecting to the intertidal zone in a direct 1 1 manner second we assumed the riverbank was vertical in the analytical hydraulic model to calculate groundwater discharge but to calculate the accumulation of dissolved as in the pnrb eq 6 groundwater was assumed to discharge across the gently sloping intertidal zone this inconsistency may have impacted the results along the 13 km river reach the bank grade is 3 7 see section 4 3 2 sharp 1977 suggested it was necessary to consider the sloping geometry in an analytical hydraulic model to accurately quantify water exchange between groundwater and surface water doble et al 2012 found that if the riverbank grade increases from 6 to 15 the bank infiltration rates and storage volume will increase 98 and 40 respectively therefore the present study may underestimate the groundwater discharge which will further underestimate the concentration of sediment as third the observed groundwater table and river stage were represented by sine functions in the analytical model sections 4 1 and 4 2 1 these functions do not represent short term water level fluctuations fig 4 and may cause a divergence in calculated groundwater discharge from a model that is constrained by observed boundary conditions at finer frequency to assess the sensitivity of discharge to the frequency of hydraulic head observations at the boundaries a 3 d numerical model was developed within modflow 2000 which is encoded within the groundwater modeling system gms utilizing daily average hydraulic heads additionally for comparison daily groundwater discharge was calculated with darcy s law the general seasonal pattern of groundwater discharge derived from three approaches is consistent fig s6 listed from most to least complex models the average annual groundwater discharge derived from three approaches for the numerical daily boussinesq sine functions and darcy s law daily were 596 740 and 707 m2 yr respectively the least complex model produced an estimated discharge that lay between the numerical and boussinesq model the reason why darcy s law performed similarly to the more complex models that explicitly account for water table storage is the small value of s y 3 7 10 4 used in the studied riverbank aquifer when the aquifer has higher s y and water table storage is important darcy s law will underestimate discharge in both directions and in this case either the boussinesq or the more complex but flexible numerical model will be needed the difference in the calculated discharge between the daily discretized numerical and the analytical model suggests that the newly developed analytical model may over estimate discharge by as much as 23 the advantage of this model over darcy s law is that it can be used to estimate groundwater discharge for any type of the aquifer confined or unconfined in general the advantage of an analytical model over a numerical model is the low computing power greater transparency and therefore reproducibility between studies and the lower likelihood of over fitting observations which can improve the identifiability of the key variables that impact discharge or related reaction processes 5 4 dissolved arsenic in groundwater is sufficient to account for sediment arsenic in a pnrb the buried 5 m and surficial 1 2 m depth sediments with high concentrations of as along the meghna river have been suggested to be formed from groundwater mixing with oxidized river water berube et al 2018 datta et al 2009 jung et al 2015 if all the dissolved as that was transported to the riverbank over the past 200 years since the aquifer building brahmaputra river avulsed to the west was completely trapped within the pnrb the predicted concentrations of sediment as are consistent with or higher than observed using hcl extractions this suggests that groundwater mass fluxes provide sufficient as to account for all the as in the mapped pnrbs earlier published studies on sources of dissolved as within a shallow aquifer underlying a parafluvial zone of the mekong river suggested alternative sources of sediment as along the riverbanks polizzotto et al 2008 proposed that as released from the river derived floodplain sediments replenishes the dissolved sediment as pool in the aquifer which was diminished through mobilization and advection through the aquifer to the mekong river postma et al 2010 found that the river mud has a large pool of reactive fe iii oxyhydroxides with high as content and higher ratio of released as fe than aquifer sediments and river sand therefore present day sediments deposited by a river can be an important contemporary source of dissolved as to aquifers which underlie or are down hydraulic gradient from floodplains although we were not able to directly verify whether the aforementioned alternative sources exist within parafluvial zones of the study reach the calculations suggested that dissolved as in groundwater can approximately account for the of the extremely elevated mass of sedimentary as found in the riverbank 6 conclusions this study quantified the relationship between water exchange between an alluvial aquifer and the tidally fluctuating meghna river and the accumulation of as at the river aquifer interface groundwater discharge was calculated using a newly developed and calibrated analytical model which describes seasonal and spatial variations in discharge over three sites the average groundwater discharge per unit width at each of three calibrated sites ranges from 173 to 891 m2 yr the average across all three sites is 540 m2 yr the negative values indicate that the direction of the flux is consistently from the aquifer to the river this modeled discharge was multiplied by the average dissolved as concentrations measured within shallow private groundwater wells to calculate the expected concentrations of sediment as in the upper 1 m of the riverbanks if indeed all the dissolved as was captured there over 200 years these predicted sediment as concentrations are consistent with or higher than those observed this closure of the mass balance suggests that dissolved as in groundwater discharging to the meghna river is sufficient to account for the enriched sediment as in a pnrb credit authorship contribution statement yibin huang conceptualization

1246,we developed a decimetric size model based on coupling generalized darcy s law and heat transfer equations to model viscous dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl pumping through highly permeable porous media under non isothermal conditions the presence of fingering and non wetting phase ganglia was modeled through an unsteady capillary diffusion coefficient and an arbitrary heterogeneous permeability field the model was validated using existing experimental data of a simple case an oil injection in a 2d tank packed with glass beads next we compared the results of this model against a dnapl extracting situation in the 2d tank to better understand the two phase flow behavior in highly permeable porous media we found that natural convection during heating plays an essential role in heat transfer especially in the wetting phase zone by adding the dynamic effect unsteady conditions we were better able to describe the presence of the ganglia in porous media we observed good agreement between modeled and experimental oil saturation curves until the breakthrough point with a mean relative error of about 10 for low and high flow rates and 8 and 16 after breakthrough for low and high flow rates respectively extracting viscous oil at low flow rates and high temperature generates less fingering and is well described by the generalized darcy s law the remobilization of residual non wetting ganglia after the breakthrough point at the outlet is however difficult to simulate using the generalized darcy s law in the end we treated this issue by using a perturbed permeability field to simulate the observed fingering in the 2d tank keywords dense non aqueous phase liquid two phase flow non isothermal 2d tank thermally enhanced dnapl recovery coal tar 1 introduction the modeling of coupling between two phase flow and heat transfers is of vast interest in porous media applications for instance water evaporation from soil subsurface davarzani et al 2014 gao et al 2018 mosthaf et al 2011 drying of various porous materials defraeye 2014 perré and turner 1999 whitaker 1977 panda et al 2020 prat 2002 vanderborght et al 2017 vorhauer et al 2018 whitaker 1977 nuclear safety fichot et al 2006 lipinski 1984 and the design of pem fuel cells meng 2007 the petroleum industry has already taken an interest in the problem of recovery under non isothermal conditions class et al 2002 reviewed several software tools able to couple mass and heat transfer under local thermal equilibrium lte the aim of these numerical tools was generally to model vadose zone remediation processes such as soil vapor extraction or steam injection class et al 2002 more recently a similar comparative evaluation of non isothermal two phase numerical models was performed on the simulation of carbon dioxide storage class et al 2009 the lte class et al 2002 is valid when fluid solid temperature variations at the pore scale are negligible in comparison to the macro scale variations kaviany 1991 in practical terms it implies that flow velocities should be small in the opposing case there is local thermal non equilibrium ltne pati et al 2022 so in field applications since the length scale is large ltne is not considered however the addition of a lateral heating element and the flow conditions imposed by pumping can generate local heating perturbations near the heating element and the extraction point the study of non aqueous phase liquid napl water flow under non isothermal conditions is less common to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt reported in the literature to model dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl water pumping under non isothermal conditions in highly permeable porous media colombano et al 2021 used a two phase flow model to predict chlorinated solvent recovery rates for surfactant enhancement applications in a 2d tank but only in isothermal and stable conditions colombano et al 2021 they used a pressure pressure two phase flow formulation instead we used a mixture model formulation to solve two phase flow in porous media wang and beckermann 1993 we chose this formulation because it is known to be more versatile than the pressure pressure formulation helmig et al 1997 as we gain more knowledge about dnapl remediation we need to include more variables such as temperature to better represent the processes at stake hu et al 2021 koproch et al 2022 mohamed et al 2007 o carroll and sleep 2009 rathfelder et al 1995 sleep and ma 1997 this study examined how non isothermal conditions can be implemented in a two phase flow in porous media model at darcy scale between 10 3 m and 10 m a highly viscous dnapl coal tar was also studied here and may have increased the complexity of the comparison between experiments and modeling in recovery applications the fluids are set into motion due to the extraction boundary condition which can cause great differences between the porous matrix temperature ts the non wetting phase tnw and the wetting phase tw davarzani et al 2014 gandomkar and gray 2018 lu et al 2018 prasannakumara 2021 rees et al 2008 an example of a three equation model exists in bio heat applications nakayama and kuwahara 2008 in this study we still considered that temperature variations between both non wetting and wetting liquid phases were negligible at the tank scale e g decimetric scale we then defined a single temperature for both the non wetting and wetting phase called liquid temperature tl for the convenience of modeling here we simulated the experimental study done by philippe et al 2021 to better understand the governing phenomena related to the coupled two phase flow and heat transfer in porous media during dnapl pumping under non isothermal conditions they used a well instrumented decimetric 2d tank to study dnapl pumping under non isothermal conditions in 1 mm packed glass beads permeability of 3 5 10 10 m2 they observed viscous fingering under their experimental conditions for two fluid pairs ethanol canola oil and water coal tar i e an unstable finger like fluid front displacement due to an unfavorable viscosity ratio of the invading displaced fluids it is found that viscous fingering reduces with increasing temperature and pumping rate which enhances the dnapl recovery under non isothermal conditions a heating element was used to model the non isothermal conditions in 2d initially the cone of depression was slightly asymmetrical but it became symmetrical at the final pumping state they observed less viscous fingering in the warm part of the cone of depression near the heating source than in the cold part because the viscosity ratio invading displaced fluids here ethanol oil is smaller where the temperature is higher philippe et al 2021 the maximum temperature set in our work is 60 c which is below the boiling point of the liquids we used to reduce their evaporation at this temperature evaporation of ethanol was noted during 2d tank experiments at a temperature slightly higher than 60 c ethanol bubbles formed moreover keeping both wetting and non wetting phases in the liquid state is an underlying objective of thermal enhancement for coal tar pumping applications the presence of vapors in the subsurface complicates the understanding of the mass transfers occurring in the soil also in real applications the evaporation of the dnapl is undesirable during pumping processes as it may hinder dnapl transport to the wellbore 2 mathematical model our goal was to develop a two phase flow in porous media model that accounts for i the influence of heat transfers under local thermal non equilibrium conditions and ii viscous fingering here we give the governing equations for the mass and energy balance the strong coupling is done by considering a temperature dependence on dynamic viscosities and densities we neglected the compositional and crossed effects related to the multi component nature of the coal tar and canola oil 2 1 governing equations for two phase flow in porous media single phase flow in homogeneous and isotropic porous media is represented by darcy s law 1 u

eventual external volume force pa m 1 davarzani and marcoux 2011 grosan et al 2009 in this study f is the buoyancy force due to density variation following the boussinesq approximation i e f ρw g β t t c where ρw is the fluid density at a reference temperature t c and β is the coefficient of thermal expansion k 1 the traditional macroscopic two phase flow equations in porous media required several assumptions such as incompressible and immiscible fluids and low reynolds number i e re 1 the assumption of immiscible fluids is verified here because the solubility of the selected liquid pair is very low over the temperature range rao and arnold 1956 the last condition i e re 1 is fulfilled as shown in philippe et al 2021 for the different temperature values and fluids philippe et al 2021 the porous medium should be fully saturated by both liquids no air and it is assumed that the capillary pressure depends only on saturation muskat and meres 1936 whitaker 1986 2 s w s nw 1 3 p c s w p nw p w where s i is the saturation of phase i from these hypotheses we can write the extension of darcy s law to multiphase flows also called generalized darcy s law for each of the fluid phases in heterogeneous and isotropic porous media muskat and meres 1936 whitaker 1986 4 u i k k r i s i μ i t p i ρ i t g with i w nw here the subscript i denotes the wetting phase w and non wetting phase nw respectively u i m s 1 is the darcy velocities and p i the pressure of phase i k r i s i μ i is referred to as mobility which is noted m i later μi t and ρi t are the fluid dynamic viscosity and density respectively which depend on the temperature since we know the relationship between the temperature and the density of the fluids see philippe et al 2020 we consider a single volumetric force related to gravity that takes into account the natural convection the effective saturation and the mass conservation laws can also be written for each of the two liquids according to their effective saturation 5 s ei s i s r i 1 s r nw s r w 6 1 s r nw s r w ρ w s ew t ρ w u w 0 7 1 s r nw s r w ρ nw s enw t ρ nw u nw 0 where sei is the effective saturation of phase i s r nw the non wetting phase residual saturation and s r w the irreducible wetting phase saturation or immovable water which is the lowest water saturation that can be achieved in porous media by displacing the water with oil falta et al 2005 different approaches to solving this problem exist chen et al 2006 generally classified into two types pressure pressure or pressure saturation formulations the numerical modeling of two phase flow in porous media chosen here is a mixture model wang and beckermann 1993 by writing the total velocity field as the sum of the velocity fields of each phase weighted by the effective saturation 8 u s ew u w s enw u nw it is thus possible to rewrite the previous equations and obtain the following system of equations 9 u k s ew m w s enw m nw p ρ w s ew ρ nw s enw g z 10 1 s r nw s

ew and the pressure field p are primary variables and are solved numerically p c s ew and k r i s w are constitutive relationships determined from literature or similar experiments we used the van genuchten mualem model to relate the capillary pressure and relative permeability to the wetting phase saturation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 12 s ew 1 α p c n m where α m 1 and n are the van

the parameter l has been considered equal to 0 5 which is commonly accepted in this type of porous medium chen et al 1999 mualem 1976 2 2 governing equations for heat transfers in porous media here we introduce the heat transfer equations assuming that the lte assumption is not automatically verified for a non isothermal single phase flow in porous media this assumption depends on the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases as well as a small length scale between both phases davarzani et al 2010 davarzani et al 2021 quintard and whitaker 1995 in practice the governing equations for ltne heat transfer can be written as nield and bejan 2006 quintard et al 1997 15 ε ρ c p l t l t ρ c p l u t l ε λ l eff t l h t s t l 16 1 ε ρ c p s t s t 1 ε λ s eff t s h t l t s where ε is the porosity of the porous medium ρ the density kg m 3 c p the heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 and λ i eff the effective thermal conductivity tensor w m 1 k 1 the subscripts l and s denote liquid and solid properties h is a coefficient representing the heat transfer occurring between phases at the micro scale knowing that the thermophysical contrasts e g thermal conductivity ratio between canola oil and ethanol are very small and there is no rapid evaporation condensation processes duval et al 2004 we have used the local thermal equilibrium between fluid phases e g both liquid phases can be described in terms of a single fluid average temperature t l the coefficient h can be replaced by the product of h sl solid to liquid heat transfer coefficient and a sl the specific surface area of the surface area for glass beads wakao and kagei 1982 give the expression of a sl and h sl as functions of prandtl pr reynolds numbers re and nusselt number nu a multitude of experiments with re ranging from 15 to 8500 have validated these expressions wakao et al 1979 17 h sl λ l nu d gb a sl 6 1 ε d gb 18 pr μ l c p l λ l re ρ l ud gb μ l nu 2 1 1 pr 1 3 re 0 6 where d gb is the diameter of the glass beads zanoni et al 2017 pointed out the issue of using wakao s correlation eqs 17 18 due to a higher reynolds number than encountered in environmental applications they proposed another correlation that seems more suitable for smoldering remediation zanoni et al 2017 indeed the hypothesis of darcy s law imposes respect for the condition re 1 which is not compatible with wakao s correlation more recently gossler et al 2020 reviewed different studies on the experimental determination of h sl a new correlation on the dependence of nu on re is proposed by supposing that pr 1 3 is a constant for groundwater between all studies on ltne effects on aquifer flow the consensus seems to be that ltne effects appear for large grain sizes gravel or very high velocities gossler et al 2020 almost all these studies represent 1d flow conditions while extraction involves an axisymmetrical 2d component radial flow towards the well moreover the multiphase feature of dnapl recovery is incompatible with the hypothesis that pr is a constant to conclude wakao s correlation eqs 17 18 which is supported by many previous experimental studies seems to be the most suitable for model development however these correlations are obtained from situations where only one phase is flowing in the porous medium since we deal with two phase flow here we will suppose that the non wetting and wetting phases have the same average temperature t l because they are both subject to forced convection effects the liquid properties ρc p l and λ l eff are represented as an average depending on saturation 19 ρ c p l s w ρ c p w s nw ρ c p nw 20 λ l eff s w λ w eff s nw λ nw eff the local thermal equilibrium lte e g t l is equal to t s assumption depends on the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases as well as a small length scale between both phases davarzani et al 2010 davarzani et al 2021 quintard and whitaker 1995 in this case the previous equations can be simplified into one equation with effective properties expressed as an average weighted by porosity 21 ρ c p eff t t ρ c p l u t λ eff t 22 ρ c p eff 1 ε ρ c p s ε ρ c p l 23 λ eff λ λ d where t is the average temperature and λ eff is the effective thermal conductivity λ represents the equivalent thermal conductivity determined from the solid and liquid thermal conductivity but also the arrangement of the phases at the micro scale λ d represents the contribution of thermal dispersion to effective thermal conductivity the effective thermal conductivity can be estimated experimentally nozad et al 1985 or calculated by solving a closure problem over a representative unit cell of the porous medium davarzani et al 2010 davarzani et al 2011 quintard 1993 whitaker 1999 a strategy that is increasingly under investigation with the development of ct scanners and other devices for pore scale investigation petrasch et al 2008 rong et al 2019 dispersion longitudinal and transversal is a consequence of the heterogeneity of the flow velocity at the microscale and can be expressed as a function of the péclet number and the liquid properties alazmi and vafai 2000 davarzani et al 2010 kaviany 1991 quintard and whitaker 1995 bories et al 2008 here we use a parallel model as it is the one most suited to liquids and glass beads used in the study 24 λ eff λ 0 5 pe λ l λ eff λ 0 1 pe λ

thermal dispersion directly in the liquid temperature equation we use previous measurements on the properties of the liquids to justify the coupling between heat transfers and flow parameters non wetting and wetting phase dynamic viscosities μ i and densities ρ i vary with temperature philippe et al 2020 also from observations on two phase flow in the 1d cell the capillary pressure is supposed to be constant with temperature but the relative permeability k r i can change depending on both the velocity and temperature philippe et al 2020 therefore the capillary diffusion coefficient d c should also vary with temperature in the two phase flow equation in addition residual saturation measurements from isothermal 2d tank experiments are used to add a temperature dependence on residual saturation 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup the mathematical model described above will be used to reproduce the extraction experiments presented in philippe et al 2021 fig 1a shows the experimental setup a 2d tank with a porous media container and two cavities on both sides of the tank to regulate the level of the liquid these cavities are connected to the porous container through a metallic grid to hold the glass beads inside the reservoir two phase flow inside homogeneous glass beads is performed in the 2d tank height 30 cm length 50 cm width 7 cm first the non wetting phase is injected inside the medium s r w 0 using a pump then the wetting phase is also injected but only in the top part of the tank the initial interface between both phases is 15 cm from the tank bottom a double jacket in the rear part and double glazing in the front create the isothermal conditions as regulated temperature water circulates in addition a heater whose temperature is controlled by pid proportional integral derivative is added on the left of the tank to pre heat the tank and generate non isothermal conditions the heating element reproduces more realistic conditions closer to the field case non isothermal pumping this element is helical 30 cm long 6 5 cm in diameter the objective is to heat the porous medium uniformly along the x axis the experiments consist of i heating step heated water circulates through the double jacket and double glazing to keep the temperature steady during isothermal experiments in non isothermal conditions the temperature of the heating element was set to 60 c with the pid controller in this case the tank was heated until a steady state was reached ii extraction step a peristaltic pump was used at the bottom of the tank to generate a cone of depression such as in real dnapl pumping conditions temperature and saturations were measured with thermocouples and tdr sensors fig 1b experiments were made for oil ethanol at 20 c and 32 c at 100 ml min 1 and under non isothermal conditions by setting the heater temperature to 60 c at 100 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 for coal tar experiments were done at 20 c and under non isothermal conditions at 100 ml min 1 more details about the experimental setup and procedure are given in philippe et al 2021 3 2 numerical modeling this section presents the numerical modeling of the experiments presented in philippe et al 2021 which were performed with consideration of the numerical simulation e g by carefully selecting boundary conditions that can be reproduced numerically the numerical model was developed with the finite element software comsol multiphysics which has been used many times for fluid flow and heat transport in soil aliyu and chen 2017 cui et al 2020 davarzani et al 2022 gudala and govindarajan 2021 maire et al 2019 song et al 2018 specifically the subsurface and heat transfer modules were used to solve the equations presented above canola oil and ethanol s thermophysical properties philippe et al 2020 listed in table 1 were entered in tabular form in comsol and subsequently used in the model via piecewise cubic interpolation we used second order elements for the pressure and linear elements for the wetting phase saturation and temperature the mesh consisted of 10 749 triangular elements between 3 mm and 5 mm these elements were used for their ease in generating an unstructured mesh which is needed to conveniently increase the density of mesh elements around the extraction well where the largest velocity gradients are expected finally we used the backward differentiation formula bdf time stepping method in the time dependent solver where the time steps were freely chosen in the time stepping method i e free time step 3 2 1 heating step eqs 1 to 20 are used to describe heat transfers and flow during the heating step generally heat transfer can occur by conduction forced convection e g as a result of an external pumping force and natural convection e g as a result of a fluid s density changing when heated the heating step is characterized by the fact that forced convection is ignored however because of the combination of gravity effects and lateral heating of the tank natural convection may not be negligible during heating philippe et al 2021 observed that the wetting non wetting interface is immobile therefore the flow in the heating step tank can be modeled as two single phase darcy s laws taking into account the natural convention the two cavities are also considered in the geometry of the model because of possible natural convection this can impact the mass flow and heat transfer in the porous medium inside the 2d tank the geometry of the 2d tank with corresponding two phase flow and heat transfer boundary conditions and initial values is shown in fig 2 boundaries 1 in the oil saturated zone and 3 in the ethanol saturated zone are considered as no flux boundaries 5 2d tank top and 6 the extraction access point 3 125 cm 2 and 7 2 tank bottom are represented by heat loss flux q w m 2 q h t t ext where t ext external temperature is measured by a thermocouple which is situated outside the 2d tank and the heat transfer coefficient h 200 w m 2 k 1 and 50 w m 2 k 1 for boundaries 5 and 2 6 and 7 respectively these values of convective heat transfer h are determined from experimental data fitting the temperature at boundaries 4 and 8 right side of the 2d tank is imposed to be t ext this cavity is far from the heating source and is filled with liquids zones i and ii from x 0 to x 6 5 cm correspond to the heater zone iii is filled with ethanol and glass beads and zone iv is filled with oil and glass beads the temperature in zones i and ii are imposed as equal to measurements from sensors number 11 and 31 these two sensors are close to the heating element respectively the initial temperature inside the tank was 20 c the duration of the heating step was set to be the same as for the experiments in philippe et al 2021 for the non isothermal cases 26 h the terminal temperature field of the simulation from the heating step was used as the initial condition for the extraction step in comsol the last time step temperature field from the heating step is saved and imported into the extraction step model finally the comparison between the experiment and simulation regarding the heating step is done by comparing the temperature at the thermocouples obtained by the simulation with the same data obtained in philippe et al 2021 3 2 2 extraction step eqs 9 to 14 were used to represent the isothermal conditions experiments whereas eqs 9 to 20 were used in non isothermal conditions in contrast to the heating step two phase flow in porous media was considered to simulate the extraction step the liquids properties capillary diffusion coefficient and relative permeabilities were taken from philippe et al 2020 as mentioned before viscous fingering which is the formation of a finger like instability of the interface between the two fluids may appear if the velocity is sufficiently high e g high pumping flow rate and should be taken into account when defining the relative permeability philippe et al 2020 the onset of such unstable displacements can be estimated using the critical velocity uc m s 1 defined as glass and nicholl 1996 26 u c ρ w ρ nw gk ε μ w μ nw normally this condition is used in 1d downward or upward flow depending on the sign of u uc we can predict whether gravity or viscous fingering might appear in practice we calculate the value of the critical velocity i e the velocity magnitude that should not be exceeded to obtain a stable displacement by considering temperature variations for the wetting phase and non wetting phase properties first the model is run supposing that no viscous fingering occurs to obtain the initial velocity field u then we estimate the value of u uc inside the oil zone if this value is 1 a new subdomain is added to the geometry representing the zone susceptible to viscous fingering during extraction in this new subdomain relative permeabilities and indirectly the capillary diffusion coefficient are corrected to consider the unsteady effect measured in the 1d cell experiment as shown in philippe et al 2020 see e g fig 9b the initial conditions depend on the part of the simulation domain zone iii represents the wetting phase initially s ew 1 with pressure p w 0 while zone iv is occupied by the non wetting phase s ew 0 at pressure p nw 0 regarding the boundary conditions boundaries 1 2 3 7 8 and 4 are represented as walls no mass flux the pressure and saturation are prescribed on boundary 5 as equal to a reference pressure e g 0 pa and s ew 1 27 p w 0 ρ w g 0 3 z p nw 0 p w 0 ρ nw g 0 15 z boundary 6 represents the extraction point in a real field case the saturation around the extraction point depends on the extraction rate wettability and phase mobilities when pumping a dnapl there is a characteristic time called breakthrough from when only the wetting phase is produced dnapl is extracted initially and then it is gradually replaced by water because of the difference in mobility between the two phases in the case of viscous fingering this time may be shortened and in practical applications almost only water is extracted in the model we imposed the velocity at the extraction point based on the total rate q t which is known from experimental mass measurements the boundary condition regarding the saturation was obtained by relating the transient extraction rate q t imposed on the extraction boundary condition to the volumetric fractional flows the saturation values s w and s nw of the extracted phases depend exclusively on the volumetric fractional flow f w around the well given the small diameter of the well horgue et al 2015 peaceman 2000 28 q t f w f nw q t 29 f w k r w μ w t k r w μ w t k r nw μ nw t f nw 1 f w the mass measurements during extraction experiments gave a precise one measurement every six seconds extraction mass flow rate curve philippe et al 2021 these experimental curves were used to calculate the total saturation fields inside the 2d tank and compare them with the ones obtained from the simulation under non isothermal conditions the heating element was added to the model geometry 6 5 cm and an outlet was added to heat transferboundary 6 other boundary conditions were the same as during the heating step if we used the two equation model eqs 15 and 16 for heat transfer the temperature was imposed for both t l and t s however as mentioned the initial temperature field for the extraction step was taken from the last time step of the heating step finally the extraction step was validated against the experiments of philippe et al 2021 in two ways i qualitatively by comparing the simulated saturation field with the photos from philippe et al 2021 and ii quantitatively by measuring the relative error between the experimental and simulated saturation values near the pumping point in summary we implemented a comprehensive numerical model to reproduce both steps of the non isothermal extraction experiments in philippe et al 2021 i e the heating and extraction steps it was then straightforward to adapt the model to simulate isothermal extraction the main feature of the model for the heating and extraction steps is that the buoyancy force is taken into account and both static and dynamic conditions are used to define the spatially distributed capillary diffusion coefficient respectively 4 results discussion the numerical model was used to reproduce isothermal 4 1 and non isothermal 4 2 oil extractions such as the experiments of philippe et al 2021 previously the proper implementation of the two phase flow model was evaluated see appendix a by reproducing simpler experiments performed in the same 2d tank cochennec et al 2022 4 1 extraction under isothermal conditions in philippe et al 2020 two sets of relative permeability curves were obtained depending on whether the imbibition inside the cell was made in quasi static or dynamic e g unsteady conditions for the numerical model with coupled flow and heat transport we first present the influence of the relative permeability relationship quasi static or dynamic on the model results compared to the experiments fig 3b and fig 3c show the simulated saturation fields during extraction with the capillary diffusion coefficient calculated in quasi static and dynamic conditions respectively the experimental saturation field for isothermal oil ethanol extraction obtained by imaging philippe et al 2021 with a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 at t 3 min is plotted in fig 3a the cone of depression i e the oil ethanol interface generated by the dnapl extraction and the presence of ganglia i e non wetting blobs that spanned over several pores payatakes 1982 are visible after the image analysis fig 3a the higher fluid velocity around the central area of the cone of depression and the low viscosity ratio between ethanol and oil are the main reason for the formation of the viscous fingerings in the zone in both cases the simulated field does not reproduce the experimental results the quasi static case fig 3b reproduces the sides of the tank well where no viscous fingers are observed during the experiment however viscous fingers are observed in the center part of the tank where the velocity is the greatest the simulation using quasi static conditions does not reproduce these viscous fingerings in the dynamic case fig 3c the finger s length in the center of the tank was considered and represented on average as a capillary diffusion zone however the capillary effects were the same everywhere at the oil ethanol interface e g the same in the middle and on the sides of the tank which is not the case in the experiments the above simulations do not exactly represent the experiments because they do not consider the fact that dynamic effects e g unsteady conditions are partially present in the 2d tank experiment e g in the center zone of the 2d tank it is therefore necessary to use different capillary diffusion coefficients related to the significance of the fingering observed in experiments the norm of the velocity vector field to the critical velocity u uc in the beginning of the extraction e g t 1 s is shown in fig 4 for isothermal cases at 100 ml min 1 20 c and 32 c in this figure only the first 15 cm from the tank bottom which is filled initially by oil is shown the dark red color indicates that the flow velocity is greater than the critical velocity the ratio is high in the vicinity of the well outlet boundary condition and the center of the tank hence viscous fingers may appear in this subdomain during extraction also it is interesting to note that the temperature increase reduces the radius where viscous fingers may appear from 14 cm at 20 c to 10 cm at 32 c thus the model takes into account the fact that viscous fingering is reduced at higher temperatures as shown in fig 4 the central subdomain velocity ratios u uc were different from those in the side subdomains the side subdomains were relatively distant from the extraction point so the fluid velocity was below the critical velocity this is why the oil ethanol interface stayed sharp during the extraction experiment in these zones thus we used relative permeability data from quasi static experiments in the central subdomain where the fluid velocity is higher we used relative permeability data determined from dynamic experiments in 1d cell philippe et al 2020 the saturation fields obtained for extraction under isothermal conditions using this approach are shown in fig 5 at 20 c and fig 6 at 32 c for experimental philippe et al 2021 and simulation results this study the model was run from t 0 to t 15 min corresponding to the end of the extraction experiment globally the description of the oil ethanol interface sw 0 is well reproduced by the model at t 3 min we observe that the center part where viscous fingers start to form is described on average by the model by adding the dynamic effect into the central subdomain we could better describe this apparent break in the oil ethanol interface then we observed that at t 6 min ethanol collects both in the experiment and in the model nevertheless the model does not seem to reproduce the saturation after t 6 min well because it needs a more complex and suitable extraction condition representing the change in wettability at the extraction point in addition the saturation in the center subdomain decreases with time from t 6 min because of the remobilization of the trapped oil ganglia in this zone it may be appealing to use dupuit s analysis to explain the parabolic shape of the interface however several important assumptions behind the dupuit hypothesis are not fulfilled e g the visible fingering pattern at t 6 min implies that the vertical component of the velocity is not negligible contrary to what the dupuit hypothesis requires kavanaugh and kresic 2008 this difference translates into a clear break in the slope of the interface near the unstable zone as fig 6 shows we observed fewer viscous fingers in the experiment at 32 c than the one at 20 c therefore the generalized darcy s law describes the cone of depression better at 32 c than at 20 c the oil saturation profile was also plotted on tdr in measurement point number 33 close to the extraction point see fig 1 which captures the saturation change as the cone of depression forms see fig 7 effective oil saturation from the simulation was converted to oil saturation by using residual oil saturation coming from experimental data using eq 5 we found good agreement between simulation results and experimental data for the first part of the curves see fig 7 before 5 min this shows that including dynamic effects in the capillary diffusion coefficient through the experimental determination of capillary pressure saturation curves may improve the degree of correlation with experimental findings however future work should seek to more accurately represent the second part of the saturation curve describing slow desaturation after the ethanol front passes this portion of the curve exclusively describes the remobilization of discontinuous oil ganglia by ethanol flow towards the extraction well these ganglia are generated during extraction from the various viscous ethanol fingers indeed when oil was pumped the viscous ethanol fingers bypass part of the oil and result in oil discontinuous ganglia afterward bouquet et al 2020 from experimental saturation curves philippe et al 2021 it seems that from a certain saturation threshold 0 75 at 20 c and 0 55 at 32 c ethanol was recovered from the tank within the remobilized oil ganglia ultimately a higher temperature reduced the viscosity ratio between oil and ethanol consequently fewer viscous fingers and trapped oil arise during extraction in conclusion the use of generalized darcy s law is more reasonable at high temperatures with high viscosity ratio and negligible fingering effects the remobilization effect is even more important for the coal tar water pair of fluids see fig c 3 taking this remobilization effect into account is a challenge and is of great importance to accurately model dnapl water flow to summarize pre heating the tank before extraction increases the recovered oil volume by i reducing the domain size where viscous fingering may occur because the velocity is higher than the critical velocity ii reducing the length of viscous fingers represented here by a diffusion zone which delays the breakthrough of ethanol at the outlet and iii reducing the measured residual saturation after ethanol replaces the oil imbibition and increasing the oil volume produced there is presently no theoretical background to justify the modeling of viscous fingering through the capillary diffusion coefficient especially when it happens in convection dominant zones due to the proximity of the extraction point however with this addition we can capture the domain where viscous fingers occur and better represent the saturation during extraction processes it is generally not possible to model individual viscous fingers using darcy s multiphase law without a very refined mesh which substantially increases the simulation time and calculation cost issues due to the assumptions of darcy s multiphase law remain unsolved for applying the model to other extraction cases the residual saturation needs to be determined before with experiments or from a literature review in our case residual saturation data was taken from 2d tank experiments philippe et al 2021 we also represented the fingers as an average saturation rather than describing them individually still the two phase flow was described correctly and may be coupled with heat transfer equations to represent pumping experiments in non isothermal conditions 4 2 non isothermal conditions experiments the non isothermal experiments involve two steps first the left side of the domain is heated to create a temperature gradient heating step there is no flow except due to the free convection cells inside the domain second extraction is performed in the same way as in the isothermal experiments extraction steps the heating step is presented independently in the following as it helps to validate the heat transport model 4 2 1 heating step the temperature field inside the 2d tank after 26 h of heating is shown in fig 8 for experiments and numerical simulation the temperature measurements obtained from pumping experiments philippe et al 2021 were interpolated with surfer software using the inverse distance weighting method modified shepard s method franke and nielson 1980 renka 1988 shepard 1968 in the interpolation we also took into account that the temperature at the top of the tank was equal to text additional points were also added to the boundaries of the tank and the temperatures at these points were set at the same temperature as the closest thermocouple globally the model captured the shape of the temperature field well but the values were slightly different the width of the tank e g possible small 3d effect the complex geometry flow conditions between the left side channel free porous medium interface flow and the heater installed in a porous medium were not taken into account in the simulation this might affect the correlation between experimental and numerical data free convection was more influential in the ethanol glass bead zone than in the oil glass bead zone apparently due to ethanol s lower dynamic viscosity density variations with temperature were also sizable but were of the same order of magnitude in two zones a decrease of about 25 kg m 3 for ethanol against 20 kg m 3 for canola oil when the temperature is increased by 40 c see philippe et al 2020 we found that free convection is not negligible during the heating step due to the medium s vertical heating in an application case study depending on the estimated groundwater flow velocity similar effects may be observed the comparisons between simulated and experimental results for coal tar water liquid pairs are presented in appendix a for this real fluid pair case the thermal conductivity of water was higher than coal tar consequently the temperature in the water zone was lower than in the coal tar zone compared to oil the heat was also transported further into the tank see fig c 1 it is important to note that the experimental data consists of 14 interpolated sensor measurements temperature values measured with three thermocouples and simulated were also compared a quite good agreement was observed between experimental and simulated temperature profiles see appendix b 4 2 2 extraction step at the end of the heating step the resulting temperature field was used as the initial temperature field to model non isothermal pumping at 20 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 as in the isothermal conditions first u uc fields were plotted to distinguish areas where viscous instabilities are likely to occur fig 9 the pumping performed at a low flow rate 20 ml min 1 only had a small region where the flow velocity can reach the critical velocity this agrees with the project of realizing this experiment to avoid viscous fingering and observe non isothermal flow without the presence of viscous fingers however at a higher flow rate 100 ml min 1 the velocity ratio was asymmetrical and higher on the right than on the left of the tank this is likely because the temperature is higher on the left which consequently reduces the dynamic viscosity ultimately uc was effectively higher when the temperature rises and more fingering was expected in the right of the tank than the left quantitatively the distance at which viscous fingers may appear was 10 cm in the left hand portion and 15 cm in the right hand portion fig 10 shows how oil saturation varied at tdr sensor 33 during pumping under non isothermal conditions at a low flow rate the modeled front was sharper than the experimental front near the pumping well at 100 ml min 1 the same flow rate as isothermal experiments we again observed good agreement between modeled and experimental oil saturation curves until the breakthrough point specifically the mean relative error of the model was 9 2 and 11 2 for flow rates of 20 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 respectively before the breakthrough point the relative error was larger after this point for the high flow rate as the mean relative error between model and experiment was 8 5 and 16 0 when considering the pumping process after breakthrough for flow rates of 20 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 respectively these results highlight that pumping viscous oil at low flow rates generates less fingering and was therefore well described by the generalized darcy s law fig 11 compares experimental and modeled saturation fields at 100 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 in adding the capillary parameters measured in dynamic conditions we could reproduce the slight asymmetrical interface observed at t 3 min for q 100 ml min 1 at q 20 ml min 1 no viscous fingering was observed during the pumping the saturation field as well as the cone of depression are described quite well by the model in this case the flow rate was not sufficient to generate viscous instabilities and the effect of temperature on the cone of depression was not reproduced to summarize without parameters measured in dynamic conditions no effect of temperature gradient would be observed in both experiments we observed slightly more oil ganglia in the right than the left of the tank and the model also reproduces this effect with the temperature dependence of residual saturation finally comparing results at both flow rates we found that generalized darcy s law was more precise for solving non isothermal dnapl pumping cases at low flow rates corresponding to small capillary numbers where viscous fingering is negligible this model was also used to simulate coal tar pumping at 20 c in non isothermal conditions at the same flow rate 100 ml min 1 saturations fields are compared in fig c 2 in the appendix section the main point is that the coal tar water critical velocity 5 5 10 5 m s 1 was higher than the oil ethanol critical velocity 2 10 5 m s 1 at 20 c therefore the viscous fingering zone was smaller for coal tar in both cases compared to canola oil moreover thanks to the good performance of heating in the non isothermal case for coal tar water compared to oil ethanol the water and coal tar viscosity ratio was reduced fig 12 shows the temperature fields inside the tank at 100 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 the comparison between modeled and measured temperatures was made with the assumption that lte was not valid we assumed that our thermocouples measured an average temperature 1 ε t s εt l in any case during pumping simulation the heat flux was redirected towards the well due to forced convection effects this effect was more visible in the temperature fields modeled at a high flow rate this heat transfer by convection was more visible in model results than in experimental data at 20 ml min 1 the temperature field looked more uniform than at 100 ml min 1 and was advancing slowly towards the pumping point due to less convective effects 5 porous media with permeability fluctuations here after considering a dynamic capillary diffusion coefficient in the oil zone we extend this analysis by considering permeability fluctuations in the same area to qualitatively reproduce the fingering ad hoc random permeability fluctuations might be used to simulate the high residual saturation the ganglia coalescence of the non wetting phase or fingering during pumping and non wetting phase drainage the significant effects of heterogeneity over different scales on the spreading of napl in the porous medium have been studied both experimentally and numerically by many researchers e g ataie ashtiani et al 2001 ataie ashtiani et al 2002 berg et al 2021 das et al 2004 das et al 2006 horgue et al 2015 random fluctuations in the permeability field have been used to onset instabilities in numerical work bouquet et al 2020 li and rivière 2016 sorbie et al 1994 we followed this path and added white gaussian noise to the constant permeability using comsol multiphysics software s built in functions the model equations initial and boundary conditions were similar to the original model presented before with the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 fig 13 shows the fluctuation patterns which only concern the oil zone where we saw that the fingering effect was significant numerical simulations were performed for pumping under isothermal conditions at 20 c as shown in fig 5 or following a pseudo non isothermal pumping i e dynamic viscosities increased linearly from the left to the right side of the tank and the corresponding viscosity ratio μ o μ e increased from 30 to 60 respectively saturation fields based on numerical simulations for heterogeneous media at 4 and 6 min after the beginning of pumping are shown in fig 14a for the isothermal case fingering and ganglia coalescence of non wetting phase behavior can be seen clearly in this situation fig 14b shows the saturation fields at 4 and 6 min after pumping for the pseudo non isothermal case besides the pattern obtained for the isothermal case we also observe the dissymmetry of the front as for the experimental results we have presented the hypothesis that small ad hoc permeability fluctuations might reproduce at least qualitatively the viscous fingering further work is required to explore the effects of several realizations of permeability fluctuations this is beyond the scope of this article additional findings on this topic are in progress and will be presented in a future article 6 conclusions we developed a numerical darcy scale model to simulate non isothermal two phase flow in highly permeable porous media the results showed that a higher temperature increased the critical velocity therefore the number of viscous fingers developed during pumping decreases when the temperature increases for oil ethanol this was linked to a change in breakthrough time as well as a decrease in residual oil saturation the mixture two phase model developed with comsol multiphysics correctly reproduces measured oil saturation in isothermal conditions until breakthrough time the coupling of the two phase flow in porous media equations with heat transfers was done by averaging fluid properties depending on the saturation temperature variation behavior is reproduced correctly using the proposed model the use of empirical relationships thermal dispersion coefficient interfacial heat transfer coefficient between solid and liquid phase and the lack of a detailed description of the fingering during pumping are issues that must be investigated to improve the quality of the fitting experiments focused on the determination of thermal dispersion and solid to liquid heat transfer coefficient specifically aimed at napl water flow are needed to improve current knowledge of non isothermal dnapl flow surprisingly for the coal tar water fluid pair viscous fingering was less important than initially thought the presence of residual non wetting ganglia being remobilized after the breakthrough of the wetting phase at the outlet was however more important for the coal tar water than the oil ethanol fluid pair future model development should consider residual non wetting phase remobilization by adding cross terms in the flow equations the values of these cross terms as well as their temperature dependence should also be explored experimentally by conducting experiments involving two simple liquids oil and ethanol we better understand phenomena happening during pumping under isothermal and non isothermal conditions however modeling thermally enhanced dnapl pumping represents a challenge that combines current problems at stake in different fields the treatment of viscous fingering breakthrough conditions remobilization of the non wetting phase by the wetting phase after breakthrough and validity of local thermal equilibrium are open subjects in the scope of this technique to address the observed issue with fingering and ganglia development in the non wetting phase during pumping generating random heterogeneities was suggested a simple heterogeneous permeability field case was simulated and a promising outcome was presented in explaining the observed issue more extensive numerical simulations for this set up and more realistic cases are in progress and will be reported in future work finally the development of non isothermal models is a must for a better representation of soil remediation processes first during heating processes it is not satisfactory to suppose that a site of a few hectares is under isothermal conditions secondly other remediation processes based on biological or chemical enhancement are also influenced by temperature variations for instance in situ chemical oxidation can generate substantial heat during reactions and a coupled model could help to find a temperature optimum credit authorship contribution statement hossein davarzani supervision conceptualization funding

institute for advanced studies appendix a two phase flow model validation first we compared the two phase flow model in porous media with experimental results from cochennec et al 2022 those authors performed a canola oil injection into 1 mm glass beads saturated with ethanol the liquid properties as well as relative permeabilities and capillary pressure saturation relationship were the same as in this study to study the impact of gravity forces on oil displacement in a highly permeable porous medium saturated with wetting fluid these authors injected canola oil from the bottom center into 1 mm glass beads saturated with ethanol which ensured stable displacement because of the similarities and fairly simple flow characteristics isothermal and stable displacement these data were well suited to validate the implementation of our model regarding two phase flow only before using the fully coupled model fig a 1 compares the simulation results obtained from the model developed in this study and experimental data from cochennec et al 2022 where the inlet velocity data was taken directly from the authors we observe that the oil pool generated after injection from the bottom has the same shape thus our two phase flow model reproduced simple two phase flow injection problems and was confronted with dnapl extraction applications fig a 1 comparison between experimental and model results a b experimental results from cochennec et al 2022 canola oil was injected from the bottom center into 1 mm glass beads saturated by ethanol the dark and light gray areas correspond to the

between model and experiment fig b 1 plots the temperature changes with time during heating for the thermocouples installed in the 2d tank center t13 ethanol saturated zone t23 ethanol oil interface and t33 oil saturated zone we observe quite good agreement between experimental and simulated profiles except for thermocouple 13 the relative error between experiment and simulation up to 17 h of heating was 6 5 3 9 and 3 0 for thermocouples 13 23 and 33 respectively the temperature profiles increased initially then decreased slightly after 17 h because of external temperature text variation from this point on the error between the experiment and simulation increased to 5 9 and 5 2 for thermocouples 23 and 33 respectively these discrepancies are likely due to an inappropriate constant coefficient used to describe heat loss at the top or bottom of the tank fig b 1 comparison of the temperature profiles obtained by numerical simulation ltne for the averaged temperature of solid and liquid phases and experiment after heating the 2d tank for 26 h for thermocouple numbers 13 23 and 33 fig b 1 appendix c application to coal tar pumping since the flow properties of the ethanol oil and coal tar water liquid pairs are similar we consider that it is possible to use the same numerical model to study coal tar pumping in this model oil properties were replaced by coal tar and ethanol

element control temperature was imposed at 50 c in the coal tar zone thermal diffusivity was higher in water than in the coal tar zone consequently the temperature in the water zone was lower than in the coal tar zone because of water s higher thermal conductivity compared to oil the heat was also transported further into the tank fig c 1 comparison of the temperature fields after heating the 2d tank for 10 h for the coal tar water fluid pair a experimental data from philippe et al 2021 and b simulation results from this study fig c 1 influence of thermal enhancement on coal tar pumping experimental data in philippe et al 2021 did not yield exploitable photographs of the saturation fields this made the estimation of thermal enhancement on coal tar pumping with imaging impossible we used the model to simulate coal tar pumping at 20 c as well as in non isothermal conditions at the same flow rate 100 ml min 1 saturations fields are compared in fig c 2 the viscous fingering zone is smaller for coal tar than canola oil in both cases because the coal tar water critical velocity is higher 5 5 10 5 m s 1 than the oil ethanol critical velocity 2 10 5 m s 1 at 20 c the coal tar water critical velocity at 20 c is even higher than that measured for oil ethanol at 32 c in non isothermal conditions better pre heating of the tank also raised the temperature in the coal tar zone higher than in the case with oil thus reducing the water to coal tar viscosity ratio even more fig c 2 comparison between coal tar saturation fields during pumping under isothermal conditions 20 c and non isothermal conditions at 100 ml min 1 fig c 2 however experiments showed that coal tar residual saturation was close and even higher than that measured during oil pumping experiments fig c 3 shows how the saturation changes in the model and experiments performed in the same conditions as the model for coal tar water at the assimilated level of tdr number 33 the area where saturation decreases is even longer than for oil ethanol we suspect this part of the curve to describe the fact that water is being pumped and at the same time dispersed ganglia of the non wetting fluid are being carried away due to the shear stress caused by pumping conditions between these ganglia and the water flowing towards the well taking this remobilization effect into account is a challenge and is of great importance to accurately model dnapl water flow finally coal tar residual saturation effectively decreases from 0 40 at 20 c to 0 27 with thermal enhancement fig c 3 comparison between experimental philippe et al 2021 and numerical results of coal tar saturation fields this study at point number 33 see fig 1 during pumping under isothermal conditions 20 c and non isothermal conditions at 100 ml

1246,we developed a decimetric size model based on coupling generalized darcy s law and heat transfer equations to model viscous dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl pumping through highly permeable porous media under non isothermal conditions the presence of fingering and non wetting phase ganglia was modeled through an unsteady capillary diffusion coefficient and an arbitrary heterogeneous permeability field the model was validated using existing experimental data of a simple case an oil injection in a 2d tank packed with glass beads next we compared the results of this model against a dnapl extracting situation in the 2d tank to better understand the two phase flow behavior in highly permeable porous media we found that natural convection during heating plays an essential role in heat transfer especially in the wetting phase zone by adding the dynamic effect unsteady conditions we were better able to describe the presence of the ganglia in porous media we observed good agreement between modeled and experimental oil saturation curves until the breakthrough point with a mean relative error of about 10 for low and high flow rates and 8 and 16 after breakthrough for low and high flow rates respectively extracting viscous oil at low flow rates and high temperature generates less fingering and is well described by the generalized darcy s law the remobilization of residual non wetting ganglia after the breakthrough point at the outlet is however difficult to simulate using the generalized darcy s law in the end we treated this issue by using a perturbed permeability field to simulate the observed fingering in the 2d tank keywords dense non aqueous phase liquid two phase flow non isothermal 2d tank thermally enhanced dnapl recovery coal tar 1 introduction the modeling of coupling between two phase flow and heat transfers is of vast interest in porous media applications for instance water evaporation from soil subsurface davarzani et al

isothermal conditions class et al 2002 reviewed several software tools able to couple mass and heat transfer under local thermal equilibrium lte the aim of these numerical tools was generally to model vadose zone remediation processes such as soil vapor extraction or steam injection class et al 2002 more recently a similar comparative evaluation of non isothermal two phase numerical models was performed on the simulation of carbon dioxide storage class et al 2009 the lte class et al 2002 is valid when fluid solid temperature variations at the pore scale are negligible in comparison to the macro scale variations kaviany 1991 in practical terms it implies that flow velocities should be small in the opposing case there is local thermal non equilibrium ltne pati et al 2022 so in field applications since the length scale is large ltne is not considered however the addition of a lateral heating element and the flow conditions imposed by pumping can generate local heating perturbations near the heating element and the extraction point the study of non aqueous phase liquid napl water flow under non isothermal conditions is less common to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt reported in the literature to model dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl water pumping under non isothermal conditions in highly permeable porous media colombano et al 2021 used a two phase flow model to predict chlorinated solvent recovery rates for surfactant enhancement applications in a 2d tank but only in isothermal and stable conditions colombano et al 2021 they used a pressure pressure two phase flow formulation instead we used a mixture model formulation to solve two phase flow in porous media wang and beckermann 1993 we chose this formulation because it is known to be more versatile than the pressure pressure formulation helmig et al 1997 as we gain more knowledge about dnapl remediation we need to include more variables such as temperature to better represent the processes at stake hu et al 2021 koproch et al 2022 mohamed et al 2007 o carroll and sleep 2009 rathfelder et al 1995 sleep and ma 1997 this study examined how non isothermal conditions can be implemented in a two phase flow in porous media model at darcy scale between 10 3 m and 10 m a highly viscous dnapl coal tar was also studied here and may have increased the complexity of the comparison between experiments and modeling in recovery applications the fluids are set into motion due to the extraction boundary condition which can cause great differences between the porous matrix temperature ts the non wetting phase tnw and the wetting phase tw davarzani et al 2014 gandomkar and gray 2018 lu et al 2018 prasannakumara 2021 rees et al 2008 an example of a three equation model exists in bio heat applications nakayama and kuwahara 2008 in this study we still considered that temperature variations between both non wetting and wetting liquid phases were negligible at the tank scale e g decimetric scale we then defined a single temperature for both the non wetting and wetting phase called liquid temperature tl for the convenience of modeling here we simulated the experimental study done by philippe et al 2021 to better understand the governing phenomena related to the coupled two phase flow and heat transfer in porous media during dnapl pumping under non isothermal conditions they used a well instrumented decimetric 2d tank to study dnapl pumping under non isothermal conditions in 1 mm packed glass beads permeability of 3 5 10 10 m2 they observed viscous fingering under their experimental conditions for two fluid pairs ethanol canola oil and water coal tar i e an unstable finger like fluid front displacement due to an unfavorable viscosity ratio of the invading displaced fluids it is found that viscous fingering reduces with increasing temperature and pumping rate which enhances the dnapl recovery under non isothermal conditions a heating element was used to model the non isothermal conditions in 2d initially the cone of depression was slightly asymmetrical but it became symmetrical at the final pumping state they observed less viscous fingering in the warm part of the cone of depression near the heating source than in the cold part because the viscosity ratio invading displaced fluids here ethanol oil is smaller where the temperature is higher philippe et al 2021 the maximum temperature set in our work is 60 c which is below the boiling point of the liquids we used to reduce their evaporation at this temperature evaporation of ethanol was noted during 2d tank experiments at a temperature slightly higher than 60 c ethanol bubbles formed moreover keeping both wetting and non wetting phases in the liquid state is an underlying objective of thermal enhancement for coal tar pumping applications the presence of vapors in the subsurface complicates the understanding of the mass transfers occurring in the soil also in real applications the evaporation of the dnapl is undesirable during pumping processes as it may hinder dnapl transport to the wellbore 2 mathematical model our goal was to develop a two phase flow in porous media model that accounts for i the influence of heat transfers under local thermal non equilibrium conditions and ii viscous fingering here we give the governing equations for the mass and energy balance the strong coupling is done by considering a temperature dependence on dynamic viscosities and densities we neglected the compositional and crossed effects related to the multi

assumptions such as incompressible and immiscible fluids and low reynolds number i e re 1 the assumption of immiscible fluids is verified here because the solubility of the selected liquid pair is very low over the temperature range rao and arnold 1956 the last condition i e re 1 is fulfilled as shown in philippe et al 2021 for the different temperature values and fluids philippe et al 2021 the porous medium should be fully saturated by both liquids no air and it is assumed that the capillary pressure depends only on saturation muskat and meres 1936 whitaker 1986 2 s w s nw 1 3 p c s w p nw

density respectively which depend on the temperature since we know the relationship between the temperature and the density of the fluids see philippe et al 2020 we consider a single volumetric force related to gravity that takes into account the natural convection the effective saturation and the mass conservation laws can also be written for each of the two liquids according to their effective

falta et al 2005 different approaches to solving this problem exist chen et al 2006 generally classified into two types pressure pressure or pressure saturation formulations the numerical modeling of two phase flow in porous media chosen here is a mixture model wang and beckermann 1993 by writing the total velocity field as the sum of the velocity fields of each phase weighted by the effective

the parameter l has been considered equal to 0 5 which is commonly accepted in this type of porous medium chen et al 1999 mualem 1976 2 2 governing equations for heat transfers in porous media here we introduce the heat transfer equations assuming that the lte assumption is not automatically verified for a non isothermal single phase flow in porous media this assumption depends on the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases as well as a small length scale between both phases davarzani et al 2010 davarzani et al 2021 quintard and whitaker 1995 in practice the governing equations for ltne heat transfer can be written as nield and bejan 2006 quintard et al 1997 15 ε ρ c p l t l t ρ c p l u t l ε λ l eff t l h t s t l 16 1 ε ρ c p s t s t 1 ε λ s eff t s h t l t s where ε is the porosity of the porous medium ρ the density kg m 3 c p the heat capacity j kg 1 k 1 and λ i eff the effective thermal conductivity tensor w m 1 k 1 the subscripts l and s denote liquid and solid properties h is a coefficient representing the heat transfer occurring between phases at the micro scale knowing that the thermophysical contrasts e g thermal conductivity ratio between canola oil and ethanol are very small and there is no rapid evaporation condensation processes duval et al 2004 we have used the local thermal equilibrium between fluid phases e g both liquid phases can be described in terms of a single fluid average temperature t l the coefficient h can be replaced by the product of h sl solid to liquid heat transfer coefficient and a sl the specific surface area of the surface area for glass beads wakao and kagei 1982 give the expression of a sl and h sl as functions of prandtl pr reynolds numbers re and nusselt number nu a multitude of experiments with

correlation that seems more suitable for smoldering remediation zanoni et al 2017 indeed the hypothesis of darcy s law imposes respect for the condition re 1 which is not compatible with wakao s correlation more recently gossler et al 2020 reviewed different studies on the experimental determination of h sl a new correlation on the dependence of nu on re is proposed by supposing that pr 1 3 is a constant for groundwater between all studies on ltne effects on aquifer flow the consensus seems to be that ltne effects appear for large grain sizes gravel or very high velocities gossler et al 2020 almost all these studies represent 1d flow conditions while extraction involves an axisymmetrical 2d component radial flow towards the well moreover the multiphase feature of dnapl recovery is incompatible with the hypothesis that pr is a constant to conclude wakao s correlation eqs 17 18 which is supported by many previous experimental studies seems to be the most suitable for model development however these correlations are obtained from situations where only one phase is flowing in the porous medium since we deal with two phase flow here we will suppose that the non wetting and wetting phases have the same average temperature t l because they are both subject to forced convection effects the liquid properties ρc p l and λ l eff are represented as an average depending on saturation 19 ρ c p l s w ρ c p w s nw ρ c p nw 20 λ l eff s w λ w eff s nw λ nw eff the local thermal equilibrium lte e g t l is equal to t s assumption depends on the temperature difference between the solid and fluid phases as well as a small length scale between both phases davarzani et al 2010 davarzani et al 2021 quintard and whitaker 1995 in this case the previous equations can be simplified into one equation with effective properties expressed as an average weighted by porosity 21 ρ c p eff t t ρ c p l u t λ eff t 22 ρ c p eff 1 ε ρ c p s ε ρ c p l 23 λ eff λ λ d where t is the average temperature and λ eff is the effective thermal conductivity λ represents the equivalent thermal conductivity determined from the solid and liquid thermal conductivity but also the arrangement of the phases at the micro scale λ d represents the contribution of thermal dispersion to effective thermal conductivity the effective thermal conductivity can be estimated experimentally nozad et al 1985 or calculated by solving a closure problem over a representative unit cell of the porous medium davarzani et al 2010 davarzani et al 2011 quintard 1993 whitaker 1999 a strategy that is increasingly under investigation with the development of ct scanners and other devices for pore scale investigation petrasch et al 2008 rong et al 2019 dispersion longitudinal and transversal is a consequence of the heterogeneity of the flow velocity at the microscale and can be expressed as a function of the péclet number and the liquid properties alazmi and vafai 2000 davarzani et al 2010 kaviany 1991 quintard and whitaker 1995 bories et al 2008 here we use a parallel model as it is the one most suited to liquids and glass beads used in the study 24 λ eff λ 0 5 pe λ l λ eff λ 0 1 pe λ

thermal dispersion directly in the liquid temperature equation we use previous measurements on the properties of the liquids to justify the coupling between heat transfers and flow parameters non wetting and wetting phase dynamic viscosities μ i and densities ρ i vary with temperature philippe et al 2020 also from observations on two phase flow in the 1d cell the capillary pressure is supposed to be constant with temperature but the relative permeability k r i can change depending on both the velocity and temperature philippe et al 2020 therefore the capillary diffusion coefficient d c should also vary with temperature in the two phase flow equation in addition residual saturation measurements from isothermal 2d tank experiments are used to add a temperature dependence on residual saturation 3 materials and methods 3 1 experimental setup the mathematical model described above will be used to reproduce the extraction experiments presented in philippe et al 2021 fig 1a shows the experimental setup a 2d tank with a porous media container and two cavities on both sides of the tank to regulate the level of the liquid these cavities are connected to the porous container through a metallic grid to hold the glass beads inside the reservoir two phase flow inside homogeneous glass beads is performed in the 2d tank height 30 cm length 50 cm width 7 cm first the non wetting phase is injected inside the medium s r w 0 using a pump then the wetting phase is also injected but only in the top part of the tank the initial interface between both phases is 15 cm from the tank bottom a double jacket in the rear part and double glazing in the front create the isothermal conditions as regulated temperature water circulates in addition a heater whose temperature is controlled by pid proportional integral derivative is added on the left of the tank to pre heat the tank and generate non isothermal conditions the heating element reproduces more realistic conditions closer to the field case non isothermal pumping this element is helical 30 cm long 6 5 cm in diameter the objective is to heat the porous medium uniformly along the x axis the experiments consist of i heating step heated water circulates through the double jacket and double glazing to keep the temperature steady during isothermal experiments in non isothermal conditions the temperature of the heating element was set to 60 c with the pid controller in this case the tank was heated until a steady state was reached ii extraction step a peristaltic pump was used at the bottom of the tank to generate a cone of depression such as in real dnapl pumping conditions temperature and saturations were measured with thermocouples and tdr sensors fig 1b experiments were made for oil ethanol at 20 c and 32 c at 100 ml min 1 and under non isothermal conditions by setting the heater temperature to 60 c at 100 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 for coal tar experiments were done at 20 c and under non isothermal conditions at 100 ml min 1 more details about the experimental setup and procedure are given in philippe et al 2021 3 2 numerical modeling this section presents the numerical modeling of the experiments presented in philippe et al 2021 which were performed with consideration of the numerical simulation e g by carefully selecting boundary conditions that can be reproduced numerically the numerical model was developed with the finite element software comsol multiphysics which has been used many times for fluid flow and heat transport in soil aliyu and chen 2017 cui et al 2020 davarzani et al 2022 gudala and govindarajan 2021 maire et al 2019 song et al 2018 specifically the subsurface and heat transfer modules were used to solve the equations presented above canola oil and ethanol s thermophysical properties philippe et al 2020 listed in table 1 were entered in tabular form in comsol and subsequently used in the model via piecewise cubic interpolation we used second order elements for the pressure and linear elements for the wetting phase saturation and temperature the mesh consisted of 10 749 triangular elements between 3 mm and 5 mm these elements were used for their ease in generating an unstructured mesh which is needed to conveniently increase the density of mesh elements around the extraction well where the largest velocity gradients are expected finally we used the backward differentiation formula bdf time stepping method in the time dependent solver where the time steps were freely chosen in the time stepping method i e free time step 3 2 1 heating step eqs 1 to 20 are used to describe heat transfers and flow during the heating step generally heat transfer can occur by conduction forced convection e g as a result of an external pumping force and natural convection e g as a result of a fluid s density changing when heated the heating step is characterized by the fact that forced convection is ignored however because of the combination of gravity effects and lateral heating of the tank natural convection may not be negligible during heating philippe et al 2021 observed that the wetting non wetting interface is immobile therefore the flow in the heating step tank can be modeled as two single phase darcy s laws taking into account the natural convention the two cavities are also considered in the geometry of the model because of possible natural convection this can impact the mass flow and heat transfer in the porous medium inside the 2d tank the geometry of the 2d tank with corresponding two phase flow and heat transfer boundary conditions and initial values is shown in fig 2 boundaries 1 in the oil saturated zone and 3 in the ethanol saturated zone are considered as no flux boundaries 5 2d tank top and 6 the extraction access point 3 125 cm 2 and 7 2 tank bottom are represented by heat loss flux q w m 2 q h t t ext where t ext external temperature is measured by a thermocouple which is situated outside the 2d tank and the heat transfer coefficient h 200 w m 2 k 1 and 50 w m 2 k 1 for boundaries 5 and 2 6 and 7 respectively these values of convective heat transfer h are determined from experimental data fitting the temperature at boundaries 4 and 8 right side of the 2d tank is imposed to be t ext this cavity is far from the heating source and is filled with liquids zones i and ii from x 0 to x 6 5 cm correspond to the heater zone iii is filled with ethanol and glass beads and zone iv is filled with oil and glass beads the temperature in zones i and ii are imposed as equal to measurements from sensors number 11 and 31 these two sensors are close to the heating element respectively the initial temperature inside the tank was 20 c the duration of the heating step was set to be the same as for the experiments in philippe et al 2021 for the non isothermal cases 26 h the terminal temperature field of the simulation from the heating step was used as the initial condition for the extraction step in comsol the last time step temperature field from the heating step is saved and imported into the extraction step model finally the comparison between the experiment and simulation regarding the heating step is done by comparing the temperature at the thermocouples obtained by the simulation with the same data obtained in philippe et al 2021 3 2 2 extraction step eqs 9 to 14 were used to represent the isothermal conditions experiments whereas eqs 9 to 20 were used in non isothermal conditions in contrast to the heating step two phase flow in porous media was considered to simulate the extraction step the liquids properties capillary diffusion coefficient and relative permeabilities were taken from philippe et al 2020 as mentioned before viscous fingering which is the formation of a finger like instability of the interface between the two fluids may appear if the velocity is sufficiently high e g high pumping flow rate and should be taken into account when defining the relative permeability philippe et al 2020 the onset of such unstable displacements can be estimated using the critical velocity uc m s 1 defined as glass and nicholl 1996 26 u c ρ w ρ nw gk ε μ w μ nw normally this condition is used in 1d downward or upward flow depending on the sign of u uc we can predict whether gravity or viscous fingering might appear in practice we calculate the value of the critical velocity i e the velocity magnitude that should not be exceeded to obtain a stable displacement by considering temperature variations for the wetting phase and non wetting phase properties first the model is run supposing that no viscous fingering occurs to obtain the initial velocity field u then we estimate the value of u uc inside the oil zone if this value is 1 a new subdomain is added to the geometry representing the zone susceptible to viscous fingering during extraction in this new subdomain relative permeabilities and indirectly the capillary diffusion coefficient are corrected to consider the unsteady effect measured in the 1d cell experiment as shown in philippe et al 2020 see e g fig 9b the initial conditions depend on the part of the simulation domain zone iii represents the wetting phase initially s ew 1 with pressure p w 0 while zone iv is occupied by the non wetting phase s ew 0 at pressure p nw 0 regarding the boundary conditions boundaries 1 2 3 7 8 and 4 are represented as walls no mass flux the pressure and saturation are prescribed on boundary 5 as equal to a reference pressure e g 0 pa and s ew 1 27 p w 0 ρ w g 0 3 z p nw 0 p w 0 ρ nw g 0 15 z boundary 6 represents the extraction point in a real field case the saturation around the extraction point depends on the extraction rate wettability and phase mobilities when pumping a dnapl there is a characteristic time called breakthrough from when only the wetting phase is produced dnapl is extracted initially and then it is gradually replaced by water because of the difference in mobility between the two phases in the case of viscous fingering this time may be shortened and in practical applications almost only water is extracted in the model we imposed the velocity at the extraction point based on the total rate q t which is known from experimental mass measurements the boundary condition regarding the saturation was obtained by relating the transient extraction rate q t imposed on the extraction boundary condition to the volumetric fractional flows the saturation values s w and s nw of the extracted phases depend exclusively on the volumetric fractional flow f w around the well given the small diameter of the well horgue et al 2015 peaceman 2000 28 q t f w f nw q t 29 f w k r w μ w t k r w μ w t k r nw μ nw t f nw 1 f w the mass measurements during extraction experiments gave a precise one measurement every six seconds extraction mass flow rate curve philippe et al 2021 these experimental curves were used to calculate the total saturation fields inside the 2d tank and compare them with the ones obtained from the simulation under non isothermal conditions the heating element was added to the model geometry 6 5 cm and an outlet was added to heat transferboundary 6 other boundary conditions were the same as during the heating step if we used the two equation model eqs 15 and 16 for heat transfer the temperature was imposed for both t l and t s however as mentioned the initial temperature field for the extraction step was taken from the last time step of the heating step finally the extraction step was validated against the experiments of philippe et al 2021 in two ways i qualitatively by comparing the simulated saturation field with the photos from philippe et al 2021 and ii quantitatively by measuring the relative error between the experimental and simulated saturation values near the pumping point in summary we implemented a comprehensive numerical model to reproduce both steps of the non isothermal extraction experiments in philippe et al 2021 i e the heating and extraction steps it was then straightforward to adapt the model to simulate isothermal extraction the main feature of the model for the heating and extraction steps is that the buoyancy force is taken into account and both static and dynamic conditions are used to define the spatially distributed capillary diffusion coefficient respectively 4 results discussion the numerical model was used to reproduce isothermal 4 1 and non isothermal 4 2 oil extractions such as the experiments of philippe et al 2021 previously the proper implementation of the two phase flow model was evaluated see appendix a by reproducing simpler experiments performed in the same 2d tank cochennec et al 2022 4 1 extraction under isothermal conditions in philippe et al 2020 two sets of relative permeability curves were obtained depending on whether the imbibition inside the cell was made in quasi static or dynamic e g unsteady conditions for the numerical model with coupled flow and heat transport we first present the influence of the relative permeability relationship quasi static or dynamic on the model results compared to the experiments fig 3b and fig 3c show the simulated saturation fields during extraction with the capillary diffusion coefficient calculated in quasi static and dynamic conditions respectively the experimental saturation field for isothermal oil ethanol extraction obtained by imaging philippe et al 2021 with a flow rate of 100 ml min 1 at t 3 min is plotted in fig 3a the cone of depression i e the oil ethanol interface generated by the dnapl extraction and the presence of ganglia i e non wetting blobs that spanned over several pores payatakes 1982 are visible after the image analysis fig 3a the higher fluid velocity around the central area of the cone of depression and the low viscosity ratio between ethanol and oil are the main reason for the formation of the viscous fingerings in the zone in both cases the simulated field does not reproduce the experimental results the quasi static case fig 3b reproduces the sides of the tank well where no viscous fingers are observed during the experiment however viscous fingers are observed in the center part of the tank where the velocity is the greatest the simulation using quasi static conditions does not reproduce these viscous fingerings in the dynamic case fig 3c the finger s length in the center of the tank was considered and represented on average as a capillary diffusion zone however the capillary effects were the same everywhere at the oil ethanol interface e g the same in the middle and on the sides of the tank which is not the case in the experiments the above simulations do not exactly represent the experiments because they do not consider the fact that dynamic effects e g unsteady conditions are partially present in the 2d tank experiment e g in the center zone of the 2d tank it is therefore necessary to use different capillary diffusion coefficients related to the significance of the fingering observed in experiments the norm of the velocity vector field to the critical velocity u uc in the beginning of the extraction e g t 1 s is shown in fig 4 for isothermal cases at 100 ml min 1 20 c and 32 c in this figure only the first 15 cm from the tank bottom which is filled initially by oil is shown the dark red color indicates that the flow velocity is greater than the critical velocity the ratio is high in the vicinity of the well outlet boundary condition and the center of the tank hence viscous fingers may appear in this subdomain during extraction also it is interesting to note that the temperature increase reduces the radius where viscous fingers may appear from 14 cm at 20 c to 10 cm at 32 c thus the model takes into account the fact that viscous fingering is reduced at higher temperatures as shown in fig 4 the central subdomain velocity ratios u uc were different from those in the side subdomains the side subdomains were relatively distant from the extraction point so the fluid velocity was below the critical velocity this is why the oil ethanol interface stayed sharp during the extraction experiment in these zones thus we used relative permeability data from quasi static experiments in the central subdomain where the fluid velocity is higher we used relative permeability data determined from dynamic experiments in 1d cell philippe et al 2020 the saturation fields obtained for extraction under isothermal conditions using this approach are shown in fig 5 at 20 c and fig 6 at 32 c for experimental philippe et al 2021 and simulation results this study the model was run from t 0 to t 15 min corresponding to the end of the extraction experiment globally the description of the oil ethanol interface sw 0 is well reproduced by the model at t 3 min we observe that the center part where viscous fingers start to form is described on average by the model by adding the dynamic effect into the central subdomain we could better describe this apparent break in the oil ethanol interface then we observed that at t 6 min ethanol collects both in the experiment and in the model nevertheless the model does not seem to reproduce the saturation after t 6 min well because it needs a more complex and suitable extraction condition representing the change in wettability at the extraction point in addition the saturation in the center subdomain decreases with time from t 6 min because of the remobilization of the trapped oil ganglia in this zone it may be appealing to use dupuit s analysis to explain the parabolic shape of the interface however several important assumptions behind the dupuit hypothesis are not fulfilled e g the visible fingering pattern at t 6 min implies that the vertical component of the velocity is not negligible contrary to what the dupuit hypothesis requires kavanaugh and kresic 2008 this difference translates into a clear break in the slope of the interface near the unstable zone as fig 6 shows we observed fewer viscous fingers in the experiment at 32 c than the one at 20 c therefore the generalized darcy s law describes the cone of depression better at 32 c than at 20 c the oil saturation profile was also plotted on tdr in measurement point number 33 close to the extraction point see fig 1 which captures the saturation change as the cone of depression forms see fig 7 effective oil saturation from the simulation was converted to oil saturation by using residual oil saturation coming from experimental data using eq 5 we found good agreement between simulation results and experimental data for the first part of the curves see fig 7 before 5 min this shows that including dynamic effects in the capillary diffusion coefficient through the experimental determination of capillary pressure saturation curves may improve the degree of correlation with experimental findings however future work should seek to more accurately represent the second part of the saturation curve describing slow desaturation after the ethanol front passes this portion of the curve exclusively describes the remobilization of discontinuous oil ganglia by ethanol flow towards the extraction well these ganglia are generated during extraction from the various viscous ethanol fingers indeed when oil was pumped the viscous ethanol fingers bypass part of the oil and result in oil discontinuous ganglia afterward bouquet et al 2020 from experimental saturation curves philippe et al 2021 it seems that from a certain saturation threshold 0 75 at 20 c and 0 55 at 32 c ethanol was recovered from the tank within the remobilized oil ganglia ultimately a higher temperature reduced the viscosity ratio between oil and ethanol consequently fewer viscous fingers and trapped oil arise during extraction in conclusion the use of generalized darcy s law is more reasonable at high temperatures with high viscosity ratio and negligible fingering effects the remobilization effect is even more important for the coal tar water pair of fluids see fig c 3 taking this remobilization effect into account is a challenge and is of great importance to accurately model dnapl water flow to summarize pre heating the tank before extraction increases the recovered oil volume by i reducing the domain size where viscous fingering may occur because the velocity is higher than the critical velocity ii reducing the length of viscous fingers represented here by a diffusion zone which delays the breakthrough of ethanol at the outlet and iii reducing the measured residual saturation after ethanol replaces the oil imbibition and increasing the oil volume produced there is presently no theoretical background to justify the modeling of viscous fingering through the capillary diffusion coefficient especially when it happens in convection dominant zones due to the proximity of the extraction point however with this addition we can capture the domain where viscous fingers occur and better represent the saturation during extraction processes it is generally not possible to model individual viscous fingers using darcy s multiphase law without a very refined mesh which substantially increases the simulation time and calculation cost issues due to the assumptions of darcy s multiphase law remain unsolved for applying the model to other extraction cases the residual saturation needs to be determined before with experiments or from a literature review in our case residual saturation data was taken from 2d tank experiments philippe et al 2021 we also represented the fingers as an average saturation rather than describing them individually still the two phase flow was described correctly and may be coupled with heat transfer equations to represent pumping experiments in non isothermal conditions 4 2 non isothermal conditions experiments the non isothermal experiments involve two steps first the left side of the domain is heated to create a temperature gradient heating step there is no flow except due to the free convection cells inside the domain second extraction is performed in the same way as in the isothermal experiments extraction steps the heating step is presented independently in the following as it helps to validate the heat transport model 4 2 1 heating step the temperature field inside the 2d tank after 26 h of heating is shown in fig 8 for experiments and numerical simulation the temperature measurements obtained from pumping experiments philippe et al 2021 were interpolated with surfer software using the inverse distance weighting method modified shepard s method franke and nielson 1980 renka 1988 shepard 1968 in the interpolation we also took into account that the temperature at the top of the tank was equal to text additional points were also added to the boundaries of the tank and the temperatures at these points were set at the same temperature as the closest thermocouple globally the model captured the shape of the temperature field well but the values were slightly different the width of the tank e g possible small 3d effect the complex geometry flow conditions between the left side channel free porous medium interface flow and the heater installed in a porous medium were not taken into account in the simulation this might affect the correlation between experimental and numerical data free convection was more influential in the ethanol glass bead zone than in the oil glass bead zone apparently due to ethanol s lower dynamic viscosity density variations with temperature were also sizable but were of the same order of magnitude in two zones a decrease of about 25 kg m 3 for ethanol against 20 kg m 3 for canola oil when the temperature is increased by 40 c see philippe et al 2020 we found that free convection is not negligible during the heating step due to the medium s vertical heating in an application case study depending on the estimated groundwater flow velocity similar effects may be observed the comparisons between simulated and experimental results for coal tar water liquid pairs are presented in appendix a for this real fluid pair case the thermal conductivity of water was higher than coal tar consequently the temperature in the water zone was lower than in the coal tar zone compared to oil the heat was also transported further into the tank see fig c 1 it is important to note that the experimental data consists of 14 interpolated sensor measurements temperature values measured with three thermocouples and simulated were also compared a quite good agreement was observed between experimental and simulated temperature profiles see appendix b 4 2 2 extraction step at the end of the heating step the resulting temperature field was used as the initial temperature field to model non isothermal pumping at 20 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 as in the isothermal conditions first u uc fields were plotted to distinguish areas where viscous instabilities are likely to occur fig 9 the pumping performed at a low flow rate 20 ml min 1 only had a small region where the flow velocity can reach the critical velocity this agrees with the project of realizing this experiment to avoid viscous fingering and observe non isothermal flow without the presence of viscous fingers however at a higher flow rate 100 ml min 1 the velocity ratio was asymmetrical and higher on the right than on the left of the tank this is likely because the temperature is higher on the left which consequently reduces the dynamic viscosity ultimately uc was effectively higher when the temperature rises and more fingering was expected in the right of the tank than the left quantitatively the distance at which viscous fingers may appear was 10 cm in the left hand portion and 15 cm in the right hand portion fig 10 shows how oil saturation varied at tdr sensor 33 during pumping under non isothermal conditions at a low flow rate the modeled front was sharper than the experimental front near the pumping well at 100 ml min 1 the same flow rate as isothermal experiments we again observed good agreement between modeled and experimental oil saturation curves until the breakthrough point specifically the mean relative error of the model was 9 2 and 11 2 for flow rates of 20 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 respectively before the breakthrough point the relative error was larger after this point for the high flow rate as the mean relative error between model and experiment was 8 5 and 16 0 when considering the pumping process after breakthrough for flow rates of 20 ml min 1 and 100 ml min 1 respectively these results highlight that pumping viscous oil at low flow rates generates less fingering and was therefore well described by the generalized darcy s law fig 11 compares experimental and modeled saturation fields at 100 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 in adding the capillary parameters measured in dynamic conditions we could reproduce the slight asymmetrical interface observed at t 3 min for q 100 ml min 1 at q 20 ml min 1 no viscous fingering was observed during the pumping the saturation field as well as the cone of depression are described quite well by the model in this case the flow rate was not sufficient to generate viscous instabilities and the effect of temperature on the cone of depression was not reproduced to summarize without parameters measured in dynamic conditions no effect of temperature gradient would be observed in both experiments we observed slightly more oil ganglia in the right than the left of the tank and the model also reproduces this effect with the temperature dependence of residual saturation finally comparing results at both flow rates we found that generalized darcy s law was more precise for solving non isothermal dnapl pumping cases at low flow rates corresponding to small capillary numbers where viscous fingering is negligible this model was also used to simulate coal tar pumping at 20 c in non isothermal conditions at the same flow rate 100 ml min 1 saturations fields are compared in fig c 2 in the appendix section the main point is that the coal tar water critical velocity 5 5 10 5 m s 1 was higher than the oil ethanol critical velocity 2 10 5 m s 1 at 20 c therefore the viscous fingering zone was smaller for coal tar in both cases compared to canola oil moreover thanks to the good performance of heating in the non isothermal case for coal tar water compared to oil ethanol the water and coal tar viscosity ratio was reduced fig 12 shows the temperature fields inside the tank at 100 ml min 1 and 20 ml min 1 the comparison between modeled and measured temperatures was made with the assumption that lte was not valid we assumed that our thermocouples measured an average temperature 1 ε t s εt l in any case during pumping simulation the heat flux was redirected towards the well due to forced convection effects this effect was more visible in the temperature fields modeled at a high flow rate this heat transfer by convection was more visible in model results than in experimental data at 20 ml min 1 the temperature field looked more uniform than at 100 ml min 1 and was advancing slowly towards the pumping point due to less convective effects 5 porous media with permeability fluctuations here after considering a dynamic capillary diffusion coefficient in the oil zone we extend this analysis by considering permeability fluctuations in the same area to qualitatively reproduce the fingering ad hoc random permeability fluctuations might be used to simulate the high residual saturation the ganglia coalescence of the non wetting phase or fingering during pumping and non wetting phase drainage the significant effects of heterogeneity over different scales on the spreading of napl in the porous medium have been studied both experimentally and numerically by many researchers e g ataie ashtiani et al 2001 ataie ashtiani et al 2002 berg et al 2021 das et al 2004 das et al 2006 horgue et al 2015 random fluctuations in the permeability field have been used to onset instabilities in numerical work bouquet et al 2020 li and rivière 2016 sorbie et al 1994 we followed this path and added white gaussian noise to the constant permeability using comsol multiphysics software s built in functions the model equations initial and boundary conditions were similar to the original model presented before with the van genuchten mualem constitutive relationships mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 fig 13 shows the fluctuation patterns which only concern the oil zone where we saw that the fingering effect was significant numerical simulations were performed for pumping under isothermal conditions at 20 c as shown in fig 5 or following a pseudo non isothermal pumping i e dynamic viscosities increased linearly from the left to the right side of the tank and the corresponding viscosity ratio μ o μ e increased from 30 to 60 respectively saturation fields based on numerical simulations for heterogeneous media at 4 and 6 min after the beginning of pumping are shown in fig 14a for the isothermal case fingering and ganglia coalescence of non wetting phase behavior can be seen clearly in this situation fig 14b shows the saturation fields at 4 and 6 min after pumping for the pseudo non isothermal case besides the pattern obtained for the isothermal case we also observe the dissymmetry of the front as for the experimental results we have presented the hypothesis that small ad hoc permeability fluctuations might reproduce at least qualitatively the viscous fingering further work is required to explore the effects of several realizations of permeability fluctuations this is beyond the scope of this article additional findings on this topic are in progress and will be presented in a future article 6 conclusions we developed a numerical darcy scale model to simulate non isothermal two phase flow in highly permeable porous media the results showed that a higher temperature increased the critical velocity therefore the number of viscous fingers developed during pumping decreases when the temperature increases for oil ethanol this was linked to a change in breakthrough time as well as a decrease in residual oil saturation the mixture two phase model developed with comsol multiphysics correctly reproduces measured oil saturation in isothermal conditions until breakthrough time the coupling of the two phase flow in porous media equations with heat transfers was done by averaging fluid properties depending on the saturation temperature variation behavior is reproduced correctly using the proposed model the use of empirical relationships thermal dispersion coefficient interfacial heat transfer coefficient between solid and liquid phase and the lack of a detailed description of the fingering during pumping are issues that must be investigated to improve the quality of the fitting experiments focused on the determination of thermal dispersion and solid to liquid heat transfer coefficient specifically aimed at napl water flow are needed to improve current knowledge of non isothermal dnapl flow surprisingly for the coal tar water fluid pair viscous fingering was less important than initially thought the presence of residual non wetting ganglia being remobilized after the breakthrough of the wetting phase at the outlet was however more important for the coal tar water than the oil ethanol fluid pair future model development should consider residual non wetting phase remobilization by adding cross terms in the flow equations the values of these cross terms as well as their temperature dependence should also be explored experimentally by conducting experiments involving two simple liquids oil and ethanol we better understand phenomena happening during pumping under isothermal and non isothermal conditions however modeling thermally enhanced dnapl pumping represents a challenge that combines current problems at stake in different fields the treatment of viscous fingering breakthrough conditions remobilization of the non wetting phase by the wetting phase after breakthrough and validity of local thermal equilibrium are open subjects in the scope of this technique to address the observed issue with fingering and ganglia development in the non wetting phase during pumping generating random heterogeneities was suggested a simple heterogeneous permeability field case was simulated and a promising outcome was presented in explaining the observed issue more extensive numerical simulations for this set up and more realistic cases are in progress and will be reported in future work finally the development of non isothermal models is a must for a better representation of soil remediation processes first during heating processes it is not satisfactory to suppose that a site of a few hectares is under isothermal conditions secondly other remediation processes based on biological or chemical enhancement are also influenced by temperature variations for instance in situ chemical oxidation can generate substantial heat during reactions and a coupled model could help to find a temperature optimum credit authorship contribution statement hossein davarzani supervision conceptualization funding

institute for advanced studies appendix a two phase flow model validation first we compared the two phase flow model in porous media with experimental results from cochennec et al 2022 those authors performed a canola oil injection into 1 mm glass beads saturated with ethanol the liquid properties as well as relative permeabilities and capillary pressure saturation relationship were the same as in this study to study the impact of gravity forces on oil displacement in a highly permeable porous medium saturated with wetting fluid these authors injected canola oil from the bottom center into 1 mm glass beads saturated with ethanol which ensured stable displacement because of the similarities and fairly simple flow characteristics isothermal and stable displacement these data were well suited to validate the implementation of our model regarding two phase flow only before using the fully coupled model fig a 1 compares the simulation results obtained from the model developed in this study and experimental data from cochennec et al 2022 where the inlet velocity data was taken directly from the authors we observe that the oil pool generated after injection from the bottom has the same shape thus our two phase flow model reproduced simple two phase flow injection problems and was confronted with dnapl extraction applications fig a 1 comparison between experimental and model results a b experimental results from cochennec et al 2022 canola oil was injected from the bottom center into 1 mm glass beads saturated by ethanol the dark and light gray areas correspond to the

between model and experiment fig b 1 plots the temperature changes with time during heating for the thermocouples installed in the 2d tank center t13 ethanol saturated zone t23 ethanol oil interface and t33 oil saturated zone we observe quite good agreement between experimental and simulated profiles except for thermocouple 13 the relative error between experiment and simulation up to 17 h of heating was 6 5 3 9 and 3 0 for thermocouples 13 23 and 33 respectively the temperature profiles increased initially then decreased slightly after 17 h because of external temperature text variation from this point on the error between the experiment and simulation increased to 5 9 and 5 2 for thermocouples 23 and 33 respectively these discrepancies are likely due to an inappropriate constant coefficient used to describe heat loss at the top or bottom of the tank fig b 1 comparison of the temperature profiles obtained by numerical simulation ltne for the averaged temperature of solid and liquid phases and experiment after heating the 2d tank for 26 h for thermocouple numbers 13 23 and 33 fig b 1 appendix c application to coal tar pumping since the flow properties of the ethanol oil and coal tar water liquid pairs are similar we consider that it is possible to use the same numerical model to study coal tar pumping in this model oil properties were replaced by coal tar and ethanol

element control temperature was imposed at 50 c in the coal tar zone thermal diffusivity was higher in water than in the coal tar zone consequently the temperature in the water zone was lower than in the coal tar zone because of water s higher thermal conductivity compared to oil the heat was also transported further into the tank fig c 1 comparison of the temperature fields after heating the 2d tank for 10 h for the coal tar water fluid pair a experimental data from philippe et al 2021 and b simulation results from this study fig c 1 influence of thermal enhancement on coal tar pumping experimental data in philippe et al 2021 did not yield exploitable photographs of the saturation fields this made the estimation of thermal enhancement on coal tar pumping with imaging impossible we used the model to simulate coal tar pumping at 20 c as well as in non isothermal conditions at the same flow rate 100 ml min 1 saturations fields are compared in fig c 2 the viscous fingering zone is smaller for coal tar than canola oil in both cases because the coal tar water critical velocity is higher 5 5 10 5 m s 1 than the oil ethanol critical velocity 2 10 5 m s 1 at 20 c the coal tar water critical velocity at 20 c is even higher than that measured for oil ethanol at 32 c in non isothermal conditions better pre heating of the tank also raised the temperature in the coal tar zone higher than in the case with oil thus reducing the water to coal tar viscosity ratio even more fig c 2 comparison between coal tar saturation fields during pumping under isothermal conditions 20 c and non isothermal conditions at 100 ml min 1 fig c 2 however experiments showed that coal tar residual saturation was close and even higher than that measured during oil pumping experiments fig c 3 shows how the saturation changes in the model and experiments performed in the same conditions as the model for coal tar water at the assimilated level of tdr number 33 the area where saturation decreases is even longer than for oil ethanol we suspect this part of the curve to describe the fact that water is being pumped and at the same time dispersed ganglia of the non wetting fluid are being carried away due to the shear stress caused by pumping conditions between these ganglia and the water flowing towards the well taking this remobilization effect into account is a challenge and is of great importance to accurately model dnapl water flow finally coal tar residual saturation effectively decreases from 0 40 at 20 c to 0 27 with thermal enhancement fig c 3 comparison between experimental philippe et al 2021 and numerical results of coal tar saturation fields this study at point number 33 see fig 1 during pumping under isothermal conditions 20 c and non isothermal conditions at 100 ml

1247,biologically mediated degradation of organic compounds in porous media is a complex mathematical problem described by a non linear differential equation the organic compound gets in contact with the biomass and an enzyme catalysed reaction takes place the net result is that part of the parent compound degrades into some daughter product while some of the organic carbon is used for microbial growth the rate of biomass growth in the presence of a limiting nutrient supply is usually modelled with the experimentally derived monod equation i e it is proportional to the actual existing biomass multiplied by a factor that is non linear in terms of available organic matter this non linearity in the degradation equation implies a strong difficulty in directly implementing a numerical solution within a fully lagrangian framework and thus numerical solutions have traditionally been sought in either an eulerian or else an eulerian lagrangian framework here we pursue a fully lagrangian solution to the problem first the monod empirical equation is formulated as the outcome of a two step reaction while the approach is less general than other derivations existing in the literature based on a full understanding of the thermodynamics of the process it allows two things 1 providing some physical meaning to the actual parameters in the monod equation and more interestingly 2 formulating a methodology for the solution of the degradation equation incorporating monod kinetics by means of a particle tracking formulation for the latter purpose both reactants and biomass are represented by particles and their location at any given time is represented by a kernel that accounts for the uncertainty in the actual physical location by solving the reaction equation in a kernel framework we can reproduce the monod kinetics and as a particular result in the case no biomass growth is allowed the michaelis menten kinetics the methodology proposed is then successfully applied to reproduce two studies of microbially induced degradation of organic compounds in porous media first the observed kinetics of pseudomonas putida f1 in batch reactors while growing on benzene toluene and phenol and second the column study of carbon tetrachloride biodegradation by the denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas stutzeri kc keywords lagrangian methods particle tracking biodegradation two step kinetics model monod equation 1 introduction bioremediation either natural or enhanced is an efficient strategy to mitigate aquifer contamination we can find several applications of biologically induced degradation whether in the form of biostimulaiton hess et al 1996 bioaugmentation dybas et al 1998 or inclusion of permeable reactive barriers valhondo et al 2020 yet in order to design an effective remediation strategy there is a need of reliable predictions of contaminate degradation rates that can only be obtained by a solid modelling effort haws et al 2006 meckenstock et al 2015 to describe bioremediation in porous media biomass dynamics should be formally included in the modelling effort the impact of microorganism mediated remediation when the reaction is nutrient limited involves the presence of non linear terms in the mathematical model that are included as an extension of the transport equation most typically described by means of the advection dispersion equation ade this non linearity is the main reason why eulerian numerical methods have traditionally been used to solve the problem on the other hand particle based methods are found to be useful alternative for general geochemical reactive problems both homogeneous and heterogeneous yet their extension to study bioremediation problems is still limited in particular to describe the kinetics of biotransformation reactions coupled to the growth of biomass with the notable exception of ding and benson 2015 and ding et al 2017 the kinetics of biodegradation reactions have been described by a variety of models e g schmidt et al 1985 bekins et al 1998 among them michaelis menten mm johnson and goody 2011 and monod kinetics monod 1949 are the most commonly used both provide similar expressions for substrate utilization rate however they are fundamentally different mm kinetics is based on the assumption that the substrate is sufficiently available and the limiting quantity is that of the enzyme besides it does not support the growth of biomass as the amount of enzyme is considered constant in time mathematically the mm expression is derived by applying the law of mass action to a two step catalysed reaction then it is obtained as a special case by invoking either the equilibrium or quasi steady state assumptions which are not valid for the general case segel 1988 monod kinetics model on the other hand is a purely empirical one and it was originally developed to describe the growth of microorganisms under substrate limited conditions monod 1949 despite of its original derivation various efforts have been performed to establish the mechanistic basis of monod s model see e g liu 2007 for example tan et al 1994 derived monod rate law using a purely statistical quantum mechanics approach in which monod constants are given in terms of the substrate binding energy alternatively liu 2006 provided a thermodynamic basis to the monod equation meanwhile merchuk and asenjo 1995 and alvarez ramirez et al 2019 considered that monod kinetics consist of two processes that occur consecutively the first one related to the transport of the substrate from the bulk solution into the cell and the second one associated to metabolic consumption and biotransformation reactions numerical models of reactive transport with biodegradation reactions are usually implemented in an eulerian framework by means of discretizing the advection dispersion reaction equation adre both in time and space while biotransformation reactions are incorporated as sink source terms taking the form of monod like kinetics e g thullner et al 2004 murphy and ginn 2000 and references therein the fact that these terms are mainly nonlinear involving the product of both biomass and substrate concentrations makes it convenient to tackle them using operator splitting techniques in finite difference or finite elements techniques simpson and landman 2007 couto and malta 2008 such approach still carries some technical challenges especially those related to computational burden the transport problem is given by multiple continua one for each phase chemical species which eventually involves solving a nonlinear system of partial differential equations more importantly in many cases the results obtained using the ade suffer from additional dispersion that is introduced while seeking a numerical solution this is an artifact that usually leads to a significant overestimation of the reaction rates for field scale applications the modified adre formalism still requires proper upscaling of the parameters involved in the monod model ginn et al 2002 king et al 2010 battiato and tartakovsky 2011 for instance heße et al 2009 evaluated pore scale mass transfer fluxes when upscaling monod kinetics and showed that the effective reaction does not always follow a monod law and suggested that empirical effective rate parameters are needed for an accurate simulation similarly golfier et al 2009 used a volume averaging technique to upscale a porous media containing a biofilm phase starting from the pore scale description and found that the macroscale model is strictly valid only for a certain range of peclet and damköhler numbers other studies e g hesse et al 2010 wood et al 2007 knutson et al 2007 tartakovsky et al 2013 have shown that an effective monod model can be applied at the darcy scale only under excess substrate conditions indicating that it might overpredict biofilm growth and substrate utilization rate this discrepancy poses a question about the physical interpretation of the parameters involved in the monod equation as well as their validity i e whether they can be linked to transport and mass transfer processes an alternative to solving reactive transport using a continuum modelling approach is to seek a solution in a lagrangian framework in particular the random walk particle tracking rwpt family of methods have been widely used to study complex transport problems involving heterogeneity dual porosity and non fickian behaviour of conservative solutes labolle et al 1996 berkowitz et al 2006 salamon et al 2006 sherman et al 2021 besides they directly incorporate the idea of incomplete mixing to the process allowing for the reproduction of several observed experiments where mixing is considered to take place only partially this can be done by several methodologies simulating chemical reactions through probabilistic rules of particle collisions and transformations on a meshless domain gillespie 2000 edery et al 2010 benson and meerschaert 2008 ding and benson 2015 or else defining the probability of particle interaction based on a kernel description fernàndez garcia and sánchez vila 2011 siirila woodburn et al 2015 rahbaralam et al 2015 additionally other studies have extended the method by including interparticle mass transfer and on particle reactions which allow to overcome resolution problems and include reactions of any user defined design and complexity bolster et al 2016 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2017 one of the challenges in particle based methods is how to properly and efficiently include the kinetics of biodegradation reactions which is the object of this study generally the kinetics of non equilibrium reactions are expressed in terms of chemical activities equivalent to concentrations in diluted solutions however traditional particle based solvers were not capable of handling non linear chemical reactions since the process of continuously reconstructing activities from the particles spatial distribution could lead to high loss of efficiency to overcome this type of problems algorithms were developed based on the collocation of particles where a particle represents a fixed fraction of the total mass and then using search algorithms initially they were limited to first order monomolecular reactions and second order bimolecular reactions benson and meerschaert 2008 fernàndez garcia and sánchez vila 2011 rahbaralam et al 2015 but later they were extended to include kinetics of arbitrary complexity ding and benson 2015 sole mari et al 2017 sole mari et al 2019 along this line ding and benson 2015 combined first and second order kinetics to reproduce mm enzyme kinetics and later applied the resulting model to simulate carbon tetrachloride degradation under anaerobic conditions ding et al 2017 another class of algorithms are based on the idea that particles exchange mass among each other reactions in this case are simulated by mass reduction operation that depends on the co location of particles or as particle wise operation while considering that particles can carry mass of any number of species bolster et al 2016 benson and bolster 2016 engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2020 the present work provides a kernel based particle tracking approach to simulate transport problems with biologically mediated degradation and biomass growth the simulation scheme is based on the original birth death algorithms where particles are considered to carry a fixed fraction of mass of a single species but then can transform to a different species due to reaction so here biomass is discretized in terms of particles representing a fraction of total biomass and then allowing the transformation of particles from representing organic matter substrate to become biomass for direct tracking of the latter for this purpose in section 2 a conceptual model for the process of biodegradation is presented we show that despite its simplicity the model formulated retrieves both monod and mm kinetics as special cases under some simplifying conditions in section 3 we present how this model is implemented in a kernel based particle tracking algorithm emphasizing biotransformation reactions then section 4 includes two examples for illustration both taken from the literature first by fitting the kinetics of pseudomonas putida f1 growing on benzene toluene and phenol acting as substrates in batch experiments in the second example we reproduce the observations from a column experiment of bioaugmentation with the denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas stutzeri kc for carbon tetrachloride ct bioremediation lastly we derive some conclusions section 5 2 biodegradation reaction products and parameters we consider a degradation problem of a pool of labile organic matter taken as the parent compound that is degraded in the presence of biomass leading to a daughter product we assume an infinite supply of electron acceptor so that it is not a limiting factor in the reaction we start by assuming the simplest case of biomass being constant in time then the reaction could be written as 1 b c k 1 bc k 2 b p where b stands for biomass c is organic matter bc is an intermediate complex being formed during the degradation process and p is the degradation product eq 1 would hold for example in most enzymatic reactions in such a case and by introducing further simplification we recover mm kinetics johnson and goody 2011 actually eq 1 is already a simplified version as the derivation of the mm model usually includes backward rate in the first reaction reversible process while product formation is assumed irreversible nevertheless in most cases the backward coefficients are smaller than the forward ones so that this simplification does not incorporate a significant error into the overall behaviour 2 1 derivation of monod kinetics a more complicated mathematical problem arises when we introduce b as active biomass capable of using part of the carbon present in the organic matter supplied to the system to grow the series of reactions can be seen as an auto catalytic process which might be written as a direct extension of eq 1 2 b c k 1 bc k 2 b δ b p here including δ b to denote the increase in biomass produced in the process since now the organic carbon can be used for two purposes we need to introduce the concept of yield coefficient y being the fraction of degraded organic matter c that is used to increase biomass therefore 1 y is the remaining fraction of degraded organic matter that is used to form the final product p again and for simplicity the backward coefficient in the first reaction has been disregarded despite it could be easily incorporated in the formulation from 2 we can write the governing equations by applying the law of mass action for each individual species if we consider a fully mixed batch system then the rate of changes in concentrations can be expressed as 3a d bc dt k 1 b c k 2 bc 3b d b dt k 1 b c k 2 1 y bc 3c d c dt add k 1 b c 3d d p dt k 2 1 y bc in all these equations is the notation used to indicate species concentration here add is the supply of organic matter and therefore in general it would be a function of time it is possible to find some constant values by slightly manipulating the equations for example combining 3a 3b and 3d we can write 4 bc b y 1 y p α where α is a constant value throughout the process notice that this result is independent of add on the other hand when add 0 this would be the case in a batch system by combining 3a 3b and 3c we can write 5 1 y bc b y c δ with δ being another constant value note that if we assume bc is approximately stable in time such that d bc dt 0 then from 3a we get 6 bc k 1 k 2 b c which would be equivalent to consider 7 d b dt k 2 y bc by combining 5 and 6 we get 8 bc c δ y c k 2 k 1 1 y c now by substituting 8 into 7 we can write 9 d b dt k 2 y c δ y c k 2 k 1 1 y c we remark that during the reaction in 2 the instantaneous total biomass would be partitioned between the active biomass b and the intermediate complex bc and we may define a new quantity x as the total biomass being 10 x b 1 y bc actually x is the real observable quantity as in reality it is not possible to measure separately b and bc now combining 5 9 10 imposing the quasi steady state assumption d bc dt 0 it is possible to derive the standard expressions for monod kinetics 11 d x dt μ max c x k m c 12 d c dt 1 y dx dt 1 y μ max c x k m c with 13 k m k 2 k 1 1 y μ max k 2 y 1 y therefore by taking add 0 and y ct these two conditions are well known in the literature the only restriction for eqs 11 and 12 to be valid is that the intermediate complex bc is stable in time furthermore in the particular case of y 0 which means that there is no growth in biomass we can fully recover the michaelis menten equation by substituting 8 into 3d which gives 14 d p dt ν max c k m c with 15 k m k 2 k 1 ν max k 2 δ we remark that the derived monod kinetics in eqs 11 and 12 are slightly different from those obtained by alvarez ramirez et al 2019 although both derivations depart from the series of reactions in 2 this difference is attributed to two main reasons first in alvarez ramirez et al 2019 the solution of 3 is approximated using singular perturbation taking the factor 1 k 2 as the perturbation parameter thus the validity of their approximation depends implicitly on the assumption that 1 k 2 1 while here we tend to simplify the system of equations in 3 by assuming that bc is stable in time second and more importantly in alvarez ramirez et al 2019 the portion of biomass that forms the intermediate complex bc is not included in their definition of the total biomass i e x b while in our case the total biomass is defined according to eq 10 nonetheless both derivations provide exactly the same interpretation for monod parameters eq 13 the monod constant k m is traditionally defined as the half saturation which is basically the substrate concentration at which the rate of growth is equal to half of the maximum specific growth from eq 13 one might read an alternative interpretation in terms of the kinetic scheme in 2 in the sense that k m represents the ratio between the rate at which the substrate biomass complex is formed k 1 and the rate at which it is being transformed k 2 therefore it might be seen as indicator of the relative dominance of the two different steps for instance high values of k m reflect that the limiting step is the formation of bc including all the sub processes that are involved in substrate biomass binding in contrast low values of k m indicate that the limiting step is the conversion of bc and the metabolic reactions that are responsible for biomass production the maximum specific growth rate μ max is found to be given solely by the rate of substrate conversion k 2 and the yield coefficient y thus this suggests that μ max might be interpreted as an intrinsic property of the microbial reaction meaning that it does not depend on the processes which might be involved in the binding of substrates such as mass transfer the availability of active sites or the level of mixing besides the specific growth rate μ max in monod equation appear to have a distinct meaning from the maximum rate ν max in mm kinetics where the latter is given in terms of the constant δ that is usually linked to the initial enzyme concentration 2 2 range of validity in order to derive monod equation we had to resort to the quasi steady state assumption by taking d bc dt 0 this assumption has been well studied in the context of enzyme catalysed reactions e g when y 0 mm kinetics this assumption is valid as long as b 0 c 0 k m 1 with b 0 and c 0 being the initial concentrations of the enzyme and the substrate respectively segel 1988 in the following we examine numerically the validity of assuming d bc dt 0 when y 0 by comparing the solution of monod kinetics given by eqs 11 and 12 with the solution obtained form the two step kinetics given by the set of eqs 3a 3d while assuming a batch system with add 0 to do so we define dimensionless measures for the deviation between the two solutions 16a ε x 0 x s τ x m τ x 0 2 d τ 16b ε c 0 c s τ c m τ c 0 2 d τ where ε x and ε c represent the deviation in the evolution of biomass x and substrate c concentrations respectively the subscripts s and m indicate respectively the solution of the full system 3 and monod eqs 11 and 12 respectively x 0 and c 0 are the initial conditions and τ μ max t is the time scale fig 1 shows the obtained values for ε x and ε c in terms of the dimensionless variables k m c 0 and x 0 c 0 y as a way to compare different sets of parameters and initial conditions the evolution of the concentrations was obtained numerically using a fourth order runge kutta method while the initial condition where chosen according to fig 1 with bc 0 0 and b 0 x 0 for the solution of 3 the integrals in eq 16 were computed numerically using the trapezoidal rule the colour map in fig 1 shows a significant variation in both ε x and ε c displaying several orders of magnitude depending on the parameter values used in the simulations basically the validity of the quasi steady state assumption is marked by the parametric conditions with vanishing deviation regions highlighted with dark blue so that within this range the solution of the nonlinear system in 3 properly approximates monod s kinetics law we also note that the two models tend to diverge whenever the concentration of the substrate c 0 is small as compared with the biomass concentration b 0 or and the half saturation constant k m considering that deviations below 10 2 are negligible we might extract heuristic conditions from fig 1 at which the two description are equivalent one might proceed be taking all the cases that rely above the line log x 0 c 0 y log k m c 0 0 which reads that x s τ x m τ and c s τ c m τ as long as 17 x 0 c 0 y c 0 k m 3 random walk particle tracking rwpt with biotransformation reaction in this section we briefly summarize the numerical scheme of rwpt we consider a split operator approach by combining the advective dispersive motion of particles with probabilistic rules for chemical reactions 3 1 representation of an individual particle the total mass m t of each reactant is divided into large number of representative particles denoted by n without losing any generality we assume that all particles have the same mass m p so that m t n δ m p at any given time the concentration field c x of each reactant is obtained from the spatial distribution of particles where each particle is considered to be equipped with an adaptive kernel function fernàndez garcia and sánchez vila 2011 such that 18 c x 1 ϕ p 1 n m p w x x p h with m p and x p indicating the mass and position of particle p respectively ϕ is the porosity and w x x p h is a scaled kernel function that is commonly chosen as gaussian distribution but other formulations would be valid as well 19 w x x p h 1 2 π d h exp 1 2 x x p t h 1 x x p with d being space dimension and h is an adaptive bandwidth support volume which is determined using kernel density estimators kde techniques in this work the estimator given in botev et al 2010 has been used 3 2 random walk algorithm advective and dispersive fluxes are simulated using a standard random walk method which implies that knowing the location of every particle location at time t this position is updated after a time step δ t according to a drift term plus a superposed brownian motion 20 x p t δ t x p t v p x p t δ t e x p t ξ t δ t where x p t is the position of particle p at time t v p is the advective velocity vector e is a displacement matrix determined by ee t 2 d with d the dispersion tensor and ξ t is a vector of independent normally distributed random variables with zero mean and unit variance 3 3 biodegradation and biomass growth in particle tracking model one of the advantages of describing biodegradation reactions in terms of 2 is that it can be decomposed into two elementary steps where the first step is simulated as a bimolecular reaction with second order kinetics and the second step as a monomolecular reaction involving first order kinetics in rwpt algorithms chemical reactions of these types can be simulated by calculating the probability of reaction benson and meerschaert 2008 rahbaralam et al 2015 ding and benson 2015 sole mari et al 2017 3 3 1 the bimolecular reaction b c k 1 bc here both organic carbon c and biomass b are discretized in terms of particles then the occurrence of the bimolecular reaction b c k 1 bc is the outcome of a bernoulli trial this means at each time step δ t a uniform random number η 0 1 is generated for each c particle or instead each b particle and compared to the probability of reaction p c in case that p c η it is considered that the reaction does not take place and the algorithm continues with the next c particle instead if p c η the reaction occurs the c particle and the closest b particle are removed while one bc particle is placed at the mid point location between the c and b particles in the literature there exist several different formulations for the probability of this reaction p c based on various conceptions of co location particle support volume and level of mixing benson and meerschaert 2008 rahbaralam et al 2015 perez et al 2019 in this work we resorted to the kernel based approach presented in rahbaralam et al 2015 in which the probability p c is derived from a second order reaction rate d c dt k 1 b c using the adaptive kernel representation in eq 18 so that the probability of reaction for the ith c particle to become a bc particle is given by 21 p c c bc δ t k 1 δ t ϕ j 1 n b m j b w x i c x j b h c h b with w x i c x j b h c h b being a kernel function that depends on the separation between particles while x i c x j b h c and h b being the position and the kernel bandwidth for the c and b particles respectively we remark that the stoichiometric formulation in eq 2 is still applicable regardless of how p c is defined that is to say any alternative implementation of p c is compatible with the present method we also remark that this expression is a linearization of an exponential model and thus it is only valid if the computed probabilities are very small p c 1 providing a limiting value for δ t 3 3 2 the monomolecular reaction bc k 2 b δ b p similarly for the monomolecular reaction bc k 2 b δ b p a uniform random number η 0 1 is drawn for each bc particle and if the probability of reaction p bc is larger than η the bc particle is transformed into three particles one p particle and two separate b particles based on the definitions in section 2 1 the additional b particle represents the growth of biomass δ b thus its mass m δ b is given in terms of the yield coefficient as 22 m δ b ym bc with m bc being the mass of the transformed bc particle the probability p bc for each bc particle is given by considering a first order reaction rate d bc dt k 2 bc benson and meerschaert 2008 as 23 p bc bc b δ b p δ t k 2 δ t again here this expression is only valid if the computed probabilities are very small p bc 1 providing a second limiting value for δ t to be considered in the actual applications other expressions could be used with a larger range of validity 4 results and discussion 4 1 interpretation of experimental data batch system as a first illustrative example we compare the two step kinetics in eqs 3 against monod kinetics given by eqs 11 and 12 both models were applied to the biodegradation of phenol benzene and toluene in the presence of pseudomonas putida f1 while assuming well mixed conditions experimental data were taken from reardon et al 2000 in that paper the authors performed several batch experiments using each of the three aromatics as the carbon and energy sources here we interpret the experiments where each substrate is analysed independently as shown in fig 2 the measurements provided the concentration of the aromatic compounds along with the microbial density as a function of time overall they tend to display along an s shape starting from a lag phase corresponding to biomass adaption followed by an exponential growth phase of the microbial density in parallel with the depletion of the substrate numerical calibration was performed to estimate the optimal parameters for both models while taking the concentration of the aromatic compounds as the main substrate c t and the density of p putida f1 strain in our notation x t the fitting procedure involved the minimization of a quadratic objective function given as 24 min m j i 1 n c t i c exp t i 2 i 1 n x t i x exp t i 2 with m being the set of fitting parameters defined as m μ max k m y for monod kinetics and m k 1 k 2 y for the system of equations in 3 the subscript exp indicates the measured experimental values t i is the sampling time and n is the number of measurements in addition we introduce a parameter t in order to represent the lag phase during which bacteria adapt themselves during this lag phase bacterial growth is fully inhibited in the methodology proposed the lag phase is implemented by considering a time varying yield coefficient y t in a simple binary function inactivation activation in the form 25 y t 0 if t t y if t t but alternative formulations might as well be considered the minimization problem in 24 is then solved using the nonlinear programming algorithm provided in coleman and li 1996 while the system of equations in 3 along with monod s equations in 11 and 12 are being solved using fourth order runge kutta method the overall performance in terms of error and the best fitted parameters given respectively in tables 1 and 2 as seen in fig 2 both models provide a good overall fit with no distinguishable difference between the two curves the overall errors are also comparable actually in general the implementation from the two step model is about 2 better than that derived directly from the monod equation also the estimated yield coefficients and the time lags are similar for both models regarding the latter the lag time was estimated around 1 h for benzene and 2 3 h for toluene while in the case of phenol the optimal fit was obtained with a zero lag we attribute this result to the slow consumption of phenol with respect to the total reaction time meaning that the lag phase has a minor effect on the overall kinetics besides both models tend to fail in capturing the consumption rate of benzene for the intermediate times 8 to 12 h this was already noted by reardon et al 2000 who attributed it to a potential inhibition effect introduced by metabolic intermediates a process not included in the proposed model regarding the estimated kinetic parameters the obtained values were found to correspond to cases in which the two step model deviate from monod kinetics as shown in section 2 2 in these cases monod kinetics given by eqs 11 and 12 do not accurately approximate the system of equations in 3 thus a comparison between the parameters of each model i e eq 13 cannot be drawn nonetheless both models still manage to fairly fit the experimental results in this case the data given in fig 2 provides a clear example in which the degradation and growth rates can be interpreted using the two step kinetics regardless of how it can be linked to monod s empirical law 4 2 simulation of a column diffusion experiment in this second example we display the result of a column experiment of the biodegradation of carbon tetrachloride ct by pseudomonas stutzeri strain kc the kc strain is able to degrade ct under anaerobic conditions and transform it to carbon dioxide formate and nonvolatile byproducts criddle et al 1990 the reaction follows a cometabollic pathway that is activated in an iron limiting environment in batch experiments it was found that this process follows monod kinetics where the reaction rate is limited by the supply of an electron donor such as acetate and nitrate as an electron acceptor while the degradation of ct tends to exhibit second order kinetics in terms of the concentration of ct and the density of the kc strain see criddle et al 2013 and references therein a detailed description of the experiment is given in witt et al 1999 it consisted of a column 1 m long and 0 052 m in diameter constructed using a polycarbonate pipe and filled with sediment and groundwater from the schoolcraft aquifer 10 sampling ports were installed along the column at 7 6 cm intervals the water contained ct and nitrate at initial concentrations of 0 1 and 25 mg l respectively at day 0 the column was inoculated at the centre at 0 517 m distance with a 320 ml culture containing strain kc at 1 2 0 1 10 8 cfu ml 1533 mg l of acetate and 217 mg l of bromide during 26 days samples from each port were analysed for ct nitrate acetate and the amount of the bacteria kc a numerical model for microbial solute transport and ct biodegradation was first developed in phanikumar et al 2002 the dominant processes which are considered to control reaction rate are 1 the utilization of the electron donor acetate and the electron acceptor nitrate given by dual monod kinetics 2 the growth decay of strain kc 3 the transformation of ct with second order kinetics that is proportional to the microbial density and 4 the sorption of ct which is assumed at equilibrium with a retardation coefficient of 1 73 phanikumar et al 2002 according to the authors in witt et al 1999 the electron donor term might be ignored while taking into account only the utilization of nitrate in monod kinetics because the concentration of acetate is three orders of magnitude higher than the half saturation constant which is 1 mg l knoll 1995 beside since there was no flow forced through the column molecular diffusion is considered as the only transport mechanism while for strain kc we also assume a single mobile phase that obeys fickian diffusion using all aforementioned conditions and assumptions ding and benson performed particle tracking simulation including mm kinetics ding and benson 2015 ding et al 2017 here we consider monod type kinetics where biomass is directly included in the particle tracking methodology and the two step model is interpreted by eq 13 in order to keep track of the developed biomass the simulation of the experiment is summarized in algorithm1 that displays the practical way that the methodology described in section 3 was implemented note that the experiment involves diffusion but not advection to summarize the algorithm at each time step 1 all particles diffuse via random walks 2 the kernel bandwidths are determined via kde 3 the nitrate particle bind to the biomass particles to form the intermediate complex 4 the complex dissociates and releases additional biomass in the proportion given by the yield coefficient 5 the degradation of ct by bacteria is simulated as a bimolecular reaction with reaction rate k ct and 6 the simulation of the first order decay of bacteria kc is computed in the simulation the initial concentration of strain kc was converted to micrograms using a cell weight of 4 08 10 10 mg cfu knoll 1995 since both ends of the column are closed a non flux boundary condition was imposed the measured initial concentrations are not uniform along the column see fig 3 and due to the lack of statistical data particles are initially distributed heuristically to reflect the initial heterogeneous measurements considering a uniform distribution for both ct and nitrate particles with standard deviation of 0 025 m while the strain kc particles are placed according to a normal distribution with 0 517 m mean value representing the injection point and 0 008 m standard deviation algorithm 1 simulation of column experiment b strain kc c nitrate no3 bc c t carbon tetrachloride ct t 0 while t t end do for each

same expression as eq 21 while replacing c by c t and k 1 by k ct the experimental data and the fittings at day 0 2 5 and 26 are shown in fig 3 the plots show the mean values continuous lines and the standard deviation shaded area for 10 simulations the manually calibrated kinetics parameters are listed in table 3 overall both model predictions and the estimated parameters are realistic and comparable with other studies ding and benson 2015 phanikumar et al 2002 knoll 1995 the lack of accuracy is mainly attributed to the oversimplification of the transport of strain kc a limitation that was not fully resolved neither by this model nor by other models e g ding and benson 2015 phanikumar et al 2002 the diffusion coefficient for both nitrate and ct were set as 0 8 10 4 m 2 d and changes of this value within the typically reported range of 0 04 1 2 10 4 m 2 d were found to have minor effect on the overall evolution the estimated ct degradation coefficient k ct is lower than the value obtained in batch reactors knoll 1995 this observation was already stated by phanikumar et al 2002 where the authors attribute this observation to the inhibition effect of the trace metals found in the sediment besides other studies e g criddle et al 2013 suggest that at late times the ct degradation rate is limited by the regeneration of an intermediate complex which is responsible for ct transformation such process could also explain the need for the low calibrated value for k ct the rate of nitrate utilization is reproduced fairly well yet at late time day 5 to 26 there is a disagreement between predictions and the measured concentrations far from the centre of the column this is likely due to the activity of indigenous microbes that were not taken into account in the modelling effort especially since the input and experimental setting is symmetric while the measured values are asymmetric the density of the simulated strain kc was found far higher than the measured values which are available only for days 2 and 5 in the experiment the total amount of strain kc is likely to be partitioned between attached biofilm and detached planktonic cells while the amount of attached cells was not quantified since the measured concentrations corresponds only to planktonic cells it represents only a fraction of the total biomass in the column other studies have tried to include attachment and detachment processes into their models and they found that in order capture population dynamics it is necessary to use a rate of attachment that is much higher than that of detachment ding et al 2017 phanikumar et al 2002 besides fitting the nitrate and ct profiles required including a relatively high diffusion coefficient of 2 10 4 m 2 d for the strain kc thus indicating that the mobile cells are chemotactic toward nitrate witt et al 1999 if attachment and detachment processes are included along with a bias motion of motile cells toward regions of higher nitrate concentrations alt 1980 then the model could better predict the distribution of detached strain kc however experimental data about these processes were limited not allowing for proper calibration 5 conclusions with the increasing use of particle tracking methods to solve complex reactive transport problems this work extends their original algorithm to incorporate biomediated reactions with biomass growth by introducing particles that directly represent biomass the methodology is built on the former contribution in ding and benson 2015 alvarez ramirez et al 2019 which consists on implementing biotransformation reaction in a two step process involving the formation of an intermediate compound with the second kinetic reaction leading to a daughter compound with a fraction of the parent compound being used for microbial growth under some simplifying conditions of equilibrium the two step reaction allows reproducing in full both monod kinetics and the mm models allowing a direct correspondence between the parameters involved in the two step reaction and those used in the mm or the monod models the probability of reaction between the organic matter and biomass is developed from a kernel based approach rahbaralam et al 2015 allowing the full algorithm implemented to be competitive in front of existing eulerian formulations without the cons of the latter mainly the enhancement of numerical dispersion we show under which conditions the two step kinetics is equivalent to monod kinetics summarized by an inequality in terms of the initial conditions and model parameters furthermore the two descriptions are compared by reproducing the biodegradation of three different aromatic compounds in batch reactors from the obtained results we have found that the two step reaction performs well even in conditions that extent beyond the range of validity related to the approximations leading to the mathematical derivation of monod kinetics actually the associated errors are found to be less then those produced while using the standard monod equation in addition the method is implemented to simulate a column diffusion experiment of carbon tetrachloride biodegradation taking into account biomass growth decay and substrate utilization the results along with estimated parameters are found consistent and comparable with other studies under the same type of assumptions we conclude that the present method is a useful tool that has a potential applicability to transport problems in bio amended porous media the fact that it is fully lagrangian makes it a favourable alternative for studying biodegradation and biofilm growth especially since this type of formulations are convenient to handle complex behaviour such as incomplete mixing and physical heterogeneity factors that are normally found to have a significant effect on reaction rates finally we see this method as a promising tool for studying biotransformation reaction at pore scale where capturing high concentration gradients and numerical dispersion pose computational challenges credit author statement malik a dawi conceptualization data

1247,biologically mediated degradation of organic compounds in porous media is a complex mathematical problem described by a non linear differential equation the organic compound gets in contact with the biomass and an enzyme catalysed reaction takes place the net result is that part of the parent compound degrades into some daughter product while some of the organic carbon is used for microbial growth the rate of biomass growth in the presence of a limiting nutrient supply is usually modelled with the experimentally derived monod equation i e it is proportional to the actual existing biomass multiplied by a factor that is non linear in terms of available organic matter this non linearity in the degradation equation implies a strong difficulty in directly implementing a numerical solution within a fully lagrangian framework and thus numerical solutions have traditionally been sought in either an eulerian or else an eulerian lagrangian framework here we pursue a fully lagrangian solution to the problem first the monod empirical equation is formulated as the outcome of a two step reaction while the approach is less general than other derivations existing in the literature based on a full understanding of the thermodynamics of the process it allows two things 1 providing some physical meaning to the actual parameters in the monod equation and more interestingly 2 formulating a methodology for the solution of the degradation equation incorporating monod kinetics by means of a particle tracking formulation for the latter purpose both reactants and biomass are represented by particles and their location at any given time is represented by a kernel that accounts for the uncertainty in the actual physical location by solving the reaction equation in a kernel framework we can reproduce the monod kinetics and as a particular result in the case no biomass growth is allowed the michaelis menten kinetics the methodology proposed is then successfully applied to reproduce two studies of microbially induced degradation of organic compounds in porous media first the observed kinetics of pseudomonas putida f1 in batch reactors while growing on benzene toluene and phenol and second the column study of carbon tetrachloride biodegradation by the denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas stutzeri kc keywords lagrangian methods particle tracking biodegradation two step kinetics model monod equation 1 introduction bioremediation either natural or enhanced is an efficient strategy to mitigate aquifer contamination we can find several applications of biologically induced degradation whether in the form of biostimulaiton hess et al 1996 bioaugmentation dybas et al 1998 or inclusion of permeable reactive barriers valhondo et al 2020 yet in order to design an effective remediation strategy there is a need of reliable predictions of contaminate degradation rates that can only be obtained by a solid modelling effort haws et al 2006 meckenstock et al 2015 to describe bioremediation in porous media biomass dynamics should be formally included in the modelling effort the impact of microorganism mediated remediation when the reaction is nutrient limited involves the presence of non linear terms in the mathematical model that are included as an extension of the transport equation most typically described by means of the advection dispersion equation ade this non linearity is the main reason why eulerian numerical methods have traditionally been used to solve the problem on the other hand particle based methods are found to be useful alternative for general geochemical reactive problems both homogeneous and heterogeneous yet their extension to study bioremediation problems is still limited in particular to describe the kinetics of biotransformation reactions coupled to the growth of biomass with the notable exception of ding and benson 2015 and ding et al 2017 the kinetics of biodegradation reactions have been described by a variety of models e g schmidt et al 1985 bekins et al 1998 among them michaelis menten mm johnson and goody 2011 and monod kinetics monod 1949 are the most commonly used both provide similar expressions for substrate utilization rate however they are fundamentally different mm kinetics is based on the assumption that the substrate is sufficiently available and the limiting quantity is that of the enzyme besides it does not support the growth of biomass as the amount of enzyme is considered constant in time mathematically the mm expression is derived by applying the law of mass action to a two step catalysed reaction then it is obtained as a special case by invoking either the equilibrium or quasi steady state assumptions which are not valid for the general case segel 1988 monod kinetics model on the other hand is a purely empirical one and it was originally developed to describe the growth of microorganisms under substrate limited conditions monod 1949 despite of its original derivation various efforts have been performed to establish the mechanistic basis of monod s model see e g liu 2007 for example tan et al 1994 derived monod rate law using a purely statistical quantum mechanics approach in which monod constants are given in terms of the substrate binding energy alternatively liu 2006 provided a thermodynamic basis to the monod equation meanwhile merchuk and asenjo 1995 and alvarez ramirez et al 2019 considered that monod kinetics consist of two processes that occur consecutively the first one related to the transport of the substrate from the bulk solution into the cell and the second one associated to metabolic consumption and biotransformation reactions numerical models of reactive transport with biodegradation reactions are usually implemented in an eulerian framework by means of discretizing the advection dispersion reaction equation adre both in time and space while biotransformation reactions are incorporated as sink source terms taking the form of monod like kinetics e g thullner et al 2004 murphy and ginn 2000 and references therein the fact that these terms are mainly nonlinear involving the product of both biomass and substrate concentrations makes it convenient to tackle them using operator splitting techniques in finite difference or finite elements techniques simpson and landman 2007 couto and malta 2008 such approach still carries some technical challenges especially those related to computational burden the transport problem is given by multiple continua one for each phase chemical species which eventually involves solving a nonlinear system of partial differential equations more importantly in many cases the results obtained using the ade suffer from additional dispersion that is introduced while seeking a numerical solution this is an artifact that usually leads to a significant overestimation of the reaction rates for field scale applications the modified adre formalism still requires proper upscaling of the parameters involved in the monod model ginn et al 2002 king et al 2010 battiato and tartakovsky 2011 for instance heße et al 2009 evaluated pore scale mass transfer fluxes when upscaling monod kinetics and showed that the effective reaction does not always follow a monod law and suggested that empirical effective rate parameters are needed for an accurate simulation similarly golfier et al 2009 used a volume averaging technique to upscale a porous media containing a biofilm phase starting from the pore scale description and found that the macroscale model is strictly valid only for a certain range of peclet and damköhler numbers other studies e g hesse et al 2010 wood et al 2007 knutson et al 2007 tartakovsky et al 2013 have shown that an effective monod model can be applied at the darcy scale only under excess substrate conditions indicating that it might overpredict biofilm growth and substrate utilization rate this discrepancy poses a question about the physical interpretation of the parameters involved in the monod equation as well as their validity i e whether they can be linked to transport and mass transfer processes an alternative to solving reactive transport using a continuum modelling approach is to seek a solution in a lagrangian framework in particular the random walk particle tracking rwpt family of methods have been widely used to study complex transport problems involving heterogeneity dual porosity and non fickian behaviour of conservative solutes labolle et al 1996 berkowitz et al 2006 salamon et al 2006 sherman et al 2021 besides they directly incorporate the idea of incomplete mixing to the process allowing for the reproduction of several observed experiments where mixing is considered to take place only partially this can be done by several methodologies simulating chemical reactions through probabilistic rules of particle collisions and transformations on a meshless domain gillespie 2000 edery et al 2010 benson and meerschaert 2008 ding and benson 2015 or else defining the probability of particle interaction based on a kernel description fernàndez garcia and sánchez vila 2011 siirila woodburn et al 2015 rahbaralam et al 2015 additionally other studies have extended the method by including interparticle mass transfer and on particle reactions which allow to overcome resolution problems and include reactions of any user defined design and complexity bolster et al 2016 benson and bolster 2016 schmidt et al 2017 one of the challenges in particle based methods is how to properly and efficiently include the kinetics of biodegradation reactions which is the object of this study generally the kinetics of non equilibrium reactions are expressed in terms of chemical activities equivalent to concentrations in diluted solutions however traditional particle based solvers were not capable of handling non linear chemical reactions since the process of continuously reconstructing activities from the particles spatial distribution could lead to high loss of efficiency to overcome this type of problems algorithms were developed based on the collocation of particles where a particle represents a fixed fraction of the total mass and then using search algorithms initially they were limited to first order monomolecular reactions and second order bimolecular reactions benson and meerschaert 2008 fernàndez garcia and sánchez vila 2011 rahbaralam et al 2015 but later they were extended to include kinetics of arbitrary complexity ding and benson 2015 sole mari et al 2017 sole mari et al 2019 along this line ding and benson 2015 combined first and second order kinetics to reproduce mm enzyme kinetics and later applied the resulting model to simulate carbon tetrachloride degradation under anaerobic conditions ding et al 2017 another class of algorithms are based on the idea that particles exchange mass among each other reactions in this case are simulated by mass reduction operation that depends on the co location of particles or as particle wise operation while considering that particles can carry mass of any number of species bolster et al 2016 benson and bolster 2016 engdahl et al 2017 schmidt et al 2017 sole mari et al 2020 the present work provides a kernel based particle tracking approach to simulate transport problems with biologically mediated degradation and biomass growth the simulation scheme is based on the original birth death algorithms where particles are considered to carry a fixed fraction of mass of a single species but then can transform to a different species due to reaction so here biomass is discretized in terms of particles representing a fraction of total biomass and then allowing the transformation of particles from representing organic matter substrate to become biomass for direct tracking of the latter for this purpose in section 2 a conceptual model for the process of biodegradation is presented we show that despite its simplicity the model formulated retrieves both monod and mm kinetics as special cases under some simplifying conditions in section 3 we present how this model is implemented in a kernel based particle tracking algorithm emphasizing biotransformation reactions then section 4 includes two examples for illustration both taken from the literature first by fitting the kinetics of pseudomonas putida f1 growing on benzene toluene and phenol acting as substrates in batch experiments in the second example we reproduce the observations from a column experiment of bioaugmentation with the denitrifying bacterium pseudomonas stutzeri kc for carbon tetrachloride ct bioremediation lastly we derive some conclusions section 5 2 biodegradation reaction products and parameters we consider a degradation problem of a pool of labile organic matter taken as the parent compound that is degraded in the presence of biomass leading to a daughter product we assume an infinite supply of electron acceptor so that it is not a limiting factor in the reaction we start by assuming the simplest case of biomass being constant in time then the reaction could be written as 1 b c k 1 bc k 2 b p where b stands for biomass c is organic matter bc is an intermediate complex being formed during the degradation process and p is the degradation product eq 1 would hold for example in most enzymatic reactions in such a case and by introducing further simplification we recover mm kinetics johnson and goody 2011 actually eq 1 is already a simplified version as the derivation of the mm model usually includes backward rate in the first reaction reversible process while product formation is assumed irreversible nevertheless in most cases the backward coefficients are smaller than the forward ones so that this simplification does not incorporate a significant error into the overall behaviour 2 1 derivation of monod kinetics a more complicated mathematical problem arises when we introduce b as active biomass capable of using part of the carbon present in the organic matter supplied to the system to grow the series of reactions can be seen as an auto catalytic process which might be written as a direct extension of eq 1 2 b c k 1 bc k 2 b δ b p here including δ b to denote the increase in biomass produced in the process since now the organic carbon can be used for two purposes we need to introduce the concept of yield coefficient y being the fraction of degraded organic matter c that is used to increase biomass therefore 1 y is the remaining fraction of degraded organic matter that is used to form the final product p again and for simplicity the backward coefficient in the first reaction has been disregarded despite it could be easily incorporated in the formulation from 2 we can write the governing equations by applying the law of mass action for each individual species if we consider a fully mixed batch system then the rate of changes in concentrations can be expressed as 3a d bc dt k 1 b c k 2 bc 3b d b dt k 1 b c k 2 1 y bc 3c d c dt add k 1 b c 3d d p dt k 2 1 y bc in all these equations is the notation used to indicate species concentration here add is the supply of organic matter and therefore in general it would be a function of time it is possible to find some constant values by slightly manipulating the equations for example combining 3a 3b and 3d we can write 4 bc b y 1 y p α where α is a constant value throughout the process notice that this result is independent of add on the other hand when add 0 this would be the case in a batch system by combining 3a 3b and 3c we can write 5 1 y bc b y c δ with δ being another constant value note that if we assume bc is approximately stable in time such that d bc dt 0 then from 3a we get 6 bc k 1 k 2 b c which would be equivalent to consider 7 d b dt k 2 y bc by combining 5 and 6 we get 8 bc c δ y c k 2 k 1 1 y c now by substituting 8 into 7 we can write 9 d b dt k 2 y c δ y c k 2 k 1 1 y c we remark that during the reaction in 2 the instantaneous total biomass would be partitioned between the active biomass b and the intermediate complex bc and we may define a new quantity x as the total biomass being 10 x b 1 y bc actually x is the real observable quantity as in reality it is not possible to measure separately b and bc now combining 5 9 10 imposing the quasi steady state assumption d bc dt 0 it is possible to derive the standard expressions for monod kinetics 11 d x dt μ max c x k m c 12 d c dt 1 y dx dt 1 y μ max c x k m c with 13 k m k 2 k 1 1 y μ max k 2 y 1 y therefore by taking add 0 and y ct these two conditions are well known in the literature the only restriction for eqs 11 and 12 to be valid is that the intermediate complex bc is stable in time furthermore in the particular case of y 0 which means that there is no growth in biomass we can fully recover the michaelis menten equation by substituting 8 into 3d which gives 14 d p dt ν max c k m c with 15 k m k 2 k 1 ν max k 2 δ we remark that the derived monod kinetics in eqs 11 and 12 are slightly different from those obtained by alvarez ramirez et al 2019 although both derivations depart from the series of reactions in 2 this difference is attributed to two main reasons first in alvarez ramirez et al 2019 the solution of 3 is approximated using singular perturbation taking the factor 1 k 2 as the perturbation parameter thus the validity of their approximation depends implicitly on the assumption that 1 k 2 1 while here we tend to simplify the system of equations in 3 by assuming that bc is stable in time second and more importantly in alvarez ramirez et al 2019 the portion of biomass that forms the intermediate complex bc is not included in their definition of the total biomass i e x b while in our case the total biomass is defined according to eq 10 nonetheless both derivations provide exactly the same interpretation for monod parameters eq 13 the monod constant k m is traditionally defined as the half saturation which is basically the substrate concentration at which the rate of growth is equal to half of the maximum specific growth from eq 13 one might read an alternative interpretation in terms of the kinetic scheme in 2 in the sense that k m represents the ratio between the rate at which the substrate biomass complex is formed k 1 and the rate at which it is being transformed k 2 therefore it might be seen as indicator of the relative dominance of the two different steps for instance high values of k m reflect that the limiting step is the formation of bc including all the sub processes that are involved in substrate biomass binding in contrast low values of k m indicate that the limiting step is the conversion of bc and the metabolic reactions that are responsible for biomass production the maximum specific growth rate μ max is found to be given solely by the rate of substrate conversion k 2 and the yield coefficient y thus this suggests that μ max might be interpreted as an intrinsic property of the microbial reaction meaning that it does not depend on the processes which might be involved in the binding of substrates such as mass transfer the availability of active sites or the level of mixing besides the specific growth rate μ max in monod equation appear to have a distinct meaning from the maximum rate ν max in mm kinetics where the latter is given in terms of the constant δ that is usually linked to the initial enzyme concentration 2 2 range of validity in order to derive monod equation we had to resort to the quasi steady state assumption by taking d bc dt 0 this assumption has been well studied in the context of enzyme catalysed reactions e g when y 0 mm kinetics this assumption is valid as long as b 0 c 0 k m 1 with b 0 and c 0 being the initial concentrations of the enzyme and the substrate respectively segel 1988 in the following we examine numerically the validity of assuming d bc dt 0 when y 0 by comparing the solution of monod kinetics given by eqs 11 and 12 with the solution obtained form the two step kinetics given by the set of eqs 3a 3d while assuming a batch system with add 0 to do so we define dimensionless measures for the deviation between the two solutions 16a ε x 0 x s τ x m τ x 0 2 d τ 16b ε c 0 c s τ c m τ c 0 2 d τ where ε x and ε c represent the deviation in the evolution of biomass x and substrate c concentrations respectively the subscripts s and m indicate respectively the solution of the full system 3 and monod eqs 11 and 12 respectively x 0 and c 0 are the initial conditions and τ μ max t is the time scale fig 1 shows the obtained values for ε x and ε c in terms of the dimensionless variables k m c 0 and x 0 c 0 y as a way to compare different sets of parameters and initial conditions the evolution of the concentrations was obtained numerically using a fourth order runge kutta method while the initial condition where chosen according to fig 1 with bc 0 0 and b 0 x 0 for the solution of 3 the integrals in eq 16 were computed numerically using the trapezoidal rule the colour map in fig 1 shows a significant variation in both ε x and ε c displaying several orders of magnitude depending on the parameter values used in the simulations basically the validity of the quasi steady state assumption is marked by the parametric conditions with vanishing deviation regions highlighted with dark blue so that within this range the solution of the nonlinear system in 3 properly approximates monod s kinetics law we also note that the two models tend to diverge whenever the concentration of the substrate c 0 is small as compared with the biomass concentration b 0 or and the half saturation constant k m considering that deviations below 10 2 are negligible we might extract heuristic conditions from fig 1 at which the two description are equivalent one might proceed be taking all the cases that rely above the line log x 0 c 0 y log k m c 0 0 which reads that x s τ x m τ and c s τ c m τ as long as 17 x 0 c 0 y c 0 k m 3 random walk particle tracking rwpt with biotransformation reaction in this section we briefly summarize the numerical scheme of rwpt we consider a split operator approach by combining the advective dispersive motion of particles with probabilistic rules for chemical reactions 3 1 representation of an individual particle the total mass m t of each reactant is divided into large number of representative particles denoted by n without losing any generality we assume that all particles have the same mass m p so that m t n δ m p at any given time the concentration field c x of each reactant is obtained from the spatial distribution of particles where each particle is considered to be equipped with an adaptive kernel function fernàndez garcia and sánchez vila 2011 such that 18 c x 1 ϕ p 1 n m p w x x p h with m p and x p indicating the mass and position of particle p respectively ϕ is the porosity and w x x p h is a scaled kernel function that is commonly chosen as gaussian distribution but other formulations would be valid as well 19 w x x p h 1 2 π d h exp 1 2 x x p t h 1 x x p with d being space dimension and h is an adaptive bandwidth support volume which is determined using kernel density estimators kde techniques in this work the estimator given in botev et al 2010 has been used 3 2 random walk algorithm advective and dispersive fluxes are simulated using a standard random walk method which implies that knowing the location of every particle location at time t this position is updated after a time step δ t according to a drift term plus a superposed brownian motion 20 x p t δ t x p t v p x p t δ t e x p t ξ t δ t where x p t is the position of particle p at time t v p is the advective velocity vector e is a displacement matrix determined by ee t 2 d with d the dispersion tensor and ξ t is a vector of independent normally distributed random variables with zero mean and unit variance 3 3 biodegradation and biomass growth in particle tracking model one of the advantages of describing biodegradation reactions in terms of 2 is that it can be decomposed into two elementary steps where the first step is simulated as a bimolecular reaction with second order kinetics and the second step as a monomolecular reaction involving first order kinetics in rwpt algorithms chemical reactions of these types can be simulated by calculating the probability of reaction benson and meerschaert 2008 rahbaralam et al 2015 ding and benson 2015 sole mari et al 2017 3 3 1 the bimolecular reaction b c k 1 bc here both organic carbon c and biomass b are discretized in terms of particles then the occurrence of the bimolecular reaction b c k 1 bc is the outcome of a bernoulli trial this means at each time step δ t a uniform random number η 0 1 is generated for each c particle or instead each b particle and compared to the probability of reaction p c in case that p c η it is considered that the reaction does not take place and the algorithm continues with the next c particle instead if p c η the reaction occurs the c particle and the closest b particle are removed while one bc particle is placed at the mid point location between the c and b particles in the literature there exist several different formulations for the probability of this reaction p c based on various conceptions of co location particle support volume and level of mixing benson and meerschaert 2008 rahbaralam et al 2015 perez et al 2019 in this work we resorted to the kernel based approach presented in rahbaralam et al 2015 in which the probability p c is derived from a second order reaction rate d c dt k 1 b c using the adaptive kernel representation in eq 18 so that the probability of reaction for the ith c particle to become a bc particle is given by 21 p c c bc δ t k 1 δ t ϕ j 1 n b m j b w x i c x j b h c h b with w x i c x j b h c h b being a kernel function that depends on the separation between particles while x i c x j b h c and h b being the position and the kernel bandwidth for the c and b particles respectively we remark that the stoichiometric formulation in eq 2 is still applicable regardless of how p c is defined that is to say any alternative implementation of p c is compatible with the present method we also remark that this expression is a linearization of an exponential model and thus it is only valid if the computed probabilities are very small p c 1 providing a limiting value for δ t 3 3 2 the monomolecular reaction bc k 2 b δ b p similarly for the monomolecular reaction bc k 2 b δ b p a uniform random number η 0 1 is drawn for each bc particle and if the probability of reaction p bc is larger than η the bc particle is transformed into three particles one p particle and two separate b particles based on the definitions in section 2 1 the additional b particle represents the growth of biomass δ b thus its mass m δ b is given in terms of the yield coefficient as 22 m δ b ym bc with m bc being the mass of the transformed bc particle the probability p bc for each bc particle is given by considering a first order reaction rate d bc dt k 2 bc benson and meerschaert 2008 as 23 p bc bc b δ b p δ t k 2 δ t again here this expression is only valid if the computed probabilities are very small p bc 1 providing a second limiting value for δ t to be considered in the actual applications other expressions could be used with a larger range of validity 4 results and discussion 4 1 interpretation of experimental data batch system as a first illustrative example we compare the two step kinetics in eqs 3 against monod kinetics given by eqs 11 and 12 both models were applied to the biodegradation of phenol benzene and toluene in the presence of pseudomonas putida f1 while assuming well mixed conditions experimental data were taken from reardon et al 2000 in that paper the authors performed several batch experiments using each of the three aromatics as the carbon and energy sources here we interpret the experiments where each substrate is analysed independently as shown in fig 2 the measurements provided the concentration of the aromatic compounds along with the microbial density as a function of time overall they tend to display along an s shape starting from a lag phase corresponding to biomass adaption followed by an exponential growth phase of the microbial density in parallel with the depletion of the substrate numerical calibration was performed to estimate the optimal parameters for both models while taking the concentration of the aromatic compounds as the main substrate c t and the density of p putida f1 strain in our notation x t the fitting procedure involved the minimization of a quadratic objective function given as 24 min m j i 1 n c t i c exp t i 2 i 1 n x t i x exp t i 2 with m being the set of fitting parameters defined as m μ max k m y for monod kinetics and m k 1 k 2 y for the system of equations in 3 the subscript exp indicates the measured experimental values t i is the sampling time and n is the number of measurements in addition we introduce a parameter t in order to represent the lag phase during which bacteria adapt themselves during this lag phase bacterial growth is fully inhibited in the methodology proposed the lag phase is implemented by considering a time varying yield coefficient y t in a simple binary function inactivation activation in the form 25 y t 0 if t t y if t t but alternative formulations might as well be considered the minimization problem in 24 is then solved using the nonlinear programming algorithm provided in coleman and li 1996 while the system of equations in 3 along with monod s equations in 11 and 12 are being solved using fourth order runge kutta method the overall performance in terms of error and the best fitted parameters given respectively in tables 1 and 2 as seen in fig 2 both models provide a good overall fit with no distinguishable difference between the two curves the overall errors are also comparable actually in general the implementation from the two step model is about 2 better than that derived directly from the monod equation also the estimated yield coefficients and the time lags are similar for both models regarding the latter the lag time was estimated around 1 h for benzene and 2 3 h for toluene while in the case of phenol the optimal fit was obtained with a zero lag we attribute this result to the slow consumption of phenol with respect to the total reaction time meaning that the lag phase has a minor effect on the overall kinetics besides both models tend to fail in capturing the consumption rate of benzene for the intermediate times 8 to 12 h this was already noted by reardon et al 2000 who attributed it to a potential inhibition effect introduced by metabolic intermediates a process not included in the proposed model regarding the estimated kinetic parameters the obtained values were found to correspond to cases in which the two step model deviate from monod kinetics as shown in section 2 2 in these cases monod kinetics given by eqs 11 and 12 do not accurately approximate the system of equations in 3 thus a comparison between the parameters of each model i e eq 13 cannot be drawn nonetheless both models still manage to fairly fit the experimental results in this case the data given in fig 2 provides a clear example in which the degradation and growth rates can be interpreted using the two step kinetics regardless of how it can be linked to monod s empirical law 4 2 simulation of a column diffusion experiment in this second example we display the result of a column experiment of the biodegradation of carbon tetrachloride ct by pseudomonas stutzeri strain kc the kc strain is able to degrade ct under anaerobic conditions and transform it to carbon dioxide formate and nonvolatile byproducts criddle et al 1990 the reaction follows a cometabollic pathway that is activated in an iron limiting environment in batch experiments it was found that this process follows monod kinetics where the reaction rate is limited by the supply of an electron donor such as acetate and nitrate as an electron acceptor while the degradation of ct tends to exhibit second order kinetics in terms of the concentration of ct and the density of the kc strain see criddle et al 2013 and references therein a detailed description of the experiment is given in witt et al 1999 it consisted of a column 1 m long and 0 052 m in diameter constructed using a polycarbonate pipe and filled with sediment and groundwater from the schoolcraft aquifer 10 sampling ports were installed along the column at 7 6 cm intervals the water contained ct and nitrate at initial concentrations of 0 1 and 25 mg l respectively at day 0 the column was inoculated at the centre at 0 517 m distance with a 320 ml culture containing strain kc at 1 2 0 1 10 8 cfu ml 1533 mg l of acetate and 217 mg l of bromide during 26 days samples from each port were analysed for ct nitrate acetate and the amount of the bacteria kc a numerical model for microbial solute transport and ct biodegradation was first developed in phanikumar et al 2002 the dominant processes which are considered to control reaction rate are 1 the utilization of the electron donor acetate and the electron acceptor nitrate given by dual monod kinetics 2 the growth decay of strain kc 3 the transformation of ct with second order kinetics that is proportional to the microbial density and 4 the sorption of ct which is assumed at equilibrium with a retardation coefficient of 1 73 phanikumar et al 2002 according to the authors in witt et al 1999 the electron donor term might be ignored while taking into account only the utilization of nitrate in monod kinetics because the concentration of acetate is three orders of magnitude higher than the half saturation constant which is 1 mg l knoll 1995 beside since there was no flow forced through the column molecular diffusion is considered as the only transport mechanism while for strain kc we also assume a single mobile phase that obeys fickian diffusion using all aforementioned conditions and assumptions ding and benson performed particle tracking simulation including mm kinetics ding and benson 2015 ding et al 2017 here we consider monod type kinetics where biomass is directly included in the particle tracking methodology and the two step model is interpreted by eq 13 in order to keep track of the developed biomass the simulation of the experiment is summarized in algorithm1 that displays the practical way that the methodology described in section 3 was implemented note that the experiment involves diffusion but not advection to summarize the algorithm at each time step 1 all particles diffuse via random walks 2 the kernel bandwidths are determined via kde 3 the nitrate particle bind to the biomass particles to form the intermediate complex 4 the complex dissociates and releases additional biomass in the proportion given by the yield coefficient 5 the degradation of ct by bacteria is simulated as a bimolecular reaction with reaction rate k ct and 6 the simulation of the first order decay of bacteria kc is computed in the simulation the initial concentration of strain kc was converted to micrograms using a cell weight of 4 08 10 10 mg cfu knoll 1995 since both ends of the column are closed a non flux boundary condition was imposed the measured initial concentrations are not uniform along the column see fig 3 and due to the lack of statistical data particles are initially distributed heuristically to reflect the initial heterogeneous measurements considering a uniform distribution for both ct and nitrate particles with standard deviation of 0 025 m while the strain kc particles are placed according to a normal distribution with 0 517 m mean value representing the injection point and 0 008 m standard deviation algorithm 1 simulation of column experiment b strain kc c nitrate no3 bc c t carbon tetrachloride ct t 0 while t t end do for each

same expression as eq 21 while replacing c by c t and k 1 by k ct the experimental data and the fittings at day 0 2 5 and 26 are shown in fig 3 the plots show the mean values continuous lines and the standard deviation shaded area for 10 simulations the manually calibrated kinetics parameters are listed in table 3 overall both model predictions and the estimated parameters are realistic and comparable with other studies ding and benson 2015 phanikumar et al 2002 knoll 1995 the lack of accuracy is mainly attributed to the oversimplification of the transport of strain kc a limitation that was not fully resolved neither by this model nor by other models e g ding and benson 2015 phanikumar et al 2002 the diffusion coefficient for both nitrate and ct were set as 0 8 10 4 m 2 d and changes of this value within the typically reported range of 0 04 1 2 10 4 m 2 d were found to have minor effect on the overall evolution the estimated ct degradation coefficient k ct is lower than the value obtained in batch reactors knoll 1995 this observation was already stated by phanikumar et al 2002 where the authors attribute this observation to the inhibition effect of the trace metals found in the sediment besides other studies e g criddle et al 2013 suggest that at late times the ct degradation rate is limited by the regeneration of an intermediate complex which is responsible for ct transformation such process could also explain the need for the low calibrated value for k ct the rate of nitrate utilization is reproduced fairly well yet at late time day 5 to 26 there is a disagreement between predictions and the measured concentrations far from the centre of the column this is likely due to the activity of indigenous microbes that were not taken into account in the modelling effort especially since the input and experimental setting is symmetric while the measured values are asymmetric the density of the simulated strain kc was found far higher than the measured values which are available only for days 2 and 5 in the experiment the total amount of strain kc is likely to be partitioned between attached biofilm and detached planktonic cells while the amount of attached cells was not quantified since the measured concentrations corresponds only to planktonic cells it represents only a fraction of the total biomass in the column other studies have tried to include attachment and detachment processes into their models and they found that in order capture population dynamics it is necessary to use a rate of attachment that is much higher than that of detachment ding et al 2017 phanikumar et al 2002 besides fitting the nitrate and ct profiles required including a relatively high diffusion coefficient of 2 10 4 m 2 d for the strain kc thus indicating that the mobile cells are chemotactic toward nitrate witt et al 1999 if attachment and detachment processes are included along with a bias motion of motile cells toward regions of higher nitrate concentrations alt 1980 then the model could better predict the distribution of detached strain kc however experimental data about these processes were limited not allowing for proper calibration 5 conclusions with the increasing use of particle tracking methods to solve complex reactive transport problems this work extends their original algorithm to incorporate biomediated reactions with biomass growth by introducing particles that directly represent biomass the methodology is built on the former contribution in ding and benson 2015 alvarez ramirez et al 2019 which consists on implementing biotransformation reaction in a two step process involving the formation of an intermediate compound with the second kinetic reaction leading to a daughter compound with a fraction of the parent compound being used for microbial growth under some simplifying conditions of equilibrium the two step reaction allows reproducing in full both monod kinetics and the mm models allowing a direct correspondence between the parameters involved in the two step reaction and those used in the mm or the monod models the probability of reaction between the organic matter and biomass is developed from a kernel based approach rahbaralam et al 2015 allowing the full algorithm implemented to be competitive in front of existing eulerian formulations without the cons of the latter mainly the enhancement of numerical dispersion we show under which conditions the two step kinetics is equivalent to monod kinetics summarized by an inequality in terms of the initial conditions and model parameters furthermore the two descriptions are compared by reproducing the biodegradation of three different aromatic compounds in batch reactors from the obtained results we have found that the two step reaction performs well even in conditions that extent beyond the range of validity related to the approximations leading to the mathematical derivation of monod kinetics actually the associated errors are found to be less then those produced while using the standard monod equation in addition the method is implemented to simulate a column diffusion experiment of carbon tetrachloride biodegradation taking into account biomass growth decay and substrate utilization the results along with estimated parameters are found consistent and comparable with other studies under the same type of assumptions we conclude that the present method is a useful tool that has a potential applicability to transport problems in bio amended porous media the fact that it is fully lagrangian makes it a favourable alternative for studying biodegradation and biofilm growth especially since this type of formulations are convenient to handle complex behaviour such as incomplete mixing and physical heterogeneity factors that are normally found to have a significant effect on reaction rates finally we see this method as a promising tool for studying biotransformation reaction at pore scale where capturing high concentration gradients and numerical dispersion pose computational challenges credit author statement malik a dawi conceptualization data

1248,the recharge of stream water below the baseflow water table can mobilize groundwater contaminants particularly redox sensitive and sorptive metals such as uranium however in situ tracer experiments that simulate the recharge of stream water to uranium contaminated groundwater are lacking thus limiting the understanding of the potential mechanisms that control the mobility of uranium at the field scale in this study a field tracer test was conducted by injecting 100 gal 379 l of oxic river water into a nearby suboxic and uranium contaminated aquifer the traced river water was monitored for 18 days in the single injection well and in the twelve surrounding observation wells mobilization of uranium from the solid to the aqueous phase was not observed during the tracer test despite its pre test presence being confirmed on the aquifer sediments from lab based acid leaching however strong evidence of oxidative immobilization of iron and manganese was observed during the tracer test and suggested that immobile uranium was likely in its oxidized state as u vi on the aquifer sediments these observations ruled out oxidation of u iv to u vi as a potential mobilization mechanism therefore desorption of u vi appeared to be the predominant potential mobilization mechanism yet it was clearly not solely dependent on concentration as evident when considering that uranium poor river water 0 015 mg l was recharged to uranium rich groundwater 1 mg l it was possible that uranium desorption was limited by the relatively higher ph and lower alkalinity of the river water as compared to the groundwater both factors favor immobilization however it was likely that the immobile uranium was associated with a mineral phase as opposed to a sorbed phase thus desorption may not have been possible the results of this field tracer study successfully ruled out two common mobilization mechanisms of uranium 1 oxidative dissolution and 2 concentration dependent desorption and ruled in the importance of advection dispersion and the mineral phase of uranium keywords uranium tracer groundwater surface water dissolution desorption 1 introduction uranium is an anthropogenic and natural contaminant of concern in local and regional aquifers throughout the united states dwivedi et al 2022 nolan and weber 2015 the mobility of uranium in groundwater is largely controlled by redox conditions and the sorptive capacity of aquifer materials uranium is relatively mobile under oxic conditions and immobile under reducing conditions waseem et al 2015 under oxic conditions uranium is typically in its plus six oxidation state as u vi and can be speciated as positively charged uranyl ion uo2 2 under reducing conditions uranium is typically in its plus four oxidation state as u iv and can be speciated as uraninite mineral uo2 the reduction of uranyl to uraninite can be microbially mediated in the presence of a suitable and sufficient source of organic carbon e g natural organic carbon added lactate ethanol acetate etc singh et al 2014 uraninite is redox sensitive and can be biotically or abiotically oxidized and subsequently mobilized to u vi by dissolved phase oxidants such as oxygen o2 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 and solid phase oxidants such as manganese mn iv and iron fe iii singh et al 2014 however uranyl can become immobilized by sorption to negatively charged surfaces of aquifer materials such as clays and metal oxides and partition to equilibrium between the solid and aqueous phases coutelot et al 2018 um et al 2007 mobile u vi can also complex with carbonates and calcium under mildly alkaline conditions to form neutral or negatively charged ternary uranium calcium carbonate species dong and brooks 2006 and partition to an equilibrium that favors the mobile aqueous phase as opposed to the immobile solid phase dangelmayr et al 2017 elless and lee 1998 the mobility of u vi in groundwater is also controlled by ph with immobilization by sorption being favored at a ph range of approximately 6 to 10 kaplan et al 1998 langmuir 1978 desorption of u vi is favored at relatively low and high ph in general oxic and alkaline conditions favor the mobilization of uranium in groundwater as compared to anoxic and non alkaline conditions groundwater and surface water such as lakes rivers and streams are inherently connected sophocleous 2002 streams in relatively humid regions are normally recharged by nearby groundwater and are thus termed gaining streams fig 1 however normally gaining streams can temporarily become losing streams during periods when water levels approach flood stage fig 1 often associated with rapid snow melt and or precipitation losing streams can recharge nearby groundwater above and below the pre flood or baseflow water table fig 1 the recharge of stream water to uranium contaminated groundwater can mobilize uranium above and below the baseflow water table fig 1 and lead to an increase in the concentration of uranium relative to pre flood stage conditions dam et al 2015 uranium above the baseflow water table and desorption are thought to be the predominant source and mechanism respectively for relative increases in the concentration of uranium zachara et al 2013 in contrast uranium below the baseflow water table is thought to be primarily diluted by the recharge of uranium poor stream water zachara et al 2016 however it is possible that the effect of dilution of uranium below the baseflow water table can be opposed by oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption paradis et al 2020 both mechanisms mobilize uranium from the solid to the aqueous phase thus the relative contribution of mobile uranium from above and below the baseflow water table during the recharge of stream water can vary considerably depending on the hydrogeologic conditions of the site the pre flood stage concentration of uranium in groundwater during groundwater to river water recharge fig 1 can be given as 1 c o m b o v b o where c o pre flood stage concentration m l3 m b o pre flood stage mass below baseflow water table m and v b o pre flood volume below baseflow water table l3 the flood stage concentration of uranium in groundwater during stream water to groundwater recharge fig 1 can be given as 2 c m b m a v b v a where c flood stage concentration m l3 m b flood stage mass below baseflow water table m v b flood stage volume below baseflow water table l3 m a flood stage mass above baseflow water table m and v a flood stage volume above baseflow water table l3 eqs 1 and 2 can be combined to express the relative concentration of flood stage to pre flood stage uranium in groundwater as 3 c c o v b o m b m a m b o v b o v a eq 3 assumes that the flood stage and pre flood stage volume below the baseflow water table are equal i e that v b v b o a relative increase in the concentration of uranium would require that the numerator to be greater than the denominator in eq 3 both the mass above and below the baseflow water table are in the numerator in eq 3 and are therefore directly proportional to the relative concentration of uranium however determining the relative importance of each mass above and below the baseflow water table during recharge of stream water to uranium contaminated groundwater is an ongoing challenge a study by zachara et al 2013 highlighted the importance of natural stream stage fluctuations on the mobility of uranium in groundwater specifically that u vi can be desorbed above the baseflow water table during high stream stage fig 1 another study by zachara et al 2016 indicated that the effect of natural stream water recharge on the mobility of uranium in groundwater was complex and that advection dilution and the source of uranium either above or below the baseflow water table were likely contributing factors it is important to note that both studies by zachara et al 2013 and 2016 were conducted during natural flow conditions a study by paradis et al 2020 forced the recharge of stream water into a uranium contaminated aquifer below the baseflow water table and suggested that oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption were contributing factors to the mobilization of uranium it is important to note that this study was conducted during forced flow conditions forced flow conditions can lead to relatively high groundwater velocities within the radial vicinity of the injection and extraction wells and underestimate the sorption of a solute as compared to natural flow conditions fenske 1979 and this effect i e velocity dependent sorption has been observed for u vi gamerdinger et al 2001 although these previous studies paradis et al 2020 zachara et al 2016 zachara et al 2013 yielded mechanistic insights into the mobility of uranium in groundwater during stream water recharge there remains a need to conduct studies focused on uranium below the baseflow water table and under natural flow conditions the objective of this study was to elucidate the mobilization mechanisms of uranium during the recharge of relatively oxic and uranium poor river water below the baseflow water table of a relatively suboxic and uranium rich aquifer under natural flow conditions it was hypothesized that uranium would be mobilized via oxidation of u iv and or concentration dependent desorption of u vi to test this hypothesis a tracer based river water to groundwater recharge experiment was conducted under predominantly natural flow conditions at a uranium contaminated site and the results herein successfully elucidated the potential mobilization mechanisms of uranium 2 materials and methods 2 1 site background this study site is in riverton wyoming a detailed history of the site activities and its hydrogeology was provided by dam et al 2015 in brief a uranium milling site operated at the site from 1958 to 1963 and the piling of uranium tailings resulted in the contamination of the shallow unconfined sand and gravel aquifer fig 2 although the tailings were removed decades ago by the united states department of energy concentrations of uranium persist in the shallow aquifer groundwater models predicted that natural flushing would reduce concentrations of uranium below maximum contaminant levels 0 044 mg l by the year 2098 dam et al 2015 however in june of 2010 local rainfall combined with snowmelt produced record stages of the little wind river fig 3 that resulted in both flooding and increases in concentrations of uranium in groundwater dam et al 2015 two additional stages have exceeded the flood stage since 2010 fig 3 interestingly the concentration of uranium in groundwater tends to increase along the flow path from the former tailings area to the downgradient area on the banks of the little wind river fig 2 where they can approach 1 5 mg l dam et al 2015 recommended that additional characterization of solid phase uranium was needed near the little wind river and a subsequent field investigation indicated that concentrations of uranium can approach 5 mg kg nearly 10 times greater than the background concentration on the sands and gravels below the water table fig 2 doe 2016 this investigation also indicated that solid phase uranium was present in naturally reduced zones in an unsaturated silt layer above the saturated sand and gravel aquifer doe 2016 the naturally reduced zone was shown to extend slightly below the water table in a clayey silt that graded into the sand and gravel aquifer doe 2016 several samples of the sand and gravel aquifer below the naturally reduced zone contained elevated levels of uranium doe 2016 therefore it is this specific area of the site the relatively high uranium area below the naturally reducing zone within the saturated sand and gravel aquifer and near the banks of the little wind river fig 2 that is of interest to understanding of the potential mechanisms that control the mobility of uranium during the recharge of relativity oxic and uranium poor river water it should be noted that in addition to the contrast in redox conditions and uranium content of the groundwater and river water the two waters are known to differ in ph and alkalinity the ph of the groundwater tends to be lower than the river water 7 versus 8 5 whereas the alkalinity tends to be higher 500 versus 200 mg l as caco3 doe 2016 2 2 previous tracer test a field tracer test was previously conducted by paradis et al 2022 in the same area of interest as this study fig 2 and was focused on characterizing the physical properties of the uranium contaminated aquifer mainly groundwater velocity and dual porosity paradis et al 2022 estimated that the magnitude of groundwater velocity was approximately 0 60 ft day 0 18 m day and in line with the hydraulic gradient fig 4 and that the aquifer sediments did not demonstrate strong evidence for dual porosity paradis et al 2022 used little wind river water as the tracer injection fluid effectively simulating recharge of river water to contaminated groundwater yet did not focus on characterizing the mobilization mechanisms of uranium however both aquifer sediments and groundwater samples were collected during this previous study and subsequently analyzed for this follow up study 2 3 experimental design the field tracer test was conducted in the summer of 2020 a detailed description of this test was provided by paradis et al 2022 in brief a series of 13 temporary groundwater monitoring wells were installed by direct push screened near the water table and within the uranium contaminated sand and gravel aquifer sediments fig 4 the wells were installed as three transects oriented perpendicular to groundwater flow fig 4 the total distance between the upper and lower transects were no 10 ft 3 m as to allow for the transport of the tracer to be completed within approximately 30 days two solute tracers iodide and pentafluorobenzoate were added to a 100 gal 379 l volume of river water for a target concentration of 500 mg l and injected into up gradient well 1001 using a peristaltic pump under forced gradient conditions for 8 h fig 4 to establish vertical distribution of the tracers the injection well fluid was recirculated in a closed loop during the injection phase the injection phase was followed by sampling and analysis of the tracers in the injection well and the down gradient transects of observation wells under natural gradient conditions for 18 days groundwater samples were collected under low volume and low flow conditions as to not disturb the natural gradient groundwater samples were filtered 0 45 μm preserved on ice 4 c acidified with nitric acid ph 2 when appropriate and shipped weekly to rsi entech llc in grand junction colorado for laboratory analysis of the added tracers iodide and pentafluorobenzoate in addition to that previously described by paradis et al 2022 groundwater samples were analyzed in the laboratory for uranium manganese iron sulfate and chloride uranium was quantified by kinetic phosphorescence analysis chemchek kpa 11 according to method ap u 2 doe 2021 sulfate and chloride were quantified by ion chromatography dionex aquion manganese and iron were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent icp ms 7850 after acidification several groundwater quality parameters were also measured relatively rapidly and in the field these included the following dissolved oxygen ph alkalinity redox potential eh and ferrous iron dissolved oxygen was quantified by hach accuvac ampules using a dr890 colorimeter following hach method 8166 ph and eh were quantified using a ysi 556 mps alkalinity was quantified by titration with 1 6 n sulfuric acid following hach method 8203 ferrous iron was quantified using a dr890 colorimeter following hach method 8146 lastly silt sand and gravel sediment samples were collected from above and below the water table during the installation of the temporary wells and were analyzed in the laboratory for uranium by first leaching with 5 nitric acid following standard batch leaching procedure cb bt 1 doe 2021 and the supernatant was analyzed by kinetic phosphorescence analysis chemchek kpa 11 a 5 nitric acid leaching was used to ensure that all sorbed uranium was mobilized from the contaminated sediments doe 2018 2 4 data analysis the fundamental method of data analysis was to generate measured versus expected concentration versus time or breakthrough curves of potentially reactive solutes e g uranium during the tracer test paradis et al 2019 and then calculate their recovery factors paradis et al 2020 the expected breakthrough curves of solutes were generated using eq 11 from paradis et al 2019 the expected breakthrough curve of a solute is based on the behavior of the added non reactive solute tracer in this case iodide and makes the following assumptions 1 the concentrations of both solutes are equal to their injection concentrations in this case river water at time equal to zero 2 the concentrations of both solutes are equal to their aquifer concentrations in this case groundwater as time reaches infinity and 3 the mobilization mechanisms of both solutes e g advection dispersion and reactivity are no different therefore any difference between the measured concentration and expected concentration of a solute indicates that one or more mobilization mechanism in addition to advection and dispersion e g dissolution or desorption occurred the recovery factors of solutes were generated using eq 3 from paradis et al 2020 the recovery factor is based on the ratio of the area under the measured versus the expected breakthrough curves for example a recovery factor 1 indicates that the potentially reactive solute e g uranium was added to the aqueous phase whereas a recovery factor 1 indicates that the solute was removed a recovery factor equal to 1 indicates no net addition or removal the limits of integration of the measured versus expected breakthrough curves were set to start when the concentration of iodide was equal to or 5 of its injection concentration and end at 5 these limits ensured that only the signal of the river water groundwater mixture was analyzed lastly breakthrough curves of three wells were analyzed as follows injection well 1001 and down gradient observation wells 1005 and 1011 fig 4 these wells had the strongest signal of the added tracers paradis et al 2022 and are the primary wells of interest in this follow up study 2 5 exploratory modeling a very simple finite difference numerical model was constructed to simulate the mobility of uranium during the pulse recharge of river water to contaminated groundwater to visually explore what the breakthrough curves of uranium may look like under the following four scenarios 1 advection and dispersion 2 advection dispersion and first order production oxidative dissolution 3 advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption concentration dependent desorption and 4 advection dispersion first order production oxidative dissolution and linear equilibrium sorption concentration dependent desorption the pulse recharge condition was meant to simulate an ephemeral flood stage event the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with linear equilibrium sorption desorption and first order decay production is as follows 4 r c t d x 2 c x 2 v x c x kc where c concentration m l3 x length l t time t v x velocity l t d x dispersion l2 t r retardation dimensionless and k rate 1 t the initial condition was set equal to the concentration of the solute in groundwater c g as 5 c x t 0 c g the boundary condition at the inlet was set equal to the concentration of the solute in the river water c r during the injection as 6 c x 0 0 t t i c r the boundary condition at the inlet was set equal to the concentration of the solute in the groundwater c g after the injection as 7 c x 0 t t i c g the boundary condition at the outlet was set to a zero concentration flux as 8 c x t x 0 where c g concentration groundwater m l3 c r concentration river water m l3 and t i injection time t eq 4 subject to the initial and boundary conditions in eqs 5 through 8 was solved using an explicit backward difference finite approximation according to the fundamental methodology by wang and anderson 1982 and using microsoft excel by enabling its optional iterative capabilities it is important to note that the boundary condition in eq 7 is somewhat unique in that there is no analytical solution in the literature under such condition goltz and huang 2017 hence the need to construct a numerical model the model was assigned the following parameters temporal step 0 1 days spatial step 0 1 ft 3 0 cm v x 0 60 ft day 0 18 m day d x 0 060 ft2 day 0 006 m2 day t i 2 days c g uranium 1 mg l and c r uranium 0 mg l the temporal and spatial discretization i e steps were determined by peclet and courant numbers respectively equal to or less than one the physical parameters v x d x concentrations of uranium c r c g and the injection time t i were approximated based on the previous study by paradis et al 2022 r was set to 1 for uranium for scenarios 1 and 2 no desorption and 1 5 for scenarios 3 and 4 yes desorption k was set to 0 for a generic oxidant for scenarios 1 and 3 no production and 0 15 days for scenarios 2 and 3 yes production because the production of uranium was dependent on the decay of the oxidant 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre test geochemistry concentrations of uranium on the aquifer sediments above and below the water table and within the tracer test location fig 4 ranged from 0 31 to 5 84 mg kg table s1 these data indicated that solid phase uranium was spatially variable with concentrations less than and up to ten times greater than the background concentration of approximately 0 5 mg kg doe 2016 a visual inspection of the data along the groundwater flow path a to a in fig 4 and in profile view indicated that concentrations of uranium on the aquifer sediments above the water table and in the silts were greater than those below the water table and in the silts sands and gravels fig 5 however concentrations of uranium on the relatively permeable sand and gravel aquifer sediments below the water table ranged from approximately 0 3 to 3 mg kg fig 5 moreover concentrations of uranium on the sands and gravels ranged from approximately 1 to 5 mg kg just 30 ft 9 m down gradient from the third transect fig 4 at the location of permanent monitoring well 855 doe 2016 therefore the data from this study and previous studies doe 2016 indicated that concentrations of uranium on the sand and gravel aquifer sediments below the water table and within the vicinity of the tracer test location were spatially variable and can greatly exceed background levels concentrations of uranium in groundwater and within the tracer test location ranged from 1 01 to 1 17 mg l fig 6 and table s2 these data indicated that aqueous phase uranium was spatially uniform and much greater than background concentrations of 0 0042 mg l doe 2016 the redox potential of groundwater ranged from approximately 162 to 340 mv fig 6 and table s2 these data indicated that redox conditions were spatially variable and spanned the general range of manganese reducing 500 mv iron reducing 100 mv and uranium reducing 0 mv but were above strongly reducing e g sulfate reducing 200 mv and methanogenic 300 mv singh et al 2014 these data also indicated that redox conditions were increasingly reducing along the groundwater flow path a to a in fig 4 from transect one to two to three fig 6 the alkalinity and ph were relatively uniform spatially with an average of 561 mg l as caco3 and 7 16 respectively fig 6 and table s2 these data indicated that the groundwater was relatively alkaline with a circumneutral ph specific concentrations of uranium in the primary wells of interest herein referred to as the test wells i e injection well 1001 in transect one and down gradient wells 1005 and 1011 in transects two and three respectively fig 4 were approximately 1 mg l whereas the concentration of uranium in the river water injection fluid was 0 015 mg l table 1 these data indicated that the test wells were uranium rich and that the river water was uranium poor and suggested that the recharge of river water could mobilize uranium from the aquifer sediments to the groundwater due to concentration dependent desorption concentrations of chloride were approximately 50 times greater in the test wells as compared to the river water table 1 chloride like the added tracer iodide is a halide and has long been utilized as a non reactive tracer davis et al 1985 thus chloride could serve as a non added tracer that like uranium is concentration rich in the groundwater and concentration poor in the river water however the mobility of chloride unlike uranium could serve as a tracer for non reactive advective and dispersive transport the specific water quality parameters of the test wells and the river water were in notable contrast specifically in redox potential dissolved oxygen ph and alkalinity table 1 the river water was relatively oxidizing as compared to the test wells as evident by higher redox potential and dissolved oxygen that approached saturation 7 to 9 mg l table 1 these data suggested that the recharge of river water could oxidize and mobilize reduced species of uranium from the aquifer sediments the river water was also relatively higher in ph and lower in alkalinity as compared to the test wells table 1 and suggested that recharge of river water could slightly favor immobilization in summary the primary potential mechanisms that could mobilize uranium during the recharge of river water were concentration dependent desorption and oxidative dissolution whereas ph and alkalinity dependent sorption could slightly favor immobilization 3 2 model simulated breakthrough curves the simulated breakthrough curve of uranium in a down gradient observation well during the pulse recharge of up gradient uranium poor river water to uranium rich groundwater showed an inverted bell shaped curve with an upper and lower bound of the groundwater and river water concentration respectively for advection and dispersion fig 7 the breakthrough curve with advection dispersion and production i e oxidative dissolution showed a similar mean arrival time as compared to the breakthrough curve with advection and dispersion yet with a notably increased area under the curve fig 7 the relatively greater area under the curve with oxidative dissolution indicated that uranium mass was mobilized to the aqueous phase the breakthrough curve with advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption i e concentration dependent desorption showed a similar area under the curve as compared to the breakthrough curve with advection and dispersion yet with a notably delayed mean arrival time fig 7 the relatively delayed mean arrival time with concentration dependent desorption indicated that uranium mass was desorbed as the leading edge of uranium poor river water was recharged and that uranium mass was sorbed as the tailing edge of uranium poor river water was followed by recharge of uranium rich groundwater the breakthrough curve with advection dispersion dissolution and desorption sorption showed both greater area under the curve and a delayed mean arrival time as compared to the breakthrough curve with advection and dispersion fig 7 these simulations suggested that both potential mobilization mechanisms of uranium i e dissolution and desorption could be visually identified in the breakthrough curve data during the pulse recharge of uranium poor river water if the mobility due to advection and dispersion alone were known hence chloride could serve as a non added and non reactive tracer to represent advective and dispersive mobility from which to elucidate dissolution and or desorption of uranium 3 3 data driven breakthrough curves 3 3 1 chloride the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of chloride were nearly identical in all three wells fig 8 the breakthrough curves were also bound in lower concentration by the river water and upper concentration by the groundwater fig 8 the signal of the river water as indicated by the start and end of integration was relatively strong at the injection well 1001 and gradually decreased in strength and increased in mean arrival time at the down gradient wells 1005 and 1011 fig 8 these results indicated that the mobility of chloride was no different than the added tracer iodide and that the assumptions of the data analysis method by paradis et al 2019 were valid i e the mobility of chloride which is naturally present at relatively high concentrations in the groundwater table 1 was controlled by non reactive advective and dispersive transport moreover visual inspection of the breakthrough curve at down gradient well 1005 fig 8b located approximately three feet one meter in distance from the up gradient injection well 1001 fig 4 suggested that the mean arrival time of the river water was approximately four to five days this equates to a one dimensional average linear groundwater velocity of approximately 0 67 ft day 0 20 m day and was in excellent agreement with the two dimensional velocity of 0 60 ft day 0 18 m day paradis et al 2022 lastly the breakthrough curve at down gradient well 1005 fig 8b looked very similar in the general shape and bounds to the simulated breakthrough curve of a pulsed solute whose mobility was controlled by advection and dispersion alone fig 7 in summary the mobility of relatively highly concentrated chloride in groundwater was non reactive and controlled by advection and dispersion when recharged with river water 3 3 2 uranium the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of uranium like chloride were nearly identical in all three wells fig 9 these results indicated that the mobility of uranium was no different than the added tracer iodide and the non added tracer chloride thus the mobility of relatively highly concentrated uranium in groundwater table 1 was non reactive and controlled by advection and dispersion when recharged with river water these results were not expected it was hypothesized that oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption and subsequent mobilization of uranium would occur during recharge of relatively oxic and uranium poor river water table 1 however the data clearly indicated that uranium was not mobilized fig 9 it is important to note that the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was not known i e uranium may or may not have been in its reduced state if the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was indeed reduced it would be expected that the recharge of relatively oxic river water would sequentially oxidize reduced sulfur uranium iron and manganese bearing species and result in the sequential mobilization of sulfate and uranium and immobilization of iron and manganese singh et al 2014 since the mobilization of uranium was not observed it was possible that reduced sulfur bearing species completely consumed the oxidative capacity of the river water and left reduced uranium bearing species immobilized paradis et al 2016 if this were true then it would be expected that the mobilization of sulfate would have occurred and that reduced iron and manganese like uranium would be non reactive if this were false then it would be expected that sulfate like uranium would be non reactive and immobilization of reduced iron and manganese would have occurred therefore the mobility of sulfate ferrous iron and reduced manganese can elucidate the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments these results are shown and discussed in the next section in terms of concentration dependent desorption it is important to note that the concentration of uranium on the aquifer sediments is sensitive to the relative aggressiveness of the laboratory method malov et al 2021 yanase et al 1991 e g carbonate leach removes loosely sorbed uranium 5 nitric leach removes all sorbed and possibly some mineral uranium microwave extraction removes all sorbed and likely some mineral uranium or total digestion removes all sorbed and mineral uranium doe 2018 a 5 nitric leach was used in this study and it is possible that this method removed uranium associated with mineral grains as opposed to sorbed uranium thus solely concentration dependent desorption may not have been possible however the ph of the river water was slightly higher than the groundwater and the alkalinity of the river water was substantially lower than the groundwater table 1 both factors can favor sorption of uranium dangelmayr et al 2017 elless and lee 1998 kaplan et al 1998 langmuir 1978 therefore it is possible that the ph and alkalinity of the river water opposed the concentration dependent desorption and resulted in no desorption of uranium it is also possible and arguably more likely that the uranium on the aquifer sediments and below the baseflow water table fig 5 was associated with a mineral phase as opposed to a sorbed phase thus desorption may not have been possible nevertheless solely concentration dependent desorption was also ruled out as a potential mobilization mechanism as evident by the non reactive mobility of uranium during the recharge of uranium poor river water to uranium rich groundwater and sediments fig 9 it should be noted that the kinetics of oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption of uranium were assumed to be observable within the time scale of the experiments i e several days however the kinetics of uranium reactivity that influence its mobility from the solid to the aqueous phase can vary considerably based on site specific biogeochemical conditions zachara et al 2013 thus rate limited oxidation and or desorption of uranium cannot be ruled out it should also be noted that colloid facilitated transport of uranium malkovsky et al 2020 was not a focus of this study thus uranium bearing colloids greater in size than 0 45 μm may have been retained but not quantified on the groundwater filters 3 3 3 sulfate iron and manganese the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of sulfate like uranium were nearly identical in the injection well fig 10a breakthrough curves of sulfate in the down gradient wells are shown in hoss 2022 and they demonstrated very similar measured versus expected behavior these results suggested that reduced sulfur bearing species were not present in the aquifer sediments or groundwater because they would be oxidized and mobilized by the recharge of relatively oxic river water the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of iron and manganese were not nearly identical and indicated that their mobility was controlled by one or more mechanisms in addition to advection and dispersion fig 10b and c breakthrough curves of iron and manganese in the down gradient wells are shown in hoss 2022 and they lacked a clear relationship between measured versus expected behavior both iron and manganese showed measured concentrations far below those that would be expected during the time that the signal of the river water was its strongest i e the first 4 days fig 10b and c moreover the redox potential showed an increase during the first 4 days and then decreased to more suboxic levels fig 11 these data strongly suggested that oxidative immobilization of iron and manganese occurred therefore the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was likely oxidized not reduced because reduced uranium would be preferentially oxidized after reduced sulfur concomitantly with reduced iron and before reduced manganese singh et al 2014 thus oxidative dissolution in addition to solely concentration dependent desorption was ruled out as a potential mobilization mechanism of uranium during the recharge of relatively oxic and uranium poor river water it is important to note that the redox state of aqueous phase iron and manganese was assumed to be reduced i e fe ii and mn ii because the oxidized states of these analytes are relatively insoluble 3 4 recovery factors the recovery factors of chloride sulfate and uranium were nearly one in the injection well fig 12 and indicated that no net addition or removal of these solutes to or from the aqueous phase occurred these quantitative results agreed with the visual inspection of their measured versus expected breakthrough curves that were nearly identical figs 8a 10a and 9a in contrast the recovery factors of iron corrected and manganese were 0 2 fig 12 and indicated that a net removal of these solutes from the aqueous phase occurred the corrected recovery factor for iron did not include analysis of two highly questionable perhaps outlier data points of elevated iron near day one and two fig 10b these quantitative results agreed with the visual inspection of their measured versus expected breakthrough curves that showed measured concentrations far below those that would be expected fig 10b and c overall the recovery factors provided an additional line of quantitative evidence to suggest that the mechanisms that controlled the mobility of uranium were no different those those that controlled the mobility of chloride namely advection and dispersion moreover the recovery factors also supported the suggestion that the mobility of both iron and manganese were controlled by oxidative precipitation and that the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was likely oxidized and therefore sorbed in the solid phase 4 conclusions this study elucidated the mobilization mechanisms of uranium during the recharge of oxic river water into a nearby suboxic and uranium contaminated aquifer by conducting and interpreting the results of a field tracer experiment it was hypothesized that oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption and subsequent mobilization of uranium from the aquifer sediments to groundwater would occur during the recharge of river water below the baseflow water table however the data clearly indicated that the mobility of uranium was predominantly controlled by advection and dispersion not dissolution or desorption as evident by nearly identical expected versus measured breakthrough curves i e the mobility of uranium like chloride a non added and non reactive solute were no different however the data strongly suggested that oxidative immobilization of iron and manganese occurred thereby partially ruling out the presence of reduced uranium on the aquifer sediments it is important to note that the redox state of uranium was not measured directly and that oxidative dissolution of reduced uranium may have been rate limited thus the presence of reduced uranium on the aquifer sediments cannot be fully ruled out moreover desorption of oxidized uranium from the aquifer sediments was not solely concentration dependent as evident by the failure of uranium poor river water to desorb and mobilize uranium from uranium rich groundwater and sediments it was possible that the desorption of uranium was limited by the relatively higher ph and lower alkalinity of the river water as compared to the groundwater both factors could slightly favor immobilization however a simpler explanation was that the uranium on the aquifer sediments and below the baseflow water table was associated with a mineral phase as opposed to a sorbed phase thus desorption may not have been possible in conclusion the results of this field tracer study partially ruled out oxidative dissolution of reduced uranium and solely concentration dependent desorption of oxidized uranium and suggested that the mobility of uranium was predominantly controlled by advection and dispersion during the recharge of river water below the baseflow water table future studies would benefit from similar field tracer experiments that simulate the recharge of river water above the baseflow water table and in the normally unsaturated zone because this hydrogeologic compartment may contain a substantial mass of mobilizable uranium via dissolution and or desorption and contribute to an increase in the concentration of uranium in groundwater relative to pre recharge conditions future studies would also benefit from characterizing the mineral phases aqueous complexes and redox states of uranium to better elucidate

1248,the recharge of stream water below the baseflow water table can mobilize groundwater contaminants particularly redox sensitive and sorptive metals such as uranium however in situ tracer experiments that simulate the recharge of stream water to uranium contaminated groundwater are lacking thus limiting the understanding of the potential mechanisms that control the mobility of uranium at the field scale in this study a field tracer test was conducted by injecting 100 gal 379 l of oxic river water into a nearby suboxic and uranium contaminated aquifer the traced river water was monitored for 18 days in the single injection well and in the twelve surrounding observation wells mobilization of uranium from the solid to the aqueous phase was not observed during the tracer test despite its pre test presence being confirmed on the aquifer sediments from lab based acid leaching however strong evidence of oxidative immobilization of iron and manganese was observed during the tracer test and suggested that immobile uranium was likely in its oxidized state as u vi on the aquifer sediments these observations ruled out oxidation of u iv to u vi as a potential mobilization mechanism therefore desorption of u vi appeared to be the predominant potential mobilization mechanism yet it was clearly not solely dependent on concentration as evident when considering that uranium poor river water 0 015 mg l was recharged to uranium rich groundwater 1 mg l it was possible that uranium desorption was limited by the relatively higher ph and lower alkalinity of the river water as compared to the groundwater both factors favor immobilization however it was likely that the immobile uranium was associated with a mineral phase as opposed to a sorbed phase thus desorption may not have been possible the results of this field tracer study successfully ruled out two common mobilization mechanisms of uranium 1 oxidative dissolution and 2 concentration dependent desorption and ruled in the importance of advection dispersion and the mineral phase of uranium keywords uranium tracer groundwater surface water dissolution desorption 1 introduction uranium is an anthropogenic and natural contaminant of concern in local and regional aquifers throughout the united states dwivedi et al 2022 nolan and weber 2015 the mobility of uranium in groundwater is largely controlled by redox conditions and the sorptive capacity of aquifer materials uranium is relatively mobile under oxic conditions and immobile under reducing conditions waseem et al 2015 under oxic conditions uranium is typically in its plus six oxidation state as u vi and can be speciated as positively charged uranyl ion uo2 2 under reducing conditions uranium is typically in its plus four oxidation state as u iv and can be speciated as uraninite mineral uo2 the reduction of uranyl to uraninite can be microbially mediated in the presence of a suitable and sufficient source of organic carbon e g natural organic carbon added lactate ethanol acetate etc singh et al 2014 uraninite is redox sensitive and can be biotically or abiotically oxidized and subsequently mobilized to u vi by dissolved phase oxidants such as oxygen o2 nitrate no3 and nitrite no2 and solid phase oxidants such as manganese mn iv and iron fe iii singh et al 2014 however uranyl can become immobilized by sorption to negatively charged surfaces of aquifer materials such as clays and metal oxides and partition to equilibrium between the solid and aqueous phases coutelot et al 2018 um et al 2007 mobile u vi can also complex with carbonates and calcium under mildly alkaline conditions to form neutral or negatively charged ternary uranium calcium carbonate species dong and brooks 2006 and partition to an equilibrium that favors the mobile aqueous phase as opposed to the immobile solid phase dangelmayr et al 2017 elless and lee 1998 the mobility of u vi in groundwater is also controlled by ph with immobilization by sorption being favored at a ph range of approximately 6 to 10 kaplan et al 1998 langmuir 1978 desorption of u vi is favored at relatively low and high ph in general oxic and alkaline conditions favor the mobilization of uranium in groundwater as compared to anoxic and non alkaline conditions groundwater and surface water such as lakes rivers and streams are inherently connected sophocleous 2002 streams in relatively humid regions are normally recharged by nearby groundwater and are thus termed gaining streams fig 1 however normally gaining streams can temporarily become losing streams during periods when water levels approach flood stage fig 1 often associated with rapid snow melt and or precipitation losing streams can recharge nearby groundwater above and below the pre flood or baseflow water table fig 1 the recharge of stream water to uranium contaminated groundwater can mobilize uranium above and below the baseflow water table fig 1 and lead to an increase in the concentration of uranium relative to pre flood stage conditions dam et al 2015 uranium above the baseflow water table and desorption are thought to be the predominant source and mechanism respectively for relative increases in the concentration of uranium zachara et al 2013 in contrast uranium below the baseflow water table is thought to be primarily diluted by the recharge of uranium poor stream water zachara et al 2016 however it is possible that the effect of dilution of uranium below the baseflow water table can be opposed by oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption paradis et al 2020 both mechanisms mobilize uranium from the solid to the aqueous phase thus the relative contribution of mobile uranium from above and below the baseflow water table during the recharge of stream water can vary considerably depending on the hydrogeologic conditions of the site the pre flood stage concentration of uranium in groundwater during groundwater to river water recharge fig 1 can be given as 1 c o m b o v b o where c o pre flood stage concentration m l3 m b o pre flood stage mass below baseflow water table m and v b o pre flood volume below baseflow water table l3 the flood stage concentration of uranium in groundwater during stream water to groundwater recharge fig 1 can be given as 2 c m b m a v b v a where c flood stage concentration m l3 m b flood stage mass below baseflow water table m v b flood stage volume below baseflow water table l3 m a flood stage mass above baseflow water table m and v a flood stage volume above baseflow water table l3 eqs 1 and 2 can be combined to express the relative concentration of flood stage to pre flood stage uranium in groundwater as 3 c c o v b o m b m a m b o v b o v a eq 3 assumes that the flood stage and pre flood stage volume below the baseflow water table are equal i e that v b v b o a relative increase in the concentration of uranium would require that the numerator to be greater than the denominator in eq 3 both the mass above and below the baseflow water table are in the numerator in eq 3 and are therefore directly proportional to the relative concentration of uranium however determining the relative importance of each mass above and below the baseflow water table during recharge of stream water to uranium contaminated groundwater is an ongoing challenge a study by zachara et al 2013 highlighted the importance of natural stream stage fluctuations on the mobility of uranium in groundwater specifically that u vi can be desorbed above the baseflow water table during high stream stage fig 1 another study by zachara et al 2016 indicated that the effect of natural stream water recharge on the mobility of uranium in groundwater was complex and that advection dilution and the source of uranium either above or below the baseflow water table were likely contributing factors it is important to note that both studies by zachara et al 2013 and 2016 were conducted during natural flow conditions a study by paradis et al 2020 forced the recharge of stream water into a uranium contaminated aquifer below the baseflow water table and suggested that oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption were contributing factors to the mobilization of uranium it is important to note that this study was conducted during forced flow conditions forced flow conditions can lead to relatively high groundwater velocities within the radial vicinity of the injection and extraction wells and underestimate the sorption of a solute as compared to natural flow conditions fenske 1979 and this effect i e velocity dependent sorption has been observed for u vi gamerdinger et al 2001 although these previous studies paradis et al 2020 zachara et al 2016 zachara et al 2013 yielded mechanistic insights into the mobility of uranium in groundwater during stream water recharge there remains a need to conduct studies focused on uranium below the baseflow water table and under natural flow conditions the objective of this study was to elucidate the mobilization mechanisms of uranium during the recharge of relatively oxic and uranium poor river water below the baseflow water table of a relatively suboxic and uranium rich aquifer under natural flow conditions it was hypothesized that uranium would be mobilized via oxidation of u iv and or concentration dependent desorption of u vi to test this hypothesis a tracer based river water to groundwater recharge experiment was conducted under predominantly natural flow conditions at a uranium contaminated site and the results herein successfully elucidated the potential mobilization mechanisms of uranium 2 materials and methods 2 1 site background this study site is in riverton wyoming a detailed history of the site activities and its hydrogeology was provided by dam et al 2015 in brief a uranium milling site operated at the site from 1958 to 1963 and the piling of uranium tailings resulted in the contamination of the shallow unconfined sand and gravel aquifer fig 2 although the tailings were removed decades ago by the united states department of energy concentrations of uranium persist in the shallow aquifer groundwater models predicted that natural flushing would reduce concentrations of uranium below maximum contaminant levels 0 044 mg l by the year 2098 dam et al 2015 however in june of 2010 local rainfall combined with snowmelt produced record stages of the little wind river fig 3 that resulted in both flooding and increases in concentrations of uranium in groundwater dam et al 2015 two additional stages have exceeded the flood stage since 2010 fig 3 interestingly the concentration of uranium in groundwater tends to increase along the flow path from the former tailings area to the downgradient area on the banks of the little wind river fig 2 where they can approach 1 5 mg l dam et al 2015 recommended that additional characterization of solid phase uranium was needed near the little wind river and a subsequent field investigation indicated that concentrations of uranium can approach 5 mg kg nearly 10 times greater than the background concentration on the sands and gravels below the water table fig 2 doe 2016 this investigation also indicated that solid phase uranium was present in naturally reduced zones in an unsaturated silt layer above the saturated sand and gravel aquifer doe 2016 the naturally reduced zone was shown to extend slightly below the water table in a clayey silt that graded into the sand and gravel aquifer doe 2016 several samples of the sand and gravel aquifer below the naturally reduced zone contained elevated levels of uranium doe 2016 therefore it is this specific area of the site the relatively high uranium area below the naturally reducing zone within the saturated sand and gravel aquifer and near the banks of the little wind river fig 2 that is of interest to understanding of the potential mechanisms that control the mobility of uranium during the recharge of relativity oxic and uranium poor river water it should be noted that in addition to the contrast in redox conditions and uranium content of the groundwater and river water the two waters are known to differ in ph and alkalinity the ph of the groundwater tends to be lower than the river water 7 versus 8 5 whereas the alkalinity tends to be higher 500 versus 200 mg l as caco3 doe 2016 2 2 previous tracer test a field tracer test was previously conducted by paradis et al 2022 in the same area of interest as this study fig 2 and was focused on characterizing the physical properties of the uranium contaminated aquifer mainly groundwater velocity and dual porosity paradis et al 2022 estimated that the magnitude of groundwater velocity was approximately 0 60 ft day 0 18 m day and in line with the hydraulic gradient fig 4 and that the aquifer sediments did not demonstrate strong evidence for dual porosity paradis et al 2022 used little wind river water as the tracer injection fluid effectively simulating recharge of river water to contaminated groundwater yet did not focus on characterizing the mobilization mechanisms of uranium however both aquifer sediments and groundwater samples were collected during this previous study and subsequently analyzed for this follow up study 2 3 experimental design the field tracer test was conducted in the summer of 2020 a detailed description of this test was provided by paradis et al 2022 in brief a series of 13 temporary groundwater monitoring wells were installed by direct push screened near the water table and within the uranium contaminated sand and gravel aquifer sediments fig 4 the wells were installed as three transects oriented perpendicular to groundwater flow fig 4 the total distance between the upper and lower transects were no 10 ft 3 m as to allow for the transport of the tracer to be completed within approximately 30 days two solute tracers iodide and pentafluorobenzoate were added to a 100 gal 379 l volume of river water for a target concentration of 500 mg l and injected into up gradient well 1001 using a peristaltic pump under forced gradient conditions for 8 h fig 4 to establish vertical distribution of the tracers the injection well fluid was recirculated in a closed loop during the injection phase the injection phase was followed by sampling and analysis of the tracers in the injection well and the down gradient transects of observation wells under natural gradient conditions for 18 days groundwater samples were collected under low volume and low flow conditions as to not disturb the natural gradient groundwater samples were filtered 0 45 μm preserved on ice 4 c acidified with nitric acid ph 2 when appropriate and shipped weekly to rsi entech llc in grand junction colorado for laboratory analysis of the added tracers iodide and pentafluorobenzoate in addition to that previously described by paradis et al 2022 groundwater samples were analyzed in the laboratory for uranium manganese iron sulfate and chloride uranium was quantified by kinetic phosphorescence analysis chemchek kpa 11 according to method ap u 2 doe 2021 sulfate and chloride were quantified by ion chromatography dionex aquion manganese and iron were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent icp ms 7850 after acidification several groundwater quality parameters were also measured relatively rapidly and in the field these included the following dissolved oxygen ph alkalinity redox potential eh and ferrous iron dissolved oxygen was quantified by hach accuvac ampules using a dr890 colorimeter following hach method 8166 ph and eh were quantified using a ysi 556 mps alkalinity was quantified by titration with 1 6 n sulfuric acid following hach method 8203 ferrous iron was quantified using a dr890 colorimeter following hach method 8146 lastly silt sand and gravel sediment samples were collected from above and below the water table during the installation of the temporary wells and were analyzed in the laboratory for uranium by first leaching with 5 nitric acid following standard batch leaching procedure cb bt 1 doe 2021 and the supernatant was analyzed by kinetic phosphorescence analysis chemchek kpa 11 a 5 nitric acid leaching was used to ensure that all sorbed uranium was mobilized from the contaminated sediments doe 2018 2 4 data analysis the fundamental method of data analysis was to generate measured versus expected concentration versus time or breakthrough curves of potentially reactive solutes e g uranium during the tracer test paradis et al 2019 and then calculate their recovery factors paradis et al 2020 the expected breakthrough curves of solutes were generated using eq 11 from paradis et al 2019 the expected breakthrough curve of a solute is based on the behavior of the added non reactive solute tracer in this case iodide and makes the following assumptions 1 the concentrations of both solutes are equal to their injection concentrations in this case river water at time equal to zero 2 the concentrations of both solutes are equal to their aquifer concentrations in this case groundwater as time reaches infinity and 3 the mobilization mechanisms of both solutes e g advection dispersion and reactivity are no different therefore any difference between the measured concentration and expected concentration of a solute indicates that one or more mobilization mechanism in addition to advection and dispersion e g dissolution or desorption occurred the recovery factors of solutes were generated using eq 3 from paradis et al 2020 the recovery factor is based on the ratio of the area under the measured versus the expected breakthrough curves for example a recovery factor 1 indicates that the potentially reactive solute e g uranium was added to the aqueous phase whereas a recovery factor 1 indicates that the solute was removed a recovery factor equal to 1 indicates no net addition or removal the limits of integration of the measured versus expected breakthrough curves were set to start when the concentration of iodide was equal to or 5 of its injection concentration and end at 5 these limits ensured that only the signal of the river water groundwater mixture was analyzed lastly breakthrough curves of three wells were analyzed as follows injection well 1001 and down gradient observation wells 1005 and 1011 fig 4 these wells had the strongest signal of the added tracers paradis et al 2022 and are the primary wells of interest in this follow up study 2 5 exploratory modeling a very simple finite difference numerical model was constructed to simulate the mobility of uranium during the pulse recharge of river water to contaminated groundwater to visually explore what the breakthrough curves of uranium may look like under the following four scenarios 1 advection and dispersion 2 advection dispersion and first order production oxidative dissolution 3 advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption concentration dependent desorption and 4 advection dispersion first order production oxidative dissolution and linear equilibrium sorption concentration dependent desorption the pulse recharge condition was meant to simulate an ephemeral flood stage event the one dimensional advection dispersion equation with linear equilibrium sorption desorption and first order decay production is as follows 4 r c t d x 2 c x 2 v x c x kc where c concentration m l3 x length l t time t v x velocity l t d x dispersion l2 t r retardation dimensionless and k rate 1 t the initial condition was set equal to the concentration of the solute in groundwater c g as 5 c x t 0 c g the boundary condition at the inlet was set equal to the concentration of the solute in the river water c r during the injection as 6 c x 0 0 t t i c r the boundary condition at the inlet was set equal to the concentration of the solute in the groundwater c g after the injection as 7 c x 0 t t i c g the boundary condition at the outlet was set to a zero concentration flux as 8 c x t x 0 where c g concentration groundwater m l3 c r concentration river water m l3 and t i injection time t eq 4 subject to the initial and boundary conditions in eqs 5 through 8 was solved using an explicit backward difference finite approximation according to the fundamental methodology by wang and anderson 1982 and using microsoft excel by enabling its optional iterative capabilities it is important to note that the boundary condition in eq 7 is somewhat unique in that there is no analytical solution in the literature under such condition goltz and huang 2017 hence the need to construct a numerical model the model was assigned the following parameters temporal step 0 1 days spatial step 0 1 ft 3 0 cm v x 0 60 ft day 0 18 m day d x 0 060 ft2 day 0 006 m2 day t i 2 days c g uranium 1 mg l and c r uranium 0 mg l the temporal and spatial discretization i e steps were determined by peclet and courant numbers respectively equal to or less than one the physical parameters v x d x concentrations of uranium c r c g and the injection time t i were approximated based on the previous study by paradis et al 2022 r was set to 1 for uranium for scenarios 1 and 2 no desorption and 1 5 for scenarios 3 and 4 yes desorption k was set to 0 for a generic oxidant for scenarios 1 and 3 no production and 0 15 days for scenarios 2 and 3 yes production because the production of uranium was dependent on the decay of the oxidant 3 results and discussion 3 1 pre test geochemistry concentrations of uranium on the aquifer sediments above and below the water table and within the tracer test location fig 4 ranged from 0 31 to 5 84 mg kg table s1 these data indicated that solid phase uranium was spatially variable with concentrations less than and up to ten times greater than the background concentration of approximately 0 5 mg kg doe 2016 a visual inspection of the data along the groundwater flow path a to a in fig 4 and in profile view indicated that concentrations of uranium on the aquifer sediments above the water table and in the silts were greater than those below the water table and in the silts sands and gravels fig 5 however concentrations of uranium on the relatively permeable sand and gravel aquifer sediments below the water table ranged from approximately 0 3 to 3 mg kg fig 5 moreover concentrations of uranium on the sands and gravels ranged from approximately 1 to 5 mg kg just 30 ft 9 m down gradient from the third transect fig 4 at the location of permanent monitoring well 855 doe 2016 therefore the data from this study and previous studies doe 2016 indicated that concentrations of uranium on the sand and gravel aquifer sediments below the water table and within the vicinity of the tracer test location were spatially variable and can greatly exceed background levels concentrations of uranium in groundwater and within the tracer test location ranged from 1 01 to 1 17 mg l fig 6 and table s2 these data indicated that aqueous phase uranium was spatially uniform and much greater than background concentrations of 0 0042 mg l doe 2016 the redox potential of groundwater ranged from approximately 162 to 340 mv fig 6 and table s2 these data indicated that redox conditions were spatially variable and spanned the general range of manganese reducing 500 mv iron reducing 100 mv and uranium reducing 0 mv but were above strongly reducing e g sulfate reducing 200 mv and methanogenic 300 mv singh et al 2014 these data also indicated that redox conditions were increasingly reducing along the groundwater flow path a to a in fig 4 from transect one to two to three fig 6 the alkalinity and ph were relatively uniform spatially with an average of 561 mg l as caco3 and 7 16 respectively fig 6 and table s2 these data indicated that the groundwater was relatively alkaline with a circumneutral ph specific concentrations of uranium in the primary wells of interest herein referred to as the test wells i e injection well 1001 in transect one and down gradient wells 1005 and 1011 in transects two and three respectively fig 4 were approximately 1 mg l whereas the concentration of uranium in the river water injection fluid was 0 015 mg l table 1 these data indicated that the test wells were uranium rich and that the river water was uranium poor and suggested that the recharge of river water could mobilize uranium from the aquifer sediments to the groundwater due to concentration dependent desorption concentrations of chloride were approximately 50 times greater in the test wells as compared to the river water table 1 chloride like the added tracer iodide is a halide and has long been utilized as a non reactive tracer davis et al 1985 thus chloride could serve as a non added tracer that like uranium is concentration rich in the groundwater and concentration poor in the river water however the mobility of chloride unlike uranium could serve as a tracer for non reactive advective and dispersive transport the specific water quality parameters of the test wells and the river water were in notable contrast specifically in redox potential dissolved oxygen ph and alkalinity table 1 the river water was relatively oxidizing as compared to the test wells as evident by higher redox potential and dissolved oxygen that approached saturation 7 to 9 mg l table 1 these data suggested that the recharge of river water could oxidize and mobilize reduced species of uranium from the aquifer sediments the river water was also relatively higher in ph and lower in alkalinity as compared to the test wells table 1 and suggested that recharge of river water could slightly favor immobilization in summary the primary potential mechanisms that could mobilize uranium during the recharge of river water were concentration dependent desorption and oxidative dissolution whereas ph and alkalinity dependent sorption could slightly favor immobilization 3 2 model simulated breakthrough curves the simulated breakthrough curve of uranium in a down gradient observation well during the pulse recharge of up gradient uranium poor river water to uranium rich groundwater showed an inverted bell shaped curve with an upper and lower bound of the groundwater and river water concentration respectively for advection and dispersion fig 7 the breakthrough curve with advection dispersion and production i e oxidative dissolution showed a similar mean arrival time as compared to the breakthrough curve with advection and dispersion yet with a notably increased area under the curve fig 7 the relatively greater area under the curve with oxidative dissolution indicated that uranium mass was mobilized to the aqueous phase the breakthrough curve with advection dispersion and linear equilibrium sorption i e concentration dependent desorption showed a similar area under the curve as compared to the breakthrough curve with advection and dispersion yet with a notably delayed mean arrival time fig 7 the relatively delayed mean arrival time with concentration dependent desorption indicated that uranium mass was desorbed as the leading edge of uranium poor river water was recharged and that uranium mass was sorbed as the tailing edge of uranium poor river water was followed by recharge of uranium rich groundwater the breakthrough curve with advection dispersion dissolution and desorption sorption showed both greater area under the curve and a delayed mean arrival time as compared to the breakthrough curve with advection and dispersion fig 7 these simulations suggested that both potential mobilization mechanisms of uranium i e dissolution and desorption could be visually identified in the breakthrough curve data during the pulse recharge of uranium poor river water if the mobility due to advection and dispersion alone were known hence chloride could serve as a non added and non reactive tracer to represent advective and dispersive mobility from which to elucidate dissolution and or desorption of uranium 3 3 data driven breakthrough curves 3 3 1 chloride the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of chloride were nearly identical in all three wells fig 8 the breakthrough curves were also bound in lower concentration by the river water and upper concentration by the groundwater fig 8 the signal of the river water as indicated by the start and end of integration was relatively strong at the injection well 1001 and gradually decreased in strength and increased in mean arrival time at the down gradient wells 1005 and 1011 fig 8 these results indicated that the mobility of chloride was no different than the added tracer iodide and that the assumptions of the data analysis method by paradis et al 2019 were valid i e the mobility of chloride which is naturally present at relatively high concentrations in the groundwater table 1 was controlled by non reactive advective and dispersive transport moreover visual inspection of the breakthrough curve at down gradient well 1005 fig 8b located approximately three feet one meter in distance from the up gradient injection well 1001 fig 4 suggested that the mean arrival time of the river water was approximately four to five days this equates to a one dimensional average linear groundwater velocity of approximately 0 67 ft day 0 20 m day and was in excellent agreement with the two dimensional velocity of 0 60 ft day 0 18 m day paradis et al 2022 lastly the breakthrough curve at down gradient well 1005 fig 8b looked very similar in the general shape and bounds to the simulated breakthrough curve of a pulsed solute whose mobility was controlled by advection and dispersion alone fig 7 in summary the mobility of relatively highly concentrated chloride in groundwater was non reactive and controlled by advection and dispersion when recharged with river water 3 3 2 uranium the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of uranium like chloride were nearly identical in all three wells fig 9 these results indicated that the mobility of uranium was no different than the added tracer iodide and the non added tracer chloride thus the mobility of relatively highly concentrated uranium in groundwater table 1 was non reactive and controlled by advection and dispersion when recharged with river water these results were not expected it was hypothesized that oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption and subsequent mobilization of uranium would occur during recharge of relatively oxic and uranium poor river water table 1 however the data clearly indicated that uranium was not mobilized fig 9 it is important to note that the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was not known i e uranium may or may not have been in its reduced state if the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was indeed reduced it would be expected that the recharge of relatively oxic river water would sequentially oxidize reduced sulfur uranium iron and manganese bearing species and result in the sequential mobilization of sulfate and uranium and immobilization of iron and manganese singh et al 2014 since the mobilization of uranium was not observed it was possible that reduced sulfur bearing species completely consumed the oxidative capacity of the river water and left reduced uranium bearing species immobilized paradis et al 2016 if this were true then it would be expected that the mobilization of sulfate would have occurred and that reduced iron and manganese like uranium would be non reactive if this were false then it would be expected that sulfate like uranium would be non reactive and immobilization of reduced iron and manganese would have occurred therefore the mobility of sulfate ferrous iron and reduced manganese can elucidate the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments these results are shown and discussed in the next section in terms of concentration dependent desorption it is important to note that the concentration of uranium on the aquifer sediments is sensitive to the relative aggressiveness of the laboratory method malov et al 2021 yanase et al 1991 e g carbonate leach removes loosely sorbed uranium 5 nitric leach removes all sorbed and possibly some mineral uranium microwave extraction removes all sorbed and likely some mineral uranium or total digestion removes all sorbed and mineral uranium doe 2018 a 5 nitric leach was used in this study and it is possible that this method removed uranium associated with mineral grains as opposed to sorbed uranium thus solely concentration dependent desorption may not have been possible however the ph of the river water was slightly higher than the groundwater and the alkalinity of the river water was substantially lower than the groundwater table 1 both factors can favor sorption of uranium dangelmayr et al 2017 elless and lee 1998 kaplan et al 1998 langmuir 1978 therefore it is possible that the ph and alkalinity of the river water opposed the concentration dependent desorption and resulted in no desorption of uranium it is also possible and arguably more likely that the uranium on the aquifer sediments and below the baseflow water table fig 5 was associated with a mineral phase as opposed to a sorbed phase thus desorption may not have been possible nevertheless solely concentration dependent desorption was also ruled out as a potential mobilization mechanism as evident by the non reactive mobility of uranium during the recharge of uranium poor river water to uranium rich groundwater and sediments fig 9 it should be noted that the kinetics of oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption of uranium were assumed to be observable within the time scale of the experiments i e several days however the kinetics of uranium reactivity that influence its mobility from the solid to the aqueous phase can vary considerably based on site specific biogeochemical conditions zachara et al 2013 thus rate limited oxidation and or desorption of uranium cannot be ruled out it should also be noted that colloid facilitated transport of uranium malkovsky et al 2020 was not a focus of this study thus uranium bearing colloids greater in size than 0 45 μm may have been retained but not quantified on the groundwater filters 3 3 3 sulfate iron and manganese the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of sulfate like uranium were nearly identical in the injection well fig 10a breakthrough curves of sulfate in the down gradient wells are shown in hoss 2022 and they demonstrated very similar measured versus expected behavior these results suggested that reduced sulfur bearing species were not present in the aquifer sediments or groundwater because they would be oxidized and mobilized by the recharge of relatively oxic river water the measured versus expected breakthrough curves of iron and manganese were not nearly identical and indicated that their mobility was controlled by one or more mechanisms in addition to advection and dispersion fig 10b and c breakthrough curves of iron and manganese in the down gradient wells are shown in hoss 2022 and they lacked a clear relationship between measured versus expected behavior both iron and manganese showed measured concentrations far below those that would be expected during the time that the signal of the river water was its strongest i e the first 4 days fig 10b and c moreover the redox potential showed an increase during the first 4 days and then decreased to more suboxic levels fig 11 these data strongly suggested that oxidative immobilization of iron and manganese occurred therefore the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was likely oxidized not reduced because reduced uranium would be preferentially oxidized after reduced sulfur concomitantly with reduced iron and before reduced manganese singh et al 2014 thus oxidative dissolution in addition to solely concentration dependent desorption was ruled out as a potential mobilization mechanism of uranium during the recharge of relatively oxic and uranium poor river water it is important to note that the redox state of aqueous phase iron and manganese was assumed to be reduced i e fe ii and mn ii because the oxidized states of these analytes are relatively insoluble 3 4 recovery factors the recovery factors of chloride sulfate and uranium were nearly one in the injection well fig 12 and indicated that no net addition or removal of these solutes to or from the aqueous phase occurred these quantitative results agreed with the visual inspection of their measured versus expected breakthrough curves that were nearly identical figs 8a 10a and 9a in contrast the recovery factors of iron corrected and manganese were 0 2 fig 12 and indicated that a net removal of these solutes from the aqueous phase occurred the corrected recovery factor for iron did not include analysis of two highly questionable perhaps outlier data points of elevated iron near day one and two fig 10b these quantitative results agreed with the visual inspection of their measured versus expected breakthrough curves that showed measured concentrations far below those that would be expected fig 10b and c overall the recovery factors provided an additional line of quantitative evidence to suggest that the mechanisms that controlled the mobility of uranium were no different those those that controlled the mobility of chloride namely advection and dispersion moreover the recovery factors also supported the suggestion that the mobility of both iron and manganese were controlled by oxidative precipitation and that the redox state of uranium on the aquifer sediments was likely oxidized and therefore sorbed in the solid phase 4 conclusions this study elucidated the mobilization mechanisms of uranium during the recharge of oxic river water into a nearby suboxic and uranium contaminated aquifer by conducting and interpreting the results of a field tracer experiment it was hypothesized that oxidative dissolution and or concentration dependent desorption and subsequent mobilization of uranium from the aquifer sediments to groundwater would occur during the recharge of river water below the baseflow water table however the data clearly indicated that the mobility of uranium was predominantly controlled by advection and dispersion not dissolution or desorption as evident by nearly identical expected versus measured breakthrough curves i e the mobility of uranium like chloride a non added and non reactive solute were no different however the data strongly suggested that oxidative immobilization of iron and manganese occurred thereby partially ruling out the presence of reduced uranium on the aquifer sediments it is important to note that the redox state of uranium was not measured directly and that oxidative dissolution of reduced uranium may have been rate limited thus the presence of reduced uranium on the aquifer sediments cannot be fully ruled out moreover desorption of oxidized uranium from the aquifer sediments was not solely concentration dependent as evident by the failure of uranium poor river water to desorb and mobilize uranium from uranium rich groundwater and sediments it was possible that the desorption of uranium was limited by the relatively higher ph and lower alkalinity of the river water as compared to the groundwater both factors could slightly favor immobilization however a simpler explanation was that the uranium on the aquifer sediments and below the baseflow water table was associated with a mineral phase as opposed to a sorbed phase thus desorption may not have been possible in conclusion the results of this field tracer study partially ruled out oxidative dissolution of reduced uranium and solely concentration dependent desorption of oxidized uranium and suggested that the mobility of uranium was predominantly controlled by advection and dispersion during the recharge of river water below the baseflow water table future studies would benefit from similar field tracer experiments that simulate the recharge of river water above the baseflow water table and in the normally unsaturated zone because this hydrogeologic compartment may contain a substantial mass of mobilizable uranium via dissolution and or desorption and contribute to an increase in the concentration of uranium in groundwater relative to pre recharge conditions future studies would also benefit from characterizing the mineral phases aqueous complexes and redox states of uranium to better elucidate the mechanisms of uranium mobility and to inform more accurate predictive modeling of the natural attenuation rate of uranium in groundwater author statement charles j paradis conducted the data

1249,temporal variations in the chemistry of infiltrating water into the subsurface are known to cause remobilization of colloids from the grain surfaces thereby increasing the travel distance of the colloidal contaminants hence it is essential to thoroughly understand the transport deposition and release mechanisms of colloids in the subsurface through laboratory experiments and modeling there are only a few experiments in which the chemistry of inflow water is changed rapidly during colloid transport also although some models have been presented for simulating the effect of transient chemistry on the fate of colloids there is no consensus in this regard as the proposed models suffer from shortcomings in this study we systematically investigated the effect of temporal variations in ionic strength on the remobilization of deposited colloids in saturated porous media through laboratory column experiments and numerical modeling four sets of column experiments were performed in which we injected carboxylate modified latex colloids at a given ionic strength for a specified period after breakthrough of colloids the ionic strength of inflowing water was decreased in a stepwise manner to 0 mm di water the initial ionic strength values of the four experiments were 100 50 25 and 10 mm we observed partial release of deposited colloids after several steps of ionic strength decrease with significant release observed only when the ionic strength was reduced to below 10 mm we also found that the fraction of released colloids decreased with increasing value of initial ionic strength of inflow water we have developed a mathematical model incorporating a novel formulation for ionic strength dependent deposition and release the model is found to capture the colloid breakthrough curves reasonably well for all experiments with the same set of parameter values except the one at the initial ionic strength of 25 mm keywords colloids transients ionic strength remobilization porous media modeling introduction groundwater is the major source of drinking water for the majority of rural and urban population carrard et al 2020 colloidal particles such as silica clays and metal oxides are naturally present in the subsurface apart from this colloidal contaminants such as pathogenic microorganisms and engineered nanoparticles enter the subsurface through various anthropogenic activities powelson et al 1993 bundschuh et al 2018 rapid infiltration due to rain events and artificial recharge of groundwater cause physical and chemical perturbations in the subsurface these lead to the colloids previously deposited on soil surface to get remobilized causing recontamination of the groundwater resources hence it is necessary to understand the colloid transport deposition and remobilization mechanisms in the subsurface to protect drinking water wells from contamination colloid deposition mechanisms in porous media are usually studied using packed soil columns in the laboratory numerous studies on colloid transport are reported in the literature in which experiments were performed under steady state flow and constant chemistry conditions elimelech and o melia 1990 sadeghi et al 2011 wan and wilson 1994 wang et al 2012 colloid transport models under steady state flow and chemistry conditions have been around for a long time and are straight forward bradford and bettahar 2005 li and johnson 2005 sasidharan et al 2017 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2011 torkzaban et al 2008 they include terms for advection dispersion attachment detachment and straining some complications such as aggregation kinetics can be added katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 however an important phenomenon is temporal variations in chemistry which significantly affects colloid transport behavior a relatively lesser number of studies have dealt with the effect of temporal variations in chemistry on colloid remobilization and deposition in porous media some examples are bradford et al 2015 cheng and saiers 2009 lenhart and saiers 2003 torkzaban et al 2015 tosco et al 2009 wang et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2013 experimental studies have observed a spike release of colloids from soil due to decrease in ionic strength beyond a threshold value bradford et al 2012 lenhart and saiers 2003 tosco et al 2009 torkzaban et al 2010 sadeghi et al 2013 found that a spike release of colloids occurred even though the ionic strength was constant but calcium ions were replaced with sodium ions colloid deposition and release from the grain surface is governed by colloid soil interaction forces transients in chemistry results in changes in interaction energy which promotes release of attached colloids for example decreases in ionic strength increases the energy barrier between the colloids and solid surface resulting in detachment of attached colloids from soil grains fang et al 2013 johnson et al 2010 torkzaban et al 2007 colloid release under transient chemistry conditions is simulated by coupling the governing equations for colloid transport and solution chemistry the effect of chemistry has been taken into account by assuming the colloid detachment rate coefficient to be an empirical function of solution chemistry lenhart and saiers 2003 tosco et al 2009 or using models with a one adsorption site equilibrium or kinetic or two adsorption sites equilibrium and kinetic or two kinetic bradford et al 2012 bradford et al 2015 lenhart and saiers 2003 assumed heterogeneous colloidal population and modelled colloid release by dividing the immobile colloidal phase into a number of compartments each compartment releasing colloids at its own critical salt concentration the model performance was evaluated by fitting the breakthrough curves obtained from experiments in which the ionic strength was reduced in a stepwise manner from an initial ionic strength of 100 mm to 0 mm di water a good match between the simulated and experimental results was observed however when the estimated parameters at an initial ionic strength of 100 mm were used to predict the colloid release curves obtained from experiments with initial ionic strengths of 40 mm and 10 mm the model overestimated the release peaks for 10 mm initial ionic strength and the declining limb of breakthrough curves for initial ionic strengths of 40 mm and 10 mm tosco et al 2009 coupled dual site colloid and solute transport models with the attachment and detachment rate coefficients expressed as empirical functions of ionic strength through critical deposition and release concentrations they performed several sets of experiments with different initial ionic strengths and the subsequent release of the colloids was initiated by decreasing the ionic strength to 0 mm di water since all experiments were performed at the same physicochemical conditions except the difference in the initial ionic strength one would expect model parameters including the critical deposition and release ionic strengths to remain the same however they fitted different experimental sets separately in order to obtain a good fit between observed and simulated data and thus obtained different sets of parameter values for different experiments bradford et al 2012 developed a dual permeability model for colloid transport and release under transient ionic strength conditions in which the detachment term was mechanistically modelled based on a balance of hydrodynamic and adhesive torques bradford et al 2015 developed equilibrium kinetic and combined equilibrium and kinetic models to describe colloid release under transient ionic strength or ph conditions they linked the amount of colloid release to the fractional solid surface area that contributed to retention where the fractional solid surface area was estimated experimentally from mass balance information however they use different functions for colloid release for different boundary conditions and the mechanisms during steady state and transient chemical conditions were treated independent of each other also this model did not account for the re deposition of remobilized colloids the foregoing short review of the literature indicates that further research is needed to develop a model that is valid under a variety of conditions without re estimating the model parameter values the objectives of this study are a to develop a mathematical model that is capable of simulating the fate of colloids in saturated porous media when there are temporal variations in ionic strength for a wide range of ionic strengths with a consistent set of parameter values and b to systematically evaluate the performance of the model through comparison with experiments four sets of column experiments were performed in which colloids were deposited at four different ionic strengths followed by decreasing the ionic strength in a stepwise manner at the column inlet to 0 mm the experimental data was further simulated using a mathematical model which accounted for ionic strength dependent colloid deposition and release 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous medium colloids and background electrolyte natural river sand with grain size between 425 and 600 μm representative of sandy aquifers bales et al 1997 tan et al 1994 was used as the porous medium for performing column experiments the sand was acid washed prior to packing it into the column to remove metal oxides and organic impurities from the grain surface acid washing involved the following sequential steps kohler et al 1996 sasidharan et al 2014 soaking the sand in 37 hcl for three days washing with di water and then washing in naoh for 2 h in a shaker after this the sand was thoroughly rinsed with di water and oven dried at 105 c for 5 h the efficiency of the acid washing procedure in removing the metal oxides and organic impurities was determined by analyzing the sand samples before and after acid treatment using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry the detailed procedure for determining the metal content of the sand is given in appendix a1 carboxylate modified latex cml beads of size 1 μm thermo fisher scientific pvt ltd were used as colloidal particles in this study sodium chloride was used for preparing background electrolyte at various ionic strengths of 100 50 25 10 1 and 0 1 mm ph of the background electrolyte was adjusted to 7 by addition of 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 m naoh injection colloidal suspension of concentration 7 3 107 no ml was prepared by diluting the stock in the background electrolyte at the desired ionic strength the colloidal suspension was sonicated for 20 min in an ultra sonicator branson ultrasonics before injecting it into the column to ensure a uniform dispersion of colloids the zeta potentials of cml colloids and sand at various ionic strengths were measured using a zeta sizer malvern analytical instruments the zeta potential of the sand was measured after crushing it into fine powder and suspending it in the background electrolyte bergendahl and grasso 1999 treumann et al 2014 2 2 column experiments column experiments were performed in acrylic columns with 2 5 cm inner diameter and 15 cm length the top and bottom ends of the column were equipped with stainless steel meshes to prevent the entry of sand into the inlet and outlet pipes and to maintain a uniform distribution of flow throughout the cross section of the column the column was placed vertically and wet packed with acid washed sand in increments of 1 cm along with tapping from the sides to maintain a tight uniform packing of solid grains the porosity and bulk density of the sand were measured to be 0 37 and 1 67 g cm3 respectively the bottom end of the column was connected to a peristaltic pump which maintained a constant upflow rate of 1 ml min throughout the experiment it is known that the column orientation and hence gravity has an important role in colloid deposition with particle deposition rates being greater in the up flow than in the down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 however the density of cml colloids 1 055 g cm3 is similar to that of water and hence the gravity effects can be considered negligible in this study the packed column was flushed with ten pore volumes pvs of di water additional experiments described below show that natural colloids were not present in the effluent after this a tracer experiment was performed by passing 3 pvs of 100 mm nacl followed by 3 pvs of di water effluent samples were collected from the column outlet at 6 min intervals and analyzed for nacl concentration using an electrical conductivity meter next the sand packed column was equilibrated with background electrolyte at the desired ionic strength for 10 pvs finally colloid transport experiments were performed each colloid transport experiment consisted of three stages stages 1 2 correspond to transport under steady state chemistry condition at a constant ionic strength whereas stage 3 corresponds to transient chemistry conditions due to a step decrease in the ionic strength of the inflowing solution in stage 1 colloid deposition under steady state chemistry condition the inflow solution had a constant ionic strength and colloid concentration colloidal suspension in the reservoir was stirred frequently to prevent particle aggregation and settling after exactly three pore volumes in stage 2 colloid elution under steady state chemistry condition the inflow was switched to a colloid free solution without any change of flow rate and ionic strength in stage 3 transient chemistry the ionic strength of inflow solution was decreased in a stepwise manner to di water 0 mm without any change of the flow rate each step decrease in ionic strength was applied for 3 pvs except for the last step for which several pvs of di water was applied effluent samples were collected from the column outlet at 6 min intervals and analyzed for colloid concentration using turbidity meter four sets of transient experiments 1 2 3 4 were performed in this study each corresponding to a different initial ionic strength in stages 1 2 as given in table 1 for example experiment 1 was performed at an ionic strength of 100 mm in stages 1 2 followed by a stepwise sequential reduction in ionic strength to 50 mm 25 mm 10 mm 1 mm 0 1 mm and 0 mm di water in stage 3 in addition to the above four experiments which involved all three stages experiments 5 6 and 7 were performed at stages 1 and 2 only table 1 at ionic strengths of 1 mm 0 1 mm and 0 mm di water respectively to understand the colloid deposition behavior under constant chemistry at these ionic strengths each experiment was repeated three times to check the reproducibility of the experimental results the above set of four release experiments was also performed including all three stages but in the absence of cml colloids to measure the release of natural colloids from the soil grains during transient chemistry conditions we did not find any natural colloids leaching from the soil into the effluent finally three additional experiments were performed in which we measured the colloid retention profile along the soil column experiments 8a 8b and 8c in table 1 this was done for an initial ionic strength of 50 mm at the following stages at the end of stage 2 experiment 8a after three step decreases of ionic strength from 50 mm to 1 mm experiment 8b and after four step decreases of ionic strength from 50 mm to 0 1 mm experiment 8c each of the above trials consisted of dissecting the soil inside the column at the end of the experiment into approximately 1 cm long sections the mass of colloids retained on the sand in each section was then determined by first adding 20 ml of di water to sand followed by gentle shaking to release the colloids into the suspension bradford et al 2007 torkzaban et al 2008 the suspension was then allowed to stand for 15 min for the sand particles to settle after that the colloid concentration in the supernatant was measured colloid retention profile is then plotted as the mass of colloids retained per mass of soil in each section versus distance from the inlet 2 3 interaction energy calculation the total interaction energy between colloid and grain surface was calculated using dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1941 verwey and overbeek 1948 as the sum of london van der waals energy electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion energy assuming a sphere plate interaction ryan and elimelech 1996 the total interaction energy φ dlvo between colloid and grain surface is given as 1 φ dlvo k b t φ vdw k b t φ edl k b t φ born k b t where φ vdw ml2t 2 is the van der waals energy φ edl ml2t 2 is electrostatic double layer energy φ born ml2t 2 is the born repulsion energy k b ml2t 2k 1 is boltzmann constant and t k is temperature the van der waals energy was calculated using the expressions given by gregory 1981 and weroński and elimelech 2008 the electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion energy were calculated using expressions given by hogg healy fuerstenau hogg et al 1966 and ruckenstein and prieve 1976 respectively the detailed description of the calculation of van der waals energy electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion energy are given in appendix a2 3 mathematical model 3 1 governing equations the ionic strength variation in the column during stage 3 was simulated by solving one dimensional advection dispersion equation as follows 2 i t d l 2 i z 2 v i z where i molar is ionic strength dl l 2t 1 is the dispersion coefficient and v lt 1 is the average pore water velocity colloid transport was simulated by one dimensional advection dispersion equation modified to account for deposition and release as 3 c t ρ b θ s t d l 2 c z 2 v c z where c ml 3 is colloid concentration in aqueous phase ρ b ml 3 is the bulk density of soil θ is the porosity of soil and s mm 1 is the mass fraction of colloids attached to soil grains during the preliminary fitting of the colloid breakthrough data from stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 we tried various models including one site kinetic model and two site kinetic model with site 1 being reversible and site 2 being irreversible we found that the two site kinetic model with reversible deposition at site 1 and irreversible deposition at site 2 fitted the data well however the values of attachment and detachment rate coefficients for site 1 were very large which indicates that site 1 is a fast or equilibrium site and site 2 is a slow or kinetic site so the colloid deposition on the grain surface was described using a two site model eqs 4a 4c with sites 1 and 2 representing equilibrium and kinetic sites respectively this model gave the same fitting as that of the two site kinetic model moreover we assume that the colloids attached to the kinetic sites are affected by the change of ionic strength during stage 3 the governing equations for adsorption are 4a s 1 f k d c 4b ρ b θ s 2 t 1 f k a c ρ b θ k d s 2 ρ b θ k d h 0 i t s 2 4c s s 1 s 2 here s 1 mm 1 is the mass fraction of colloids attached to site 1 mass of colloids attached to site 1 per unit mass of dry soil s 2 mm 1 is the mass fraction of colloids attached to site 2 mass of colloids attached to site 2 per unit mass of dry soil f is the fraction of sites in equilibrium with the liquid phase k d m 1l3 is the equilibrium distribution coefficient k a t 1 and k d t 1 are the rate coefficients of attachment and detachment of colloids to the kinetic site k d t 1 is the rate coefficient for the release of colloids from kinetic site during transients in ionic strength and h 0 i t is the heaviside step function defined as 5 h 0 i t 1 i t 0 0 i t 0 the colloid release rate coefficient during transients in ionic strength was expressed as k d k d 0 1 i i c β where k d 0 t 1 is the maximum value of release rate coefficient which occurs at zero ionic strength i c molar is the critical ionic strength below which the release is fast and β is a constant tosco et al 2009 we observed from stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 that the values of the rate coefficients k d k a k d and f depend on ionic strength coefficients k a and k d were found to increase with increase in ionic strength whereas k d and f decrease with increase in ionic strength hence the colloid deposition parameters change during transients in ionic strength stage 3 and therefore it is important to account for the effect of ionic strength variation on colloid deposition parameters in the model we tried various functions for relating k d k a k d and f to ionic strength and found the following formulas to give us the best fit 6 k d a 1 i 2 a 2 i a 3 7 k a b 1 i 2 b 2 i b 3 8 k d d 1 exp d 2 i 9 f e 1 exp e 2 i where a i b i c j and d j i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 are the coefficients whose values were estimated from the experimental data given in table 3 eqs 2 9 represent the complete set of equations governing the transport of colloids in porous media they were solved by imposing the following initial and boundary conditions 10 i z 0 i 0 c z 0 s 1 z 0 s 2 z 0 0 11 i 0 t i 0 t t 2 i 1 t 2 t t 31 i i t 3 i 1 t t 3 i i 1 2 3 12 c 0 t c 0 t t 1 0 t t 1 13 i z l t c z l t 0 here i 0 is the initial value of ionic strength of the background electrolyte in the soil before starting colloid transport experiments t 1 is the duration of injection of colloidal suspension at the inlet of the column in stage 1 t 2 is time till the end of stage 2 i 1 is the ionic strength at the column inlet for first step decrease in ionic strength at the start of stage 3 t 31 is the time till the end of first step decrease in ionic strength i i is the ionic strength at the column inlet for i th step decrease in ionic strength in stage 3 t 3i is the time till the end of i th step decrease in ionic strength and i is the number of steps of ionic strength reduction eq 10 indicates that the initial value of ionic strength in the liquid phase was i 0 and there were no colloids present in the liquid and solid phases initially the governing eqs 2 9 subject to the initial and boundary conditions eqs 10 13 were solved numerically using comsol multiphysics software version 5 5 there may be many other mechanisms influencing the colloid release that are not included here doing so would require many more data for evaluating the model for example a relevant mechanism is release of attached colloids as aggregates after sudden changes in ionic strength and their subsequent straining in the downstream pores the model performance could be improved by including aggregation kinetics and straining during the release however including such a mechanism in the model will be useful only if data required for evaluating corresponding parameters is available 3 2 fitting procedure the model contains eqs 2 9 eight unknown parameters d l f k d k a k d k d 0 i c and β whose values were estimated by fitting different stages of the tracer and colloid transport breakthrough curves as explained below first the dispersion coefficient d l was estimated by fitting the tracer breakthrough data with advection dispersion equation colloids were assumed to have the same dispersivity as that of the tracer colloid dispersivity has been found to be size dependent chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 and can be different from the dispersivity of tracer chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 observed a positive correlation between colloid dispersivity and its size however for simplicity we have assumed the dispersivity of colloid to be the same as that of the tracer as a result the dispersivity of colloids may be underestimated in this work the value of f at a given ionic strength was estimated as the fraction of injected colloids recovered in the effluent in steady state stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 this is reasonable as the value of detachment rate coefficient at the kinetic site during stages 1 and 2 is negligibly small then the colloid breakthrough curve from stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 were fitted with eq 3 4 to estimate the values of k d k a and k d at different ionic strengths this resulted in a list of values of k d k a and k d at different values of ionic strengths these values were then fitted with eqs 6 9 respectively to estimate the values of a i b i d j and e j where i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 following this step colloid breakthrough curve from stage 3 of experiment 1 was fitted with eqs 3 5 to estimate the values of k d 0 i c and β since k d 0 i c and β are constant for a given combination of colloid type soil type and hydraulic conditions the estimated values of these parameters from experiment 1 were then used to simulate the breakthrough curves in stage 3 of experiments 2 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 interaction energy profile the zeta potentials of cml colloids and sand at various ionic strengths and the corresponding depths and distances of primary and secondary minima are given in table 2 fig 1 shows the interaction energy profile between cml colloids and grain surface at different ionic strengths there h l is the separation distance between colloid and grain surface and a l is the colloid radius the interaction energy profile at 100 mm is characterized by a deep primary minimum with a negligible energy barrier fig 1 and hence the conditions at 100 mm were favourable for deposition at other ionic strengths energy profiles are characterized by a secondary minimum and an energy barrier fig 1 and table 2 indicating unfavourable conditions for deposition the depth of the secondary minimum increased from 0 00013 k b t to 9 71 k b t as ionic strength increased from 0 1 mm to 100 mm table 2 thereby increasing the potential for colloid retention at secondary minimum 4 2 colloid deposition during steady state ionic strength stages 1 and 2 of column experiments experimental and model fitted breakthrough curves of colloids at various ionic strengths 100 50 25 10 1 0 1 mm and di water during stages 1 and 2 of column experiments are given in fig 2 the developed model fitted the experimental breakthrough curves reasonably well fig 2 the experimental mass balance information and the values of fitted parameters are given in table 3 it is clear from fig 2 and table 3 that colloid retention in soil increased with increasing ionic strength this can be attributed to deeper secondary minimum at higher ionic strengths table 2 these findings are in line with the estimated values of k a and k d which showed increasing and decreasing trends respectively with increasing ionic strength as given in table 3 the fraction of equilibrium sites increased with decreasing ionic strength table 3 the estimated values of f k d k a and k d were then used to find values of constants in eqs 6 9 that relate these parameters to ionic strength the resulting values are reported in table 4 4 3 colloid release during transients in ionic strength stage 3 of column experiments figs 3 to 6 show the colloid release curves during stage 3 of column experiments 1 to 4 respectively colloid release curves during transients in ionic strength are characterized by sharp peaks followed by long tails with the time to peak coinciding with the time of arrival of the ionic strength front at the column outlet figs 3 6 this is in line with the observations reported in literature for cml colloids bradford and kim 2012 bradford et al 2015 torkzaban et al 2010 tosco et al 2009 it can also be seen from figs 3 6 that the amount of spike release during a given step decrease in ionic strength in stage 3 depends on the history of colloid deposition and release significant spike release of deposited colloids was observed only at the step when ionic strength was decreased from 10 mm to 1 mm and smaller table 3 this could be due to the release of attached colloids from the tips of asperities at lower ionic strengths shen et al 2018 this indicates that there may exist a critical ionic strength between 10 and 1 mm below which the spike release is significant as no significant release of colloids was observed at the previous step decrease of ionic strength i e 10 mm tosco et al 2009 however for all transient experiments significant mass was still retained in the soil even after several steps of ionic strength transients this indicates that only a fraction of the retained colloids on soil grains can be remobilized by ionic strength variations moreover the fraction of retained colloids released during transients stage 3 became smaller with larger value of ionic strength in stages 1 and 2 table 3 similar observations have been reported by other authors pazmino et al 2014 torkzaban et al 2010 the incomplete colloid release during transients may be due to the roughness on the grain surfaces shen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 and colloid retention in low velocity regions such as grain to grain contact points and their subsequent aggregation there torkzaban et al 2010 rough collector surfaces may have depressions that act as favourable locations for colloid deposition the colloids deposited in such depressions remain irreversibly deposited li et al 2017 shen et al 2007 the long tail in the breakthrough curves after the passage of the ionic strength front was due to the slow detachment from the soil surface this behavior was also reported in previous studies bradford et al 2015 lenhart and saiers 2003 wang et al 2020 fig 3 shows that the developed model fitted the full breakthrough curve of experiment 1 100 mm and subsequent decreases in ionic strength reasonably well the model fitted parameter values for the transient release of colloids are k d 0 0 006 min 1 i c 7 48 mm and β 4 3 this is in line with the experimental data figs 3 6 which shows that significant spike release of colloids occur only when the ionic strength becomes smaller than 10 mm since the physicochemical conditions for experiments 1 to 4 were all the same except for ionic strength k d 0 i c and β are expected to remain the same for all four experiments hence the model fitted parameter values of k d 0 i c and β obtained from experiment 1 100 mm were used to simulate the breakthrough curves for experiments 2 4 figs 4 6 show that the simulated curves match the full breakthrough curves including spikes for experiments 2 and 4 figs 4 and 6 whereas there is some mismatch between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves for experiment 3 fig 5 of course one can improve the quality of fitting for all experiments by selecting different set of values for k d 0 i c and β for each experiment such an approach leads to four different sets of k d 0 i c and β values for the same soil this is physically not acceptable also unlike some of the existing models in the literature where colloid release function changes with change in the boundary conditions bradford et al 2015 the model developed in this study employs the same set of governing equations for stages 1 2 and 3 which is physically correct however the model developed in this study did not capture the gradual release of colloids in the breakthrough curves after the passage of ionic strength front figs 3 6 the performance of the developed model in this study is comparable to existing models in the literature for example lenhart and saiers 2003 developed a mathematical model to simulate the release of colloids by dividing the immobile phase colloid population into a series of compartments colloid release from each compartment occurs when the ionic strength becomes lower than a critical value of solute concentration the model fitted parameters for release of colloids caused by step decreases in ionic strength from 100 mm to 0 mm were used to simulate the release for step decreases in ionic strength from 40 mm to 0 mm and 10 mm to 0 mm the model predicted the release spikes for 40 mm initial ionic strength well but the decline in concentrations after the peak was overestimated also the model performance was poorer for 10 mm initial ionic strength where the release spike was overestimated fig 7 shows the colloid retention profile at various stages for an initial ionic strength of 50 mm at the end of stage 2 experiment 8a at the end of step decreases in ionic strength to 1 mm experiment 8b and at the end of step decreases in ionic strength to 0 1 mm experiment 8c table 5 shows the mass balance information for experiments 8a c it is evident from fig 7 that colloid retention is more near the inlet than the outlet for all three experiments indicating strong attachment to grain surfaces fig 7 shows that colloid release from grain surfaces during step decreases in ionic strength to 1 mm experiment 8b mainly happens in the downstream part of the column however colloid release mainly occurs near to the column inlet for step decrease in ionic strength from 1 mm to 0 1 mm experiment 8c also the retention at the end of 0 1 mm experiment 8c is smaller than that at the end of 1 mm experiment 8b significant amount of colloidal mass was still retained at the end of 0 1 mm ionic strength experiment 8c and table 5 which is in line with the observations based on colloid breakthrough curve in experiment 2 table 3 fig 7 also indicates that there might be straining of colloids happening in the initial part of the column during ionic strength transients this may be because of the release of attached colloids in the form of aggregates from grain surfaces 4 4 factors affecting colloid release behavior the discrepancy between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves in this study figs 3 5 can be attributed to mechanisms that could not be quantified in our measurements and therefore are not included in our model among such mechanisms are surface roughness of soil grains irreversible deposition at stagnation zones of soil grains and deposited colloids getting released as aggregates from the grain surface which were eventually strained downstream each of these mechanisms is discussed in detail in the following sections 4 4 1 roughness of soil grain surfaces colloid retention to and release from soil grains depends on the interaction energy between them though the interaction energy profile based on dlvo theory fig 1 showed that the conditions were unfavourable for deposition at all ionic strengths except at 100 mm experimental results showed strong kinetic deposition behavior at all ionic strengths fig 2 and table 3 this could be due to the surface roughness of the sand grains as classical dlvo theory assumes that colloid and soil grains are smooth and chemically homogeneous shen et al 2011 but several studies have found that grain surfaces are rough characterized by microscale asperities and depressions li et al 2017 liang et al 2020 shen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 surface roughness has been found to affect the interaction energy of colloids with grain surface by decreasing the energy barrier and primary minimum depth at the tip of the asperities thereby making it less favourable for deposition pazmino et al 2014 shen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in contrast depressions present between the roughness asperities were found to act as permanent retention sites for colloids li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 which is the possible reason for the strong kinetic behavior with long tailing observed in this study according to the dlvo energy profile fig 1 and table 2 the secondary minimum is eliminated between 10 and 1 mm and hence all attached colloids were expected to get released when ionic strength was reduced to 1 mm and smaller in contrast to this the experimental data shows that only a fraction of the attached colloids on the grain surfaces were released during transients in ionic strength one possible explanation for this observation is the strong attachment of colloids in the depressions of grain surfaces which could not be released by ionic strength transients this is in line with the results of shen et al 2012 li et al 2017 and wang et al 2019 they found that reduction in ionic strength caused the release of attached colloids from the tips of asperities whereas the colloids residing in the depressions were irreversibly attached 4 4 2 retention in flow stagnation zones nishad et al 2021 observed from micromodel experiments that colloids were predominantly deposited in flow stagnation zones under unfavourable conditions due to negligible fluid drag forces and were not released during perturbations in ionic strength this can also be a reason for the partial release of deposited colloids during transients observed in this study similar observations as in this study were reported by bhuvankar et al 2022 for the remobilization of clay colloids through pore scale simulations they found that temporal decrease in ionic strength led to lesser remobilization of clay particles when they were deposited at high ionic strengths this was because at higher ionic strengths clay particles got aggregated and remained attached in the downstream low velocity regions decrease in ionic strength resulted in the attached clay particles getting released as clusters which may subsequently be strained in the downstream pores similar observations were reported by torkzaban et al 2010 from micromodel experiments when colloids were deposited at an ionic strength of 106 mm and then released by decreasing the ionic strength in a stepwise manner from 106 mm to di water they observed uniform distribution of colloids on the grain surface at all ionic strengths when ionic strength was reduced from 106 mm to 6 mm however aggregation of trapped colloids in low velocity regions at grain grain points was observed when ionic strength was decreased to di water the incomplete mass recovery was attributed to the formation of aggregates and funneling of colloids in low velocity regions at grain grain contacts this may be another reason for the partial release of retained colloids observed in this study even after several steps of ionic strength decrease 4 4 3 straining of released aggregates the discrepancy between the model output and the experimental data may be partly due to the release of colloids in the form of aggregates from the grain surface during decrease in ionic strength and their subsequent straining in the downstream pores liang et al 2019 this mechanism may be prominent for experiments with high ionic strength in stages 1 and 2 where greater number of colloids was attached to the grain surface and colloid colloid interaction was more favourable as a result colloids deposited at higher ionic strengths detach as clusters from the grain surface during stage 3 and may get strained in the downstream pores bhuvankar et al 2022 nishad and al raoush 2021 torkzaban et al 2010 this is supported by table 3 which shows only partial release of retained colloids even after several step reductions in ionic strength with the total release being smaller for experiments with high ionic strengths in stages 1 and 2 also the shape of the retention profile during stage 3 shown in fig 7 indicates that there may be straining near to the column inlet figs 3 6 show extended tailing during colloid release with the tailing more prevalent for higher ionic strength experiments in stages 1 and 2 experiments 1 and 2 this is because of the difference in the transport behavior of individual colloids and the aggregates aggregation of colloidal particles during transients in ionic strength was also reported by zhou et al 2011 5 summary and conclusions there are only limited studies on the effect of sudden changes in water chemistry on transport of colloids in porous media also the reported laboratory experiments and proposed models do not seem to be applicable for a wide range of conditions we have performed a systematic study of the effect of temporal variations in ionic strength on colloid remobilization and re deposition in porous media under saturated conditions this was done by performing four sets of column experiments each at a different value of initial ionic strength 100 50 25 and 10 mm followed by stepwise reduction of the inflow solution ionic strength to 0 mm we observed a sharp spike followed by a long tail in the effluent colloid concentration for every step decrease in ionic strength with the peak value being significantly higher when ionic strength becomes smaller than 10 mm also our experimental results show that only a fraction of the retained colloids was mobilized during ionic strength transients and the fraction of remobilized colloids was smaller for higher value of initial ionic strength of inflow water further experimental results were numerically simulated using a mathematical model containing a novel formulation for ionic strength dependent colloid attachment and release rate coefficients since significant release of colloids was only observed for ionic strength reduction below 10 mm it was assumed in the model that there is a critical concentration of ionic strength below which colloid release is fast the estimated value of the critical ionic strength was 7 48 mm the same set of model parameter values were used to simulate the colloid breakthrough curves obtained from all four sets of column experiments the model output was found to match the spikes in the colloid release curves of the experimental data reasonably well for initial ionic strengths of 100 mm 50 mm and 10 mm however the model did not capture well the descending part of the release curves for all initial ionic strengths and also the peaks in the release curve for initial ionic strength of 25 mm it may be mentioned that we could obtain a good fit between our simulations and experimental release curve for initial ionic strength of 25 mm by simply varying the values of model parameters as done in some other models that however we do not find satisfactory the discrepancy in the model output and experimental results may be due to mechanisms which were not considered in the model potential mechanisms include surface roughness of soil grains retention of colloids in low velocity regions and detachment of retained colloids as aggregates and their subsequent straining in the downstream pores though colloid retention profile during temporal reduction in ionic strength indicates that there may be straining of colloids near the column inlet further research is needed especially at the pore scale to elucidate the detachment mechanisms and thereby to

1249,temporal variations in the chemistry of infiltrating water into the subsurface are known to cause remobilization of colloids from the grain surfaces thereby increasing the travel distance of the colloidal contaminants hence it is essential to thoroughly understand the transport deposition and release mechanisms of colloids in the subsurface through laboratory experiments and modeling there are only a few experiments in which the chemistry of inflow water is changed rapidly during colloid transport also although some models have been presented for simulating the effect of transient chemistry on the fate of colloids there is no consensus in this regard as the proposed models suffer from shortcomings in this study we systematically investigated the effect of temporal variations in ionic strength on the remobilization of deposited colloids in saturated porous media through laboratory column experiments and numerical modeling four sets of column experiments were performed in which we injected carboxylate modified latex colloids at a given ionic strength for a specified period after breakthrough of colloids the ionic strength of inflowing water was decreased in a stepwise manner to 0 mm di water the initial ionic strength values of the four experiments were 100 50 25 and 10 mm we observed partial release of deposited colloids after several steps of ionic strength decrease with significant release observed only when the ionic strength was reduced to below 10 mm we also found that the fraction of released colloids decreased with increasing value of initial ionic strength of inflow water we have developed a mathematical model incorporating a novel formulation for ionic strength dependent deposition and release the model is found to capture the colloid breakthrough curves reasonably well for all experiments with the same set of parameter values except the one at the initial ionic strength of 25 mm keywords colloids transients ionic strength remobilization porous media modeling introduction groundwater is the major source of drinking water for the majority of rural and urban population carrard et al 2020 colloidal particles such as silica clays and metal oxides are naturally present in the subsurface apart from this colloidal contaminants such as pathogenic microorganisms and engineered nanoparticles enter the subsurface through various anthropogenic activities powelson et al 1993 bundschuh et al 2018 rapid infiltration due to rain events and artificial recharge of groundwater cause physical and chemical perturbations in the subsurface these lead to the colloids previously deposited on soil surface to get remobilized causing recontamination of the groundwater resources hence it is necessary to understand the colloid transport deposition and remobilization mechanisms in the subsurface to protect drinking water wells from contamination colloid deposition mechanisms in porous media are usually studied using packed soil columns in the laboratory numerous studies on colloid transport are reported in the literature in which experiments were performed under steady state flow and constant chemistry conditions elimelech and o melia 1990 sadeghi et al 2011 wan and wilson 1994 wang et al 2012 colloid transport models under steady state flow and chemistry conditions have been around for a long time and are straight forward bradford and bettahar 2005 li and johnson 2005 sasidharan et al 2017 syngouna and chrysikopoulos 2011 torkzaban et al 2008 they include terms for advection dispersion attachment detachment and straining some complications such as aggregation kinetics can be added katzourakis and chrysikopoulos 2021 however an important phenomenon is temporal variations in chemistry which significantly affects colloid transport behavior a relatively lesser number of studies have dealt with the effect of temporal variations in chemistry on colloid remobilization and deposition in porous media some examples are bradford et al 2015 cheng and saiers 2009 lenhart and saiers 2003 torkzaban et al 2015 tosco et al 2009 wang et al 2014 sadeghi et al 2013 experimental studies have observed a spike release of colloids from soil due to decrease in ionic strength beyond a threshold value bradford et al 2012 lenhart and saiers 2003 tosco et al 2009 torkzaban et al 2010 sadeghi et al 2013 found that a spike release of colloids occurred even though the ionic strength was constant but calcium ions were replaced with sodium ions colloid deposition and release from the grain surface is governed by colloid soil interaction forces transients in chemistry results in changes in interaction energy which promotes release of attached colloids for example decreases in ionic strength increases the energy barrier between the colloids and solid surface resulting in detachment of attached colloids from soil grains fang et al 2013 johnson et al 2010 torkzaban et al 2007 colloid release under transient chemistry conditions is simulated by coupling the governing equations for colloid transport and solution chemistry the effect of chemistry has been taken into account by assuming the colloid detachment rate coefficient to be an empirical function of solution chemistry lenhart and saiers 2003 tosco et al 2009 or using models with a one adsorption site equilibrium or kinetic or two adsorption sites equilibrium and kinetic or two kinetic bradford et al 2012 bradford et al 2015 lenhart and saiers 2003 assumed heterogeneous colloidal population and modelled colloid release by dividing the immobile colloidal phase into a number of compartments each compartment releasing colloids at its own critical salt concentration the model performance was evaluated by fitting the breakthrough curves obtained from experiments in which the ionic strength was reduced in a stepwise manner from an initial ionic strength of 100 mm to 0 mm di water a good match between the simulated and experimental results was observed however when the estimated parameters at an initial ionic strength of 100 mm were used to predict the colloid release curves obtained from experiments with initial ionic strengths of 40 mm and 10 mm the model overestimated the release peaks for 10 mm initial ionic strength and the declining limb of breakthrough curves for initial ionic strengths of 40 mm and 10 mm tosco et al 2009 coupled dual site colloid and solute transport models with the attachment and detachment rate coefficients expressed as empirical functions of ionic strength through critical deposition and release concentrations they performed several sets of experiments with different initial ionic strengths and the subsequent release of the colloids was initiated by decreasing the ionic strength to 0 mm di water since all experiments were performed at the same physicochemical conditions except the difference in the initial ionic strength one would expect model parameters including the critical deposition and release ionic strengths to remain the same however they fitted different experimental sets separately in order to obtain a good fit between observed and simulated data and thus obtained different sets of parameter values for different experiments bradford et al 2012 developed a dual permeability model for colloid transport and release under transient ionic strength conditions in which the detachment term was mechanistically modelled based on a balance of hydrodynamic and adhesive torques bradford et al 2015 developed equilibrium kinetic and combined equilibrium and kinetic models to describe colloid release under transient ionic strength or ph conditions they linked the amount of colloid release to the fractional solid surface area that contributed to retention where the fractional solid surface area was estimated experimentally from mass balance information however they use different functions for colloid release for different boundary conditions and the mechanisms during steady state and transient chemical conditions were treated independent of each other also this model did not account for the re deposition of remobilized colloids the foregoing short review of the literature indicates that further research is needed to develop a model that is valid under a variety of conditions without re estimating the model parameter values the objectives of this study are a to develop a mathematical model that is capable of simulating the fate of colloids in saturated porous media when there are temporal variations in ionic strength for a wide range of ionic strengths with a consistent set of parameter values and b to systematically evaluate the performance of the model through comparison with experiments four sets of column experiments were performed in which colloids were deposited at four different ionic strengths followed by decreasing the ionic strength in a stepwise manner at the column inlet to 0 mm the experimental data was further simulated using a mathematical model which accounted for ionic strength dependent colloid deposition and release 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous medium colloids and background electrolyte natural river sand with grain size between 425 and 600 μm representative of sandy aquifers bales et al 1997 tan et al 1994 was used as the porous medium for performing column experiments the sand was acid washed prior to packing it into the column to remove metal oxides and organic impurities from the grain surface acid washing involved the following sequential steps kohler et al 1996 sasidharan et al 2014 soaking the sand in 37 hcl for three days washing with di water and then washing in naoh for 2 h in a shaker after this the sand was thoroughly rinsed with di water and oven dried at 105 c for 5 h the efficiency of the acid washing procedure in removing the metal oxides and organic impurities was determined by analyzing the sand samples before and after acid treatment using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry the detailed procedure for determining the metal content of the sand is given in appendix a1 carboxylate modified latex cml beads of size 1 μm thermo fisher scientific pvt ltd were used as colloidal particles in this study sodium chloride was used for preparing background electrolyte at various ionic strengths of 100 50 25 10 1 and 0 1 mm ph of the background electrolyte was adjusted to 7 by addition of 0 1 n hcl and 0 1 m naoh injection colloidal suspension of concentration 7 3 107 no ml was prepared by diluting the stock in the background electrolyte at the desired ionic strength the colloidal suspension was sonicated for 20 min in an ultra sonicator branson ultrasonics before injecting it into the column to ensure a uniform dispersion of colloids the zeta potentials of cml colloids and sand at various ionic strengths were measured using a zeta sizer malvern analytical instruments the zeta potential of the sand was measured after crushing it into fine powder and suspending it in the background electrolyte bergendahl and grasso 1999 treumann et al 2014 2 2 column experiments column experiments were performed in acrylic columns with 2 5 cm inner diameter and 15 cm length the top and bottom ends of the column were equipped with stainless steel meshes to prevent the entry of sand into the inlet and outlet pipes and to maintain a uniform distribution of flow throughout the cross section of the column the column was placed vertically and wet packed with acid washed sand in increments of 1 cm along with tapping from the sides to maintain a tight uniform packing of solid grains the porosity and bulk density of the sand were measured to be 0 37 and 1 67 g cm3 respectively the bottom end of the column was connected to a peristaltic pump which maintained a constant upflow rate of 1 ml min throughout the experiment it is known that the column orientation and hence gravity has an important role in colloid deposition with particle deposition rates being greater in the up flow than in the down flow direction chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 however the density of cml colloids 1 055 g cm3 is similar to that of water and hence the gravity effects can be considered negligible in this study the packed column was flushed with ten pore volumes pvs of di water additional experiments described below show that natural colloids were not present in the effluent after this a tracer experiment was performed by passing 3 pvs of 100 mm nacl followed by 3 pvs of di water effluent samples were collected from the column outlet at 6 min intervals and analyzed for nacl concentration using an electrical conductivity meter next the sand packed column was equilibrated with background electrolyte at the desired ionic strength for 10 pvs finally colloid transport experiments were performed each colloid transport experiment consisted of three stages stages 1 2 correspond to transport under steady state chemistry condition at a constant ionic strength whereas stage 3 corresponds to transient chemistry conditions due to a step decrease in the ionic strength of the inflowing solution in stage 1 colloid deposition under steady state chemistry condition the inflow solution had a constant ionic strength and colloid concentration colloidal suspension in the reservoir was stirred frequently to prevent particle aggregation and settling after exactly three pore volumes in stage 2 colloid elution under steady state chemistry condition the inflow was switched to a colloid free solution without any change of flow rate and ionic strength in stage 3 transient chemistry the ionic strength of inflow solution was decreased in a stepwise manner to di water 0 mm without any change of the flow rate each step decrease in ionic strength was applied for 3 pvs except for the last step for which several pvs of di water was applied effluent samples were collected from the column outlet at 6 min intervals and analyzed for colloid concentration using turbidity meter four sets of transient experiments 1 2 3 4 were performed in this study each corresponding to a different initial ionic strength in stages 1 2 as given in table 1 for example experiment 1 was performed at an ionic strength of 100 mm in stages 1 2 followed by a stepwise sequential reduction in ionic strength to 50 mm 25 mm 10 mm 1 mm 0 1 mm and 0 mm di water in stage 3 in addition to the above four experiments which involved all three stages experiments 5 6 and 7 were performed at stages 1 and 2 only table 1 at ionic strengths of 1 mm 0 1 mm and 0 mm di water respectively to understand the colloid deposition behavior under constant chemistry at these ionic strengths each experiment was repeated three times to check the reproducibility of the experimental results the above set of four release experiments was also performed including all three stages but in the absence of cml colloids to measure the release of natural colloids from the soil grains during transient chemistry conditions we did not find any natural colloids leaching from the soil into the effluent finally three additional experiments were performed in which we measured the colloid retention profile along the soil column experiments 8a 8b and 8c in table 1 this was done for an initial ionic strength of 50 mm at the following stages at the end of stage 2 experiment 8a after three step decreases of ionic strength from 50 mm to 1 mm experiment 8b and after four step decreases of ionic strength from 50 mm to 0 1 mm experiment 8c each of the above trials consisted of dissecting the soil inside the column at the end of the experiment into approximately 1 cm long sections the mass of colloids retained on the sand in each section was then determined by first adding 20 ml of di water to sand followed by gentle shaking to release the colloids into the suspension bradford et al 2007 torkzaban et al 2008 the suspension was then allowed to stand for 15 min for the sand particles to settle after that the colloid concentration in the supernatant was measured colloid retention profile is then plotted as the mass of colloids retained per mass of soil in each section versus distance from the inlet 2 3 interaction energy calculation the total interaction energy between colloid and grain surface was calculated using dlvo theory derjaguin and landau 1941 verwey and overbeek 1948 as the sum of london van der waals energy electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion energy assuming a sphere plate interaction ryan and elimelech 1996 the total interaction energy φ dlvo between colloid and grain surface is given as 1 φ dlvo k b t φ vdw k b t φ edl k b t φ born k b t where φ vdw ml2t 2 is the van der waals energy φ edl ml2t 2 is electrostatic double layer energy φ born ml2t 2 is the born repulsion energy k b ml2t 2k 1 is boltzmann constant and t k is temperature the van der waals energy was calculated using the expressions given by gregory 1981 and weroński and elimelech 2008 the electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion energy were calculated using expressions given by hogg healy fuerstenau hogg et al 1966 and ruckenstein and prieve 1976 respectively the detailed description of the calculation of van der waals energy electrostatic double layer energy and born repulsion energy are given in appendix a2 3 mathematical model 3 1 governing equations the ionic strength variation in the column during stage 3 was simulated by solving one dimensional advection dispersion equation as follows 2 i t d l 2 i z 2 v i z where i molar is ionic strength dl l 2t 1 is the dispersion coefficient and v lt 1 is the average pore water velocity colloid transport was simulated by one dimensional advection dispersion equation modified to account for deposition and release as 3 c t ρ b θ s t d l 2 c z 2 v c z where c ml 3 is colloid concentration in aqueous phase ρ b ml 3 is the bulk density of soil θ is the porosity of soil and s mm 1 is the mass fraction of colloids attached to soil grains during the preliminary fitting of the colloid breakthrough data from stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 we tried various models including one site kinetic model and two site kinetic model with site 1 being reversible and site 2 being irreversible we found that the two site kinetic model with reversible deposition at site 1 and irreversible deposition at site 2 fitted the data well however the values of attachment and detachment rate coefficients for site 1 were very large which indicates that site 1 is a fast or equilibrium site and site 2 is a slow or kinetic site so the colloid deposition on the grain surface was described using a two site model eqs 4a 4c with sites 1 and 2 representing equilibrium and kinetic sites respectively this model gave the same fitting as that of the two site kinetic model moreover we assume that the colloids attached to the kinetic sites are affected by the change of ionic strength during stage 3 the governing equations for adsorption are 4a s 1 f k d c 4b ρ b θ s 2 t 1 f k a c ρ b θ k d s 2 ρ b θ k d h 0 i t s 2 4c s s 1 s 2 here s 1 mm 1 is the mass fraction of colloids attached to site 1 mass of colloids attached to site 1 per unit mass of dry soil s 2 mm 1 is the mass fraction of colloids attached to site 2 mass of colloids attached to site 2 per unit mass of dry soil f is the fraction of sites in equilibrium with the liquid phase k d m 1l3 is the equilibrium distribution coefficient k a t 1 and k d t 1 are the rate coefficients of attachment and detachment of colloids to the kinetic site k d t 1 is the rate coefficient for the release of colloids from kinetic site during transients in ionic strength and h 0 i t is the heaviside step function defined as 5 h 0 i t 1 i t 0 0 i t 0 the colloid release rate coefficient during transients in ionic strength was expressed as k d k d 0 1 i i c β where k d 0 t 1 is the maximum value of release rate coefficient which occurs at zero ionic strength i c molar is the critical ionic strength below which the release is fast and β is a constant tosco et al 2009 we observed from stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 that the values of the rate coefficients k d k a k d and f depend on ionic strength coefficients k a and k d were found to increase with increase in ionic strength whereas k d and f decrease with increase in ionic strength hence the colloid deposition parameters change during transients in ionic strength stage 3 and therefore it is important to account for the effect of ionic strength variation on colloid deposition parameters in the model we tried various functions for relating k d k a k d and f to ionic strength and found the following formulas to give us the best fit 6 k d a 1 i 2 a 2 i a 3 7 k a b 1 i 2 b 2 i b 3 8 k d d 1 exp d 2 i 9 f e 1 exp e 2 i where a i b i c j and d j i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 are the coefficients whose values were estimated from the experimental data given in table 3 eqs 2 9 represent the complete set of equations governing the transport of colloids in porous media they were solved by imposing the following initial and boundary conditions 10 i z 0 i 0 c z 0 s 1 z 0 s 2 z 0 0 11 i 0 t i 0 t t 2 i 1 t 2 t t 31 i i t 3 i 1 t t 3 i i 1 2 3 12 c 0 t c 0 t t 1 0 t t 1 13 i z l t c z l t 0 here i 0 is the initial value of ionic strength of the background electrolyte in the soil before starting colloid transport experiments t 1 is the duration of injection of colloidal suspension at the inlet of the column in stage 1 t 2 is time till the end of stage 2 i 1 is the ionic strength at the column inlet for first step decrease in ionic strength at the start of stage 3 t 31 is the time till the end of first step decrease in ionic strength i i is the ionic strength at the column inlet for i th step decrease in ionic strength in stage 3 t 3i is the time till the end of i th step decrease in ionic strength and i is the number of steps of ionic strength reduction eq 10 indicates that the initial value of ionic strength in the liquid phase was i 0 and there were no colloids present in the liquid and solid phases initially the governing eqs 2 9 subject to the initial and boundary conditions eqs 10 13 were solved numerically using comsol multiphysics software version 5 5 there may be many other mechanisms influencing the colloid release that are not included here doing so would require many more data for evaluating the model for example a relevant mechanism is release of attached colloids as aggregates after sudden changes in ionic strength and their subsequent straining in the downstream pores the model performance could be improved by including aggregation kinetics and straining during the release however including such a mechanism in the model will be useful only if data required for evaluating corresponding parameters is available 3 2 fitting procedure the model contains eqs 2 9 eight unknown parameters d l f k d k a k d k d 0 i c and β whose values were estimated by fitting different stages of the tracer and colloid transport breakthrough curves as explained below first the dispersion coefficient d l was estimated by fitting the tracer breakthrough data with advection dispersion equation colloids were assumed to have the same dispersivity as that of the tracer colloid dispersivity has been found to be size dependent chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 and can be different from the dispersivity of tracer chrysikopoulos and katzourakis 2015 observed a positive correlation between colloid dispersivity and its size however for simplicity we have assumed the dispersivity of colloid to be the same as that of the tracer as a result the dispersivity of colloids may be underestimated in this work the value of f at a given ionic strength was estimated as the fraction of injected colloids recovered in the effluent in steady state stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 this is reasonable as the value of detachment rate coefficient at the kinetic site during stages 1 and 2 is negligibly small then the colloid breakthrough curve from stages 1 and 2 of experiments 1 7 were fitted with eq 3 4 to estimate the values of k d k a and k d at different ionic strengths this resulted in a list of values of k d k a and k d at different values of ionic strengths these values were then fitted with eqs 6 9 respectively to estimate the values of a i b i d j and e j where i 1 2 3 and j 1 2 following this step colloid breakthrough curve from stage 3 of experiment 1 was fitted with eqs 3 5 to estimate the values of k d 0 i c and β since k d 0 i c and β are constant for a given combination of colloid type soil type and hydraulic conditions the estimated values of these parameters from experiment 1 were then used to simulate the breakthrough curves in stage 3 of experiments 2 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 interaction energy profile the zeta potentials of cml colloids and sand at various ionic strengths and the corresponding depths and distances of primary and secondary minima are given in table 2 fig 1 shows the interaction energy profile between cml colloids and grain surface at different ionic strengths there h l is the separation distance between colloid and grain surface and a l is the colloid radius the interaction energy profile at 100 mm is characterized by a deep primary minimum with a negligible energy barrier fig 1 and hence the conditions at 100 mm were favourable for deposition at other ionic strengths energy profiles are characterized by a secondary minimum and an energy barrier fig 1 and table 2 indicating unfavourable conditions for deposition the depth of the secondary minimum increased from 0 00013 k b t to 9 71 k b t as ionic strength increased from 0 1 mm to 100 mm table 2 thereby increasing the potential for colloid retention at secondary minimum 4 2 colloid deposition during steady state ionic strength stages 1 and 2 of column experiments experimental and model fitted breakthrough curves of colloids at various ionic strengths 100 50 25 10 1 0 1 mm and di water during stages 1 and 2 of column experiments are given in fig 2 the developed model fitted the experimental breakthrough curves reasonably well fig 2 the experimental mass balance information and the values of fitted parameters are given in table 3 it is clear from fig 2 and table 3 that colloid retention in soil increased with increasing ionic strength this can be attributed to deeper secondary minimum at higher ionic strengths table 2 these findings are in line with the estimated values of k a and k d which showed increasing and decreasing trends respectively with increasing ionic strength as given in table 3 the fraction of equilibrium sites increased with decreasing ionic strength table 3 the estimated values of f k d k a and k d were then used to find values of constants in eqs 6 9 that relate these parameters to ionic strength the resulting values are reported in table 4 4 3 colloid release during transients in ionic strength stage 3 of column experiments figs 3 to 6 show the colloid release curves during stage 3 of column experiments 1 to 4 respectively colloid release curves during transients in ionic strength are characterized by sharp peaks followed by long tails with the time to peak coinciding with the time of arrival of the ionic strength front at the column outlet figs 3 6 this is in line with the observations reported in literature for cml colloids bradford and kim 2012 bradford et al 2015 torkzaban et al 2010 tosco et al 2009 it can also be seen from figs 3 6 that the amount of spike release during a given step decrease in ionic strength in stage 3 depends on the history of colloid deposition and release significant spike release of deposited colloids was observed only at the step when ionic strength was decreased from 10 mm to 1 mm and smaller table 3 this could be due to the release of attached colloids from the tips of asperities at lower ionic strengths shen et al 2018 this indicates that there may exist a critical ionic strength between 10 and 1 mm below which the spike release is significant as no significant release of colloids was observed at the previous step decrease of ionic strength i e 10 mm tosco et al 2009 however for all transient experiments significant mass was still retained in the soil even after several steps of ionic strength transients this indicates that only a fraction of the retained colloids on soil grains can be remobilized by ionic strength variations moreover the fraction of retained colloids released during transients stage 3 became smaller with larger value of ionic strength in stages 1 and 2 table 3 similar observations have been reported by other authors pazmino et al 2014 torkzaban et al 2010 the incomplete colloid release during transients may be due to the roughness on the grain surfaces shen et al 2018 wang et al 2020 and colloid retention in low velocity regions such as grain to grain contact points and their subsequent aggregation there torkzaban et al 2010 rough collector surfaces may have depressions that act as favourable locations for colloid deposition the colloids deposited in such depressions remain irreversibly deposited li et al 2017 shen et al 2007 the long tail in the breakthrough curves after the passage of the ionic strength front was due to the slow detachment from the soil surface this behavior was also reported in previous studies bradford et al 2015 lenhart and saiers 2003 wang et al 2020 fig 3 shows that the developed model fitted the full breakthrough curve of experiment 1 100 mm and subsequent decreases in ionic strength reasonably well the model fitted parameter values for the transient release of colloids are k d 0 0 006 min 1 i c 7 48 mm and β 4 3 this is in line with the experimental data figs 3 6 which shows that significant spike release of colloids occur only when the ionic strength becomes smaller than 10 mm since the physicochemical conditions for experiments 1 to 4 were all the same except for ionic strength k d 0 i c and β are expected to remain the same for all four experiments hence the model fitted parameter values of k d 0 i c and β obtained from experiment 1 100 mm were used to simulate the breakthrough curves for experiments 2 4 figs 4 6 show that the simulated curves match the full breakthrough curves including spikes for experiments 2 and 4 figs 4 and 6 whereas there is some mismatch between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves for experiment 3 fig 5 of course one can improve the quality of fitting for all experiments by selecting different set of values for k d 0 i c and β for each experiment such an approach leads to four different sets of k d 0 i c and β values for the same soil this is physically not acceptable also unlike some of the existing models in the literature where colloid release function changes with change in the boundary conditions bradford et al 2015 the model developed in this study employs the same set of governing equations for stages 1 2 and 3 which is physically correct however the model developed in this study did not capture the gradual release of colloids in the breakthrough curves after the passage of ionic strength front figs 3 6 the performance of the developed model in this study is comparable to existing models in the literature for example lenhart and saiers 2003 developed a mathematical model to simulate the release of colloids by dividing the immobile phase colloid population into a series of compartments colloid release from each compartment occurs when the ionic strength becomes lower than a critical value of solute concentration the model fitted parameters for release of colloids caused by step decreases in ionic strength from 100 mm to 0 mm were used to simulate the release for step decreases in ionic strength from 40 mm to 0 mm and 10 mm to 0 mm the model predicted the release spikes for 40 mm initial ionic strength well but the decline in concentrations after the peak was overestimated also the model performance was poorer for 10 mm initial ionic strength where the release spike was overestimated fig 7 shows the colloid retention profile at various stages for an initial ionic strength of 50 mm at the end of stage 2 experiment 8a at the end of step decreases in ionic strength to 1 mm experiment 8b and at the end of step decreases in ionic strength to 0 1 mm experiment 8c table 5 shows the mass balance information for experiments 8a c it is evident from fig 7 that colloid retention is more near the inlet than the outlet for all three experiments indicating strong attachment to grain surfaces fig 7 shows that colloid release from grain surfaces during step decreases in ionic strength to 1 mm experiment 8b mainly happens in the downstream part of the column however colloid release mainly occurs near to the column inlet for step decrease in ionic strength from 1 mm to 0 1 mm experiment 8c also the retention at the end of 0 1 mm experiment 8c is smaller than that at the end of 1 mm experiment 8b significant amount of colloidal mass was still retained at the end of 0 1 mm ionic strength experiment 8c and table 5 which is in line with the observations based on colloid breakthrough curve in experiment 2 table 3 fig 7 also indicates that there might be straining of colloids happening in the initial part of the column during ionic strength transients this may be because of the release of attached colloids in the form of aggregates from grain surfaces 4 4 factors affecting colloid release behavior the discrepancy between the simulated and experimental breakthrough curves in this study figs 3 5 can be attributed to mechanisms that could not be quantified in our measurements and therefore are not included in our model among such mechanisms are surface roughness of soil grains irreversible deposition at stagnation zones of soil grains and deposited colloids getting released as aggregates from the grain surface which were eventually strained downstream each of these mechanisms is discussed in detail in the following sections 4 4 1 roughness of soil grain surfaces colloid retention to and release from soil grains depends on the interaction energy between them though the interaction energy profile based on dlvo theory fig 1 showed that the conditions were unfavourable for deposition at all ionic strengths except at 100 mm experimental results showed strong kinetic deposition behavior at all ionic strengths fig 2 and table 3 this could be due to the surface roughness of the sand grains as classical dlvo theory assumes that colloid and soil grains are smooth and chemically homogeneous shen et al 2011 but several studies have found that grain surfaces are rough characterized by microscale asperities and depressions li et al 2017 liang et al 2020 shen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 surface roughness has been found to affect the interaction energy of colloids with grain surface by decreasing the energy barrier and primary minimum depth at the tip of the asperities thereby making it less favourable for deposition pazmino et al 2014 shen et al 2012 shen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in contrast depressions present between the roughness asperities were found to act as permanent retention sites for colloids li et al 2017 wang et al 2019 which is the possible reason for the strong kinetic behavior with long tailing observed in this study according to the dlvo energy profile fig 1 and table 2 the secondary minimum is eliminated between 10 and 1 mm and hence all attached colloids were expected to get released when ionic strength was reduced to 1 mm and smaller in contrast to this the experimental data shows that only a fraction of the attached colloids on the grain surfaces were released during transients in ionic strength one possible explanation for this observation is the strong attachment of colloids in the depressions of grain surfaces which could not be released by ionic strength transients this is in line with the results of shen et al 2012 li et al 2017 and wang et al 2019 they found that reduction in ionic strength caused the release of attached colloids from the tips of asperities whereas the colloids residing in the depressions were irreversibly attached 4 4 2 retention in flow stagnation zones nishad et al 2021 observed from micromodel experiments that colloids were predominantly deposited in flow stagnation zones under unfavourable conditions due to negligible fluid drag forces and were not released during perturbations in ionic strength this can also be a reason for the partial release of deposited colloids during transients observed in this study similar observations as in this study were reported by bhuvankar et al 2022 for the remobilization of clay colloids through pore scale simulations they found that temporal decrease in ionic strength led to lesser remobilization of clay particles when they were deposited at high ionic strengths this was because at higher ionic strengths clay particles got aggregated and remained attached in the downstream low velocity regions decrease in ionic strength resulted in the attached clay particles getting released as clusters which may subsequently be strained in the downstream pores similar observations were reported by torkzaban et al 2010 from micromodel experiments when colloids were deposited at an ionic strength of 106 mm and then released by decreasing the ionic strength in a stepwise manner from 106 mm to di water they observed uniform distribution of colloids on the grain surface at all ionic strengths when ionic strength was reduced from 106 mm to 6 mm however aggregation of trapped colloids in low velocity regions at grain grain points was observed when ionic strength was decreased to di water the incomplete mass recovery was attributed to the formation of aggregates and funneling of colloids in low velocity regions at grain grain contacts this may be another reason for the partial release of retained colloids observed in this study even after several steps of ionic strength decrease 4 4 3 straining of released aggregates the discrepancy between the model output and the experimental data may be partly due to the release of colloids in the form of aggregates from the grain surface during decrease in ionic strength and their subsequent straining in the downstream pores liang et al 2019 this mechanism may be prominent for experiments with high ionic strength in stages 1 and 2 where greater number of colloids was attached to the grain surface and colloid colloid interaction was more favourable as a result colloids deposited at higher ionic strengths detach as clusters from the grain surface during stage 3 and may get strained in the downstream pores bhuvankar et al 2022 nishad and al raoush 2021 torkzaban et al 2010 this is supported by table 3 which shows only partial release of retained colloids even after several step reductions in ionic strength with the total release being smaller for experiments with high ionic strengths in stages 1 and 2 also the shape of the retention profile during stage 3 shown in fig 7 indicates that there may be straining near to the column inlet figs 3 6 show extended tailing during colloid release with the tailing more prevalent for higher ionic strength experiments in stages 1 and 2 experiments 1 and 2 this is because of the difference in the transport behavior of individual colloids and the aggregates aggregation of colloidal particles during transients in ionic strength was also reported by zhou et al 2011 5 summary and conclusions there are only limited studies on the effect of sudden changes in water chemistry on transport of colloids in porous media also the reported laboratory experiments and proposed models do not seem to be applicable for a wide range of conditions we have performed a systematic study of the effect of temporal variations in ionic strength on colloid remobilization and re deposition in porous media under saturated conditions this was done by performing four sets of column experiments each at a different value of initial ionic strength 100 50 25 and 10 mm followed by stepwise reduction of the inflow solution ionic strength to 0 mm we observed a sharp spike followed by a long tail in the effluent colloid concentration for every step decrease in ionic strength with the peak value being significantly higher when ionic strength becomes smaller than 10 mm also our experimental results show that only a fraction of the retained colloids was mobilized during ionic strength transients and the fraction of remobilized colloids was smaller for higher value of initial ionic strength of inflow water further experimental results were numerically simulated using a mathematical model containing a novel formulation for ionic strength dependent colloid attachment and release rate coefficients since significant release of colloids was only observed for ionic strength reduction below 10 mm it was assumed in the model that there is a critical concentration of ionic strength below which colloid release is fast the estimated value of the critical ionic strength was 7 48 mm the same set of model parameter values were used to simulate the colloid breakthrough curves obtained from all four sets of column experiments the model output was found to match the spikes in the colloid release curves of the experimental data reasonably well for initial ionic strengths of 100 mm 50 mm and 10 mm however the model did not capture well the descending part of the release curves for all initial ionic strengths and also the peaks in the release curve for initial ionic strength of 25 mm it may be mentioned that we could obtain a good fit between our simulations and experimental release curve for initial ionic strength of 25 mm by simply varying the values of model parameters as done in some other models that however we do not find satisfactory the discrepancy in the model output and experimental results may be due to mechanisms which were not considered in the model potential mechanisms include surface roughness of soil grains retention of colloids in low velocity regions and detachment of retained colloids as aggregates and their subsequent straining in the downstream pores though colloid retention profile during temporal reduction in ionic strength indicates that there may be straining of colloids near the column inlet further research is needed especially at the pore scale to elucidate the detachment mechanisms and thereby to
