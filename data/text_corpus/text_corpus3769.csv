18845,the conversion of food waste fw into the sewage system is regarded as a promising method of relieving the burden of solid waste management however knowledge about its effects on sewer processes is limited particularly in terms of biofilm formation and sulfide production in this study a gravity sewer system was set up to investigate the effects of the addition of fw on biofilm formation the sulfate reducing bacteria srb population and the sulfide production potential the sewer biofilm characteristics changed with long term fw addition and a greater thickness by 32 an increased dry density by 13 and more extracellular polymeric substance by 141 were observed the thicker and denser biofilm limited oxygen diffusion enlarged the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm promoted an increase in the srb population and enhanced the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer substantial differences in the h2s profiles in the biofilm samples with and without the addition of fw were observed via microelectrode analysis a model based investigation of sewer biofilm formation with and without the addition of fw was conducted with a dynamic sewer biofilm model to gain further insights into sewer biofilm processes the results suggest that the addition of fw can promote sulfide production and srb growth in a sewer biofilm which can be significantly affected by the ratio of fw to sewage it is worth further investigations of the impacts of fw addition on the potential sulfide production in pressure sewers graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewer biofilm model food waste

conversion of fw in the sewage system with fw disposers fwds has been considered promising due to the hygienic advantages efficiency and cost effectiveness evans 2007 iacovidou et al 2012 mtp 2008 although the use of fwd enables the diversion of a considerable amount of organic waste from the solid waste stream the reliability and uncertainty of fwd application have made this issue controversial for decades battistoni et al 2007 bolzonella et al 2003 marashlian and el fadel 2005 the addition of fw may cause extra loadings of pollutants such as suspended solids carbon nitrogen and phosphorus in sewers and wastewater treatment plants wwtps zan et al 2018 extensive studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of fw addition on wwtps from laboratory scale to large scale battistoni et al 2007 bolzonella et al 2003 ceced 2003 de koning and van der graaf 1996 kim et al 2015 nyepd 1997 however wwtps are not the only areas of the sewage system that could be affected by the discharge of fw the sewer process may be affected before fw enters the wwtps but this issue has often been ignored during conveyance sewage quality can be significantly changed by sewer processes in which sewer biofilm plays a fundamental role abdul talib et al 2002 tanaka and hvitved jacobsen 1998 vollertsen and hvitved jacobsen 1998 zhang et al 2018 hydrogen sulfide h2s is produced by the mediation of sulfate reducing bacteria srb that colonize sewer biofilm which can lead to detrimental effects such as concrete corrosion malodors and explosive potential hvitved jacobsen et al 2013 jiang et al 2013 2011 liang et al 2016 nielsen et al 2008 pikaar et al 2014 many factors have influences on sulfide production and srb activity such as the dissolved oxygen organic loading and hydraulic conditions lin et al 2018 norsker et al 1995 sharma et al 2008 sun et al 2018a 2018b zeng et al 2019 for instance the build up of sulfide in a real pressure sewer of australia was monitored for one day with the fluctuations from 1 to 12 mg s l due to the variations of hrt sulfate and organic matters sharma et al 2008 in the long term operation of lab scale reactor system sulfide production was positively correlated with the hrt sun et al 2018a 2018b norsker et al 1995 found the sulfide concentration in gravity sewers could vary significantly with the wastewater characteristics by using real sewage and synthetic glucose however fw slurry after fwd treatment can result in 50 of organics dissolved zan et al 2018 the addition of fw into sewers could inevitably change the substrate composition and organic fraction of sewage thus affecting biofilm formation and its characteristics and the sewer processes however knowledge of this issue is currently limited hence the objectives of this study were to assess the effect of fw addition on biofilm formation srb population and sulfide production potential in a gravity sewer system variations in biofilm characteristics were monitored during biofilm formation the srb population and sulfide production potential in the biofilm were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and microelectrodes to provide clear insights into sewer biofilm processes a dynamic sewer biofilm model developed by jiang et al 2009 was used to simulate the process of biofilm formation with or without the addition of fw this sewer biofilm model can dynamically simulate the evolution of biofilm and its associated microbial activities while considering variations in the hydraulic condition and wastewater quality which are important factors in the microbial transformation induced by the addition of fw in gravity sewers 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale sewer reactor to investigate all the potential negative impacts from fw addition on sewer system the sewer reactors were designed to mimic the worst condition in gravity sewers the parameters design followed the minimum required values in the design criteria hkdsd 2013 montes et al 2017 two sets of pilot scale sewer systems made from upvc tubing were constructed on the campus of the hong kong university of science and technology due to the use of seawater for toilet flushing in hong kong upvc is applied for sewer pipes with small diameters to reduce sewer corrosion hkdsd 2013 hkwsd 2017 the reactors were 5 m long with an inner diameter of 150 mm which is within the minimal diameter ranges of sewer pipes in hong kong hkdsd 2013 moreover the slope of 0 015 and velocity of 0 3 m s were designed to maintain a minimum self cleaning capability in pipes based on the standard bong 2014 montes et al 2017 constant flow was provided by the pumps p2 with the velocity of 0 3 m s but it could lower to 0 1 m s occasionally the schematic diagram of the pilot scale sewer systems is shown in fig 1 and fig s1 municipal wastewater originating from the real sewer on campus was continuously injected into the sewer reactors as the influent the sewage was cycled by a pump i e p2 in the system and descended by gravity to the sewer reactors i and ii i e r1 and r2 and the sewage overflow was the effluent from tanks iii and iv the sewer system was covered by black sheets to keep the reactors in the dark the sewer systems were operated in summer which the air temperature varied from 30 to 38 c the dissolved oxygen in both sewer systems were higher than 2 mg l during the entire operation period the general process of the sewer operation and the characteristics of raw sewage and fw as influent are summarized in table 1 2 2 monitoring the sewer biofilm growth sewer biofilm experiments were set up in the pilot sewer reactors with one as the experiment reactor r2 with fw and real wastewater added and the other as the control reactor r1 only with real wastewater fw used in this study contains of 50 fruits 20 vegetables 20 starchy food and 10 meat which is the typical composition of fw from households in hong kong according to our previous survey zan et al 2018 fresh fw was prepared twice a day with the treatment of fwd and then pumped into the system to ensure a ratio of 1 g fw l sewage biofilms were developed on specifically designed pvc chips 2 5 cm 2 5 cm embedded into a carrier each carrier containing 6 pieces of pvc chips and 15 of carriers were installed in from 2 5 m to 5 m of the sewer reactors the biofilms samples from two chips were collected for the physicochemical microstructure and morphology parameters measurement around 60 80 of fullness in the pipes was achieved to maintain the biofilm submerging in the water phase the biofilm thickness was monitored with a certain carrier located at 4 m of the pipe from day 9 and then every 2 days four different random selection of area on chips was conducted for thickness measurement the biofilm dry density the specific surface area ssa the total pore volume extracellular polymeric substances eps including protein pn and polysaccharides ps and the biofilm microstructure were examined at 10 day intervals each parameter was determined from an intact chip of the carrier in similar area with duplicate samples and the chip can be only used for once the details of the analytical methods are presented in the following section 2 3 fish the biofilm samples developed on day 40 were taken from the locations of 2 5 m 3 5 m and 4 5 m in the sewer and detached from the carriers due to the high thickness and low abundance of srb in biofilm the collected biofilm samples from different locations were washed by phosphate buffer saline pbs solution mixed and dispersed in a 2 ml centrifuge tube then the treated biofilms were settled for 10 min and the supernatant was removed by the dropper the settled biofilms were further collected and fixed overnight in 4 w v paraformaldehyde at 4 c followed by the slide preparation cell hybridization was carried out as described by amann et al 1995 and guo et al 2017 the oligonucleotide probe groupings used for fish were made to cover the appropriate ranges eubmix eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii and sulfate reducing bacteria srbmix srb385 srb385db all probes were used at a formamide hybridization level of 35 after hybridization the biofilm samples were examined with an lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss germany equipped with a diode laser 405 nm an argon ml laser 458 488 514 nm a dass laser 560 nm and a hene laser 633 nm the tests were duplicated with around 10 images at different locations with each examination eub and srb were quantified from randomly selected areas based on the relative abundance of blue and red pixels in 10 or more images in imagej national institutes of health usa 2 4 sulfide production potential of sewer biofilm batch tests were conducted to further investigate the sulfide production potential of the sewer biofilm to verify the activity of srb for 12 h biofilm carriers and raw sewage were collected from the pilot scale sewer reactors on day 40 for each batch test sewer biofilm was carefully scraped off two chips with an area of 12 5 cm2 and then put into a 50 ml falcon conical centrifuge tubes the tubes were then filled with raw sewage which was purged with pure nitrogen gas for 15 min to reduce the dissolved oxygen concentration in advance the filled tubes were sealed with parafilm and covered by the cap a digital rotator mx rd pro dlab china was applied at a speed of 40 rpm the tests lasted 12 h and the samples were collected at 0 initial value 6 and 12 h for sulfide measurement the batch tests of sewer biofilm from the two reactors were conducted simultaneously the sulfide concentration produced at different times was calculated based on the specific area of sewer biofilm applied in the batch test i e g s m2 2 5 microelectrodes analysis biofilm carriers were taken from the reactors on day 40 and submerged in a 250 ml beaker containing 150 ml of 0 22 μm filtered raw sewage intact biofilms on chips submerged in real sewage were used for measurement of h2s and oxidation reduction potential orp at different depths of biofilm samples the spatial concentration of h2s and orp in the biofilm was profiled using a microsensor system equipped with a h2s sensor h2s 25 unisense denmark and an orp sensor orp 25 unisense denmark using an ag agcl open ended electrode as reference the outside diameter of the sensor tips ranged from 20 to 30 μm the microelectrodes were firstly calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions measurements were made with h2s and orp microelectrodes mounted on the motor driven micromanipulator unisense mm33 2 denmark the tips of the electrodes were positioned above the biofilms on the chips the micromanipulator was interfaced to a desktop computer and run by a sensortrace profiling program profiling tests were conducted with a step of 0 1 mm from the water phase to biofilm phase in triplicate total dissolved sulfide was calculated based on the ph and temperature with measured value of h2s 2 6 chemical and physical analysis total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate nitrate nitrite and ammonia were filtrated through a 0 45 μm filter millex hv millipore germany the sulfate nitrate and nitrite were then measured using an ion chromatograph hic 20a super shimadzu japan equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic sa2 analytical column shim pack ic sa2 shimadzu japan the dissolved sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 ammonium was determined using a flow injection analyzer quikchem fia 8000 lachat usa ph and dissolved oxygen were measured with a multiparameter portable meter multi 3420 wtw germany the total organic carbon and total nitrogen were also analyzed toc 5000a shimadzu japan the average thickness was obtained from the chips on a certain carrier using a modified micrometer with an ohmmeter huang et al 1985 after each carrier was taken out from the reactor the excess water was allowed to drain for 5 min then the carrier was mounted on the stage the wires of the ohmmeter were connected with the carrier and the micrometer to form a circuit once the sharp tip of the micrometer touched the biofilm surface the resistance on the ohmmeter sharply increased and the reading on the micrometer was recorded then the tip was forced through the biofilm to touch the carrier surface at this time a second reading was taken the difference of these two readings gave the biofilm thickness since the thickness of biofilm varied slightly from one place to another at a given time about 5 10 thickness measurements were taken randomly from each carrier the average value of these measurements was used in the data calculation the average mass density was calculated based on the specific total solids and the correlated biofilm thickness the sample pretreatment for the surface area analysis followed the methods described by miura et al 2007 biofilm samples attached on the chips were taken from the reactors and immersed in 2 v v glutaraldehyde in 0 1 m phosphate buffer for 2 h subsequently the samples were fixed in 1 osmic acid oso4 for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series 50 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol for 15 min each and then dried with a freeze dryer supermodulyo edwards england and placed in a drying oven before further analysis after the pretreatment the ssa total pore volumes and mean pore diameters of the dry samples were analyzed with a high speed surface area and pore size analyzer nova 3200e quantachrome usa using the brunauer emmett teller bet and the barrett joyner halenda bjh methods extracellular polymeric substances epss were extracted from the biofilm by the formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 polysaccharides were measured using the colorimetric method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 whereas protein was determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard smith et al 1985 2 7 sewer biofilm modeling an previously reported sewer biofilm model was used to simulate the biofilm formation e g thickness and dry density microbial community evolution substrate diffusion and transformation jiang et al 2009 liang et al 2019 the sewer biofilm model is able to simulate the concentration variations of 13 variables within 33 biofilm thin layers via 21 species specific biochemical processes the stoichiometric and kinetic equations and parameters are summarized in tables s1 and s2 which are from jiang et al 2009 three parameters the growth rate constant of srb μsrb the attachment coefficient k att and the detachment coefficient k det were recalibrated according to sensitivity analysis table s3 to estimate the k att and k det which are key parameters to biofilm development the experimental results of long term biofilm thickness variation without fw addition were used for parameter estimation the biofilm thickness profile with fw addition were used for model validation after the mode calibration to determine k att and k det the model was re calibrated again to estimate μ srb sulfide generation was very sensitive to the value of μ srb so that the stratified profiles of sulfide concentrations inside the biofilm samples taken at day 40 were used to estimate μ srb the data taken at the condition of without and with fw addition were used for model calibration and validation respectively the results of parameter estimation was shown in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical characteristics of sewer biofilm the development of the biofilm in the sewer system within 45 days of operation was preliminarily characterized to determine the variations of thickness dry density and ssa as shown in fig 2 the thickness of the sewer biofilm in both systems gradually increased over the first 26 days and then was relatively stable over the remaining 19 days which the fast formation may result from the high air temperature 30 38 c in summer of hong kong during the operation of sewer system fig 2a this suggests that the biofilms reached a steady state in thickness after approximately 1 month s growth when comparing the thicknesses of the biofilms that developed in the two systems the fw addition was found to have led to a significantly thicker biofilm and the average thicknesses of the biofilms with and without fw addition in a steady state were 1 53 0 07 mm and 1 16 0 05 mm respectively the biofilm growth in terms of thickness resulted in a sigmoid curve where the plateau represents the stationary or critical thickness of the biofilm bryers and characklis 1981 lazarova and manem 1995 in other studies biofilm thickness reached 1 3 mm after 40 day s development by using real wastewater of hong kong jiang et al 2009 or in the range of 2 2 2 7 mm with different shear force after 30 day s cultivation using synthetic wastewater xu et al 2017 due to the different hydraulic conditions and wastewater characteristics therefore the thickness of the biofilm developed in this study is comparable with other studies the sewer biofilm was initially formed with a compact structure and a high dry density as found in other studies boaventura and rodrigues 1988 hoehn and ray 1973 ro and neethling 1991 the dry densities then gradually increased over 40 days resulting in a 13 higher dry density of biofilm on average with fw addition than without fw addition the fw addition thus appeared to have facilitated the biofilm growth in terms of greater thickness and larger dry density the ssa pore volume and mean pore diameter are the preferable indicators for quantification of the biofilm s porosity fig 2c and table s4 which is recognized as the structure most instrumental in facilitating liquid transport thus triggering the rudimentary circulation system in the biofilm flemming et al 2016 karimi et al 2015 patel 2005 wilking et al 2013 with the addition of fw the ssa of the biofilm was sharply reduced in the initial phase and stabilized thereafter in contrast the ssa decreased progressively over the whole experimental period in the biofilm without fw addition the trend of ssa is in accordance with the variation of dry density in sewer biofilm fig 2b in which the high ssa and dry density formed a biofilm structure with the gelatinous matrix at the early stage thus facilitating resource capture mass transfer and nutrient conversion 3 2 eps contents of sewer biofilms eps accumulation is essential to biofilm formation and further affects its structure bacterial activity and sewer system performance wang et al 2018 zhang et al 1998 fig 3 gives the results of specific pn and ps content in eps and their respective ratios i e ps pn in both sewer systems the eps content in the biofilms with fw addition was significantly higher than in those without fw addition the synthetic fw applied in this study can provide around 100 7 mg g vs of particulate ps 87 8 mg g vs of particulate pn 111 8 mg l of soluble cod and 2 28 mg n l of nitrogen as extra loading the high eps accumulation in the system with fw addition may be due to both the precipitation of particulate pn and ps in fw and the enhanced biomass growth rate and metabolite production which can derive a higher nutrient concentration from the addition of fw compared with the system that has wastewater as the sole nutrient source in terms of eps concentration the proportion of eps components was more important in determining the characteristics of eps liao et al 2001 for the biofilm without fw addition the observed growing trend of ps pn ratios was that limited ps was accumulated in the initial phase and the ratios gradually increased from 0 14 to 0 45 from day 20 to day 40 which is consistent with other studies ahimou et al 2007 jahn and nielsen 1998 zhang et al 1998 the accumulation of ps and pn in the system with fw addition over the initial 10 days could well explain the relatively lower dry density and higher ssa of the biofilm at day 10 although the ps pn ratio in the system with fw addition decreased at day 20 and increased gradually from day 20 40 in the normal wastewater sewer system the fw system still had a higher ps pn value this implies that the fw addition induced massive accumulations of ps and pn in eps for biofilm development facilitating a stable and strong biofilm structure 3 3 fish images and sulfide production potential from sewer biofilms a dense biofilm with high eps content in a sewer with fw addition may limit the diffusion of dissolved oxygen and facilitate the growth of anaerobic microbes such as srb thus the populations of srb in biofilms with and without fw addition were visualized and quantified using fish with a confocal laser scanning microscope fig 4 in the abundant total bacteria in the biofilms srb were scarcely present in that without fw addition whereas numerous srb were distributed in the biofilm with fw addition the quantified population of srb in the biofilm with fw addition was around 3 4 times greater than that without fw addition calculated from 10 images using imagej the fw addition therefore appeared to induce this increase in the srb population of the biofilms which could enhance potential sulfide production especially in pressure pipeline the pressure pipeline with anaerobic condition is not included in this study however the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer biofilm may provide useful information for future studies on pressure sewer system therefore the biogenic sulfide production potential of the sewer biofilm with and without fw addition was then examined in the batch test fig s2 in which nitrogen gas was first purged to establish an anaerobic environment although the structure of biofilm was damaged the purpose of the test was to verify the activity of srb and its sulfide production potential the spatial concentrations of total dissolved sulfide and orp in the biofilm samples were profiled using microelectrodes with the biofilm submerged in the real sewage fig 5 the fw addition generally resulted in higher biogenic sulfide production in both the bulk and biofilm phases during the batch test around 2 2 times more specific sulfide production potential was determined in the biofilm with fw addition than that without fw addition 0 117 versus 0 052 g s m2 after a 12 h test which the sulfide production rate is comparable with other studies such as 0 013 0 079 g s m2 h with do from 0 to 5 mg s l in gravity sewer biofilm norsker et al 1995 0 0 2 g s m2 h under different soluble cod levels nielsen et al 1992 this indicates that the biogenic sulfide production capability of biofilm was enhanced by adding fw in the biofilm phase dissolved oxygen was depleted within the outer 0 4 mm of biofilm do 0 2 mg l data not shown and the total dissolved sulfide was generated from the deeper biofilm zone with the highest sulfide level for the fw sample being 24 μmol l and 1 μmol l without the addition of fw this is consistent with the population of srb in the fish images fig 4 the profile of orp sharply decreased as the thickness of the biofilm increased further confirming its anaerobic zones with the depletion of oxygen in biofilms this suggests that fw addition promoted the growth of srb in the sewer biofilm which may cause a significant increase in sulfide production from biofilms in sewers especially pressure sewers hence it is deemed necessary to investigate the impacts of fw addition on sulfide production in the pressure sewer in future studies 3 4 modelling of sulfide profile and microbial distribution in biofilm the above findings suggest that srb growth can be facilitated with an associated enhancement of sulfide production in the biofilm in a gravity sewer with the addition of fw which can be further confirmed by model based investigation the sewer biofilm model jiang et al 2009 was used and calibrated in this study with the parameters determined in model calibration table s3 the calibrated model well simulated the development of biofilm thickness and the sulfide generation in the sewer biofilm without fw addition fig 6 the results indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the variations in developments of biofilm growth and microbial activities at the condition of no fw addition the differences between the predicted values and measured values are mainly attributed to the fluctuations of wastewater quality i e sewage collected from a real sewer and the maintenance of the sewer system during the experiments causing a less ideal fit the model validation was performed with the data taken in the sewer with fw addition fig 6 the model was clearly good enough to predict the changes of thickness and sulfide generation in the biofilm with fw addition fw addition in the sewers changed the wastewater compositions thus further affecting the biofilm structure and microbial activities the components in the biofilm were also simulated to evaluate the effects of fw addition on the distribution of srb fig 6c shows the spatial levels of srb over the biofilm depth with and without fw addition on day 40 the increased thickness of the biofilm could lead to the accumulation of larger proportions of srb in both conditions resulting in higher sulfide production in the biofilm the addition of fw may also induce more accumulation of srb in the biofilm than that without fw addition provoking more sulfide production the modeling results further validate that the addition of fw will lead to a thicker biofilm a higher srb population and greater sulfide production in a sewer biofilm this effect can be quantitatively assessed by the sewer biofilm model 4 discussion this study has demonstrated that the addition of fw can significantly affect sewer biofilms via changes in structure and heterogeneity along with the influence of biofilm on the srb population and sulfide production the composition of fw applied in this study was based on the comprehensive survey of household fw in hong kong in our previous study zan et al 2018 although the case study is hong kong the major constituents of fw i e fruits vegetables starchy food and meat are similar in other areas bolzonella et al 2003 kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 according to hkepd 2015 and hkdsd 2018 the average ratio of household fw to sewage is around 0 86 g l 2397 metric tons of household fw versus 2 8 million m3 of sewage on a daily basis which is in the range of this study i e 0 8 to 1 0 table 1 hence the results obtained can be universally applied and are valuable in revealing the effects of fw addition on sewer biofilm the addition of fw can facilitate the growth of biofilm with a greater thickness and higher density fig 2 this can be attributed to the abundant substrate loadings provided by fw addition because the growth and activity of biofilm are normally confined by the initial concentration and availability of substrates ehlinger et al 1987 lazarova and manem 1995 speitel and digiano 1987 van loosdrecht et al 1995 the self organized eps enhanced by fw addition can also mediate the development of the biofilm architecture providing mechanical stability to the biofilm and directly determining the living environment of the bacteria bird et al 2011 flemming et al 2016 persat et al 2015 however the thicker and denser biofilm limits the diffusion of dissolved oxygen leading to a decline of the orp in deep layers and the enlargement of the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm with the addition of fw the accumulation of srb was further improved by the changed structure of the sewer biofilm fig 4 both the experimental results and the model predictions suggested that the srb population in the sewer biofilm with fw addition was much higher than that in the sewer biofilm without fw addition after 40 days of cultivation figs 4 and 6c sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer biofilm was massively enhanced after the addition of fw fig 5 and fig s2 this implies that the effects of the addition of fw on sewer biofilm properties and sulfide production potential in sewers must be carefully evaluated before the large scale implementation of fwd in households specifically the ratio of fwd installation in households will change the ratio of fw to sewage in sewer systems in hong kong the highest fw to sewage ratio is 2 g l hkepd 2015 hkwsd 2017 meaning that all households equipped with fwd could result in all household fw entering the sewage system 326 g over 160 l per capita per day with a different fw to sewage ratio the above findings could change therefore a calibrated sewer biofilm model was used to simulate the effects of various fw to sewage ratios on biofilm formation and the sulfide production potential in a gravity sewer fig 7 shows the predicted biofilm thickness the average srb population and the maximum sulfide production with various fw to sewage ratios the effects of the dosage of fw on biofilm thickness is insignificant in comparison with the other two predicted values importantly the maximum sulfide production potential can be enhanced by 5 45 times from 0 2 to 2 g l of fw to sewage ratio further implying that the dosage of fw may promote sulfide production in sewer biofilm and thus provoke negative sulfide induced effects in a gravity sewer the results reveal that the sewer biofilm model applied in this work could be an effective and useful tool to assess the effects of fw addition on sewer processes in various conditions moreover the applied conditions of sewer system in this study are meaningful for the understandings of sewer processes in gravity pipes because the worst condition was applied in this study for investigations of all the potential negative impacts of fw addition on sewers however it should be noted that the hydraulic condition wastewater quality e g nutrient concentration and sulfate levels and types of sewer system can vary spatially and temporally in sewer systems and further study is therefore required particularly in rising mains sewers 5 conclusions this study evaluated the effects of fw addition on biofilm characteristics srb population growth and sulfide production potential in biofilm in a gravity sewer the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the addition of fw enhanced the growth of sewer biofilm via abundant substrate loading in terms of thickness and high dry density 2 the denser biofilm with a higher eps content induced by the addition of fw limited oxygen diffusion enlarged the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm promoted a substantial increase in the srb population and enhanced the sulfide production potential in a gravity sewer 3 the modeling results with different fw to sewage ratios by a calibrated sewer biofilm model suggest that a higher fw to sewage ratio would significantly promote sulfide production and srb accumulation in a sewer biofilm the model can be an effective and useful tool to assess the effects of fw addition on

change the substrate composition and organic fraction of sewage thus affecting biofilm formation and its characteristics and the sewer processes however knowledge of this issue is currently limited hence the objectives of this study were to assess the effect of fw addition on biofilm formation srb population and sulfide production potential in a gravity sewer system variations in biofilm characteristics were monitored during biofilm formation the srb population and sulfide production potential in the biofilm were investigated by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and microelectrodes to provide clear insights into sewer biofilm processes a dynamic sewer biofilm model developed by jiang et al 2009 was used to simulate the process of biofilm formation with or without the addition of fw this sewer biofilm model can dynamically simulate the evolution of biofilm and its associated microbial activities while considering variations in the hydraulic condition and wastewater quality which are important factors in the microbial transformation induced by the addition of fw in gravity sewers 2 materials and methods 2 1 pilot scale sewer reactor to investigate all the potential negative impacts from fw addition on sewer system the sewer reactors were designed to mimic the worst condition in gravity sewers the parameters design followed the minimum required values in the design criteria hkdsd 2013 montes et al 2017 two sets of pilot scale sewer systems made from upvc tubing were constructed on the campus of the hong kong university of science and technology due to the use of seawater for toilet flushing in hong kong upvc is applied for sewer pipes with small diameters to reduce sewer corrosion hkdsd 2013 hkwsd 2017 the reactors were 5 m long with an inner diameter of 150 mm which is within the minimal diameter ranges of sewer pipes in hong kong hkdsd 2013 moreover the slope of 0 015 and velocity of 0 3 m s were designed to maintain a minimum self cleaning capability in pipes based on the standard bong 2014 montes et al 2017 constant flow was provided by the pumps p2 with the velocity of 0 3 m s but it could lower to 0 1 m s occasionally the schematic diagram of the pilot scale sewer systems is shown in fig 1 and fig s1 municipal wastewater originating from the real sewer on campus was continuously injected into the sewer reactors as the influent the sewage was cycled by a pump i e p2 in the system and descended by gravity to the sewer reactors i and ii i e r1 and r2 and the sewage overflow was the effluent from tanks iii and iv the sewer system was covered by black sheets to keep the reactors in the dark the sewer systems were operated in summer which the air temperature varied from 30 to 38 c the dissolved oxygen in both sewer systems were higher than 2 mg l during the entire operation period the general process of the sewer operation and the characteristics of raw sewage and fw as influent are summarized in table 1 2 2 monitoring the sewer biofilm growth sewer biofilm experiments were set up in the pilot sewer reactors with one as the experiment reactor r2 with fw and real wastewater added and the other as the control reactor r1 only with real wastewater fw used in this study contains of 50 fruits 20 vegetables 20 starchy food and 10 meat which is the typical composition of fw from households in hong kong according to our previous survey zan et al 2018 fresh fw was prepared twice a day with the treatment of fwd and then pumped into the system to ensure a ratio of 1 g fw l sewage biofilms were developed on specifically designed pvc chips 2 5 cm 2 5 cm embedded into a carrier each carrier containing 6 pieces of pvc chips and 15 of carriers were installed in from 2 5 m to 5 m of the sewer reactors the biofilms samples from two chips were collected for the physicochemical microstructure and morphology parameters measurement around 60 80 of fullness in the pipes was achieved to maintain the biofilm submerging in the water phase the biofilm thickness was monitored with a certain carrier located at 4 m of the pipe from day 9 and then every 2 days four different random selection of area on chips was conducted for thickness measurement the biofilm dry density the specific surface area ssa the total pore volume extracellular polymeric substances eps including protein pn and polysaccharides ps and the biofilm microstructure were examined at 10 day intervals each parameter was determined from an intact chip of the carrier in similar area with duplicate samples and the chip can be only used for once the details of the analytical methods are presented in the following section 2 3 fish the biofilm samples developed on day 40 were taken from the locations of 2 5 m 3 5 m and 4 5 m in the sewer and detached from the carriers due to the high thickness and low abundance of srb in biofilm the collected biofilm samples from different locations were washed by phosphate buffer saline pbs solution mixed and dispersed in a 2 ml centrifuge tube then the treated biofilms were settled for 10 min and the supernatant was removed by the dropper the settled biofilms were further collected and fixed overnight in 4 w v paraformaldehyde at 4 c followed by the slide preparation cell hybridization was carried out as described by amann et al 1995 and guo et al 2017 the oligonucleotide probe groupings used for fish were made to cover the appropriate ranges eubmix eub338 eub338 ii and eub338 iii and sulfate reducing bacteria srbmix srb385 srb385db all probes were used at a formamide hybridization level of 35 after hybridization the biofilm samples were examined with an lsm 710 confocal laser scanning microscope carl zeiss germany equipped with a diode laser 405 nm an argon ml laser 458 488 514 nm a dass laser 560 nm and a hene laser 633 nm the tests were duplicated with around 10 images at different locations with each examination eub and srb were quantified from randomly selected areas based on the relative abundance of blue and red pixels in 10 or more images in imagej national institutes of health usa 2 4 sulfide production potential of sewer biofilm batch tests were conducted to further investigate the sulfide production potential of the sewer biofilm to verify the activity of srb for 12 h biofilm carriers and raw sewage were collected from the pilot scale sewer reactors on day 40 for each batch test sewer biofilm was carefully scraped off two chips with an area of 12 5 cm2 and then put into a 50 ml falcon conical centrifuge tubes the tubes were then filled with raw sewage which was purged with pure nitrogen gas for 15 min to reduce the dissolved oxygen concentration in advance the filled tubes were sealed with parafilm and covered by the cap a digital rotator mx rd pro dlab china was applied at a speed of 40 rpm the tests lasted 12 h and the samples were collected at 0 initial value 6 and 12 h for sulfide measurement the batch tests of sewer biofilm from the two reactors were conducted simultaneously the sulfide concentration produced at different times was calculated based on the specific area of sewer biofilm applied in the batch test i e g s m2 2 5 microelectrodes analysis biofilm carriers were taken from the reactors on day 40 and submerged in a 250 ml beaker containing 150 ml of 0 22 μm filtered raw sewage intact biofilms on chips submerged in real sewage were used for measurement of h2s and oxidation reduction potential orp at different depths of biofilm samples the spatial concentration of h2s and orp in the biofilm was profiled using a microsensor system equipped with a h2s sensor h2s 25 unisense denmark and an orp sensor orp 25 unisense denmark using an ag agcl open ended electrode as reference the outside diameter of the sensor tips ranged from 20 to 30 μm the microelectrodes were firstly calibrated according to the manufacturer s instructions measurements were made with h2s and orp microelectrodes mounted on the motor driven micromanipulator unisense mm33 2 denmark the tips of the electrodes were positioned above the biofilms on the chips the micromanipulator was interfaced to a desktop computer and run by a sensortrace profiling program profiling tests were conducted with a step of 0 1 mm from the water phase to biofilm phase in triplicate total dissolved sulfide was calculated based on the ph and temperature with measured value of h2s 2 6 chemical and physical analysis total solids ts and volatile solids vs were determined according to the standard methods apha 2005 sulfate nitrate nitrite and ammonia were filtrated through a 0 45 μm filter millex hv millipore germany the sulfate nitrate and nitrite were then measured using an ion chromatograph hic 20a super shimadzu japan equipped with a conductivity detector and an ic sa2 analytical column shim pack ic sa2 shimadzu japan the dissolved sulfide was measured using the methylene blue method apha 2005 ammonium was determined using a flow injection analyzer quikchem fia 8000 lachat usa ph and dissolved oxygen were measured with a multiparameter portable meter multi 3420 wtw germany the total organic carbon and total nitrogen were also analyzed toc 5000a shimadzu japan the average thickness was obtained from the chips on a certain carrier using a modified micrometer with an ohmmeter huang et al 1985 after each carrier was taken out from the reactor the excess water was allowed to drain for 5 min then the carrier was mounted on the stage the wires of the ohmmeter were connected with the carrier and the micrometer to form a circuit once the sharp tip of the micrometer touched the biofilm surface the resistance on the ohmmeter sharply increased and the reading on the micrometer was recorded then the tip was forced through the biofilm to touch the carrier surface at this time a second reading was taken the difference of these two readings gave the biofilm thickness since the thickness of biofilm varied slightly from one place to another at a given time about 5 10 thickness measurements were taken randomly from each carrier the average value of these measurements was used in the data calculation the average mass density was calculated based on the specific total solids and the correlated biofilm thickness the sample pretreatment for the surface area analysis followed the methods described by miura et al 2007 biofilm samples attached on the chips were taken from the reactors and immersed in 2 v v glutaraldehyde in 0 1 m phosphate buffer for 2 h subsequently the samples were fixed in 1 osmic acid oso4 for 2 h the fixed samples were dehydrated in an ethanol series 50 70 80 90 and 100 ethanol for 15 min each and then dried with a freeze dryer supermodulyo edwards england and placed in a drying oven before further analysis after the pretreatment the ssa total pore volumes and mean pore diameters of the dry samples were analyzed with a high speed surface area and pore size analyzer nova 3200e quantachrome usa using the brunauer emmett teller bet and the barrett joyner halenda bjh methods extracellular polymeric substances epss were extracted from the biofilm by the formaldehyde naoh method liu and fang 2002 polysaccharides were measured using the colorimetric method with glucose as the standard dubois et al 1956 whereas protein was determined by a bicinchoninic acid assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard smith et al 1985 2 7 sewer biofilm modeling an previously reported sewer biofilm model was used to simulate the biofilm formation e g thickness and dry density microbial community evolution substrate diffusion and transformation jiang et al 2009 liang et al 2019 the sewer biofilm model is able to simulate the concentration variations of 13 variables within 33 biofilm thin layers via 21 species specific biochemical processes the stoichiometric and kinetic equations and parameters are summarized in tables s1 and s2 which are from jiang et al 2009 three parameters the growth rate constant of srb μsrb the attachment coefficient k att and the detachment coefficient k det were recalibrated according to sensitivity analysis table s3 to estimate the k att and k det which are key parameters to biofilm development the experimental results of long term biofilm thickness variation without fw addition were used for parameter estimation the biofilm thickness profile with fw addition were used for model validation after the mode calibration to determine k att and k det the model was re calibrated again to estimate μ srb sulfide generation was very sensitive to the value of μ srb so that the stratified profiles of sulfide concentrations inside the biofilm samples taken at day 40 were used to estimate μ srb the data taken at the condition of without and with fw addition were used for model calibration and validation respectively the results of parameter estimation was shown in table s3 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical characteristics of sewer biofilm the development of the biofilm in the sewer system within 45 days of operation was preliminarily characterized to determine the variations of thickness dry density and ssa as shown in fig 2 the thickness of the sewer biofilm in both systems gradually increased over the first 26 days and then was relatively stable over the remaining 19 days which the fast formation may result from the high air temperature 30 38 c in summer of hong kong during the operation of sewer system fig 2a this suggests that the biofilms reached a steady state in thickness after approximately 1 month s growth when comparing the thicknesses of the biofilms that developed in the two systems the fw addition was found to have led to a significantly thicker biofilm and the average thicknesses of the biofilms with and without fw addition in a steady state were 1 53 0 07 mm and 1 16 0 05 mm respectively the biofilm growth in terms of thickness resulted in a sigmoid curve where the plateau represents the stationary or critical thickness of the biofilm bryers and characklis 1981 lazarova and manem 1995 in other studies biofilm thickness reached 1 3 mm after 40 day s development by using real wastewater of hong kong jiang et al 2009 or in the range of 2 2 2 7 mm with different shear force after 30 day s cultivation using synthetic wastewater xu et al 2017 due to the different hydraulic conditions and wastewater characteristics therefore the thickness of the biofilm developed in this study is comparable with other studies the sewer biofilm was initially formed with a compact structure and a high dry density as found in other studies boaventura and rodrigues 1988 hoehn and ray 1973 ro and neethling 1991 the dry densities then gradually increased over 40 days resulting in a 13 higher dry density of biofilm on average with fw addition than without fw addition the fw addition thus appeared to have facilitated the biofilm growth in terms of greater thickness and larger dry density the ssa pore volume and mean pore diameter are the preferable indicators for quantification of the biofilm s porosity fig 2c and table s4 which is recognized as the structure most instrumental in facilitating liquid transport thus triggering the rudimentary circulation system in the biofilm flemming et al 2016 karimi et al 2015 patel 2005 wilking et al 2013 with the addition of fw the ssa of the biofilm was sharply reduced in the initial phase and stabilized thereafter in contrast the ssa decreased progressively over the whole experimental period in the biofilm without fw addition the trend of ssa is in accordance with the variation of dry density in sewer biofilm fig 2b in which the high ssa and dry density formed a biofilm structure with the gelatinous matrix at the early stage thus facilitating resource capture mass transfer and nutrient conversion 3 2 eps contents of sewer biofilms eps accumulation is essential to biofilm formation and further affects its structure bacterial activity and sewer system performance wang et al 2018 zhang et al 1998 fig 3 gives the results of specific pn and ps content in eps and their respective ratios i e ps pn in both sewer systems the eps content in the biofilms with fw addition was significantly higher than in those without fw addition the synthetic fw applied in this study can provide around 100 7 mg g vs of particulate ps 87 8 mg g vs of particulate pn 111 8 mg l of soluble cod and 2 28 mg n l of nitrogen as extra loading the high eps accumulation in the system with fw addition may be due to both the precipitation of particulate pn and ps in fw and the enhanced biomass growth rate and metabolite production which can derive a higher nutrient concentration from the addition of fw compared with the system that has wastewater as the sole nutrient source in terms of eps concentration the proportion of eps components was more important in determining the characteristics of eps liao et al 2001 for the biofilm without fw addition the observed growing trend of ps pn ratios was that limited ps was accumulated in the initial phase and the ratios gradually increased from 0 14 to 0 45 from day 20 to day 40 which is consistent with other studies ahimou et al 2007 jahn and nielsen 1998 zhang et al 1998 the accumulation of ps and pn in the system with fw addition over the initial 10 days could well explain the relatively lower dry density and higher ssa of the biofilm at day 10 although the ps pn ratio in the system with fw addition decreased at day 20 and increased gradually from day 20 40 in the normal wastewater sewer system the fw system still had a higher ps pn value this implies that the fw addition induced massive accumulations of ps and pn in eps for biofilm development facilitating a stable and strong biofilm structure 3 3 fish images and sulfide production potential from sewer biofilms a dense biofilm with high eps content in a sewer with fw addition may limit the diffusion of dissolved oxygen and facilitate the growth of anaerobic microbes such as srb thus the populations of srb in biofilms with and without fw addition were visualized and quantified using fish with a confocal laser scanning microscope fig 4 in the abundant total bacteria in the biofilms srb were scarcely present in that without fw addition whereas numerous srb were distributed in the biofilm with fw addition the quantified population of srb in the biofilm with fw addition was around 3 4 times greater than that without fw addition calculated from 10 images using imagej the fw addition therefore appeared to induce this increase in the srb population of the biofilms which could enhance potential sulfide production especially in pressure pipeline the pressure pipeline with anaerobic condition is not included in this study however the sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer biofilm may provide useful information for future studies on pressure sewer system therefore the biogenic sulfide production potential of the sewer biofilm with and without fw addition was then examined in the batch test fig s2 in which nitrogen gas was first purged to establish an anaerobic environment although the structure of biofilm was damaged the purpose of the test was to verify the activity of srb and its sulfide production potential the spatial concentrations of total dissolved sulfide and orp in the biofilm samples were profiled using microelectrodes with the biofilm submerged in the real sewage fig 5 the fw addition generally resulted in higher biogenic sulfide production in both the bulk and biofilm phases during the batch test around 2 2 times more specific sulfide production potential was determined in the biofilm with fw addition than that without fw addition 0 117 versus 0 052 g s m2 after a 12 h test which the sulfide production rate is comparable with other studies such as 0 013 0 079 g s m2 h with do from 0 to 5 mg s l in gravity sewer biofilm norsker et al 1995 0 0 2 g s m2 h under different soluble cod levels nielsen et al 1992 this indicates that the biogenic sulfide production capability of biofilm was enhanced by adding fw in the biofilm phase dissolved oxygen was depleted within the outer 0 4 mm of biofilm do 0 2 mg l data not shown and the total dissolved sulfide was generated from the deeper biofilm zone with the highest sulfide level for the fw sample being 24 μmol l and 1 μmol l without the addition of fw this is consistent with the population of srb in the fish images fig 4 the profile of orp sharply decreased as the thickness of the biofilm increased further confirming its anaerobic zones with the depletion of oxygen in biofilms this suggests that fw addition promoted the growth of srb in the sewer biofilm which may cause a significant increase in sulfide production from biofilms in sewers especially pressure sewers hence it is deemed necessary to investigate the impacts of fw addition on sulfide production in the pressure sewer in future studies 3 4 modelling of sulfide profile and microbial distribution in biofilm the above findings suggest that srb growth can be facilitated with an associated enhancement of sulfide production in the biofilm in a gravity sewer with the addition of fw which can be further confirmed by model based investigation the sewer biofilm model jiang et al 2009 was used and calibrated in this study with the parameters determined in model calibration table s3 the calibrated model well simulated the development of biofilm thickness and the sulfide generation in the sewer biofilm without fw addition fig 6 the results indicate that the model is capable of reproducing the variations in developments of biofilm growth and microbial activities at the condition of no fw addition the differences between the predicted values and measured values are mainly attributed to the fluctuations of wastewater quality i e sewage collected from a real sewer and the maintenance of the sewer system during the experiments causing a less ideal fit the model validation was performed with the data taken in the sewer with fw addition fig 6 the model was clearly good enough to predict the changes of thickness and sulfide generation in the biofilm with fw addition fw addition in the sewers changed the wastewater compositions thus further affecting the biofilm structure and microbial activities the components in the biofilm were also simulated to evaluate the effects of fw addition on the distribution of srb fig 6c shows the spatial levels of srb over the biofilm depth with and without fw addition on day 40 the increased thickness of the biofilm could lead to the accumulation of larger proportions of srb in both conditions resulting in higher sulfide production in the biofilm the addition of fw may also induce more accumulation of srb in the biofilm than that without fw addition provoking more sulfide production the modeling results further validate that the addition of fw will lead to a thicker biofilm a higher srb population and greater sulfide production in a sewer biofilm this effect can be quantitatively assessed by the sewer biofilm model 4 discussion this study has demonstrated that the addition of fw can significantly affect sewer biofilms via changes in structure and heterogeneity along with the influence of biofilm on the srb population and sulfide production the composition of fw applied in this study was based on the comprehensive survey of household fw in hong kong in our previous study zan et al 2018 although the case study is hong kong the major constituents of fw i e fruits vegetables starchy food and meat are similar in other areas bolzonella et al 2003 kim et al 2015 zan et al 2018 according to hkepd 2015 and hkdsd 2018 the average ratio of household fw to sewage is around 0 86 g l 2397 metric tons of household fw versus 2 8 million m3 of sewage on a daily basis which is in the range of this study i e 0 8 to 1 0 table 1 hence the results obtained can be universally applied and are valuable in revealing the effects of fw addition on sewer biofilm the addition of fw can facilitate the growth of biofilm with a greater thickness and higher density fig 2 this can be attributed to the abundant substrate loadings provided by fw addition because the growth and activity of biofilm are normally confined by the initial concentration and availability of substrates ehlinger et al 1987 lazarova and manem 1995 speitel and digiano 1987 van loosdrecht et al 1995 the self organized eps enhanced by fw addition can also mediate the development of the biofilm architecture providing mechanical stability to the biofilm and directly determining the living environment of the bacteria bird et al 2011 flemming et al 2016 persat et al 2015 however the thicker and denser biofilm limits the diffusion of dissolved oxygen leading to a decline of the orp in deep layers and the enlargement of the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm with the addition of fw the accumulation of srb was further improved by the changed structure of the sewer biofilm fig 4 both the experimental results and the model predictions suggested that the srb population in the sewer biofilm with fw addition was much higher than that in the sewer biofilm without fw addition after 40 days of cultivation figs 4 and 6c sulfide production potential in the gravity sewer biofilm was massively enhanced after the addition of fw fig 5 and fig s2 this implies that the effects of the addition of fw on sewer biofilm properties and sulfide production potential in sewers must be carefully evaluated before the large scale implementation of fwd in households specifically the ratio of fwd installation in households will change the ratio of fw to sewage in sewer systems in hong kong the highest fw to sewage ratio is 2 g l hkepd 2015 hkwsd 2017 meaning that all households equipped with fwd could result in all household fw entering the sewage system 326 g over 160 l per capita per day with a different fw to sewage ratio the above findings could change therefore a calibrated sewer biofilm model was used to simulate the effects of various fw to sewage ratios on biofilm formation and the sulfide production potential in a gravity sewer fig 7 shows the predicted biofilm thickness the average srb population and the maximum sulfide production with various fw to sewage ratios the effects of the dosage of fw on biofilm thickness is insignificant in comparison with the other two predicted values importantly the maximum sulfide production potential can be enhanced by 5 45 times from 0 2 to 2 g l of fw to sewage ratio further implying that the dosage of fw may promote sulfide production in sewer biofilm and thus provoke negative sulfide induced effects in a gravity sewer the results reveal that the sewer biofilm model applied in this work could be an effective and useful tool to assess the effects of fw addition on sewer processes in various conditions moreover the applied conditions of sewer system in this study are meaningful for the understandings of sewer processes in gravity pipes because the worst condition was applied in this study for investigations of all the potential negative impacts of fw addition on sewers however it should be noted that the hydraulic condition wastewater quality e g nutrient concentration and sulfate levels and types of sewer system can vary spatially and temporally in sewer systems and further study is therefore required particularly in rising mains sewers 5 conclusions this study evaluated the effects of fw addition on biofilm characteristics srb population growth and sulfide production potential in biofilm in a gravity sewer the main findings are summarized as follows 1 the addition of fw enhanced the growth of sewer biofilm via abundant substrate loading in terms of thickness and high dry density 2 the denser biofilm with a higher eps content induced by the addition of fw limited oxygen diffusion enlarged the anaerobic area in the sewer biofilm promoted a substantial increase in the srb population and enhanced the sulfide production potential in a gravity sewer 3 the modeling results with different fw to sewage ratios by a calibrated sewer biofilm model suggest that a higher fw to sewage ratio would significantly promote sulfide production and srb accumulation in a sewer biofilm the model can be an effective and useful tool to assess the effects of fw addition on

18846,aerobic granular sludge ags is a powerful biotechnology to remove various heavy metal loid s from wastewater but not including arsenic as in this study a novel manganese oxidizing aerobic granular sludge mn ags was developed to remove as from organic wastewater eight sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of as removal by mn ags the immobilized as in the granular sludge was characterized by sequencing extraction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds and raman spectroscopy oxidation pathways for as and their contributions in mn ags were evaluated by seven batch experiments under different conditions the results indicated that as removal efficiency was much higher by mn ags than by ags in mn ags as iii was efficiently oxidized into as v 74 6 82 6 and then mostly bound on amorphous ferrihydrite and biogenic mn oxides bio mnox 56 2 65 0 while metal arsenates such as ferric arsenate were not detected importantly as removal was greatly improved by a small addition of fe ii in mn ags this might be primarily caused by fenton reactions because this improvement was removed when h2o2 self generated in mn ags was scavenged by exogenous catalase cat this study provided a novel extension of the traditional ags technology to treat as in organic wastewater with an acceptable degree of efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge ags arsenic oxidation biogenic mn oxides bio mnox amorphous ferrihydrite biogenic hydrogen peroxide h2o2 1 introduction arsenic as contamination is a critical worldwide issue and as has adverse effects on human health causing a variety of diseases arsenic frequently co exists in many natural ore minerals including copper and lead ores and is mined as a by product the majority of the associated as is terminally transferred into waste and wastewater after ore dressing and dearsenifying processes shi et al 2017 arsenic in industrial wastewater must be removed before discharge to comply with government regulations many technologies based on physical chemical and biological methods have been developed to treat as containing wastewater including adsorption precipitation coagulation membrane filtration ion exchange and capacitive deionization kim et al 2017 luong et al 2018 among them microbially mediated adsorption followed by oxidation seems a promising technology biological aerobic granular sludge ags has been widely investigated for heavy metal loid s removal from wastewater while ags is an effective bio sorption tool for most metal loid s it is not effective for as sarma and tay 2018 wang et al 2018 the surface of ags is usually negatively charged and thereby can easily adsorb and remove cationic positively charged heavy metals from wastewater including copper ii zinc ii lead ii and cadmium ii nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 however as species in wastewater including arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are negatively charged or neutral in normal ph ranges kwok et al 2018 ags may repel as oxyanions in solution which results in the low efficiency of as removal wang et al 2018 of the two as species as v is much less toxic and mobile than as iii romano et al 2017 therefore oxidation of as iii to as v is generally a key step of as treatment because as iii is usually the dominant as species in wastewater and as v can be rapidly removed through adsorption and precipitation villalobos et al 2014 oxidation coupled with subsequent adsorption or precipitation is therefore a popular strategy to remove as from wastewater and ground water andrianisa et al 2008 katsoyiannis et al 2004 chemical and biological methods have been proposed to oxidize as iii and microbial processes are generally regarded as an economical way li et al 2016 many physiologically diverse arsenic oxidizing bacteria asob have been cultivated and can oxidize as iii to as v with oxygen nitrate or chlorate as an electron acceptor wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015a several bioreactors have been operated successfully to oxidize as iii including biofilm and activated sludge reactors andrianisa et al 2008 ito et al 2012 li et al 2016 peng et al 2018 however relatively low rates of microbial as iii oxidation and poor adsorption of as species on biomass significantly limit its practical application biogenic mn oxides bio mnox trivalent or quadrivalent manganese mn iii iv are produced by diverse manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob or fungi from the reduced manganese mn ii in both pure and mixed cultures romano et al 2017 bio mnox is highly reactive and has a large surface area for adsorption he et al 2019a tran et al 2018 bio mnox therefore can oxidize and remove many pollutants including as iii bai et al 2016 gude et al 2016 he et al 2018 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2015 in previous studies bio mnox was usually prepared ex situ and added to wastewater or ground water for as treatment forrez et al 2011 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2015 such approaches improved the stability and efficiency of as removal but largely raised process complexity and operating costs additionally the released mn ii polluted the effluent and inhibited the further reaction of bio mnox gude et al 2017 only a few studies produced bio mnox in situ in bioreactors to remove pollutants from wastewater cao et al 2015 and matsushita et al 2018 successfully enriched mnob in downflow hanging sponge bioreactors for producing bio mnox and removed heavy metals of nickel ii and cobalt ii from wastewater zhang et al 2015b added mn ii to two aerated biofilters fed with secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants and found that diclofenac could be eliminated by bio mnox moreover some mnob also participate in pollutant removal directly for instance pseudomonas putida p putida a well investigated bacterium of mnob not only produces bio mnox but also directly oxidizes as iii to oxidize as v through its biological metabolism chang et al 2018 therefore we predict that cultivating mnob and producing bio mnox in ags will combine the advantages of both biological and chemical approaches and may be a potentially promising way to oxidize and remove as from wastewater in the present study a novel manganese oxidizing aerobic granular sludge mn ags was developed by long term addition of mn ii to the medium the potential for as oxidation and removal by both mn ags and ags was investigated the speciation of immobilized as in sludge was characterized and the pathways of as iii oxidation were analyzed through a series of batch experiments based on the advantages of mn ags the ags technology can be extended to efficiently remove as from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation eight sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of as removal by mn ags and the traditional ags mn ags and ags granules were harvested from two parent reactors that had been operated for more than three months with glucose as the carbon source the operation of the two parent reactors was identical and similar to those of the sbrs in this work an additional mn ii of 10 40 mg l was supplied in the mn ags parent reactor the eight sbrs in this study were divided into four groups ags with low as iii loading 2 5 mg l of as in influent ags with high as iii loading 25 mg l of as in influent mn ags with low as iii loading and mn ags with high as iii loading the eight sbrs were identical

sludge a five step sequencing extraction method originally designed for soil as analysis kim et al 2014 was utilized in this study sludge was sampled and centrifuged at 5000 g a 0 5 g pellet was sampled and extracted by ammonium sulfate ammonium dihydrogen phosphate ammonium oxalate ascorbic acid and aqua regia in sequence the extracted as was exchangeable i specifically adsorbed ii bound to amorphous fe mn oxides iii bound to crystalline fe mn oxides iv and residual phases v respectively valence analysis of as was performed only on the first three phases because as valence changed during extraction in the last two steps reacted with ascorbic acid and aqua regia the detailed procedure is given in table s1 2 3 batch experiments the manganese oxidizing activities of ags and mn ags obtained from the parent reactors were measured by batch experiments in triplicate then 10 ml granule washed with fresh medium after sampling was mixed with 40 ml fresh medium in 150 ml conical flasks the medium was identical to the artificial wastewater above the assays were carried out on a shaking table at 150 rpm and 25 c mn ii in solution was monitored every 2 h and mn iii iv in sludge was measured before and after each experiment in addition granules were stained by leukoberbelin blue lbb a specific stain for mn iii iv and granules containing bio mnox present as blue to distinguish the pathways of as oxidation in mn ags seven batch experiments were performed in triplicate the seven batch experiments were 1 group sterilized mn ags sludge was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c for 15

supernatant was sampled every 2 h and ph was adjusted at about 6 2 after each sampling as iii total as fe ii and h2o2 in solution were measured immediately 2 4 chemical analyses liquid samples were filtered through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membranes before measurements cod and suspended solid ss were determined by apha standard methods apha 2005 ph was monitored using a fe20 ph meter mettler toledo shanghai as iii and total as were measured using a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer hg afs afs 8220 jitian china and as v concentration was calculated by subtracting the value of as iii from the total as concentration as previously described bai et al 2016 total dissolved fe and mn were assumed to be fe ii and mn ii and measured by colorimetric methods using bipyridine and formaldehyde oxime as chromogenic reagents respectively h2o2 was detected using a modified n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method katsoyiannis et al 2008 and a hydrogen peroxide sensor iso hpo 100 world precision instruments usa in the modified dpd method a 2 ml sample was immediately added with 200 μl bpy 30 mm in 1 mm hclo4 solution 100 μl na2edta 0 1 m and 400 μl phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 6 0 0 5 m in turn next 50 μl dpd 1 0 1 m h2so4 and 50 μl peroxidase pod 100 u ml were added after 1 min the absorbance was measured at 552 nm by a spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan to determine the mn iii iv level in sludge 2 ml sludge was sampled ground and immediately added with 0 4 ml lbb 0 4 and 6 ml acetic acid 45 mm the suspension was mixed completely and then filtered 0 22 μm to measure the absorbance at 620 nm a calibration curve of kmno4 was utilized for mn iii iv quantification with a correction coefficient of 2 5 5 2 5 electrons are accepted from mn vii to mn ii whereas 2 electrons were involved in the conversion from mn iv to mn ii li et al 2014 attentively the calculated values of mn iii iv in the method above were actually the sum of mn iv and twice mn iii not mn iv mn iii the results were acceptable if mn iv was much more prevalent than mn iii and only approximate concentrations of mn iii iv were required in this work sludge samples were

precipitates were washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c in a vacuum oven 3 results and discussion 3 1 cultivation and activity of granule granules of ags and mn ags harvested from the parent reactors were stained with lbb and the photos are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively mn ags presents in blue because lbb was oxidized forming a blue color by highly valent manganese mn iii iv geszvain et al 2016 this indicated that mn ags contained much bio mnox while the traditional ags did not the cross section of a granule in the inset picture in fig 1b showed that some large size mn ags granules had hollow structures which were also observed in ags de kreuk et al 2005 batch experiments were conducted to investigate the manganese oxidizing activity of sludge the large decreases in mn ii concentration in the first 2 h fig 1c were attributed to the strong adsorption of mn ii on granules wang et al 2018 and decreases in the later 6 h should be largely caused by mn ii oxidation as a result the concentration of mn iii iv products of mn ii oxidation in mn ags increased from 19 0 1 0 to 21 5 0 2 mg g ss whereas that in ags was at very low levels 0 04 mg g ss fig 1d based on the increase of mn iii iv in sludge the manganese oxidizing rate of mn ags was calculated to be 0 30 0 09 mg g ss h 100 fold higher than that of ags 0 003 0 002 mg g ss h 3 2 reactor performance of arsenic removal eight sbrs were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of mn ags for as removal from wastewater efficiencies of as and cod removal as well as variations in ph are given in fig 2 fig s1 and fig s2 respectively the operating period was divided into two phases phase i day 1 17 and phase ii day 18 28 the difference between the two phases was that an additional fe ii was provided in phase ii in the whole operating period the performance of as removal was better in mn ags than in ags reactors but especially in phase ii in fig 2a low as loading fe ii addition in phase ii decreased effluent as of mn ags from about 1 0 mg l to below 0 5 mg l which meets the discharge standards of industrial wastewaters in china however fe ii addition had no effect in ags reactors in fig 2b high as loading immediate improvements of as removal were achieved in both ags and mn ags reactors when additional fe ii was supplied the effluent as concentration in mn ags reactors was stable below 4 0 mg l after day 19 after day 23 fe ii was doubly added that is the fe as ratio increased from 1 1 to 2 1 which greatly reduced the as contained in effluent in ags reactors but had no significant effect in mn ags reactors furthermore variation of effluent as concentration in mn ags reactors was significantly reduced after fe ii addition fe modification was also adopted to change the surface properties of the biosorbent to improve the removal of as oxyanions because of the low efficiencies of biosorption for these negatively charged species wang et al 2018 in all reactors effluent cod decreased continuously over time and was below 60 mg l in the final 5 days fig s1 the removal efficiency of cod was higher in mn ags than in ags reactors the bio mnox in mn ags might facilitate the oxidation of influent organic matter and microbial products thereby improving cod removal efficiency effluent ph was increased from 7 0 to near 9 0 fig s2 and this was mainly caused by the oxidation of influent acetate ch3coo 2o2 h 2co2 2h2o 3 3 characteristic of immobilized arsenic in granule granular sludge before and after as treatment reactor operation in fig 2 was collected and extracted to determine the as concentration speciation and valence state in sludge as expected as was much richer in mn ags than in ags fig 3 a consistent with as removal from solution as shown in fig 2 sludge as concentration was 13 3 fold higher in mn ags than in ags 5 6 0 2 vs 0 42 0 03 mg g ss in the low as loading treatments while this ratio decreased to 2 9 fold when high as loading was adopted 34 3 1 6 vs 11 9 1 3 mg g ss this decrease might be largely caused by the increase of as removal in ags when high levels of fe ii were added in high as loading groups see fig 2b arsenic was mostly in phase iii in all the samples after treatments fig 3a indicating that the majority of the immobilized as was bound to amorphous fe mn oxides 56 2 65 0 in mn ags the second most concentrated as phase was phase ii and as in this phase was specifically adsorbed on granules the immobilized as in sludge was mostly 74 6 82 6 in pentavalence as v fig 3b because only as iii was supplied this finding indicated that most as iii had been oxidized into as v after treatments in both ags and mn ags reactors granules after treatment with high as loading were selected for xps and the spectra of as 3d and mn 2p are shown in fig 4 the as 3d spectra fig 4a and b were modeled as doublets of 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 with a separation of 0 69 ev and area ratio of 2 3 two peaks of as 3d5 2 were observed at 45 0 45 2 and 44 2 44 4 ev attributed to as v and as iii respectively kim et al 2014 the percentages of peak area of as v 3d5 2 in total as 3d5 2 were 69 6 in ags and 82 0 in mn ags which represented the relative abundance of as v in samples and were close to the results from macroscopic measurements fig 3b in fig 4c and d mn 2p spectra were modeled as 2p1 2 2p3 2 and shake up satellite peaks mn 2p3 2 spectra could be fit to three peaks located at 642 6 642 7 641 5 641 7 and 640 9 641 0 ev which were interpreted as mn iv mn iii and mn ii respectively ilton et al 2016 the peak area percentages of mn iv mn iii and mn ii were 59 8 16 2 and 24 0 in ags respectively and 53 9 17 8 and 28 3 in mn ags respectively this finding supported the observation fig 1d that mn ii was oxidized into mn iii iv in sludge the granular surface was also characterized by raman spectra fig s3 comparisons of spectra before and after the experiment clearly demonstrated that a band was generated at around 845 cm 1 after the experiment this band was ascribed to the strong stretching vibrations of the aso bond of adsorbed arsenate goldberg and johnston 2001 this broad band 750 950 cm 1 might be attributed to a mixture of v aso vibrations from h2aso4 haso4 2 and fe mnoas complexes as well as the complicated chemical environments in biological sludge xrd analysis was used to determine the mineral composition of sludge granules before and after the experiment in addition to reference substances 2 line ferrihydrite amorphous ferric arsenate and bio mnox were heated at 450 c to remove the high noise from organic matter and 800 c to transform from amorphous to crystalline forms to obtain xrd patterns fig 5 all the samples were in amorphous forms fig 5a even if heated at 450 c for 2 h comparisons between samples before and after the experiment showed that two broad peaks near 35 and 63 degrees of 2 theta marked by vertical lines in the figure were formed in both ags and mn ags after the experiment these two peaks were interpreted as amorphous 2 line ferrihydrite see ferrihydrite spectrogram in fig 5a which was derived from the added fe ii ferrihydrite has been well documented to be a strong adsorbent of arsenate by forming inner sphere bidentate arsenate complexes or monodentate arsenate linkages on the ferrihydrite surface cheng et al 2009 samples heated to 800 c fig 5b exhibited xrd patterns that were similar for both ags and mn ags samples after the experiment and almost all the major peaks were identical 11 major peaks coincided with hematite fe2o3 99 0060 that was transformed from dehydration of ferrihydrite during 800 c heating the residual peaks could not be recognized and some unknown arsenic compounds might be formed during as treatment or heating peaks of ferric arsenate feaso4 or other metal arsenate such as mn3 aso4 2 mg3 aso4 2 and ca3 aso4 2 were not found in the xrd spectrograms although those precipitations were frequently detected in previous studies gutiérrez et al 2015 tournassat et al 2002 an xrd pattern of feaso4 in fig 5b confirmed that feaso4 was not decomposed at 800 c but changed from amorphous to crystalline forms scorodite 78 1545 thus metal arsenate precipitates were not generated in either set of granules a very broad and low peak was found between 15 to 35 in mn ags samples and this might be attributed to the influence of bio mnox see fig s4 for the xrd spectrograms of bio mnox bio mnox was deemed to be a good adsorbent for metal ions that could be adsorbed on the surface and sequestered at the vacant layer octahedral sites of bio mnox matsushita et al 2018 bio mnox might also contribute to as removal although its adsorption capacity was lower than that of ferrihydrite bai et al 2016 sem images and eds mappings of ags and mn ags granules after the experiment are given in fig 6 both ags and mn ags granules were rich in pore channels that allowed substrate transportation through the granules overall as was evenly distributed in the granules although slightly more in the outer space than in the inner core the distribution of as was similar to that of fe and mn in mn ags and no crystals containing as were observed these results further supported the conclusion that as was mostly bound on amorphous fe mn oxides as discussed above 3 4 pathway of arsenic oxidation by mn ags seven batch experiments were performed to investigate the possible pathways of as oxidation in mn ags and the results are presented in fig 7 the addition of fe ii significantly improved as iii removal fig 7a however the improvement was removed by cat an enzyme that scavenges h2o2 or bpy a reagent for chelating fe ii indicating h2o2 and fe ii played an important role in the improvement assuming the difference between groups mn ags and sterilized mn ags was only that organisms were dead in the latter the proportion of microbial as iii oxidation was calculated by subtracting as iii removal in group sterilized mn ags from that in group mn ags and found to be 0 305 of the initial as iii δc c0 the removed proportion in the initial concentration after 10 h of the experimental period similarly the proportions of as iii oxidation by mn iii iv bio mnox and h2o2 fenton δc c0 were estimated to be 0 203 and 0 152 based on the comparisons between groups mn ags and mn iii iv free mn ags and groups mn ags fe ii and mn ags fe ii cat respectively the estimation of the fenton proportion above was based on the assumption that cat depleted h2o2 completely and did not influence the as iii adsorption and oxidation by other pathways the sum of as iii oxidation δc c0 was 0 660 and the contributions of organisms bio mnox and fenton were 46 2 30 8 and 23 0 respectively the group mn ags fe ii in fig 7a showed that approximate 0 791 of the initial as iii was removed after experiment and the difference between 0 791 and 0 660 could be attributed to the adsorption of as iii on sludge the percentage of the oxidized as as v in the removed as as iii as v was 83 4 0 660 0 791 very close to the findings from sludge extraction 82 6 fig 3 and xps spectrogram 82 0 fig 4 the trend in total as removal depicted in fig 7b was similar to that of as iii and this might be explained by the fact that most as v was rapidly adsorbed on sludge in fe ii addition groups fe ii concentrations in solution were measured and the results are presented in fig 7c fe ii was adsorbed on sludge quickly see fig s5 and only trace fe ii 0 3 mg l could be detected in solutions except group mn ags fe ii bpy fig 7c fe ii solubility was slightly promoted by cat but we could not exclude the possible influence of impurities in the cat reagent in group mn ags fe ii bpy the concentration of fe ii was high due to formation of a complex of fe ii and bpy furthermore fe ii concentrations increased over time from hour 2 to 10 indicating that the adsorbed fe ii in sludge was extracted by bpy this could explain the abnormal phenomenon that as removal rate sharply decreased after 2 h fig 7a the improvements resulting from the addition of fe ii improved oxidation by fenton and enhanced adsorption by ferrihydrite ceased when the adsorbed fe ii was extracted by bpy furthermore bpy could also form complexes with other metal ions including mn ii and inhibited as oxidation and removal hydrogen peroxide was detected in mn ags solutions fig 7d and a further investigation of h2o2 generation by mn ags see fig s6 revealed that mn ags was better at h2o2 generation than ags the concentration of h2o2 in solutions of mn ags was mostly in the range 1 5 3 0 μm without cat and fe ii and up to 4 8 1 0 μm in the presence of bpy bpy can protect h2o2 from decomposition by fe ii katsoyiannis et al 2008 hydrogen peroxide is prevalent in biological habitats which is continuously produced by the autoxidation of redox enzymes in aerobic cells h2o2 is formed from superoxide radical o2 by superoxide dismutase sod which is then rapidly degraded by cat or some other peroxidase to protect cells from oxidative damage mishra and imlay 2012 some mnob such as roseobacter oxidize mn ii into mn iii by extracellular superoxide eq 1 mn iii is further oxidized into mn iv eq 2 or disproportionated into mn ii and mn iv eq 3 and h2o2 is a concomitant product in the first radical reaction learman et al 2011 furthermore a laccase was reported to oxidize mn ii into mn iii and produce extracellular h2o2 that can be reused by manganese peroxidase to oxidize mn ii schlosser and höfer 2002 these might explain the relatively high levels of h2o2 in mn ags fig 7d and micromolar levels of h2o2 can perform fenton reactions to oxidize as iii quickly even at a ph of 7 0 ding et al 2018 katsoyiannis et al 2008 the initial ph after influent feeding in mn ags reactors was generally below 6 5 in phase ii of reactor operation fig s2 and ph was adjusted back to about 6 2 after each sampling in batch experiments which facilitated fenton reactions to oxidize as iii 1 mn ii o2 2h mn iii h2o2 2 4mn iii o2 4h mn iv 2h2o 3 2mn iii mn ii mn iv remarkably a low level of fe ii addition 1 9 mg l greatly improved as removal in mn ags but had no discernible effect on ags fig 2a this could not be explained by the strong adsorption of as on ferrihydrite because ferrihydrite should be formed in both types of granules the main differences between ags and mn ags were that mn ii and bio mnox as well as relatively high levels of h2o2 occurred in mn ags reactors bio mnox was undoubtedly an important factor that oxidized as iii into as v quickly wang et al 2015 and its concentration in sludge was up to 45 mg mn gss after 28 days of operation recently it was discovered that ferrihydrite facilitated the generation of mn iii from aqueous mn ii and then as iii can be efficiently oxidized by mn iii lan et al 2018 this phenomenon probably also occurred in mn ags after the addition of fe ii in this study except for bio mnox h2o2 might also substantially enhance the oxidation of as iii after the addition of fe ii via fenton reactions this was confirmed by two inhibition experiments of cat and bpy fig 7a moreover the catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 was enhanced on the surface of ferrihydrite which also favors the oxidation of as iii voegelin and hug 2003 microbial processes were major pathways in the oxidation of as iii according to the estimations given above and the microbial community was analyzed before and after the experiment figs s7 s9 members of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were dominant 87 in both ags and mn ags fig s7 great differences were found in microbial community at genus level between ags and mn ags figs s8 and s9 possibly attributed to their different culture conditions arsenic oxidation related genera of acinetobacter bacillus bosea pseudomonas and rhodococcus heinrich salmeron et al 2011 were detected in the microbial community table s4 and fig s8 they showed distant phylogenetic relationships and were affiliated to proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria phyla among them bosea and rhodococcus were abundant in the samples after experiment implying they might be important as oxidizers in this study however due to asob are too diverse and widely distributed in prokaryotes heinrich salmeron et al 2011 wang et al 2017 it seems to be difficult to obtain solid information from 16s rrna sequences subsequently qpcr targeting function gene of aoxb encoding for a subunit of arsenite oxidase was performed the results showed that large increases 5 6 fold for ags and 9 2 fold for mn ags occurred in the abundance of gene aoxb fig s10 clearly demonstrating the importance of microbial as oxidation in sludge 3 5 mechanisms and potential applications of mn ags a substrate flow scheme was drawn for as oxidation and removal in mn ags with fe ii addition see fig s11 based on the findings in this study the mechanisms of as oxidation and removal by mn ags can be summarized as as iii h3aso3 in neutral and acidic ph was adsorbed on sludge subsequently oxidized into as v h2aso4 and haso4 2 through multiple pathways of microbes bio mnox and fenton reactions and finally most as v was immobilized in sludge by bonding on amorphous ferrihydrite and bio mnox oxygen was the terminal electron acceptor in all the as oxidation pathways in microbial pathways as iii was oxidized by arsenite oxidase and oxygen accepted electrons from the microbial electron transport chain crognale et al 2017 in the fenton pathway as iii was oxidized by h2o2 that was generated originally from oxygen through the intermediate of superoxide in the bio mnox pathway as iii is oxidized by mn iii iv that was primarily produced by mnob in the presence of oxygen in addition a quick recycle of manganese among mn ii mn iii and mn iv would reduce the demand for mn ii addition whereas fe iii reduction was restricted in aerobic reactors and continuous fresh fe ii addition was required to stimulate as oxidation and removal the results from reactor operation and batch experiments both clearly showed the novel mn ags had many advantages in as oxidation and removal from wastewater however it can be predicted that high efficiency of as removal by mn ags is impossible to sustain for a long time because the high accumulation of as in sludge will lower the removal efficiency we proposed a strategy of periodic replacement of fresh mn ags in reactors to solve this problem see fig s12 and the unloaded as rich sludge can be used for as recovery in addition mn ags could also be used to treat some other oxyanionic heavy metals including antimony sb which cannot be removed by the traditional ags wang et al 2018 although chromium cr can be oxidized by bio mnox it should be noted that cr vi has a higher toxicity than cr iii a broader application of mn ags may be to treat some toxic or refractory organic micro pollutants including pesticides antibiotics endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals since these refractory compounds can be decomposed into biodegradable substances by bio mnox forrez et al 2011 wang et al 2015 and the biodegradable products will be subsequently degraded by microbial metabolism 4 conclusions mn ags a novel extension of the traditional ags was developed to treat as in organic wastewater eight sbrs were operated in duplicate and the results indicated that as iii oxidation and removal were much more efficient in mn ags than in ags reactors specifically fe ii addition even at low levels greatly stimulated the removal of as by mn ags and this was mainly attributed to fenton reactions and strong adsorption on ferrihydrite batch experiments demonstrated that as iii was oxidized by multiple pathways in mn ags including microbial metabolism 46 bio mnox 31 and fenton reactions 23 a range of characterizations showed that the immobilized as in mn ags sludge was mostly in as v species 74 6 82 6 and bound to amorphous ferrihydrite and bio mnox 56 2 65 0 furthermore this technology can be used to deal with some toxic or refractory micro pollutants in organic wastewater declaration of interests the authors declare that they have

18846,aerobic granular sludge ags is a powerful biotechnology to remove various heavy metal loid s from wastewater but not including arsenic as in this study a novel manganese oxidizing aerobic granular sludge mn ags was developed to remove as from organic wastewater eight sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of as removal by mn ags the immobilized as in the granular sludge was characterized by sequencing extraction x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps x ray diffraction xrd scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds and raman spectroscopy oxidation pathways for as and their contributions in mn ags were evaluated by seven batch experiments under different conditions the results indicated that as removal efficiency was much higher by mn ags than by ags in mn ags as iii was efficiently oxidized into as v 74 6 82 6 and then mostly bound on amorphous ferrihydrite and biogenic mn oxides bio mnox 56 2 65 0 while metal arsenates such as ferric arsenate were not detected importantly as removal was greatly improved by a small addition of fe ii in mn ags this might be primarily caused by fenton reactions because this improvement was removed when h2o2 self generated in mn ags was scavenged by exogenous catalase cat this study provided a novel extension of the traditional ags technology to treat as in organic wastewater with an acceptable degree of efficiency graphical abstract image 1 keywords aerobic granular sludge ags arsenic oxidation biogenic mn oxides bio mnox amorphous ferrihydrite biogenic hydrogen peroxide h2o2 1 introduction arsenic as contamination is a critical worldwide issue and as has adverse effects on human health causing a variety of diseases arsenic frequently co exists in many natural ore minerals including copper and lead ores and is mined as a by product the majority of the associated as is terminally transferred into waste and wastewater after ore dressing and dearsenifying processes shi et al 2017 arsenic in industrial wastewater must be removed before discharge to comply with government regulations many technologies based on physical chemical and biological methods have been developed to treat as containing wastewater including adsorption precipitation coagulation membrane filtration ion exchange and capacitive deionization kim et al 2017 luong et al 2018 among them microbially mediated adsorption followed by oxidation seems a promising technology biological aerobic granular sludge ags has been widely investigated for heavy metal loid s removal from wastewater while ags is an effective bio sorption tool for most metal loid s it is not effective for as sarma and tay 2018 wang et al 2018 the surface of ags is usually negatively charged and thereby can easily adsorb and remove cationic positively charged heavy metals from wastewater including copper ii zinc ii lead ii and cadmium ii nancharaiah and kiran kumar reddy 2018 however as species in wastewater including arsenite as iii and arsenate as v are negatively charged or neutral in normal ph ranges kwok et al 2018 ags may repel as oxyanions in solution which results in the low efficiency of as removal wang et al 2018 of the two as species as v is much less toxic and mobile than as iii romano et al 2017 therefore oxidation of as iii to as v is generally a key step of as treatment because as iii is usually the dominant as species in wastewater and as v can be rapidly removed through adsorption and precipitation villalobos et al 2014 oxidation coupled with subsequent adsorption or precipitation is therefore a popular strategy to remove as from wastewater and ground water andrianisa et al 2008 katsoyiannis et al 2004 chemical and biological methods have been proposed to oxidize as iii and microbial processes are generally regarded as an economical way li et al 2016 many physiologically diverse arsenic oxidizing bacteria asob have been cultivated and can oxidize as iii to as v with oxygen nitrate or chlorate as an electron acceptor wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015a several bioreactors have been operated successfully to oxidize as iii including biofilm and activated sludge reactors andrianisa et al 2008 ito et al 2012 li et al 2016 peng et al 2018 however relatively low rates of microbial as iii oxidation and poor adsorption of as species on biomass significantly limit its practical application biogenic mn oxides bio mnox trivalent or quadrivalent manganese mn iii iv are produced by diverse manganese oxidizing bacteria mnob or fungi from the reduced manganese mn ii in both pure and mixed cultures romano et al 2017 bio mnox is highly reactive and has a large surface area for adsorption he et al 2019a tran et al 2018 bio mnox therefore can oxidize and remove many pollutants including as iii bai et al 2016 gude et al 2016 he et al 2018 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2015 in previous studies bio mnox was usually prepared ex situ and added to wastewater or ground water for as treatment forrez et al 2011 liang et al 2017 wang et al 2015 such approaches improved the stability and efficiency of as removal but largely raised process complexity and operating costs additionally the released mn ii polluted the effluent and inhibited the further reaction of bio mnox gude et al 2017 only a few studies produced bio mnox in situ in bioreactors to remove pollutants from wastewater cao et al 2015 and matsushita et al 2018 successfully enriched mnob in downflow hanging sponge bioreactors for producing bio mnox and removed heavy metals of nickel ii and cobalt ii from wastewater zhang et al 2015b added mn ii to two aerated biofilters fed with secondary effluents from wastewater treatment plants and found that diclofenac could be eliminated by bio mnox moreover some mnob also participate in pollutant removal directly for instance pseudomonas putida p putida a well investigated bacterium of mnob not only produces bio mnox but also directly oxidizes as iii to oxidize as v through its biological metabolism chang et al 2018 therefore we predict that cultivating mnob and producing bio mnox in ags will combine the advantages of both biological and chemical approaches and may be a potentially promising way to oxidize and remove as from wastewater in the present study a novel manganese oxidizing aerobic granular sludge mn ags was developed by long term addition of mn ii to the medium the potential for as oxidation and removal by both mn ags and ags was investigated the speciation of immobilized as in sludge was characterized and the pathways of as iii oxidation were analyzed through a series of batch experiments based on the advantages of mn ags the ags technology can be extended to efficiently remove as from wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation eight sequencing batch reactors sbrs were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of as removal by mn ags and the traditional ags mn ags and ags granules were harvested from two parent reactors that had been operated for more than three months with glucose as the carbon source the operation of the two parent reactors was identical and similar to those of the sbrs in this work an additional mn ii of 10 40 mg l was supplied in the mn ags parent reactor the eight sbrs in this study were divided into four groups ags with low as iii loading 2 5 mg l of as in influent ags with high as iii loading 25 mg l of as in influent mn ags with low as iii loading and mn ags with high as iii loading the eight sbrs were identical with 800 ml of working volume an exchange rate of 0 5 and 20 rate of inoculum the cycle period consisted of the following phases 5 min feeding 23 5 h aeration 5 min settling 5 min decanting and 15 min idle air was pumped into the bottom of each reactor at a rate of 200 l h and the operation temperature was approximately 25 c the components of the artificial wastewater were as following 1300 mg l

m ratio of fe as on days 17 21 and 22 28 respectively effluent as chemical oxygen demand cod and ph were monitored every day 2 2 sequencing extraction to assess the speciation and valence of as in sludge a five step sequencing extraction method originally designed for soil as analysis kim et al 2014 was utilized in this study sludge was sampled and centrifuged at 5000 g a 0 5 g pellet was sampled and extracted by ammonium sulfate ammonium dihydrogen phosphate ammonium oxalate ascorbic acid and aqua regia in sequence the extracted as was exchangeable i specifically adsorbed ii bound to amorphous fe mn oxides iii bound to crystalline fe mn oxides iv and residual phases v respectively valence analysis of as was performed only on the first three phases because as valence changed during extraction in the last two steps reacted with ascorbic acid and aqua regia the detailed procedure is given in table s1 2 3 batch experiments the manganese oxidizing activities of ags and mn ags obtained from the parent reactors were measured by batch experiments in triplicate then 10 ml granule washed with fresh medium after sampling was mixed with 40 ml fresh medium in 150 ml conical flasks the medium was identical to the artificial wastewater above the assays were carried out on a shaking table at 150 rpm and 25 c mn ii in solution was monitored every 2 h and mn iii iv in sludge was measured before and after each experiment in addition granules were stained by leukoberbelin blue lbb a specific stain for mn iii iv and granules containing bio mnox present as blue to distinguish the pathways of as oxidation in mn ags seven batch experiments were performed in triplicate the seven batch experiments were 1 group sterilized mn ags sludge was sterilized by autoclaving at 121 c for 15 min 2 group mn iii iv free mn ags mn iii iv was removed from mn ags by treating with 0 1 ascorbic acid 3 group mn ags it was a standard group and sludge was not specially treated 4 group mn ags fe ii fe ii was added to the standard group fe as 2 1 5 group mn ags fe iii fe iii was added to the standard group fe as 2 1 6 group mn ags fe ii cat exogenous catalase cat a hydrogen peroxide h2o2 scavenger was reactivated at 37 c for 1 h and then added to the fe ii amended group 20000 u ml and 7 group mn ags fe ii bpy bipyridine bpy a fe ii chelator was added to the fe ii amended group 2 mmol l detailed information on the experimental settings is provided in table s2 the procedure was similar to the batch experiments for determining manganese oxidizing activity described above liquid supernatant was sampled every 2 h and ph was adjusted at about 6 2 after each sampling as iii total as fe ii and h2o2 in solution were measured immediately 2 4 chemical analyses liquid samples were filtered through 0 22 μm polyethersulfone membranes before measurements cod and suspended solid ss were determined by apha standard methods apha 2005 ph was monitored using a fe20 ph meter mettler toledo shanghai as iii and total as were measured using a hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectrometer hg afs afs 8220 jitian china and as v concentration was calculated by subtracting the value of as iii from the total as concentration as previously described bai et al 2016 total dissolved fe and mn were assumed to be fe ii and mn ii and measured by colorimetric methods using bipyridine and formaldehyde oxime as chromogenic reagents respectively h2o2 was detected using a modified n n diethyl p phenylenediamine dpd method katsoyiannis et al 2008 and a hydrogen peroxide sensor iso hpo 100 world precision instruments usa in the modified dpd method a 2 ml sample was immediately added with 200 μl bpy 30 mm in 1 mm hclo4 solution 100 μl na2edta 0 1 m and 400 μl phosphate buffer solution pbs ph 6 0 0 5 m in turn next 50 μl dpd 1 0 1 m h2so4 and 50 μl peroxidase pod 100 u ml were added after 1 min the absorbance was measured at 552 nm by a spectrometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan to determine the mn iii iv level in sludge 2 ml sludge was sampled ground and immediately added with 0 4 ml lbb 0 4 and 6 ml acetic acid 45 mm the suspension was mixed completely and then filtered 0 22 μm to measure the absorbance at 620 nm a calibration curve of kmno4 was utilized for mn iii iv quantification with a correction coefficient of 2 5 5 2 5 electrons are accepted from mn vii to mn ii whereas 2 electrons were involved in the conversion from mn iv to mn ii li et al 2014 attentively the calculated values of mn iii iv in the method above were actually the sum of mn iv and twice mn iii not mn iv mn iii the results were acceptable if mn iv was much more prevalent than mn iii and only approximate concentrations of mn iii iv were required in this work sludge samples were

experiment was extracted by a power soil dna isolation kit mo bio laboratories usa and the microbial community was analyzed using the next generation sequencing ngs technique of the illumina platform 16s rrna genes v3v4 regions of the dna samples were amplified using a universal primer set of 338f 806r he et al 2019b the pcr procedure was started with initial denaturation 94 c for 3 min followed

putida mnb1 in 279 medium see table s3 as previously described wang et al 2015 amorphous 2 line ferrihydrite was prepared by adding 1 mol l koh solution into 0 1 mol l fe no3 3 solution until the ph was 7 8 amorphous ferric arsenate were synthesized by mixing 0 05 mol l ferric sulfate and 0 1 mol l sodium arsenate solutions in stoichiometric amounts at 60 c lee and nriagu 2007 all the resulting precipitates were washed with deionized water and dried at 60 c in a vacuum oven 3 results and discussion 3 1 cultivation and activity of granule granules of ags and mn ags harvested from the parent reactors were stained with lbb and the photos are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively mn ags presents in blue because lbb was oxidized forming a blue color by highly valent manganese mn iii iv geszvain et al 2016 this indicated that mn ags contained much bio mnox while the traditional ags did not the cross section of a granule in the inset picture in fig 1b showed that some large size mn ags granules had hollow structures which were also observed in ags de kreuk et al 2005 batch experiments were conducted to investigate the manganese oxidizing activity of sludge the large decreases in mn ii concentration in the first 2 h fig 1c were attributed to the strong adsorption of mn ii on granules wang et al 2018 and decreases in the later 6 h should be largely caused by mn ii oxidation as a result the concentration of mn iii iv products of mn ii oxidation in mn ags increased from 19 0 1 0 to 21 5 0 2 mg g ss whereas that in ags was at very low levels 0 04 mg g ss fig 1d based on the increase of mn iii iv in sludge the manganese oxidizing rate of mn ags was calculated to be 0 30 0 09 mg g ss h 100 fold higher than that of ags 0 003 0 002 mg g ss h 3 2 reactor performance of arsenic removal eight sbrs were operated in duplicate to investigate the feasibility of mn ags for as removal from wastewater efficiencies of as and cod removal as well as variations in ph are given in fig 2 fig s1 and fig s2 respectively the operating period was divided into two phases phase i day 1 17 and phase ii day 18 28 the difference between the two phases was that an additional fe ii was provided in phase ii in the whole operating period the performance of as removal was better in mn ags than in ags reactors but especially in phase ii in fig 2a low as loading fe ii addition in phase ii decreased effluent as of mn ags from about 1 0 mg l to below 0 5 mg l which meets the discharge standards of industrial wastewaters in china however fe ii addition had no effect in ags reactors in fig 2b high as loading immediate improvements of as removal were achieved in both ags and mn ags reactors when additional fe ii was supplied the effluent as concentration in mn ags reactors was stable below 4 0 mg l after day 19 after day 23 fe ii was doubly added that is the fe as ratio increased from 1 1 to 2 1 which greatly reduced the as contained in effluent in ags reactors but had no significant effect in mn ags reactors furthermore variation of effluent as concentration in mn ags reactors was significantly reduced after fe ii addition fe modification was also adopted to change the surface properties of the biosorbent to improve the removal of as oxyanions because of the low efficiencies of biosorption for these negatively charged species wang et al 2018 in all reactors effluent cod decreased continuously over time and was below 60 mg l in the final 5 days fig s1 the removal efficiency of cod was higher in mn ags than in ags reactors the bio mnox in mn ags might facilitate the oxidation of influent organic matter and microbial products thereby improving cod removal efficiency effluent ph was increased from 7 0 to near 9 0 fig s2 and this was mainly caused by the oxidation of influent acetate ch3coo 2o2 h 2co2 2h2o 3 3 characteristic of immobilized arsenic in granule granular sludge before and after as treatment reactor operation in fig 2 was collected and extracted to determine the as concentration speciation and valence state in sludge as expected as was much richer in mn ags than in ags fig 3 a consistent with as removal from solution as shown in fig 2 sludge as concentration was 13 3 fold higher in mn ags than in ags 5 6 0 2 vs 0 42 0 03 mg g ss in the low as loading treatments while this ratio decreased to 2 9 fold when high as loading was adopted 34 3 1 6 vs 11 9 1 3 mg g ss this decrease might be largely caused by the increase of as removal in ags when high levels of fe ii were added in high as loading groups see fig 2b arsenic was mostly in phase iii in all the samples after treatments fig 3a indicating that the majority of the immobilized as was bound to amorphous fe mn oxides 56 2 65 0 in mn ags the second most concentrated as phase was phase ii and as in this phase was specifically adsorbed on granules the immobilized as in sludge was mostly 74 6 82 6 in pentavalence as v fig 3b because only as iii was supplied this finding indicated that most as iii had been oxidized into as v after treatments in both ags and mn ags reactors granules after treatment with high as loading were selected for xps and the spectra of as 3d and mn 2p are shown in fig 4 the as 3d spectra fig 4a and b were modeled as doublets of 3d3 2 and 3d5 2 with a separation of 0 69 ev and area ratio of 2 3 two peaks of as 3d5 2 were observed at 45 0 45 2 and 44 2 44 4 ev attributed to as v and as iii respectively kim et al 2014 the percentages of peak area of as v 3d5 2 in total as 3d5 2 were 69 6 in ags and 82 0 in mn ags which represented the relative abundance of as v in samples and were close to the results from macroscopic measurements fig 3b in fig 4c and d mn 2p spectra were modeled as 2p1 2 2p3 2 and shake up satellite peaks mn 2p3 2 spectra could be fit to three peaks located at 642 6 642 7 641 5 641 7 and 640 9 641 0 ev which were interpreted as mn iv mn iii and mn ii respectively ilton et al 2016 the peak area percentages of mn iv mn iii and mn ii were 59 8 16 2 and 24 0 in ags respectively and 53 9 17 8 and 28 3 in mn ags respectively this finding supported the observation fig 1d that mn ii was oxidized into mn iii iv in sludge the granular surface was also characterized by raman spectra fig s3 comparisons of spectra before and after the experiment clearly demonstrated that a band was generated at around 845 cm 1 after the experiment this band was ascribed to the strong stretching vibrations of the aso bond of adsorbed arsenate goldberg and johnston 2001 this broad band 750 950 cm 1 might be attributed to a mixture of v aso vibrations from h2aso4 haso4 2 and fe mnoas complexes as well as the complicated chemical environments in biological sludge xrd analysis was used to determine the mineral composition of sludge granules before and after the experiment in addition to reference substances 2 line ferrihydrite amorphous ferric arsenate and bio mnox were heated at 450 c to remove the high noise from organic matter and 800 c to transform from amorphous to crystalline forms to obtain xrd patterns fig 5 all the samples were in amorphous forms fig 5a even if heated at 450 c for 2 h comparisons between samples before and after the experiment showed that two broad peaks near 35 and 63 degrees of 2 theta marked by vertical lines in the figure were formed in both ags and mn ags after the experiment these two peaks were interpreted as amorphous 2 line ferrihydrite see ferrihydrite spectrogram in fig 5a which was derived from the added fe ii ferrihydrite has been well documented to be a strong adsorbent of arsenate by forming inner sphere bidentate arsenate complexes or monodentate arsenate linkages on the ferrihydrite surface cheng et al 2009 samples heated to 800 c fig 5b exhibited xrd patterns that were similar for both ags and mn ags samples after the experiment and almost all the major peaks were identical 11 major peaks coincided with hematite fe2o3 99 0060 that was transformed from dehydration of ferrihydrite during 800 c heating the residual peaks could not be recognized and some unknown arsenic compounds might be formed during as treatment or heating peaks of ferric arsenate feaso4 or other metal arsenate such as mn3 aso4 2 mg3 aso4 2 and ca3 aso4 2 were not found in the xrd spectrograms although those precipitations were frequently detected in previous studies gutiérrez et al 2015 tournassat et al 2002 an xrd pattern of feaso4 in fig 5b confirmed that feaso4 was not decomposed at 800 c but changed from amorphous to crystalline forms scorodite 78 1545 thus metal arsenate precipitates were not generated in either set of granules a very broad and low peak was found between 15 to 35 in mn ags samples and this might be attributed to the influence of bio mnox see fig s4 for the xrd spectrograms of bio mnox bio mnox was deemed to be a good adsorbent for metal ions that could be adsorbed on the surface and sequestered at the vacant layer octahedral sites of bio mnox matsushita et al 2018 bio mnox might also contribute to as removal although its adsorption capacity was lower than that of ferrihydrite bai et al 2016 sem images and eds mappings of ags and mn ags granules after the experiment are given in fig 6 both ags and mn ags granules were rich in pore channels that allowed substrate transportation through the granules overall as was evenly distributed in the granules although slightly more in the outer space than in the inner core the distribution of as was similar to that of fe and mn in mn ags and no crystals containing as were observed these results further supported the conclusion that as was mostly bound on amorphous fe mn oxides as discussed above 3 4 pathway of arsenic oxidation by mn ags seven batch experiments were performed to investigate the possible pathways of as oxidation in mn ags and the results are presented in fig 7 the addition of fe ii significantly improved as iii removal fig 7a however the improvement was removed by cat an enzyme that scavenges h2o2 or bpy a reagent for chelating fe ii indicating h2o2 and fe ii played an important role in the improvement assuming the difference between groups mn ags and sterilized mn ags was only that organisms were dead in the latter the proportion of microbial as iii oxidation was calculated by subtracting as iii removal in group sterilized mn ags from that in group mn ags and found to be 0 305 of the initial as iii δc c0 the removed proportion in the initial concentration after 10 h of the experimental period similarly the proportions of as iii oxidation by mn iii iv bio mnox and h2o2 fenton δc c0 were estimated to be 0 203 and 0 152 based on the comparisons between groups mn ags and mn iii iv free mn ags and groups mn ags fe ii and mn ags fe ii cat respectively the estimation of the fenton proportion above was based on the assumption that cat depleted h2o2 completely and did not influence the as iii adsorption and oxidation by other pathways the sum of as iii oxidation δc c0 was 0 660 and the contributions of organisms bio mnox and fenton were 46 2 30 8 and 23 0 respectively the group mn ags fe ii in fig 7a showed that approximate 0 791 of the initial as iii was removed after experiment and the difference between 0 791 and 0 660 could be attributed to the adsorption of as iii on sludge the percentage of the oxidized as as v in the removed as as iii as v was 83 4 0 660 0 791 very close to the findings from sludge extraction 82 6 fig 3 and xps spectrogram 82 0 fig 4 the trend in total as removal depicted in fig 7b was similar to that of as iii and this might be explained by the fact that most as v was rapidly adsorbed on sludge in fe ii addition groups fe ii concentrations in solution were measured and the results are presented in fig 7c fe ii was adsorbed on sludge quickly see fig s5 and only trace fe ii 0 3 mg l could be detected in solutions except group mn ags fe ii bpy fig 7c fe ii solubility was slightly promoted by cat but we could not exclude the possible influence of impurities in the cat reagent in group mn ags fe ii bpy the concentration of fe ii was high due to formation of a complex of fe ii and bpy furthermore fe ii concentrations increased over time from hour 2 to 10 indicating that the adsorbed fe ii in sludge was extracted by bpy this could explain the abnormal phenomenon that as removal rate sharply decreased after 2 h fig 7a the improvements resulting from the addition of fe ii improved oxidation by fenton and enhanced adsorption by ferrihydrite ceased when the adsorbed fe ii was extracted by bpy furthermore bpy could also form complexes with other metal ions including mn ii and inhibited as oxidation and removal hydrogen peroxide was detected in mn ags solutions fig 7d and a further investigation of h2o2 generation by mn ags see fig s6 revealed that mn ags was better at h2o2 generation than ags the concentration of h2o2 in solutions of mn ags was mostly in the range 1 5 3 0 μm without cat and fe ii and up to 4 8 1 0 μm in the presence of bpy bpy can protect h2o2 from decomposition by fe ii katsoyiannis et al 2008 hydrogen peroxide is prevalent in biological habitats which is continuously produced by the autoxidation of redox enzymes in aerobic cells h2o2 is formed from superoxide radical o2 by superoxide dismutase sod which is then rapidly degraded by cat or some other peroxidase to protect cells from oxidative damage mishra and imlay 2012 some mnob such as roseobacter oxidize mn ii into mn iii by extracellular superoxide eq 1 mn iii is further oxidized into mn iv eq 2 or disproportionated into mn ii and mn iv eq 3 and h2o2 is a concomitant product in the first radical reaction learman et al 2011 furthermore a laccase was reported to oxidize mn ii into mn iii and produce extracellular h2o2 that can be reused by manganese peroxidase to oxidize mn ii schlosser and höfer 2002 these might explain the relatively high levels of h2o2 in mn ags fig 7d and micromolar levels of h2o2 can perform fenton reactions to oxidize as iii quickly even at a ph of 7 0 ding et al 2018 katsoyiannis et al 2008 the initial ph after influent feeding in mn ags reactors was generally below 6 5 in phase ii of reactor operation fig s2 and ph was adjusted back to about 6 2 after each sampling in batch experiments which facilitated fenton reactions to oxidize as iii 1 mn ii o2 2h mn iii h2o2 2 4mn iii o2 4h mn iv 2h2o 3 2mn iii mn ii mn iv remarkably a low level of fe ii addition 1 9 mg l greatly improved as removal in mn ags but had no discernible effect on ags fig 2a this could not be explained by the strong adsorption of as on ferrihydrite because ferrihydrite should be formed in both types of granules the main differences between ags and mn ags were that mn ii and bio mnox as well as relatively high levels of h2o2 occurred in mn ags reactors bio mnox was undoubtedly an important factor that oxidized as iii into as v quickly wang et al 2015 and its concentration in sludge was up to 45 mg mn gss after 28 days of operation recently it was discovered that ferrihydrite facilitated the generation of mn iii from aqueous mn ii and then as iii can be efficiently oxidized by mn iii lan et al 2018 this phenomenon probably also occurred in mn ags after the addition of fe ii in this study except for bio mnox h2o2 might also substantially enhance the oxidation of as iii after the addition of fe ii via fenton reactions this was confirmed by two inhibition experiments of cat and bpy fig 7a moreover the catalyzed decomposition of h2o2 was enhanced on the surface of ferrihydrite which also favors the oxidation of as iii voegelin and hug 2003 microbial processes were major pathways in the oxidation of as iii according to the estimations given above and the microbial community was analyzed before and after the experiment figs s7 s9 members of the phyla proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria were dominant 87 in both ags and mn ags fig s7 great differences were found in microbial community at genus level between ags and mn ags figs s8 and s9 possibly attributed to their different culture conditions arsenic oxidation related genera of acinetobacter bacillus bosea pseudomonas and rhodococcus heinrich salmeron et al 2011 were detected in the microbial community table s4 and fig s8 they showed distant phylogenetic relationships and were affiliated to proteobacteria firmicutes and actinobacteria phyla among them bosea and rhodococcus were abundant in the samples after experiment implying they might be important as oxidizers in this study however due to asob are too diverse and widely distributed in prokaryotes heinrich salmeron et al 2011 wang et al 2017 it seems to be difficult to obtain solid information from 16s rrna sequences subsequently qpcr targeting function gene of aoxb encoding for a subunit of arsenite oxidase was performed the results showed that large increases 5 6 fold for ags and 9 2 fold for mn ags occurred in the abundance of gene aoxb fig s10 clearly demonstrating the importance of microbial as oxidation in sludge 3 5 mechanisms and potential applications of mn ags a substrate flow scheme was drawn for as oxidation and removal in mn ags with fe ii addition see fig s11 based on the findings in this study the mechanisms of as oxidation and removal by mn ags can be summarized as as iii h3aso3 in neutral and acidic ph was adsorbed on sludge subsequently oxidized into as v h2aso4 and haso4 2 through multiple pathways of microbes bio mnox and fenton reactions and finally most as v was immobilized in sludge by bonding on amorphous ferrihydrite and bio mnox oxygen was the terminal electron acceptor in all the as oxidation pathways in microbial pathways as iii was oxidized by arsenite oxidase and oxygen accepted electrons from the microbial electron transport chain crognale et al 2017 in the fenton pathway as iii was oxidized by h2o2 that was generated originally from oxygen through the intermediate of superoxide in the bio mnox pathway as iii is oxidized by mn iii iv that was primarily produced by mnob in the presence of oxygen in addition a quick recycle of manganese among mn ii mn iii and mn iv would reduce the demand for mn ii addition whereas fe iii reduction was restricted in aerobic reactors and continuous fresh fe ii addition was required to stimulate as oxidation and removal the results from reactor operation and batch experiments both clearly showed the novel mn ags had many advantages in as oxidation and removal from wastewater however it can be predicted that high efficiency of as removal by mn ags is impossible to sustain for a long time because the high accumulation of as in sludge will lower the removal efficiency we proposed a strategy of periodic replacement of fresh mn ags in reactors to solve this problem see fig s12 and the unloaded as rich sludge can be used for as recovery in addition mn ags could also be used to treat some other oxyanionic heavy metals including antimony sb which cannot be removed by the traditional ags wang et al 2018 although chromium cr can be oxidized by bio mnox it should be noted that cr vi has a higher toxicity than cr iii a broader application of mn ags may be to treat some toxic or refractory organic micro pollutants including pesticides antibiotics endocrine disruptors and pharmaceuticals since these refractory compounds can be decomposed into biodegradable substances by bio mnox forrez et al 2011 wang et al 2015 and the biodegradable products will be subsequently degraded by microbial metabolism 4 conclusions mn ags a novel extension of the traditional ags was developed to treat as in organic wastewater eight sbrs were operated in duplicate and the results indicated that as iii oxidation and removal were much more efficient in mn ags than in ags reactors specifically fe ii addition even at low levels greatly stimulated the removal of as by mn ags and this was mainly attributed to fenton reactions and strong adsorption on ferrihydrite batch experiments demonstrated that as iii was oxidized by multiple pathways in mn ags including microbial metabolism 46 bio mnox 31 and fenton reactions 23 a range of characterizations showed that the immobilized as in mn ags sludge was mostly in as v species 74 6 82 6 and bound to amorphous ferrihydrite

18847,national and subnational burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water apportioned by sex age group province and community type in iran 2017 were quantified based on disability adjusted life years dalys the attributable burden of disease was estimated using four input data 1 effect size of elevated drinking water fluoride levels for dental and skeletal fluorosis 2 population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels 3 the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution in dental and skeletal fluorosis and 4 age sex distribution of population the attributable burden of disease was only related to dental fluorosis because the fluoride levels were lower than the threshold value for skeletal fluorosis 4 0 mg l in all of the cases the national attributable prevalence per 100 000 people dalys and daly rate in 2017 were calculated to be 60 95 uncertainty interval 48 69 3443 1034 6940 and 4 31 1 29 8 68 respectively the national attributable burden of disease was not significantly different by sex but was affected by age and community type in a manner that the highest daly rate was related to the age group 10 14 y 6 06 1 82 12 21 and over 66 of the national attributable dalys occurred in rural communities the attributable burden of disease occurred only in 10 out of 31 provinces and about 94 of the attributable dalys were concentrated in four provinces fars 1967 592 3964 bushehr 414 124 836 west azarbaijan 400 120 808 and hormozgan 377 113 761 implementation of fluoride safe drinking water supply schemes in the four leading provinces can prevent most of the national health losses and partly compensate the increasing trend of disease burden from oral conditions at the national level graphical abstract image 1 keywords attributable burden of disease defluoridation dental fluorosis elevated fluoride level environmental risk factor health risk assessment 1 introduction fluorine is the 13th most abundant element in earth s crust due to its extremely high reactivity fluorine almost entirely combines with other elements and hence is mainly occurred as the ionic form of fluoride in nature the major sources of fluoride in the environment are the minerals fluorite or fluorspar caf₂ fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and cryolite na3alf6 but it is also widely distributed in other minerals fluoride as well as other minerals is naturally transported from the lithosphere to the hydrosphere atmosphere and living organisms at varying levels depending on geological formation chuah et al 2016 fawell et al 2006 song et al 2017 mesdaghinia et al 2010 who 2005 although fluoride is not an essential nutrient for human life its adequate intake is necessary for preventing dental caries in both children and adults the caries preventive effect of fluoride is mainly due to the increasing resistance of tooth enamel to acidic ph promoting remineralization of enamel lesions interference with the metabolism of sugars by cariogenic bacteria in dental plaque and germicidal effect on cariogenic bacteria in contrast excess exposure to fluoride can reversely lead to both acute and chronic negative health consequences the acute toxicity of fluoride is due to impairment of the activity of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes which can be even fatal in accidental extremely high intake doses via ingestion inhalation or dermal route the main adverse health effects of elevated exposure to fluoride are the chronic consequences of enamel or dental and skeletal fluorosis dental fluorosis is a cosmetic effect resulted from excess intake of fluoride during the preeruptive formation of enamel therefore only infant and children up to the age of 8 years are exposed to the risk of developing the adverse effect abtahi et al 2018a fawell et al 2006 institute of medicine 1997 who 2005 dental fluorosis is characterized by intrinsic discoloration of teeth in a degree ranged from a few white flecks to widespread brown stains in moderate to severe enamel fluorosis cases the teeth are also physically damaged in the form of discrete or confluent pitting and a corroded looking appearance in order to characterize the degree of dental fluorosis a number of indexes have been developed the most commonly used of which is dean s fluorosis index this index characterizes an individual s dental fluorosis on the basis of the most severe conditions of fluorosis found on at least two teeth and describes the fluorosis scores in six categories as normal questionable very mild mild moderate and severe according to dean s index the dental fluorosis scores of mild or worse are considered to be of aesthetic concern iheozor ejiofor et al 2015 rango et al 2014 shanthi et al 2014 walls 2018 tolerable upper intake level ul of fluoride for enamel fluorosis of aesthetic concern has been established to be 0 10 mg kg d for infant and children up to the age of 8 years institute of medicine 1997 skeletal fluorosis is an adult disorder of the bones and joints caused by excessive fluoride accumulation in the bone for at least 10 years severity of skeletal fluorosis is associated with the level and duration of exposure to fluoride ranged from the asymptomatic preclinical stage to very advanced phase with a number of painful and disabling symptoms including calcification of ligaments and tendons neurological defects due to compression of the spinal cord osteosclerosis exostoses possibly osteoporosis of long bones decreased movement of joints crippling deformities of the spine and major joints and muscle wasting fawell et al 2006 institute of medicine 1997 who 2005 most epidemiological researches and extensive reviews of the scientific literature have indicated that clinical phases of skeletal fluorosis are associated with a fluoride intake at least 10 mg day for 10 years or more based on epidemiological evidence for skeletal fluorosis a ul of 10 mg day has been derived for fluoride intake by people older than 8 years institute of medicine 1997 dental fluorosis is well known to be one of the most widespread endemic health problems occurring in many countries throughout the world in contrast the occurrence of endemic skeletal fluorosis is limited to several parts of the world such as africa india and china mostly due to a much higher threshold level of fluoride intake for the last outcome although dental and skeletal fluorosis are primarily related to the elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water other sources of exposure to fluoride such as foodstuff especially tea fish curly kale endive etc combustion of high fluoride coal etc can exhibit an important contribution in prevalence of the health problems battaleb looie et al 2013 de carvalho et al 2013 fawell et al 2006 harrison 2005 institute of medicine 1997 mohebbi et al 2013 petersen et al 2005 based on the adverse health effects world health organization who has established a guideline value of 1 5 mg l for fluoride in drinking water who 2011 inasmuch as fluoride is one of the three chemical contaminants of the greatest health concern in water resources all across the world quantification of health losses from elevated fluoride levels in drinking water is of importance and can help to determine the contribution of drinking water in dental and skeletal fluorosis and health benefits of defluoridation schemes as well as to set priorities for environmental health action plan based on the cost effectiveness abtahi et al 2015 abtahi et al 2018b amini et al 2014 etchie et al 2014 hänninen et al 2014 prüss ustün et al 2016 who 2011 zhang et al 2018 fewtrell et al 2006 made the first attempt to evaluate the burden of disease due to fluoride in drinking water at global regional and national levels using exposure response curves of dental and skeletal fluorosis predicting water fluoride levels and estimating the distribution of population into the exposure levels due to a number of data gaps such as drinking water fluoride levels the proportion of people exposed to each fluoride level etc the authors concluded that the obtained results were unlikely to be precise and suggested the need for a series of the disease burden studies at national level the objective of this study was to assess the burden of disease attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water by sex and age group at the national and subnational levels in iran using the results of fluoride measurement in drinking water samples at the community level throughout the country in 2017 and most recently developed exposure response curves for the health outcomes the spatial trend in the attributable burden of disease was analyzed and the hotspot provinces were determined to be addressed in national environmental health action plan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in iran at the national provincial urban and rural levels iran located in the southwest of asia is divided into 31 provinces iran is the world s 18th largest country covering an area of 1 648 195 km2 it is the world s 18th most populous country with a population exceeding 80 000 000 people in 2017 that about 73 8 of the population are urban the estimated nominal gross domestic product gdp and gdp per capita at purchasing power parity gpd per capita ppp of iran in 2017 are us 439 5 billion and us 20 950 respectively iran is ranked the 24th largest economy in the world based on nominal gdp and as an upper middle income economy 63rd among 185 countries based on gpd per capita ppp the world bank 2017 about 85 of the country s area is considered to be arid or semi arid and average annual precipitation in iran 250 mm is one third of the global value similar to most of the other countries located in southwest of asia iran is facing with a drastic water crisis according to falkenmark index iran with per capita renewable water of less than 1700 m3 capita y in 2017 is considered to be in water stress condition the major causes of the current water crisis were determined to be a rapid population growth and disproportionate spatial population distribution b inefficient agriculture sector and c lack of demand management and disintegrated planning for development the water crisis can seriously affect water supply systems and should be taken into more consideration madani 2014 zargan and waez mousavi 2016 the community water supply systems in iran are relatively modern and coverage of piped water supply in the entire country urban and rural communities are 95 5 98 7 and 86 7 respectively contribution of surface water resources in the water supply for the entire country urban and rural communities are 28 5 35 0 and 10 2 respectively point of use water treatment systems and consumption of bottled water in the country are not popular and most of the ingested drinking water is taken from the public water distribution networks abtahi et al 2016 2 2 data collection of drinking water fluoride level elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water as well as occurrence of dental fluorosis have been reported in different areas of the country especially in two southern provinces of bushehr and fars in this study fluoride concentration in drinking water at the community level throughout the country in 2017 were obtained from two reliable databases of drinking water quality including 1 urban and rural water and wastewater companies and 2 universities of medical sciences and health services the data collection was double checked and inaccurate records were cleaned in general over 150 000 acceptable records of drinking water fluoride level were obtained the records of drinking water fluoride level during 2017 were separated at the community level and the annual average values at the community level were considered as the fluoride concentration of drinking water 2 3 exposure to fluoride through drinking water and health risk assessment exposure to fluoride from drinking water can be occurred through ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation but amount of fluoride intake from drinking water through dermal absorption and inhalation pathways is negligible therefore in this study exposure to fluoride from drinking water was estimated only based on the daily water ingestion using the following equation erdal and buchanan 2004 fallahzadeh et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 1 e d i s a c i r s a e f e d a a f c f a t where edi s a is the estimated daily intake of fluoride from drinking water for sex s and age group a mg kg d c is the fluoride level of drinking water mg l ir is the ingestion rate of drinking water for sex s and age group a ml kg d ef is the exposure frequency d y ed is the exposure duration for age group a y af is the absorption ratio unitless cf is the conversion coefficient 10 3 l ml and at is the averaging time d due to different nutritional requirements sensitivity to adverse health effects and drinking water consumption the edi was separately estimated for 9 age groups life stages as follows 1 0 6 months 2 7 12 months 3 1 3 y 4 4 8 y 5 9 13 y 6 14 19 y 7 19 y 8 pregnant women 15 44 y and 9 lactating women 15 44 y the age sex distribution of population at national and subnational were extracted from the last national population and housing census of iran statistical center of iran 2017 the ingestion rate of drinking water by sex and age group was extracted from usepa 2004 the exposure frequency for drinking water consumption is assumed to be 365 d y the exposure duration was the total life period of each age group for example the ed of infant 0 6 months was 0 5 y the averaging time was calculated by multiplying the exposure duration by the number of days per year to be 365 d y the absorption of fluoride from ingested water is nearly complete therefore the absorption ratio was considered to be unity the edi for each sex and age group was characterized by two values under two conditions 1 average or central tendency exposure cte using an average ir to represent a typical scenario and 2 reasonable maximum exposure rme using a 90th percentile ir to illustrate a plausible worst case scenario aghapour et al 2018 erdal and buchanan 2004 fallahzadeh et al 2018 institute of medicine 1997 zhang et al 2017 health risk assessment hra developed by the national academy of sciences in 1983 is a process for evaluating the potential adverse health effects of exposure to harmful physical chemical and microbial agents of the environment hra process is extensively used for development of health based environmental standards risk prioritizing and ranking and estimation of adverse health effects of different environments hra framework consists of four steps as follows health problem identification dose response assessment exposure assessment and risk characterization in this study hra of exposure to fluoride through drinking water for dental fluorosis by age group and sex was performed using the dose response assessment developed by united states environmental protection agency usepa inasmuch as dental fluorosis is caused during the preeruptive development of the teeth only the people up to the age of 8 years are exposed to the risk of dental fluorosis in the hra approach hazard quotient hq as a measure of dental fluorosis risk from fluoride intake through drinking water is calculated using the following equation chen et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2018 mirzabeygi et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 2 h q s a e d i s a rfd where hq s a is the hazard quotient of dental fluorosis risk for sex s and age group a and rfd is the reference dose of fluoride to be 0 06 mg kg d the rfd is an estimate of a daily exposure of sensitive subgroups of the target population to a toxic substance that based on the best available knowledge do not cause a considerable risk of adverse health effects during lifetime the hq was estimated for three age groups to be 0 6 months 7 12 months 1 3 y and 4 8 y the hq value is estimated based on the rme scenario and is interpreted as follows no considerable risk of relevant health effects for values less than 1 and potential significant risk of relevant health effects for values greater than 1 2 4 estimation of the attributable burden of disease in this study the burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water is quantified in terms of the disability adjusted life year daly daly is the most frequently used summary measure of population health that was introduced in the first study of the global burden of disease gbd the summary measure combines mortality and non fatal health outcomes of causes or risk factors into a single value through the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality ylls and years lived with disability ylds as follows abtahi et al 2018a prüss üstün et al 2003 prüss ustün et al 2011 3 daly yll yld according to the literature review the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution in dental and skeletal fluorosis are considered to be 1 5 and 4 0 mg l respectively institute of medicine 1997 who 2005 2011 inasmuch as the annual average of fluoride concentrations in drinking water at the community level were lower than 4 0 mg l in all of the cases the burden of disease attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water was only related to dental fluorosis the exposure response relationship for the contribution of elevated fluoride levels of drinking water in dental fluorosis was extracted from iheozor ejiofor et al 2015 the proportion of population with dental fluorosis of aesthetic concern with 95 confidence limits as a function of drinking water fluoride level is presented in fig 1 the attributable prevalence ap of dental fluorosis for elevated fluoride levels of drinking water was estimated using the following equation 4 a p s a p x y u f x f y p s a p x where ap q a p is the attributable prevalence of dental fluorosis due to elevated fluoride levels of drinking water for sex s age group a and province p f x is the prevalence of dental fluorosis as a function of drinking water fluoride level x obtained from fig 1 ranged from higher than y threshold level of fluoride in drinking water for dental fluorosis to u the highest level of fluoride in drinking water f y is the proportion of population with dental fluorosis at drinking water fluoride level y and p s a p x is the population fraction exposed to level x of fluoride in drinking water for sex s age group a province p as can be seen in fig 1 dental fluorosis is occurred at any fluoride level of drinking water hence in order to characterize the net contribution of elevated water fluoride level in the prevalence of dental fluorosis the background values for the threshold water fluoride level for dental fluorosis was subtracted from the prevalence for the target water fluoride level obtained from fig 1 the age of onset for dental fluorosis was considered to be eight years fewtrell et al 2006 iheozor ejiofor et al 2015 institute of medicine 1997 due to non fatal nature of dental fluorosis ylls were zero and all the attributable burden of disease dalys was caused by years lived with disability ylds the burden of disease attributable to dental fluorosis was calculated using the following equation abtahi et al 2017 prüss üstün et al 2003 5 d a l y a s p 0 y l d a s p a p a s p d w k c exp r a r β 2 exp r β d a r β d a 1 exp r β a r β a 1 1 k r 1 exp r d where daly a s p is the daly of dental fluorosis attributable to elevated fluoride levels of drinking water for sex s age group a and province p dw is the disability weight of dental fluorosis d is the duration of dental fluorosis years a is the age of dental fluorosis incidence r is the time discount rate to estimate the net present value of years of life lost in the future 0 03 k is the age weighting modulation constant 0 for no age weighting and 1 for age weighting c is the adjustment constant for age weights 0 1658 and β is the age weighting constant 0 04 it is also worth to mention that the response provided in fig 1 is the prevalence of dental fluorosis therefore the estimated dalys attributable to elevated water fluoride level using the exposure response relationship is only the current prevalence of the attributed dalys not its incidence in a specific year dental fluorosis is not included in the gbd study and no official disability weight is introduced for the outcome until now based on the last set of disability weights for the gbd gbd 2016 dalys and hale collaborators 2017 and the previous study on the global burden of disease due to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water by fewtrell et al 2006 and due to the mild severity of the outcome the disability weight of dental fluorosis was considered to be as low as 0 003 95 uncertainty interval ui 0 001 to 0 006 and constant with age spatial variation in the attributable burden of disease was assessed by province and community type and the national dalys due to fluoride in drinking water by community type were calculated by aggregation of the provincial values the 95 uncertainty intervals of the attributable dalys 95 ui have been estimated using monte carlo simulation methods by r 3 5 0 for windows monte carlo simulation provides the distribution of outcome values by calculating the outcomes in a repeated manner through substituting random values for any factor with inherent uncertainty from the relevant probability distribution robert and casella 2009 zhang et al 2017 in this study the probabilistic factors of the attributable dalys were the prevalence of dental fluorosis as a function of drinking water fluoride level and dw of dental fluorosis and the simulation was performed by calculating the attributable dalys for 10 000 iterations the effects of age sex and community type on the edi hq and attributable burden of disease of fluoride in drinking water with a significance level of 5 were determined by three way factorial analysis of variance anova methods using statistical package for social science spss for windows version 21 software as assumptions of the parametric test normality of data distribution and homogeneity of variances based on the three independent variables were evaluated and confirmed using the shapiro wilk and levene s tests respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluoride concentration in drinking water the population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels by province and community type at the national level in 2017 is provided in fig 2 in 19 out of 31 provinces of the country all the people received drinking water with fluoride levels lower than 1 5 mg l the threshold value for dental fluorosis and the guideline value of who and in six other provinces population coverage of drinking water with elevated fluoride levels above 1 5 mg l was lower than 1 but in the last six provinces bushehr fars hormozgan west azarbaijan ghazvin and kerman proportions of population receiving drinking water with elevated fluoride levels were considerable to be 11 5 4 6 4 3 1 8 1 7 and 1 4 respectively the elevated drinking water fluoride levels in several areas of the country especially in bushehr fars and west azarbaijan were repeatedly reported in the literature amini et al 2016 dehghani et al 2018 dobaradaran et al 2008 2018 taghipour et al 2016 yousefi et al 2018 the population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels at the provincial and national levels were different by community type so that the number of provinces completely covered by drinking water with non elevated fluoride levels for urban and rural communities were respectively 25 and 21 and the three highest population proportions of drinking water with elevated fluoride levels were reported to be occurred in bushehr 11 6 fars 10 7 and hormozgan 5 3 for rural communities and bushehr 11 5 hormozgan 3 3 and ghazvin 2 3 for urban communities respectively the population proportions receiving drinking water with the elevated fluoride levels in the entire urban and rural communities at the national level were found to be 0 8 0 4 and 1 8 respectively the higher percentage of violation from the guideline value in rural communities can be caused by the greater share of groundwater resources in the rural water supply so that the contribution of groundwater resources in rural and urban water supply at the national level are 90 and 65 respectively the distribution of the country s population into the categories of drinking water fluoride level was determined to be 70 5 for lower than 0 5 mg l lower than the minimum recommended value for preventing dental caries 27 1 for 0 5 1 0 mg l the optimum recommended range for preventing dental caries 1 6 for 1 0 1 5 mg l 0 5 for 1 5 2 0 mg l 0 2 for 2 3 mg l and 0 1 for higher than 3 mg l the highest annual average of drinking water fluoride concentration was observed in a rural community in fars to be 3 9 mg l that was lower than the introduced threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for skeletal fluorosis inasmuch as the artificial resources of fluoride discharge into the water bodies such as the production of aluminum brick tile ceramic phosphate fertilizer steel glass fiber combustion of fluoride rich coal etc are not significant in the areas of the country with the elevated drinking water fluoride levels the environmental health problem is considered to be mainly caused by the natural resources through the contact with rocks and soil due to geochemical properties and high fluoride content of lithosphere in the regions although elevated fluoride levels in drinking water have been reported in many countries all across the world most of the reported cases have been concentrated in developing countries possibly due to inadequate technical and financial supports for removal of excess fluoride using water treatment schemes fawell et al 2006 fewtrell et al 2006 guissouma et al 2017 mesdaghinia et al 2010 3 2 health risk assessment table 1 provides distribution of population based on the edi of fluoride through drinking water by age sex and community type at the national level in 2017 the distribution of population based on the edi of fluoride via drinking water for the cte scenario at the national level was determined to be 66 71 for lower than 0 01 mg kg d 32 32 for 0 01 0 03 mg kg d 0 78 for 0 03 0 05 mg kg d 0 15 for 0 05 0 07 mg kg d 0 04 for 0 07 0 10 mg kg d and zero for higher than 0 10 mg kg d the corresponding distribution for the rme scenario was found to be 19 68 for lower than 0 01 mg kg d 72 38 for 0 01 0 03 mg kg d 6 66 for 0 03 0 05 mg kg d 0 88 for 0 05 0 07 mg kg d 0 28 for 0 07 0 10 mg kg d and 0 12 for higher than 0 10 mg kg d according to table 1 the edis for both the cte and rme scenarios at the national level were significantly affected by age and community type p value 0 01 but exhibited no considerable difference by sex the edis of fluoride via drinking water fell by age until 19 years and then exhibited a slight increase the edi category of 0 01 0 03 mg kg d for the cte can be considered as the optimum fluoride intake range via drinking water for preventing dental caries for all people excluding the age group lower than 6 months the adequate intake of fluoride for infants 0 6 months is 0 001 0 003 mg kg d based on the rme the plausible worst case scenario for adverse health effects the population proportions of elevated fluoride intake higher than 0 05 mg kg d via drinking water for children under 1 year old were 23 01 for 0 05 0 07 mg kg d 15 66 for 0 07 0 10 mg kg d and 13 09 for higher than 0 10 mg kg d that were much more than those of other age groups fig 3 shows the population distribution of the hq of fluoride intake through drinking water by age group and community type at the national level based on the hq values the percentage of population at risk of dental fluorosis decreased by age and was much lower in urban communities so that the highest proportions of population at the risk of dental fluorosis were observed in infants 0 6 months lived in rural communities to be 46 2 for moderate risk hq 1 to 2 and 19 7 for high risk hq higher than 2 it is worth to be noted that dental fluorosis is a permanent outcome and its occurrence in infants results in the most health losses the percentages of population at risk of dental fluorosis in the entire country were determined to be 47 6 for 0 6 months 27 3 for 7 12 months 2 4 for 1 3 y and 1 3 for 4 8 y the higher risks of fluoride exposure from drinking water for infants and younger children were also reported by chen et al 2017 guissouma et al 2017 martínez acuña et al 2016 and yousefi et al 2018 these results indicated that due to high drinking water consumption per kg of body weight in children under 1 year old even moderate drinking water fluoride levels of 0 5 1 0 mg l that are needed for preventing dental caries can also cause a risk of dental fluorosis therefore it is recommended that only in the communities with fluoride levels lower than 0 5 mg l children under 1 year old be fed by community drinking water supply and in the other circumstances drinking water for the age group be provided form other drinking water sources with low fluoride contents such as household water treatment systems bottled drinking water etc 3 3 national attributable burden of disease table 2 provides prevalence per 100 000 people dalys daly rate per 100 000 people and age standardized values of dalys and daly rate due to dental fluorosis attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water by sex and community type at the national level in 2017 the attributable prevalence dalys daly rate age standardized dalys and age standardized daly rate at the national level were estimated to be 60 uncertainty interval ui 95 48 to 69 3443 1034 6940 4 31 1 29 8 68 3699 1111 7457 and 4 63 1 39 9 33 respectively the national burden of disease attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels for females and males was very close to each other but significantly affected by community type p value 0 01 so that the attributable prevalence dalys and daly rate at the national level were respectively 153 122 177 2296 690 4628 and 11 05 3 32 22 27 in rural areas and 27 22 31 1154 346 2326 and 1 95 0 59 3 93 in urban ones due to the very low disability weight of dental fluorosis and small proportions of elevated drinking water fluoride levels the estimated burden of disease was relatively low as compared with those of other environmental risks and oral disorders at the national level according to global burden of disease collaborative network 2018 and gbd 2016 risk factors collaborators 2017 the national daly rate attributable to all environmental risks included in the gbd in 2016 was determined to be 1184 1020 1366 and the five environmental risks with the highest daly rates were respectively ambient particulate matter pollution 853 699 to 1016 lead exposure 257 159 to 376 unsafe water source in terms of microbial aspects 85 20 to 151 no access to handwashing facility 85 20 to 151 and unsafe sanitation 29 14 to 47 the national daly rate of all oral disorders was 222 132 345 and contribution of causes in the disease burden was in the following order edentulism and severe tooth loss for 36 periodontal diseases for 28 other oral disorders for 24 caries of permanent teeth for 11 and caries of deciduous teeth for 1 gbd 2016 dalys and hale collaborators 2017 global burden of disease collaborative network 2018 the estimated burden of disease attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels can be used for cost effectiveness analysis of drinking water defluoridation schemes as well as prioritizing public health action plans fluoride in drinking water along with many other environmental risks do not still meet the inclusion criteria of the gbd therefore this estimation and similar efforts on fluoride exposure via drinking water and other environmental risks are also of importance in terms of providing reliable frameworks for inclusion of much more environmental risks such as in future iterations of the gbd to achieve more accurate results of contribution of environmental risks in the total burden of disease abtahi et al 2018b amini et al 2014 hänninen et al 2014 prüss üstün et al 2003 prüss ustün et al 2011 2016 fig 4 shows the age distribution of national dalys and daly rate attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels by community type the age distribution of the attributable dalys was affected by population age structure and the values ranged from 83 25 167 for the age group 60 64 y to 457 137 921 for the age group 25 29 y in contrast the attributable daly rate exhibited the highest value for the age group 10 14 y 6 06 1 82 to 12 21 and then constantly fell by age to the age group higher than 65 y 2 49 0 75 to 5 03 because duration of the outcome decreased by age the lowest attributable daly rate accounted for the age group 5 9 y 2 46 0 74 to 4 95 because the age of onset for dental fluorosis was 8 years and in the age group only the people aged 8 9 years old were at risk of the outcome in addition to significant effects of age and community type on the edi hq and attributable burden of disease of fluoride in drinking water the interaction effect between age group and community type was also statistically significant p value 0 01 fig 5 displays the burden of disease associated with elevated drinking water fluoride contents by province and community type at the national level the spatial distribution of the national attributable dalys and daly rate by province in 2017 are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 as can be seen in figs 5 7 the attributable burden of disease only occurred in 10 out of 31 provinces and most of the health losses were concentrated in four provinces fars bushehr west azarbaijan and hormozgan about 94 of the national attributable dalys and the observed values in other provinces razavi khorasan kerman tehran yazd ghazvin and ardebil were negligible number of cases of dental fluorosis associated with elevated drinking water fluoride levels in fars bushehr west azarbaijan and hormozgan were estimated to be 27 268 21 822 to 31 448 5613 4471 6572 5480 4371 6373 and 5047 4023 5883 respectively the contribution of the four leading provinces in the national attributable dalys was as follows fars for 58 3 1967 592 to 3964 bushehr for 12 3 414 124 to 836 west azarbaijan for 11 9 400 120 to 808 and hormozgan for 11 2 377 113 to 761 ranking of provinces by the attributable daly rate were partly different from that by the attributable dalys the four highest attributable daly rates were observed in fars bushehr hormozgan and west azarbaijan to be 40 56 12 20 81 71 35 59 10 66 71 83 21 24 6 37 42 84 and 12 27 3 68 24 73 respectively the provincial attributable burden of disease was different by community type so that in four out of the ten provinces kerman tehran yazd and ardebil the burden of disease only occurred in rural communities and reversely in another one ghazvin urban communities accounted for all the health losses in addition to ghazvin bushehr and hormozgan also exhibited higher dalys and daly rates for urban communities but in the other seven provinces the values for rural communities were higher than those for urban ones although the national attributable burden of disease was relatively low the adverse health effects were mainly concentrated in limited provinces causing considerable provincial daly rates this ununiformed spatial distribution of the health losses is of advantage to provide improved drinking water for most of the affected people by implementation of a limited number of water treatment schemes there are two interventions for preventing the health outcomes of high levels of fluoride in drinking water to be changing water resources of drinking water supply and defluoridation of drinking water the conventional methods for defluoridation of drinking water are adsorption by activated alumina and bone char membrane processes and ion exchange many attempts for defluoridation of drinking water especially in developing countries have led to failure due to relatively high technical financial and organizational requirements accordingly the provision of fluoride safe drinking water from alternative sources should be put as the first priority for management of drinking water quality abtahi et al 2018c crittenden et al 2012 fawell et al 2006 mahvi et al 2018 mesdaghinia et al 2010 wang et al 2012 investigated the effectiveness of the interventions for fluoride safe water supply in china this study exhibited that both the interventions alternative low fluoride water sources and defluoridation of water successfully decreased drinking water fluoride levels to meet the government standard 1 2 mg l and resulted in a significant prevention of dental and skeletal fluorosis in the target areas in order to prevent the health losses in the communities with elevated drinking water fluoride level as soon as possible household water treatment systems can be considered as a temporary solution until the implementation of the community based interventions in addition to compensate the increasing trend of oral conditions at the national level implementation of fluoride safe drinking water supply schemes can decrease the health inequalities in oral conditions between socio economic classes due to being beneficial at the community level abtahi et al 2018a cho et al 2014 homaie rad et al 2016 in addition to dental and skeletal fluorosis a range of other health effects such as hypertension hypothyroidism a decrease in children s intelligence neurological problems etc are also suspected to be associated with chronic high level exposure to fluoride amini et al 2011 pearce 2015 sharma et al 2009 tang et al 2008 therefore the actual disease burden of elevated drinking water fluoride levels may be more than the estimated values it is recommended that the probable outcomes of fluoride be taken into consideration for setting priorities for control of environmental exposure to chemicals 4 conclusions the national burden of disease attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels was only resulted from dental fluorosis the attributable burden of disease was not significantly affected by sex but was considerably different by age community type and province the national attributable burden of disease was relatively low due to the very low disability weight of dental fluorosis and small proportions of elevated drinking water fluoride levels implementation of fluoride safe drinking water supply schemes especially in the four leading provinces fars bushehr west azarbaijan and hormozgan was needed to prevent the health losses and to move towards a healthier environment the introduced framework for assessing health losses of elevated fluoride levels in drinking water can be used in future studies at local national regional and global levels to extend knowledge about disease burden related to environmental exposure to chemicals as well as to prioritize environmental health measures declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

18847,national and subnational burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water apportioned by sex age group province and community type in iran 2017 were quantified based on disability adjusted life years dalys the attributable burden of disease was estimated using four input data 1 effect size of elevated drinking water fluoride levels for dental and skeletal fluorosis 2 population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels 3 the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution in dental and skeletal fluorosis and 4 age sex distribution of population the attributable burden of disease was only related to dental fluorosis because the fluoride levels were lower than the threshold value for skeletal fluorosis 4 0 mg l in all of the cases the national attributable prevalence per 100 000 people dalys and daly rate in 2017 were calculated to be 60 95 uncertainty interval 48 69 3443 1034 6940 and 4 31 1 29 8 68 respectively the national attributable burden of disease was not significantly different by sex but was affected by age and community type in a manner that the highest daly rate was related to the age group 10 14 y 6 06 1 82 12 21 and over 66 of the national attributable dalys occurred in rural communities the attributable burden of disease occurred only in 10 out of 31 provinces and about 94 of the attributable dalys were concentrated in four provinces fars 1967 592 3964 bushehr 414 124 836 west azarbaijan 400 120 808 and hormozgan 377 113 761 implementation of fluoride safe drinking water supply schemes in the four leading provinces can prevent most of the national health losses and partly compensate the increasing trend of disease burden from oral conditions at the national level graphical abstract image 1 keywords attributable burden of disease defluoridation dental fluorosis elevated fluoride level environmental risk factor health risk assessment 1 introduction fluorine is the 13th most abundant element in earth s crust due to its extremely high reactivity fluorine almost entirely combines with other elements and hence is mainly occurred as the ionic form of fluoride in nature the major sources of fluoride in the environment are the minerals fluorite or fluorspar caf₂ fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and cryolite na3alf6 but it is also widely distributed in other minerals fluoride as well as other minerals is naturally transported from the lithosphere to the hydrosphere atmosphere and living organisms at varying levels depending on geological formation chuah et al 2016 fawell et al 2006 song et al 2017 mesdaghinia et al 2010 who 2005 although fluoride is not an essential nutrient for human life its adequate intake is necessary for preventing dental caries in both children and adults the caries preventive effect of fluoride is mainly due to the increasing resistance of tooth enamel to acidic ph promoting remineralization of enamel lesions interference with the metabolism of sugars by cariogenic bacteria in dental plaque and germicidal effect on cariogenic bacteria in contrast excess exposure to fluoride can reversely lead to both acute and chronic negative health consequences the acute toxicity of fluoride is due to impairment of the activity of proteolytic and glycolytic enzymes which can be even fatal in accidental extremely high intake doses via ingestion inhalation or dermal route the main adverse health effects of elevated exposure to fluoride are the chronic consequences of enamel or dental and skeletal fluorosis dental fluorosis is a cosmetic effect resulted from excess intake of fluoride during the preeruptive formation of enamel therefore only infant and children up to the age of 8 years are exposed to the risk of developing the adverse effect abtahi et al 2018a fawell et al 2006 institute of medicine 1997 who 2005 dental fluorosis is characterized by intrinsic discoloration of teeth in a degree ranged from a few white flecks to widespread brown stains in moderate to severe enamel fluorosis cases the teeth are also physically damaged in the form of discrete or confluent pitting and a corroded looking appearance in order to characterize the degree of dental fluorosis a number of indexes have been developed the most commonly used of which is dean s fluorosis index this index characterizes an individual s dental fluorosis on the basis of the most severe conditions of fluorosis found on at least two teeth and describes the fluorosis scores in six categories as normal questionable very mild mild moderate and severe according to dean s index the dental fluorosis scores of mild or worse are considered to be of aesthetic concern iheozor ejiofor et al 2015 rango et al 2014 shanthi et al 2014 walls 2018 tolerable upper intake level ul of fluoride for enamel fluorosis of aesthetic concern has been established to be 0 10 mg kg d for infant and children up to the age of 8 years institute of medicine 1997 skeletal fluorosis is an adult disorder of the bones and joints caused by excessive fluoride accumulation in the bone for at least 10 years severity of skeletal fluorosis is associated with the level and duration of exposure to fluoride ranged from the asymptomatic preclinical stage to very advanced phase with a number of painful and disabling symptoms including calcification of ligaments and tendons neurological defects due to compression of the spinal cord osteosclerosis exostoses possibly osteoporosis of long bones decreased movement of joints crippling deformities of the spine and major joints and muscle wasting fawell et al 2006 institute of medicine 1997 who 2005 most epidemiological researches and extensive reviews of the scientific literature have indicated that clinical phases of skeletal fluorosis are associated with a fluoride intake at least 10 mg day for 10 years or more based on epidemiological evidence for skeletal fluorosis a ul of 10 mg day has been derived for fluoride intake by people older than 8 years institute of medicine 1997 dental fluorosis is well known to be one of the most widespread endemic health problems occurring in many countries throughout the world in contrast the occurrence of endemic skeletal fluorosis is limited to several parts of the world such as africa india and china mostly due to a much higher threshold level of fluoride intake for the last outcome although dental and skeletal fluorosis are primarily related to the elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water other sources of exposure to fluoride such as foodstuff especially tea fish curly kale endive etc combustion of high fluoride coal etc can exhibit an important contribution in prevalence of the health problems battaleb looie et al 2013 de carvalho et al 2013 fawell et al 2006 harrison 2005 institute of medicine 1997 mohebbi et al 2013 petersen et al 2005 based on the adverse health effects world health organization who has established a guideline value of 1 5 mg l for fluoride in drinking water who 2011 inasmuch as fluoride is one of the three chemical contaminants of the greatest health concern in water resources all across the world quantification of health losses from elevated fluoride levels in drinking water is of importance and can help to determine the contribution of drinking water in dental and skeletal fluorosis and health benefits of defluoridation schemes as well as to set priorities for environmental health action plan based on the cost effectiveness abtahi et al 2015 abtahi et al 2018b amini et al 2014 etchie et al 2014 hänninen et al 2014 prüss ustün et al 2016 who 2011 zhang et al 2018 fewtrell et al 2006 made the first attempt to evaluate the burden of disease due to fluoride in drinking water at global regional and national levels using exposure response curves of dental and skeletal fluorosis predicting water fluoride levels and estimating the distribution of population into the exposure levels due to a number of data gaps such as drinking water fluoride levels the proportion of people exposed to each fluoride level etc the authors concluded that the obtained results were unlikely to be precise and suggested the need for a series of the disease burden studies at national level the objective of this study was to assess the burden of disease attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water by sex and age group at the national and subnational levels in iran using the results of fluoride measurement in drinking water samples at the community level throughout the country in 2017 and most recently developed exposure response curves for the health outcomes the spatial trend in the attributable burden of disease was analyzed and the hotspot provinces were determined to be addressed in national environmental health action plan 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in iran at the national provincial urban and rural levels iran located in the southwest of asia is divided into 31 provinces iran is the world s 18th largest country covering an area of 1 648 195 km2 it is the world s 18th most populous country with a population exceeding 80 000 000 people in 2017 that about 73 8 of the population are urban the estimated nominal gross domestic product gdp and gdp per capita at purchasing power parity gpd per capita ppp of iran in 2017 are us 439 5 billion and us 20 950 respectively iran is ranked the 24th largest economy in the world based on nominal gdp and as an upper middle income economy 63rd among 185 countries based on gpd per capita ppp the world bank 2017 about 85 of the country s area is considered to be arid or semi arid and average annual precipitation in iran 250 mm is one third of the global value similar to most of the other countries located in southwest of asia iran is facing with a drastic water crisis according to falkenmark index iran with per capita renewable water of less than 1700 m3 capita y in 2017 is considered to be in water stress condition the major causes of the current water crisis were determined to be a rapid population growth and disproportionate spatial population distribution b inefficient agriculture sector and c lack of demand management and disintegrated planning for development the water crisis can seriously affect water supply systems and should be taken into more consideration madani 2014 zargan and waez mousavi 2016 the community water supply systems in iran are relatively modern and coverage of piped water supply in the entire country urban and rural communities are 95 5 98 7 and 86 7 respectively contribution of surface water resources in the water supply for the entire country urban and rural communities are 28 5 35 0 and 10 2 respectively point of use water treatment systems and consumption of bottled water in the country are not popular and most of the ingested drinking water is taken from the public water distribution networks abtahi et al 2016 2 2 data collection of drinking water fluoride level elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water as well as occurrence of dental fluorosis have been reported in different areas of the country especially in two southern provinces of bushehr and fars in this study fluoride concentration in drinking water at the community level throughout the country in 2017 were obtained from two reliable databases of drinking water quality including 1 urban and rural water and wastewater companies and 2 universities of medical sciences and health services the data collection was double checked and inaccurate records were cleaned in general over 150 000 acceptable records of drinking water fluoride level were obtained the records of drinking water fluoride level during 2017 were separated at the community level and the annual average values at the community level were considered as the fluoride concentration of drinking water 2 3 exposure to fluoride through drinking water and health risk assessment exposure to fluoride from drinking water can be occurred through ingestion dermal absorption and inhalation but amount of fluoride intake from drinking water through dermal absorption and inhalation pathways is negligible therefore in this study exposure to fluoride from drinking water was estimated only based on the daily water ingestion using the following equation erdal and buchanan 2004 fallahzadeh et al 2018 yousefi et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 1 e d i s a c i r s a e f e d a a f c f a t where edi s a is the estimated daily intake of fluoride from drinking water for sex s and age group a mg kg d c is the fluoride level of drinking water mg l ir is the ingestion rate of drinking water for sex s and age group a ml kg d ef is the exposure frequency d y ed is the exposure duration for age group a y af is the absorption ratio unitless cf is the conversion coefficient 10 3 l ml and at is the averaging time d due to different nutritional requirements sensitivity to adverse health effects and drinking water consumption the edi was separately estimated for 9 age groups life stages as follows 1 0 6 months 2 7 12 months 3 1 3 y 4 4 8 y 5 9 13 y 6 14 19 y 7 19 y 8 pregnant women 15 44 y and 9 lactating women 15 44 y the age sex distribution of population at national and subnational were extracted from the last national population and housing census of iran statistical center of iran 2017 the ingestion rate of drinking water by sex and age group was extracted from usepa 2004 the exposure frequency for drinking water consumption is assumed to be 365 d y the exposure duration was the total life period of each age group for example the ed of infant 0 6 months was 0 5 y the averaging time was calculated by multiplying the exposure duration by the number of days per year to be 365 d y the absorption of fluoride from ingested water is nearly complete therefore the absorption ratio was considered to be unity the edi for each sex and age group was characterized by two values under two conditions 1 average or central tendency exposure cte using an average ir to represent a typical scenario and 2 reasonable maximum exposure rme using a 90th percentile ir to illustrate a plausible worst case scenario aghapour et al 2018 erdal and buchanan 2004 fallahzadeh et al 2018 institute of medicine 1997 zhang et al 2017 health risk assessment hra developed by the national academy of sciences in 1983 is a process for evaluating the potential adverse health effects of exposure to harmful physical chemical and microbial agents of the environment hra process is extensively used for development of health based environmental standards risk prioritizing and ranking and estimation of adverse health effects of different environments hra framework consists of four steps as follows health problem identification dose response assessment exposure assessment and risk characterization in this study hra of exposure to fluoride through drinking water for dental fluorosis by age group and sex was performed using the dose response assessment developed by united states environmental protection agency usepa inasmuch as dental fluorosis is caused during the preeruptive development of the teeth only the people up to the age of 8 years are exposed to the risk of dental fluorosis in the hra approach hazard quotient hq as a measure of dental fluorosis risk from fluoride intake through drinking water is calculated using the following equation chen et al 2017 fallahzadeh et al 2018 mirzabeygi et al 2018 zhang et al 2017 2 h q s a e d i s a rfd where hq s a is the hazard quotient of dental fluorosis risk for sex s and age group a and rfd is the reference dose of fluoride to be 0 06 mg kg d the rfd is an estimate of a daily exposure of sensitive subgroups of the target population to a toxic substance that based on the best available knowledge do not cause a considerable risk of adverse health effects during lifetime the hq was estimated for three age groups to be 0 6 months 7 12 months 1 3 y and 4 8 y the hq value is estimated based on the rme scenario and is interpreted as follows no considerable risk of relevant health effects for values less than 1 and potential significant risk of relevant health effects for values greater than 1 2 4 estimation of the attributable burden of disease in this study the burden of disease attributable to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water is quantified in terms of the disability adjusted life year daly daly is the most frequently used summary measure of population health that was introduced in the first study of the global burden of disease gbd the summary measure combines mortality and non fatal health outcomes of causes or risk factors into a single value through the sum of years of life lost due to premature mortality ylls and years lived with disability ylds as follows abtahi et al 2018a prüss üstün et al 2003 prüss ustün et al 2011 3 daly yll yld according to the literature review the threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for contribution in dental and skeletal fluorosis are considered to be 1 5 and 4 0 mg l respectively institute of medicine 1997 who 2005 2011 inasmuch as the annual average of fluoride concentrations in drinking water at the community level were lower than 4 0 mg l in all of the cases the burden of disease attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water was only related to dental fluorosis the exposure response relationship for the contribution of elevated fluoride levels of drinking water in dental fluorosis was extracted from iheozor ejiofor et al 2015 the proportion of population with dental fluorosis of aesthetic concern with 95 confidence limits as a function of drinking water fluoride level is presented in fig 1 the attributable prevalence ap of dental fluorosis for elevated fluoride levels of drinking water was estimated using the following equation 4 a p s a p x y u f x f y p s a p x where ap q a p is the attributable prevalence of dental fluorosis due to elevated fluoride levels of drinking water for sex s age group a and province p f x is the prevalence of dental fluorosis as a function of drinking water fluoride level x obtained from fig 1 ranged from higher than y threshold level of fluoride in drinking water for dental fluorosis to u the highest level of fluoride in drinking water f y is the proportion of population with dental fluorosis at drinking water fluoride level y and p s a p x is the population fraction exposed to level x of fluoride in drinking water for sex s age group a province p as can be seen in fig 1 dental fluorosis is occurred at any fluoride level of drinking water hence in order to characterize the net contribution of elevated water fluoride level in the prevalence of dental fluorosis the background values for the threshold water fluoride level for dental fluorosis was subtracted from the prevalence for the target water fluoride level obtained from fig 1 the age of onset for dental fluorosis was considered to be eight years fewtrell et al 2006 iheozor ejiofor et al 2015 institute of medicine 1997 due to non fatal nature of dental fluorosis ylls were zero and all the attributable burden of disease dalys was caused by years lived with disability ylds the burden of disease attributable to dental fluorosis was calculated using the following equation abtahi et al 2017 prüss üstün et al 2003 5 d a l y a s p 0 y l d a s p a p a s p d w k c exp r a r β 2 exp r β d a r β d a 1 exp r β a r β a 1 1 k r 1 exp r d where daly a s p is the daly of dental fluorosis attributable to elevated fluoride levels of drinking water for sex s age group a and province p dw is the disability weight of dental fluorosis d is the duration of dental fluorosis years a is the age of dental fluorosis incidence r is the time discount rate to estimate the net present value of years of life lost in the future 0 03 k is the age weighting modulation constant 0 for no age weighting and 1 for age weighting c is the adjustment constant for age weights 0 1658 and β is the age weighting constant 0 04 it is also worth to mention that the response provided in fig 1 is the prevalence of dental fluorosis therefore the estimated dalys attributable to elevated water fluoride level using the exposure response relationship is only the current prevalence of the attributed dalys not its incidence in a specific year dental fluorosis is not included in the gbd study and no official disability weight is introduced for the outcome until now based on the last set of disability weights for the gbd gbd 2016 dalys and hale collaborators 2017 and the previous study on the global burden of disease due to elevated fluoride levels in drinking water by fewtrell et al 2006 and due to the mild severity of the outcome the disability weight of dental fluorosis was considered to be as low as 0 003 95 uncertainty interval ui 0 001 to 0 006 and constant with age spatial variation in the attributable burden of disease was assessed by province and community type and the national dalys due to fluoride in drinking water by community type were calculated by aggregation of the provincial values the 95 uncertainty intervals of the attributable dalys 95 ui have been estimated using monte carlo simulation methods by r 3 5 0 for windows monte carlo simulation provides the distribution of outcome values by calculating the outcomes in a repeated manner through substituting random values for any factor with inherent uncertainty from the relevant probability distribution robert and casella 2009 zhang et al 2017 in this study the probabilistic factors of the attributable dalys were the prevalence of dental fluorosis as a function of drinking water fluoride level and dw of dental fluorosis and the simulation was performed by calculating the attributable dalys for 10 000 iterations the effects of age sex and community type on the edi hq and attributable burden of disease of fluoride in drinking water with a significance level of 5 were determined by three way factorial analysis of variance anova methods using statistical package for social science spss for windows version 21 software as assumptions of the parametric test normality of data distribution and homogeneity of variances based on the three independent variables were evaluated and confirmed using the shapiro wilk and levene s tests respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 fluoride concentration in drinking water the population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels by province and community type at the national level in 2017 is provided in fig 2 in 19 out of 31 provinces of the country all the people received drinking water with fluoride levels lower than 1 5 mg l the threshold value for dental fluorosis and the guideline value of who and in six other provinces population coverage of drinking water with elevated fluoride levels above 1 5 mg l was lower than 1 but in the last six provinces bushehr fars hormozgan west azarbaijan ghazvin and kerman proportions of population receiving drinking water with elevated fluoride levels were considerable to be 11 5 4 6 4 3 1 8 1 7 and 1 4 respectively the elevated drinking water fluoride levels in several areas of the country especially in bushehr fars and west azarbaijan were repeatedly reported in the literature amini et al 2016 dehghani et al 2018 dobaradaran et al 2008 2018 taghipour et al 2016 yousefi et al 2018 the population distribution of drinking water fluoride levels at the provincial and national levels were different by community type so that the number of provinces completely covered by drinking water with non elevated fluoride levels for urban and rural communities were respectively 25 and 21 and the three highest population proportions of drinking water with elevated fluoride levels were reported to be occurred in bushehr 11 6 fars 10 7 and hormozgan 5 3 for rural communities and bushehr 11 5 hormozgan 3 3 and ghazvin 2 3 for urban communities respectively the population proportions receiving drinking water with the elevated fluoride levels in the entire urban and rural communities at the national level were found to be 0 8 0 4 and 1 8 respectively the higher percentage of violation from the guideline value in rural communities can be caused by the greater share of groundwater resources in the rural water supply so that the contribution of groundwater resources in rural and urban water supply at the national level are 90 and 65 respectively the distribution of the country s population into the categories of drinking water fluoride level was determined to be 70 5 for lower than 0 5 mg l lower than the minimum recommended value for preventing dental caries 27 1 for 0 5 1 0 mg l the optimum recommended range for preventing dental caries 1 6 for 1 0 1 5 mg l 0 5 for 1 5 2 0 mg l 0 2 for 2 3 mg l and 0 1 for higher than 3 mg l the highest annual average of drinking water fluoride concentration was observed in a rural community in fars to be 3 9 mg l that was lower than the introduced threshold levels of fluoride in drinking water for skeletal fluorosis inasmuch as the artificial resources of fluoride discharge into the water bodies such as the production of aluminum brick tile ceramic phosphate fertilizer steel glass fiber combustion of fluoride rich coal etc are not significant in the areas of the country with the elevated drinking water fluoride levels the environmental health problem is considered to be mainly caused by the natural resources through the contact with rocks and soil due to geochemical properties and high fluoride content of lithosphere in the regions although elevated fluoride levels in drinking water have been reported in many countries all across the world most of the reported cases have been concentrated in developing countries possibly due to inadequate technical and financial supports for removal of excess fluoride using water treatment schemes fawell et al 2006 fewtrell et al 2006 guissouma et al 2017 mesdaghinia et al 2010 3 2 health risk assessment table 1 provides distribution of population based on the edi of fluoride through drinking water by age sex and community type at the national level in 2017 the distribution of population based on the edi of fluoride via drinking water for the cte scenario at the national level was determined to be 66 71 for lower than 0 01 mg kg d 32 32 for 0 01 0 03 mg kg d 0 78 for 0 03 0 05 mg kg d 0 15 for 0 05 0 07 mg kg d 0 04 for 0 07 0 10 mg kg d and zero for higher than 0 10 mg kg d the corresponding distribution for the rme scenario was found to be 19 68 for lower than 0 01 mg kg d 72 38 for 0 01 0 03 mg kg d 6 66 for 0 03 0 05 mg kg d 0 88 for 0 05 0 07 mg kg d 0 28 for 0 07 0 10 mg kg d and 0 12 for higher than 0 10 mg kg d according to table 1 the edis for both the cte and rme scenarios at the national level were significantly affected by age and community type p value 0 01 but exhibited no considerable difference by sex the edis of fluoride via drinking water fell by age until 19 years and then exhibited a slight increase the edi category of 0 01 0 03 mg kg d for the cte can be considered as the optimum fluoride intake range via drinking water for preventing dental caries for all people excluding the age group lower than 6 months the adequate intake of fluoride for infants 0 6 months is 0 001 0 003 mg kg d based on the rme the plausible worst case scenario for adverse health effects the population proportions of elevated fluoride intake higher than 0 05 mg kg d via drinking water for children under 1 year old were 23 01 for 0 05 0 07 mg kg d 15 66 for 0 07 0 10 mg kg d and 13 09 for higher than 0 10 mg kg d that were much more than those of other age groups fig 3 shows the population distribution of the hq of fluoride intake through drinking water by age group and community type at the national level based on the hq values the percentage of population at risk of dental fluorosis decreased by age and was much lower in urban communities so that the highest proportions of population at the risk of dental fluorosis were observed in infants 0 6 months lived in rural communities to be 46 2 for moderate risk hq 1 to 2 and 19 7 for high risk hq higher than 2 it is worth to be noted that dental fluorosis is a permanent outcome and its occurrence in infants results in the most health losses the percentages of population at risk of dental fluorosis in the entire country were determined to be 47 6 for 0 6 months 27 3 for 7 12 months 2 4 for 1 3 y and 1 3 for 4 8 y the higher risks of fluoride exposure from drinking water for infants and younger children were also reported by chen et al 2017 guissouma et al 2017 martínez acuña et al 2016 and yousefi et al 2018 these results indicated that due to high drinking water consumption per kg of body weight in children under 1 year old even moderate drinking water fluoride levels of 0 5 1 0 mg l that are needed for preventing dental caries can also cause a risk of dental fluorosis therefore it is recommended that only in the communities with fluoride levels lower than 0 5 mg l children under 1 year old be fed by community drinking water supply and in the other circumstances drinking water for the age group be provided form other drinking water sources with low fluoride contents such as household water treatment systems bottled drinking water etc 3 3 national attributable burden of disease table 2 provides prevalence per 100 000 people dalys daly rate per 100 000 people and age standardized values of dalys and daly rate due to dental fluorosis attributable to elevated levels of fluoride in drinking water by sex and community type at the national level in 2017 the attributable prevalence dalys daly rate age standardized dalys and age standardized daly rate at the national level were estimated to be 60 uncertainty interval ui 95 48 to 69 3443 1034 6940 4 31 1 29 8 68 3699 1111 7457 and 4 63 1 39 9 33 respectively the national burden of disease attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels for females and males was very close to each other but significantly affected by community type p value 0 01 so that the attributable prevalence dalys and daly rate at the national level were respectively 153 122 177 2296 690 4628 and 11 05 3 32 22 27 in rural areas and 27 22 31 1154 346 2326 and 1 95 0 59 3 93 in urban ones due to the very low disability weight of dental fluorosis and small proportions of elevated drinking water fluoride levels the estimated burden of disease was relatively low as compared with those of other environmental risks and oral disorders at the national level according to global burden of disease collaborative network 2018 and gbd 2016 risk factors collaborators 2017 the national daly rate attributable to all environmental risks included in the gbd in 2016 was determined to be 1184 1020 1366 and the five environmental risks with the highest daly rates were respectively ambient particulate matter pollution 853 699 to 1016 lead exposure 257 159 to 376 unsafe water source in terms of microbial aspects 85 20 to 151 no access to handwashing facility 85 20 to 151 and unsafe sanitation 29 14 to 47 the national daly rate of all oral disorders was 222 132 345 and contribution of causes in the disease burden was in the following order edentulism and severe tooth loss for 36 periodontal diseases for 28 other oral disorders for 24 caries of permanent teeth for 11 and caries of deciduous teeth for 1 gbd 2016 dalys and hale collaborators 2017 global burden of disease collaborative network 2018 the estimated burden of disease attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels can be used for cost effectiveness analysis of drinking water defluoridation schemes as well as prioritizing public health action plans fluoride in drinking water along with many other environmental risks do not still meet the inclusion criteria of the gbd therefore this estimation and similar efforts on fluoride exposure via drinking water and other environmental risks are also of importance in terms of providing reliable frameworks for inclusion of much more environmental risks such as in future iterations of the gbd to achieve more accurate results of contribution of environmental risks in the total burden of disease abtahi et al 2018b amini et al 2014 hänninen et al 2014 prüss üstün et al 2003 prüss ustün et al 2011 2016 fig 4 shows the age distribution of national dalys and daly rate attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels by community type the age distribution of the attributable dalys was affected by population age structure and the values ranged from 83 25 167 for the age group 60 64 y to 457 137 921 for the age group 25 29 y in contrast the attributable daly rate exhibited the highest value for the age group 10 14 y 6 06 1 82 to 12 21 and then constantly fell by age to the age group higher than 65 y 2 49 0 75 to 5 03 because duration of the outcome decreased by age the lowest attributable daly rate accounted for the age group 5 9 y 2 46 0 74 to 4 95 because the age of onset for dental fluorosis was 8 years and in the age group only the people aged 8 9 years old were at risk of the outcome in addition to significant effects of age and community type on the edi hq and attributable burden of disease of fluoride in drinking water the interaction effect between age group and community type was also statistically significant p value 0 01 fig 5 displays the burden of disease associated with elevated drinking water fluoride contents by province and community type at the national level the spatial distribution of the national attributable dalys and daly rate by province in 2017 are illustrated in figs 6 and 7 as can be seen in figs 5 7 the attributable burden of disease only occurred in 10 out of 31 provinces and most of the health losses were concentrated in four provinces fars bushehr west azarbaijan and hormozgan about 94 of the national attributable dalys and the observed values in other provinces razavi khorasan kerman tehran yazd ghazvin and ardebil were negligible number of cases of dental fluorosis associated with elevated drinking water fluoride levels in fars bushehr west azarbaijan and hormozgan were estimated to be 27 268 21 822 to 31 448 5613 4471 6572 5480 4371 6373 and 5047 4023 5883 respectively the contribution of the four leading provinces in the national attributable dalys was as follows fars for 58 3 1967 592 to 3964 bushehr for 12 3 414 124 to 836 west azarbaijan for 11 9 400 120 to 808 and hormozgan for 11 2 377 113 to 761 ranking of provinces by the attributable daly rate were partly different from that by the attributable dalys the four highest attributable daly rates were observed in fars bushehr hormozgan and west azarbaijan to be 40 56 12 20 81 71 35 59 10 66 71 83 21 24 6 37 42 84 and 12 27 3 68 24 73 respectively the provincial attributable burden of disease was different by community type so that in four out of the ten provinces kerman tehran yazd and ardebil the burden of disease only occurred in rural communities and reversely in another one ghazvin urban communities accounted for all the health losses in addition to ghazvin bushehr and hormozgan also exhibited higher dalys and daly rates for urban communities but in the other seven provinces the values for rural communities were higher than those for urban ones although the national attributable burden of disease was relatively low the adverse health effects were mainly concentrated in limited provinces causing considerable provincial daly rates this ununiformed spatial distribution of the health losses is of advantage to provide improved drinking water for most of the affected people by implementation of a limited number of water treatment schemes there are two interventions for preventing the health outcomes of high levels of fluoride in drinking water to be changing water resources of drinking water supply and defluoridation of drinking water the conventional methods for defluoridation of drinking water are adsorption by activated alumina and bone char membrane processes and ion exchange many attempts for defluoridation of drinking water especially in developing countries have led to failure due to relatively high technical financial and organizational requirements accordingly the provision of fluoride safe drinking water from alternative sources should be put as the first priority for management of drinking water quality abtahi et al 2018c crittenden et al 2012 fawell et al 2006 mahvi et al 2018 mesdaghinia et al 2010 wang et al 2012 investigated the effectiveness of the interventions for fluoride safe water supply in china this study exhibited that both the interventions alternative low fluoride water sources and defluoridation of water successfully decreased drinking water fluoride levels to meet the government standard 1 2 mg l and resulted in a significant prevention of dental and skeletal fluorosis in the target areas in order to prevent the health losses in the communities with elevated drinking water fluoride level as soon as possible household water treatment systems can be considered as a temporary solution until the implementation of the community based interventions in addition to compensate the increasing trend of oral conditions at the national level implementation of fluoride safe drinking water supply schemes can decrease the health inequalities in oral conditions between socio economic classes due to being beneficial at the community level abtahi et al 2018a cho et al 2014 homaie rad et al 2016 in addition to dental and skeletal fluorosis a range of other health effects such as hypertension hypothyroidism a decrease in children s intelligence neurological problems etc are also suspected to be associated with chronic high level exposure to fluoride amini et al 2011 pearce 2015 sharma et al 2009 tang et al 2008 therefore the actual disease burden of elevated drinking water fluoride levels may be more than the estimated values it is recommended that the probable outcomes of fluoride be taken into consideration for setting priorities for control of environmental exposure to chemicals 4 conclusions the national burden of disease attributable to elevated drinking water fluoride levels was only resulted from dental fluorosis the attributable burden of disease was not significantly affected by sex but was considerably different by age community type and province the national attributable burden of disease was relatively low due to the very low disability weight of dental fluorosis and small proportions of elevated drinking water fluoride levels implementation of fluoride safe drinking water supply schemes especially in the four leading provinces fars bushehr west azarbaijan and hormozgan was needed to prevent the health losses and to move towards a healthier environment the introduced framework for assessing health losses of elevated fluoride levels in drinking water can be used in future studies at local national regional and global levels to extend knowledge about disease burden related to environmental exposure to chemicals as well as to prioritize environmental health measures declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

18848,marine phytoplankton accounts for roughly half the planetary primary production and plays significant roles in marine ecosystem functioning physical and biogeochemical processes and climate changes documenting phytoplankton assemblages dynamics particularly their community structure properties is thus a crucial and also challenging task a large number of in situ and space borne observation datasets are collected that cover the marginal seas in the west pacific including bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea here a customized region specific semi analytical model is developed in order to detect phytoplankton community structure properties using phytoplankton size classes pscs as its first order delegate and repeatedly tested to assure its reliable performance independent in situ validation datasets generate relatively low and acceptable predictive errors e g mean absolute percentage errors mape are 38 4 22 7 and 34 4 for micro nano and picophytoplankton estimations respectively satellite synchronization verification also produces comparative predictive errors by applying this model to long time series of satellite data we document the past two decadal namely from 1997 to 2017 variation on the pscs satellite derived records reveal a general spatial distribution rule namely microphytoplankton accounts for most variation in nearshore regions when nanophytoplankton dominates offshore water areas together with a certain high contribution from picophytoplankton long time series of data records indicate a roughly stable tendency during the period of the past twenty years while there exist periodical changes in a short term one year scale high covariation between marine environment factors and pscs are further found with results that underwater light field and sea surface temperature are the two dominant climate variables which exhibit a good ability to multivariate statistically model the pscs changes in these marginal seas specifically three types of influence induced by underwater light field and sea surface temperature can be generalized to cover different water conditions and regions and meanwhile a swift response time approximately 1 month of phytoplankton to the changing external environment conditions is found by the wavelet analysis this study concludes that phytoplankton community structures in the marginal seas remain stable and are year independent over the past two decades together with a short term in year cycle this change rule need to be considered in future oceanographic studies graphical

1996 behrenfeld et al 2001 field et al 1998 longhurst et al 1995 and significantly affects climate processes murtugudde et al 2002 beaugrand and reid 2003 and biogeochemical cycles such as the carbon nitrogen phosphorus and silicon cycles boyce et al 2010 marinov et al 2010 sabine et al 2004 sunda and huntsman 1997 roemmich and mcgowan 1995 meanwhile phytoplankton plays a critical role in changing marine ecosystem functioning legendre and fèvre 1991 demarcq et al 2012 masotti et al 2010 alvain et al 2013 sun et al 2018 and shows important effects on the biology in upper levels on account of its bottom location of the food chain chassot et al 2010 pauly and christensen 1995 documenting knowledge on phytoplankton dynamics in marine waters is thus necessary and of a great significance to the community as the two important properties of phytoplankton assemblages in marine waters their biomass and community structure should receive concerns for revealing phytoplankton dynamics phytoplankton biomass has been conventionally characterized by measures of total chlorophyll pigment concentration ryther and yentsch 1957 boyce et al 2010 henson et al 2010 dörnhöfer et al 2018 and also investigated widely in different spatiotemporal scales such as global and local scales boyce et al 2010 cannizzaro and carder 2006 boyd et al 2000 forsbergh and joseph 1963 and interannual and decadal scale variability espinosa carreon et al 2004 schubert et al 1998 this has generated a large quantity of phytoplankton biomass records which have served for enriching and improving our knowledge to phytoplankton abundance by contrast the large scale investigations on the community structure and diversity dynamics are still limited which is also elusive probably due to a lack of effective satellite retrieval methods when it captures first order variations in phytoplankton biomass the total chlorophyll concentration hardly accounts for much of variance in phytoplankton community structure instead phytoplankton size classes pscs as a further fine surrogate of phytoplankton assemblages refer to different sized phytoplankton chlorophyll pigments from various phytoplankton populations and their contributions to the total and thus to a large extent indicate phytoplankton diversity in marine waters vidussi et al 2001 uitz et al 2006 devred et al 2011 brewin et al 2015 sun et al 2018 fortunately it has been demonstrated that the pscs can be detected by satellite remote sensing methods for instance the existing so called two types of approaches i e abundance and spectra based approaches ioccg 2014 the abundance based approaches can be established based on an assumption that is there exists significant relationships between total chlorophyll a and size fractioned contributions by the pscs uitz et al 2006 brewin et al 2010 2015 hirata et al 2011 the spectra based approaches can be developed which are essentially dependent on the differences in the optical signatures of specific phytoplankton groups ciotti et al 2002 hirata et al 2008 kostadinov et al 2009 roy et al 2013 mainly based on the absorption and backscattering characteristics of water bodies the spectra based approaches are easily affected by noises garver et al 1994 and are apt to the failure for retrieving different pscs with weak differences on the optical signatures especially in the turbid coastal waters also those methods cannot detect different phytoplankton groups that show similar spectral signs as for the turbid coastal waters the abundance based approaches here may have a good underlying relationship between size structure and phytoplankton abundance based on in situ measurements and are easier to reveal the expected size structure of the phytoplankton at a given pixel brewin et al 2010 2015 although many efforts have been done to develop remote sensing algorithms for pscs estimation there still exists very limited knowledge on pscs dynamics in marine waters particularly the long term changes to our knowledge the reports on the long term changes of pscs in marine waters are scarce other than several limited publications for instance varunan and shanmugam 2015 produced the global modis aqua composite images of pscs for two seasons winter and summer of the year 2002 2013 and showed a large scale global pattern for pscs distribution and seasonality as for a given site namely mvco station near antarctica zhang et al 2015 showed a long time series from 2004 to 2014 of size fractions for micro nano and picophytoplankton indicating that microphytoplankton dominates the phytoplankton community all year though nano and picophytoplankton do increase during the less eutrophic periods of the year additionally note that class specific primary production of phytoplankton had been investigated with multi annual climatological maps for local water regions uitz et al 2012 mayot et al 2017 so long term records about pscs spatiotemporal variations should be documented in order to further understand phytoplankton diversity dynamics and environment responses in marine waters as the study areas in the current study some seas of china including bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea are typically northwest marginal seas of pacific ocean these seas intensely interact with the surrounding lands and are strongly affected by sediment loads and nutrients discharged from large rivers e g the yangtze river and yellow river also industrial and agricultural pollution as well as domestic sewage jointly lead to highly productive conditions of water bodies these seas are thus typical and complex coastal waters morel and prieur 1977 the aims of this study focuses on 1 to build up a robust remote sensing model for pscs estimation based on the two component assumption brewin et al 2010 2015 which should be applied into satellite data 2 to explore a long term of pscs spatiotemporal dynamics in the marginal regions 3 to reveal potential influences of environment conditions to pscs dynamics in the study region 2 methodology 2 1 in situ data collection this study has collected adequate in situ observed datasets from five cruise surveys in sea areas of china including bohai sea bs yellow sea ys and east china sea ecs fig 1 these cruise surveys covered different seasons which were carried out in may jun sep and dec 2016 and may 2017 respectively the in situ data parameters used in this study included the hplc measured total chlorophyll a c diagnostic pigment and phytoplankton absorption a ph as well as in situ observed remote sensing reflectance r rs surface water samples at each station had been collected by using niskin bottles which were used for hplc pigment extraction and phytoplankton absorption measurement meanwhile the r rs data was collected with the hyper profiler ii satlantic inc halifax ns canada see below for details the concentrations of total chlorophyll a and diagnostic pigments were measured by means of the quantitative filter technique qft and reversed phase hplc with a zorbax eclipse xdb c8 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 3 5 μm agilent technologies according to van heukelem and thomas 2001 method it was calibrated by commercial pigment standards sigma aldrich st louis and dhi hørsholm denmark seven typical diagnostic pigments including fucoxanthin peridinin 19 hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin 19 butanoyloxyfucoxanthin alloxanthin total chlorophyll b and zeaxanthin were measured and subsequently used for diagnostic pigment analysis as well as the total chlorophyll a the measured pigment data were quality controlled according to the data statistical rules see that in aiken et al 2009 study more detailed description about hplc pigment data measurement refers to sun et al 2017 study these observed hplc pigment data would be used to derive the pscs the in situ measurements about a ph and r rs data all abided by the corresponding protocols accepted by the community babin et al 2003 bricaud and stramski 1990 lee et al 1999 mueller and fargion 2002 stramska et al 2003 the a ph measurements were performed by using the quantitative filter technique qft mitchell 1990 more details could be seen in wang et al 2014 study the r rs λ measurements were carried out by using hyper profiler ii satlantic inc halifax ns canada instrument with an averaged bandwidth of 3 3 nm in a spectral range of 349 4 804 0 nm this instrument system has three calibrated radiometers namely a deck sensor that observes the above water surface downwelling irradiance ed λ 0 and two underwater sensors that measure vertical profiles of downwelling irradiance signals ed λ z and upwelling radiance signals lu λ z when beginning observations the meter was deployed in waters away from the vessel to avoid ship perturbation and shadow and also without whitecaps disturbance the collected radiometric data were quality controlled through removing those with the tilt angles 5 or downward velocity 0 5 m s 1 and then processed by a series of steps including calibration data filtering and interpolation finally r rs λ could be obtained from the following equation 1 r r s λ l w λ e d λ 0 where lw λ is the water leaving radiance which is determined from the profile of lu λ z unit w m 2 nm 1 sr 1 at the upper layer as described by rudorff et al 2014 a total of valid 246 groups of water sample derived data and 75 groups of r rs data were finally obtained in our investigated water regions 2 2 satellite data a two decade monthly satellite image dataset including seawifs r rs λ product from sep 1997 to jun 2002 and modis aqua r rs λ product from jul 2002 to sep 2017 was downloaded from nasa goddard space flight center http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov accessed in august 2015 reprocessing 2014 0 a total of 241 monthly image data spectral r rs λ with a spatial resolution of 9 km were collected in this study these images were cropped to the investigated regions in bs ys and ecs and then processed to target products by using the new developed pscs algorithm in this study see details in section 3 for showing a long time series of variations on phytoplankton size classes in the study area meanwhile daily modis aqua data spatial resolution 4 km matching with in situ data collection within a narrow time window of 1 h were also obtained from the nasa goddard space flight center and their date coverages were from 29 may to 2 jun from 28 jun to 16 july and from 22 sep to 28 oct during 2016 year see table 1 these daily modis aqua data were applied for satellite validation of the pscs algorithm spectral r rs λ data were processed using the most updated calibration and atmospheric correction algorithms namely the nir swir procedure gordon and wang 1994 jiang and wang 2014 wang et al 2017 wang and shi 2007 with the quality controlled flags such as stray light cloud coverage atmospheric correction warning etc the current study used a homogeneity test in order to avert those pixels from patchy waters and their coefficient of variation cv values 3 3 pixel window must be less than 0 4 furthermore this study used the median value from the 3 3 pixel box centered at the in situ station to avoid those potential sensor and algorithm noises hu et al 2001 the above strict constraints were utilized to determine those data matching the in situ observations 2 3 environment condition variables five environment condition variables were focused in this study which may straightly change pscs dynamics in the upper ocean namely sea surface temperature sst underwater light field using underwater diffuse attenuation coefficient k d as delegate in this study salinity wind velocity and sea surface height relative to geoid sshg sst and k d data products were available in nasa goddard space flight center matching with r rs λ monthly satellite data for retrieving a long time series of pscs variation in the study area see the first part of section 2 2 in spatial and temporal scales sshg and salinity data products during the recent twenty years i e from sep 1997 to sep 2017 were obtained from ncep global ocean data assimilation system godas https www esrl noaa gov with a spatial resolution of 0 333 1 0 latitude longitude grid sea surface wind data products 2 5 2 5 grid for the period from sep 1997 to sep 2017 could be available from ccmp version 2 0 analyses produced by remote sensing systems at the website of http www remss com measurements ccmp 2 4 performance metrics diagnostic pigment analysis model establishment and satellite data application were all carried out by the matlab software mathworks inc natick ma usa to evaluate the performance of the developed models several indicators were used in the current study including

values respectively n refers to the sample number 3 phytoplankton size class model 3 1 diagnostic pigment analysis diagnostic pigment analysis dpa is an important basis for quantifying different size specific phytoplankton biomass by using hplc diagnostic pigments vidussi et al 2001 uitz et al 2006 brewin et al 2011 2015 hirata et al 2011 the previous study utilized limited five diagnostic pigments that were collected in only one cruise sun et al 2017 as an update more cruises have been carried out with more effective diagnostic pigments available in this study seven typical pigments namely fucoxanthin fuco peridinin per 19 hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin 19 hex 19 butanoy loxyfucoxanthin 19 but alloxanthin allo chlorophyll b and divinyl chlorophyll b chlb and zeaxanthin zea have been demonstrated to perform well in characterizing phytoplankton assemblages vidussi et al 2001 uitz et al 2006 brewin et al 2011a 2015 hirata et al 2011 and were also shown in fig 2 p i denotes the i th diagnostic pigment in mg m 3 and w i is the weight the values for the parameter w i 2 05 1 01 1 31 4 27 3 28 0 94 and 0 75 for fuco peri 19 hex 19 but allo chlb and zea respectively where the i values denote 1 7 following this pigment sequence were available to us by carrying out a multiple linear regression between c and p i with the in situ measured hplc samples n 215 during four cruises in the marginal seas in may jun sep and dec 2016 fig 3 a the dpa derived total chlorophyll a concentrations c w showed very good agreement with in situ measured c r 2 0 961 mape 17 33 we had actually tried other published weights uitz et al 2006 2008 brewin et al 2014 2015 sun et al 2017 but with their performances not shown here inferior to the performance by the new group of weights for our study area by means of the customized diagnostic pigment analysis suitable for the study area this study can derive the micro nano and picophytoplankton proportions namely f m f n and f p which is according to vidussi et al 2001 and uitz et al 2006 methods then refined by brewin et al 2010 2015 and devred et al 2011 the fractions of chlorophyll a in each size class can be calculated as the product of c with f m f n and f p as shown in fig 2 the subscripts for c refer to micro nano and picophytoplankton respectively assuming that the sum of size specific chlorophyll a concentrations is equal to the measured total chlorophyll a concentration 3 2 model development a two component model of concept used and refined in this study is fundamentally based on an assumption that the large sized phytoplankton dominates water bodies with high chlorophyll a concentration while low chlorophyll a waters are mainly controlled by the small sized phytoplankton sathyendranath et al 2001 brewin et al 2010 devred et al 2006 2011 the total chlorophyll a concentration can be made up of two different portions where the first portion corresponds to large sized cells referring to microphytoplankton in this study and the other portion is the sum of medium and small cells i e nano and picophytoplankton also the chlorophyll a from the combination of nano and picophytoplankton could be assumed not grow beyond a certain value with the increasing total chlorophyll a concentration by using the in situ observed data this assumption could be satisfied well in the current study see fig 3b corresponding author to this assumption the c n p can be expressed as a function of the total chlorophyll a concentration c 6 c n p c n p m 1 exp s n p c where c n p m denotes a maximum that c n p asymptotically reaches with increasing c and the slope s n p can define a rate at which c n p raises with the increase in c given that absorption coefficients of water bodies are additive the phytoplankton absorption coefficient a ph λ can be thus expressed by the combination of large and small sized phytoplankton as below 7 a p h λ a m λ c m a n p λ c n p where a m λ and a n p λ are the specific absorption coefficients of microphytoplankton and the combination of nano and picophytoplankton respectively combining with eq 6 the above equation can be transformed as below devred et al 2006 8 a p h λ c n p m a n p λ a m λ 1 exp s n p c a m λ c it is assumed that c n p m s n p 1 when c approaches toward zero devred et al 2006 by applying this equation to the collected in situ dataset with a ph λ and c we could yield the parameterization for the parameters a m λ a n p λ and s n p with a value of 0 591 through the least square method for the investigated marginal seas of this study fig 3c shows the estimated spectra of specific absorption coefficients of microphytoplankton and the combination of nano and picophytoplankton in this study the a n p λ is significantly higher than a m λ that is comparable with devred et al 2011 study also following the assumption using the obtained parameters in eq 6 we accordingly can produce c n p and then c m it is comforting that relatively high and acceptable predictive accuracy could be obtained for the estimated c m by the in situ dataset in this study fig 3d to further quantify c n and c p from the derived c n p the two component concept was also attempted again and yet found to dissatisfy the basic assumption well by using our dataset as shown in fig 3e the nano and picophytoplankton jointly contribute the chlorophyll a concentration at whether high or low concentration parts of c n p probably indicative of local characteristics in the study region here we instead made use of a very close empirical relationship between c p and c n p as below 9 c p 0 37 c n p 1 06 r 2 0 851 p 0 001 n 205 note that this empirical model functions well mainly in a chlorophyll a range of 5 mg m 3 but may need more validation for high concentrations after that c n could be obtained by subtracting c p from c n p fig 3f g showed comparisons between the estimated and measured c n and c p respectively with acceptable predictive accuracies 3 3 accurate chla as model input the total chlorophyll a concentration is a single input of the phytoplankton size class model and needs to be estimated accurately some studies have demonstrated that the existing chlorophyll a products by conventional operational algorithms are not very accurate in those turbid coastal waters compared with in situ measurement such as the investigated water region of this study he et al 2013 sun et al 2017 note that the potential errors might be induced by atmospheric correction in the wide coastal water areas but not in the open ocean which is generally more challenging for our study water areas like that in sun et al 2017 this study still depends on the band ratio r rs 488 r rs 555 to retrieve chlorophyll a which is also found to perform best than other methods see table 2 based on 62 samples with r rs λ and c data collected from four cruises 41 samples was selected randomly to customize the regional chlorophyll a model see eq 10 fig 4 a with the rest samples used for model validation 10 c 0 965 exp 5 931 log 10 r r s 488 r r s 555 as shown in fig 4b the estimated and measured c show a good agreement between each other indicating relatively low predictive errors produced by the region specific chlorophyll a model 3 4 model validation in order to evaluate the performance of the developed psc model three different ways were comprehensively utilized in this study the first is to use an independent in situ dataset to test the established dpa and subsequent psc model in this study which had been collected in may 2017 cruise for this study area this dataset has 41 hplc samples among which 13 samples are simultaneously matching with in situ r rs data fig 5 shows a comparison about the dpa results which are derived by this study and other typical references indeed the current study shows a good performance with the generally lowest predictive errors such as mape 18 61 rmse 0 116 mg m 3 which implies the accuracy of dpa for the study area rather than using other existing diagnostic pigment weights the comparisons between in situ measured and estimated cm cn and cp by using the developed model of this study are shown in fig 6 the derived predictive errors such as mape 38 40 22 66 and 34 41 for cm cn and cp respectively are generally low and acceptable to a large degree meanwhile note that the predictive results derived by the previous model in sun et al 2017 study are also shown here with larger errors than that in this study as an update the currently established model in this study actually shows the following advantages 1 more in situ data collection from five cruises in different seasons used for the model s calibration and refinement 2 more effective diagnostic pigments available to us i e using seven categories for obtaining more accurate dpa rather than five as before 3 a certain physical basis is considered in the model development instead of more empirical relationships on the other hand the current study carries out satellite synchronization verification after matching the satellite derived r rs data with in situ measurements by a set of strict constraints see methodology section a limited dataset with 5 synchronous samples were obtained and then used for comparisons between measured and satellite derived pscs as shown in fig 7 a general good agreement could be seen between measured and satellite derived pscs with mape values of 22 9 11 4 and 35 0 for f m f n and f p respectively this indicates that the application of the psc model has a potential ability to produce relatively accurate and acceptable pscs results lastly the current study compared the spatial distributions of pscs produced by in situ measurement and satellite derivation note that the use of satellite data is from the specific monthly coverages concurrent with the two cruises as samples they are may 2016 cruise in zhejiang coastal waters and sep 2016 cruise in east china sea fig 8 showed the spatial distributions of pscs derived by three ways including in situ observations satellite derived results by nasa chla products and satellite derived results by region specific chla model in comparison with in situ observations we found that the pscs obtained by nasa chla products would show relatively large deviations with higher values for micro and nanophytoplankton and lower values for picophytoplankton especially in the nearshore waters this is mainly due to inaccurate chla input to our psc model fortunately the pscs derived by region specific chla model showed a spatial distribution that is close to the in situ observations although there did not exist absolutely real time synchronization between the in situ measured and satellite derived monthly pscs the cruise sampling covered a period of near one month and could roughly provide an accurate reference the generally similar spatial distribution between the in situ observation and our psc model with the regional chla correction implies the accuracy of our developed psc model our developed psc model is consisted of two main processes 1 retrieving cm from the total chlorophyll a concentration by means of the two component assumption and our proposed region specific parameters in eq 6 2 separating the cn and cp from cn p by using the more efficient method that has been proposed in this study and tested to perform better not shown here for simplicity than that of brewin et al 2010 2015 method that uses the two component assumption twice brewin et al 2010 2015 method relies on the assumption that the concentrations of different phytoplankton size structure change with the total chlorophyll a concentration which is used twice in the whole model process so if the assumption cannot function well for any given time this method would fail in the pscs retrievals although the two component assumption is also used to extract the cm in our model like that in brewin et al 2010 2015 studies the existing obvious difference lies in that our model utilizes the new method to separate the cn and cp from the cn p as well as proposing the region specific key parameters see fig 3c these novelties in our developed psc model lay the foundation for its good performance in the satellite application 3 5 model uncertainty analysis in order to test the uncertainty of our developed psc model to the r rs inputs we utilized some in situ collected samples with the measured r rs data n 35 from all cruises for delegates the two band r rs data namely r rs 488 and r rs 555 are the inputs of our model so random normal distribution errors their average value is 0 and standard deviation is 0 05 were proportionally added into r rs 488 and r rs 555 values namely r rs λ 1 error and then these new r rs values were used into our psc model to derive the new retrievals we could calculate corresponding errors such as mape and rmse between these new retrievals and the previous retrievals i e those estimations before adding random errors for the 35 representative samples these derived errors thus indicated the uncertainty of our psc model this process was repeated 50 times so that those random errors were representative following a normal distribution as shown in fig 9 the microphytoplankton retrievals showed a greater sensitivity than that of the nano and picophytoplankton on whether r rs 488 or r rs 555 the averaged mape at r rs 488 were 19 2 8 0 and 8 7 for micro nano and picophytoplankton respectively when calculated to be 20 1 8 1 and 8 9 at r rs 555 corresponding standard deviations were roughly below 2 for the microphytoplankton and less than 1 for both nano and picophytoplankton those relatively low errors indicated the stability and robustness of our model derived pscs calculations 4 two decade documentation of phytoplankton size class variation this study documented a recent two decade 1997 2017 variation in phytoplankton size classes in our study area the monthly r rs data from seawifs sep 1997 jun 2002 and modis jul 2002 sep 2017 were utilized to input our developed model to generate the time series of psc distribution fig 10 showed the general distribution patterns during this two decade period on the whole microphytoplankton contributed the most to phytoplankton assemblages in bs with ratios of 0 4 0 6 for most areas while nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton roughly showed contribution ratios of 0 3 and 0 2 respectively similar distributions also appeared in nearshore regions of ys and ecs yet in offshore regions of ys and ecs nanophytoplankton played the most important role in changing phytoplankton assemblages and explained an approximate half of the proportion meanwhile picophytoplankton also showed an important contribution especially for the central region of ys and offshore regions of ecs about 0 4 when noting that microphytoplankton would show the lowest proportion 0 2 fig 11 further showed the monthly psc variations for the study water areas during a whole year microphytoplankton dominated phytoplankton assemblages in bs and nearshore regions its high value spatial coverage approximately 0 4 would show a generally increasing trend during the first five months in each year when noting that the maximal coverage including many areas of ys and certain areas of ecs appeared in apr from jun to sep microphytoplankton showed a stable spatial distribution with low contribution in offshore waters a weak increase in high value coverage would happen in the last three months of a year nanophytoplankton dominated the offshore water areas about 0 5 during nearly all months of a whole year such as the central area of ys and offshore areas of ecs when picophytoplankton was the second contributor 0 3 0 4 for most areas meanwhile note that the monthly variations of nano and picophytoplankton would show a generally opposite trend with that of microphytoplankton five representative stations s1s5 throughout the whole study area were selected to exhibit the long time series of variations in pscs fig 12 although there existed a certain degree of fluctuations in the short run three pscs regardless of stations all showed generally stable temporal trends along with approximate central lines from a long term perspective meanwhile a mathematical mann kendall test to the long time series of the pscs had been done with results of no mutation for the pscs dynamics the above findings reveal a fact that the structure of phytoplankton size classes in our study area was generally steady at least in recent twenty years 5 discussion how are pscs dynamics influenced by environment conditions 5 1 mathematical correlations with environmental factors pscs dynamics could be linked to many environment conditions such as ocean circulation river discharge eutrophication aerosol deposition stratification upwelling and wind broecker and peng 1999 ware and thomson 2005 paytan et al 2009 behrenfeld et al 2006 martinez et al 2009 dickson et al 1988 and even some extreme climate events such as hurricanes and severe rainfall etc for parsimony this study focuses on five variables that may straightly change pscs dynamics in the upper ocean including sst k d salinity wind velocity and sshg these physical variables monthly averages were matched by time year month and location five typical stations each cell with a spatial range of 27 27 km2 with satellite derived pscs data to estimate the effects on the pscs changes within a uniform framework pearson correlation analysis was first carried out to show degrees that these variables were statistically related to the pscs k d was an important factor of controlling the pscs changes with relatively high correlation coefficients r fig 13 interestingly note that k d showed close positive relationships r 0 75 p 0 001 with microphytoplankton at these stations while negative relationships appeared with nano and picophytoplankton absolute r 0 70 p 0 001 this indicates that turbid water conditions with limited light intensity may stimulate the growth of microphytoplankton to some extent possibly due to large superficial areas of these large sized algal particles that possess stronger light availability than small suspended particulates riegman and noordeloos 1998 domingues et al 2011 yet the small sized nano and picophytoplankton growth would be suppressed by the turbidity of water bodies indeed k d will control the phytoplankton assemblages in water columns however the phytoplankton cells will probably influence the underwater light field especially in the phytoplankton dominance conditions they complement each other thus strictly speaking it should be the incident radiation rather than k d that regulate photosynthesis and physiology of phytoplankton in waters sst as the other important influencing factor showed significant correlations with the pscs in most cases sst had negative close relationships with microphytoplankton absolute r in the range of 0 43 0 66 with p 0 001 at s2 s3 and s5 stations when weak negative correlation appeared at s1 station and positive correlation at s4 station fig 13 opposite relationships happened in nano and picophytoplankton discussed in the following section as far as salinity and sshg were concerned there also existed certain correlations with the pscs at individual stations such as s3 though no sufficient valid salinity and sshg data were available in bs and nys wind velocity generally showed low correlations with the pscs fig 13 probably indicative of its weak effect on the pscs dynamics 5 2 quantitative contributions of environmental factors and potential influence in order to further quantify contributions from different environmental factors to the pscs changes this study implemented a multiple linear stepwise regression analysis based on the standardized data i e variable mean standard deviation contribution coefficients for the environmental factors at five representative stations were all shown in table 3 with very high significance level p 0 0001 for each relationship as for microphytoplankton these environmental factors could account for most of its variability with relatively high explanation ratios r 2 of 66 7 84 1 meanwhile note that nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton could be also explained well and most variability of them r 2 62 5 83 6 for nano 56 0 84 5 for pico could be modeled by the environmental factors furthermore we found that k d and sst contributed most among these environmental factors with large contribution coefficients table 3 whereas salinity sshg and wind velocity generally showed very weak effects almost without valid contribution weights except individual cases it is also worthy to note that k d possesses the largest contribution weights which indicates light field plays a more dominant role in controlling the pscs changes for the study water areas three types of properties on influence of environmental factors on the pscs could be approximately generalized as 1 type 1 k d positive and sst negative effects on microphytoplankton and meanwhile k d negative and sst positive impacts on nano and picophytoplankton corresponding to s1 s2 and s3 stations table 3 in this study 2 type 2 positive effects from both k d and sst on microphytoplankton and simultaneously negative impacts on nano and picophytoplankton see s4 station 3 type 3 k d positive impact on microphytoplankton and negative to nano and pico phytoplankton and sst negative effects on micro and picophytoplankton and positive to nanophytoplankton like s5 station as for type 1 the corresponding representative stations s1 s2 and s3 in fig 12 all distributed at the offshore central regions of the seas with larger depths than other regions where terrestrial influence such as runoff discharge would be weak to a certain degree so the phytoplankton growth was mainly affected by the own conditions of water columns huang et al 1999 large k d implies weak water stratification and a certain strong vertical mixing of water columns which accordingly increases nutrients in the surface layer of water columns eutrophic water conditions with high nutrients are prone to facilitate the growth of microphytoplankton when oligotrophic water bodies are more suitable for nano and picophytoplankton propagation chisholm 1992 platt et al 2005 aiken et al 2009 opposite to k d increasing sst tends to generate a shallower mixed layer and more apparent water stratification boyce et al 2010 which further limits nutrient supply to the surface water layer and then constrains the increase of microphytoplankton compared with microphytoplankton k d and sst show opposite impacts on nano and picophytoplankton because increasing sst and decreasing k d easily lead to low nutrient input to the surface water layer in this status of low nutrient content nutrient absorption efficiency from nano and pico phytoplankton is higher than microphytoplankton nair et al 2008 which finally promotes their growth a distinct feature for type 2 is the presence of relatively strong terrigenous input effect that leads to high nutrient water conditions for instance the water region like s4 station fig 12 is located near to yangtze estuary water stratification may not exist very obviously and also k d value is usually high due to vertical mixing and a large quantity of suspended particulate discharge shen et al 2010 2013 high nutrient sources come from surface runoff vertical transport and also potentially seaweed farming in subei shoal shi et al 2015 li et al 2017a high nutrient water conditions along with increasing sst and k d provide a chance of rapid growth for microphytoplankton while growth rates of nano and picophytoplankton would be lower than microphytoplankton so the proportions of nano and picophytoplankton in the total phytoplankton biomass would be conversely affected along with the increase of sst and k d the water regions of type 3 see s5 station in fig 12 show similar natural conditions with type 1 such as large water depths and weak terrestrial influence due to far away from the land most influences from both sst and k d on the pscs are similar to that of type 1 but note that a difference is the negative effect of sst on picophytoplankton for type 3 this is probably owing to the impact of kuroshio current which is typically characterized by high temperature and high salinity water mass jiao et al 2005 yang et al 2011 lee et al 2014 li et al 2017b it has been demonstrated that picophytoplankton such as picoeukaryotes and synechococcus may be restrained by high salinity water condition in summer and also has been found to closely correlate with the total phytoplankton biomass in winter with relatively low temperature guo et al 2014 this supports the findings of our study that the picophytoplankton percentage increases under relatively low temperature environment in the water regions of type 3 5 3 periodic response of pscs to environmental factors fig 14 shows the time series of the pscs and environmental factors mainly k d and sst due to their dominant effects which have been processed by the wavelet analysis method to remove potential noise and high frequency information these shown curves indicate the general characteristics on temporal variations for pscs and environmental factors only micro and nanophytoplankton were shown here as delegates since pico phytoplankton would show similar trends with nanophytoplankton in general these quantities including micro and nanophytoplankton k d and sst have similar time cycles for their temporal variations fig 14 more specifically approximate one year interval is a change cycle for them also very short response time of phytoplankton to k d and sst less than one month is found in this study as revealed in mutshinda et al 2013 and macintyre et al 2000 studies the findings in the current study suggest a potentially rapid response of phytoplankton when the external environment conditions change 6 conclusions our study represents a first effort to document the past two decadal i e from 1997 to 2017 variations on phytoplankton assemblage structure using phytoplankton size classes as its first order delegate in the marginal seas of china based on a newly developed region specific semi analytical model satellite derived spatial patterns reveal a general rule i e microphytoplankton dominates nearshore regions while nanophytoplankton accounts for the most variation in offshore regions as well as a certain high contribution from picophytoplankton from a temporal perspective our records demonstrate a generally stable variation trend in phytoplankton assemblage structures during the past two decades while periodical changes happen in a short term scale approximately within a year spatiotemporally synchronous environment variables are matched to infer their influences on the pscs dynamics underwater light field and sea surface temperature are indicated as the two dominant environment factors and meanwhile can model the pscs changes very well in the study marginal seas also together with a fine generalization i e three types of influence by them another interesting finding is a swift response 1 month of phytoplankton to the changing external environment conditions also consistent with those marine biology studies such consequences in the current study provide incentive for an enhanced basic knowledge on understanding phytoplankton population evolution and environment responses given that the pscs variations are potentially affected by climate conditions such as some extreme climate events e g hurricanes severe rainfall etc that is not covered in the current study future research should focus on them for revealing climate change from marine phytoplankton status declaration of interests the

18848,marine phytoplankton accounts for roughly half the planetary primary production and plays significant roles in marine ecosystem functioning physical and biogeochemical processes and climate changes documenting phytoplankton assemblages dynamics particularly their community structure properties is thus a crucial and also challenging task a large number of in situ and space borne observation datasets are collected that cover the marginal seas in the west pacific including bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea here a customized region specific semi analytical model is developed in order to detect phytoplankton community structure properties using phytoplankton size classes pscs as its first order delegate and repeatedly tested to assure its reliable performance independent in situ validation datasets generate relatively low and acceptable predictive errors e g mean absolute percentage errors mape are 38 4 22 7 and 34 4 for micro nano and picophytoplankton estimations respectively satellite synchronization verification also produces comparative predictive errors by applying this model to long time series of satellite data we document the past two decadal namely from 1997 to 2017 variation on the pscs satellite derived records reveal a general spatial distribution rule namely microphytoplankton accounts for most variation in nearshore regions when nanophytoplankton dominates offshore water areas together with a certain high contribution from picophytoplankton long time series of data records indicate a roughly stable tendency during the period of the past twenty years while there exist periodical changes in a short term one year scale high covariation between marine environment factors and pscs are further found with results that underwater light field and sea surface temperature are the two dominant climate variables which exhibit a good ability to multivariate statistically model the pscs changes in these marginal seas specifically three types of influence induced by underwater light field and sea surface temperature can be generalized to cover different water conditions and regions and meanwhile a swift response time approximately 1 month of phytoplankton to the changing external environment conditions is found by the wavelet analysis this study concludes that phytoplankton community structures in the marginal seas remain stable and are year independent over the past two decades together with a short term in year cycle this change rule need to be considered in future oceanographic studies graphical

bottom location of the food chain chassot et al 2010 pauly and christensen 1995 documenting knowledge on phytoplankton dynamics in marine waters is thus necessary and of a great significance to the community as the two important properties of phytoplankton assemblages in marine waters their biomass and community structure should receive concerns for revealing phytoplankton dynamics phytoplankton biomass has been conventionally characterized by measures of total chlorophyll pigment concentration ryther and yentsch 1957 boyce et al 2010 henson et al 2010 dörnhöfer et al 2018 and also investigated widely in different spatiotemporal scales such as global and local scales boyce et al 2010 cannizzaro and carder 2006 boyd et al 2000 forsbergh and joseph 1963 and interannual and decadal scale variability espinosa carreon et al 2004 schubert et al 1998 this has generated a large quantity of phytoplankton biomass records which have served for enriching and improving our knowledge to phytoplankton abundance by contrast the large scale investigations on the community structure and diversity dynamics are still limited which is also elusive probably due to a lack of effective satellite retrieval methods when it captures first order variations in phytoplankton biomass the total chlorophyll concentration hardly accounts for much of variance in phytoplankton community structure instead phytoplankton size classes pscs as a further fine surrogate of phytoplankton assemblages refer to different sized phytoplankton chlorophyll pigments from various phytoplankton populations and their contributions to the total and thus to a large extent indicate phytoplankton diversity in marine waters vidussi et al 2001 uitz et al 2006 devred et al 2011 brewin et al 2015 sun et al 2018 fortunately it has been demonstrated that the pscs can be detected by satellite remote sensing methods for instance the existing so called two types of approaches i e abundance and spectra based approaches ioccg 2014 the abundance based approaches can be established based on an assumption that is there exists significant relationships between total chlorophyll a and size fractioned contributions by the pscs uitz et al 2006 brewin et al 2010 2015 hirata et al 2011 the spectra based approaches can be developed which are essentially dependent on the differences in the optical signatures of specific phytoplankton groups ciotti et al 2002 hirata et al 2008 kostadinov et al 2009 roy et al 2013 mainly based on the absorption and backscattering characteristics of water bodies the spectra based approaches are easily affected by noises garver et al 1994 and are apt to the failure for retrieving different pscs with weak differences on the optical signatures especially in the turbid coastal waters also those methods cannot detect different phytoplankton groups that show similar spectral signs as for the turbid coastal waters the abundance based approaches here may have a good underlying relationship between size structure and phytoplankton abundance based on in situ measurements and are easier to reveal the expected size structure of the phytoplankton at a given pixel brewin et al 2010 2015 although many efforts have been done to develop remote sensing algorithms for pscs estimation there still exists very limited knowledge on pscs dynamics in marine waters particularly the long term changes to our knowledge the reports on the long term changes of pscs in marine waters are scarce other than several limited publications for instance varunan and shanmugam 2015 produced the global modis aqua composite images of pscs for two seasons winter and summer of the year 2002 2013 and showed a large scale global pattern for pscs distribution and seasonality as for a given site namely mvco station near antarctica zhang et al 2015 showed a long time series from 2004 to 2014 of size fractions for micro nano and picophytoplankton indicating that microphytoplankton dominates the phytoplankton community all year though nano and picophytoplankton do increase during the less eutrophic periods of the year additionally note that class specific primary production of phytoplankton had been investigated with multi annual climatological maps for local water regions uitz et al 2012 mayot et al 2017 so long term records about pscs spatiotemporal variations should be documented in order to further understand phytoplankton diversity dynamics and environment responses in marine waters as the study areas in the current study some seas of china including bohai sea yellow sea and east china sea are typically northwest marginal seas of pacific ocean these seas intensely interact with the surrounding lands and are strongly affected by sediment loads and nutrients discharged from large rivers e g the yangtze river and yellow river also industrial and agricultural pollution as well as domestic sewage jointly lead to highly productive conditions of water bodies these seas are thus typical and complex coastal waters morel and prieur 1977 the aims of this study focuses on 1 to build up a robust remote sensing model for pscs estimation based on the two component assumption brewin et al 2010 2015 which should be applied into satellite data 2 to explore a long term of pscs spatiotemporal dynamics in the marginal regions 3 to reveal potential influences of environment conditions to pscs dynamics in the study region 2 methodology 2 1 in situ data collection this study has collected adequate in situ observed datasets from five cruise surveys in sea areas of china including bohai sea bs yellow sea ys and east china sea ecs fig 1 these cruise surveys covered different seasons which were carried out in may jun sep and dec 2016 and may 2017 respectively the in situ data parameters used in this study included the hplc measured total chlorophyll a c diagnostic pigment and phytoplankton absorption a ph as well as in situ observed remote sensing reflectance r rs surface water samples at each station had been collected by using niskin bottles which were used for hplc pigment extraction and phytoplankton absorption measurement meanwhile the r rs data was collected with the hyper profiler ii satlantic inc halifax ns canada see below for details the concentrations of total chlorophyll a and diagnostic pigments were measured by means of the quantitative filter technique qft and reversed phase hplc with a zorbax eclipse xdb c8 column 150 mm 4 6 mm 3 5 μm agilent technologies according to van heukelem and thomas 2001 method it was calibrated by commercial pigment standards sigma aldrich st louis and dhi hørsholm denmark seven typical diagnostic pigments including fucoxanthin peridinin 19 hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin 19 butanoyloxyfucoxanthin alloxanthin total chlorophyll b and zeaxanthin were measured and subsequently used for diagnostic pigment analysis as well as the total chlorophyll a the measured pigment data were quality controlled according to the data statistical rules see that in aiken et al 2009 study more detailed description about hplc pigment data measurement refers to sun et al 2017 study these observed hplc pigment data would be used to derive the pscs the in situ measurements about a ph and r rs data all abided by the corresponding protocols accepted by the community babin et al 2003 bricaud and stramski 1990 lee et al 1999 mueller and fargion 2002 stramska et al 2003 the a ph measurements were performed by using the quantitative filter technique qft mitchell 1990 more details could be seen in wang et al 2014 study the r rs λ measurements were carried out by using hyper profiler ii satlantic inc halifax ns canada instrument with an averaged bandwidth of 3 3 nm in a spectral range of 349 4 804 0 nm this instrument system has three calibrated radiometers namely a deck sensor that observes the above water surface downwelling irradiance ed λ 0 and two underwater sensors that measure vertical profiles of downwelling irradiance signals ed λ z and upwelling radiance signals lu λ z when beginning observations the meter was deployed in waters away from the vessel to avoid ship perturbation and shadow and also without whitecaps disturbance the collected radiometric data were quality controlled through removing those with the tilt angles 5 or downward velocity 0 5 m s 1 and then processed by a series of steps including calibration data filtering and interpolation finally r rs λ could be obtained from the following equation 1 r r s λ l w λ e d λ 0 where lw λ is the water leaving radiance which is determined from the profile of lu λ z unit w m 2 nm 1 sr 1 at the upper layer as described by rudorff et al 2014 a total of valid 246 groups of water sample derived data and 75 groups of r rs data were finally obtained in our investigated water regions 2 2 satellite data a two decade monthly satellite image dataset including seawifs r rs λ product from sep 1997 to jun 2002 and modis aqua r rs λ product from jul 2002 to sep 2017 was downloaded from nasa goddard space flight center http oceancolor gsfc nasa gov accessed in august 2015 reprocessing 2014 0 a total of 241 monthly image data spectral r rs λ with a spatial resolution of 9 km were collected in this study these images were cropped to the investigated regions in bs ys and ecs and then processed to target products by using the new developed pscs algorithm in this study see details in section 3 for showing a long time series of variations on phytoplankton size classes in the study area meanwhile daily modis aqua data spatial resolution 4 km matching with in situ data collection within a narrow time window of 1 h were also obtained from the nasa goddard space flight center and their date coverages were from 29 may to 2 jun from 28 jun to 16 july and from 22 sep to 28 oct during 2016 year see table 1 these daily modis aqua data were applied for satellite validation of the pscs algorithm spectral r rs λ data were processed using the most updated calibration and atmospheric correction algorithms namely the nir swir procedure gordon and wang 1994 jiang and wang 2014 wang et al 2017 wang and shi 2007 with the quality controlled flags such as stray light cloud coverage atmospheric correction warning etc the current study used a homogeneity test in order to avert those pixels from patchy waters and their coefficient of variation cv values 3 3 pixel window must be less than 0 4 furthermore this study used the median value from the 3 3 pixel box centered at the in situ station to avoid those potential sensor and algorithm noises hu et al 2001 the above strict constraints were utilized to determine those data matching the in situ observations 2 3 environment condition variables five environment condition variables were focused in this study which may straightly change pscs dynamics in the upper ocean namely sea surface temperature sst underwater light field using underwater diffuse attenuation coefficient k d as delegate in this study salinity wind velocity and sea surface height relative to geoid sshg sst and k d data products were available in nasa goddard space flight center matching with r rs λ monthly satellite data for retrieving a long time series of pscs variation in the study area see the first part of section 2 2

pigments that were collected in only one cruise sun et al 2017 as an update more cruises have been carried out with more effective diagnostic pigments available in this study seven typical pigments namely fucoxanthin fuco peridinin per 19 hexanoyloxyfucoxanthin 19 hex 19 butanoy loxyfucoxanthin 19 but alloxanthin allo chlorophyll b and divinyl chlorophyll b chlb and zeaxanthin zea have been demonstrated to perform well in characterizing phytoplankton assemblages vidussi et al 2001 uitz et al 2006 brewin et al 2011a 2015 hirata et al 2011 and were also shown in fig 2 p i denotes the i th diagnostic pigment in mg m 3 and w i is the weight the values for the parameter w i 2 05 1 01 1 31 4 27 3 28 0 94 and 0 75 for fuco peri 19 hex 19 but allo chlb and zea respectively where the i values denote 1 7 following this pigment sequence were available to us by carrying out a multiple linear regression between c and p i with the in situ measured hplc samples n 215 during four cruises in the marginal seas in may jun sep and dec 2016 fig 3 a the dpa derived total chlorophyll a concentrations c w showed very good agreement with in situ measured c r 2 0 961 mape 17 33 we had actually tried other published weights uitz et al 2006 2008 brewin et al 2014 2015 sun et al 2017 but with their performances not shown here inferior to the performance by the new group of weights for our study area by means of the customized diagnostic pigment analysis suitable for the study area this study can derive the micro nano and picophytoplankton proportions namely f m f n and f p which is according to vidussi et al 2001 and uitz et al 2006 methods then refined by brewin et al 2010 2015 and devred et al 2011 the fractions of chlorophyll a in each size class can be calculated as the product of c with f m f n and f p as shown in fig 2 the subscripts for c refer to micro nano and picophytoplankton respectively assuming that the sum of size specific chlorophyll a concentrations is equal to the measured total chlorophyll a concentration 3 2 model development a two component model of concept used and refined in this study is fundamentally based on an assumption that the large sized phytoplankton dominates water bodies with high chlorophyll a concentration while low chlorophyll a waters are mainly controlled by the small sized phytoplankton sathyendranath et al 2001 brewin et al 2010 devred et al 2006 2011 the total chlorophyll a concentration can be made up of two different portions where the first portion corresponds to large sized cells referring to microphytoplankton in this study and the other portion is the sum of medium and small cells i e nano and picophytoplankton also the chlorophyll a from the combination of nano and picophytoplankton could be assumed not grow beyond a certain value with the increasing total chlorophyll a concentration by using the in situ observed data this assumption could be satisfied well in the current study see fig 3b corresponding author to this assumption the c n p can be expressed as a function of the total chlorophyll a concentration c 6 c n p c n p m 1 exp s n p c where c n p m denotes a maximum that c n p asymptotically reaches with increasing c and the slope s n p can define a rate at which c n p raises with the increase in c given that absorption coefficients of water bodies are additive the phytoplankton absorption coefficient a ph λ can be thus expressed by the combination of large and small sized phytoplankton as below 7 a p h λ a m λ c m a n p λ c n p where a m λ and a n p λ are the specific absorption coefficients of microphytoplankton and the combination of nano and picophytoplankton respectively combining with eq 6 the above equation can be transformed as below devred et al 2006 8 a p h λ c n p m a n p λ a m λ 1 exp s n p c a m λ c it is assumed that c n p m s n p 1 when c approaches toward zero devred et al 2006 by applying this equation to the collected in situ dataset with a ph λ and c we could yield the parameterization for the parameters a m λ a n p λ and s n p with a value of 0 591 through the least square method for the investigated marginal seas of this study fig 3c shows the estimated spectra of specific absorption coefficients of microphytoplankton and the combination of nano and picophytoplankton in this study the a n p λ is significantly higher than a m λ that is comparable with devred et al 2011 study also following the assumption using the obtained parameters in eq 6 we accordingly can produce c n p and then c m it is comforting that relatively high and acceptable predictive accuracy could be obtained for the estimated c m by the in situ dataset in this study fig 3d to further quantify c n and c p from the derived c n p the two component concept was also attempted again and yet found to dissatisfy the basic assumption well by using our dataset as shown in fig 3e the nano and picophytoplankton jointly contribute the chlorophyll a concentration at whether high or low concentration parts of c n p probably indicative of local characteristics in the study region here we instead made use of a very close empirical relationship between c p and c n p as below 9 c p 0 37 c n p 1 06 r 2 0 851 p 0 001 n 205 note that this empirical model functions well mainly in a chlorophyll a range of 5 mg m 3 but may need more validation for high concentrations after that c n could be obtained by subtracting c p from c n p fig 3f g showed comparisons between the estimated and measured c n and c p respectively with acceptable predictive accuracies 3 3 accurate chla as model input the total chlorophyll a concentration is a single input of the phytoplankton size class model and needs to be estimated accurately some studies have demonstrated that the existing chlorophyll a products by conventional operational algorithms are not very accurate in those turbid coastal waters compared with in situ measurement such as the investigated water region of this study he et al 2013 sun et al 2017 note that the potential errors might be induced by atmospheric correction in the wide coastal water areas but not in the open ocean which is generally more challenging for our study water areas like that in sun et al 2017 this study still depends on the band ratio r rs 488 r rs 555 to retrieve chlorophyll a which is also found to perform best than other methods see table 2 based on 62 samples with r rs λ and c data collected from four cruises 41 samples was selected randomly to customize the regional chlorophyll a model see eq 10 fig 4 a with the rest samples used for model validation 10 c 0 965 exp 5 931 log 10 r r s 488 r r s 555 as shown in fig 4b the estimated and measured c show a good agreement between each other indicating relatively low predictive errors produced by the region specific chlorophyll a model 3 4 model validation in order to evaluate the performance of the developed psc model three different ways were comprehensively utilized in this study the first is to use an independent in situ dataset to test the established dpa and subsequent psc model in this study which had been collected in may 2017 cruise for this study area this dataset has 41 hplc samples among which 13 samples are simultaneously matching with in situ r rs data fig 5 shows a comparison about the dpa results which are derived by this study and other typical references indeed the current study shows a good performance with the generally lowest predictive errors such as mape 18 61 rmse 0 116 mg m 3 which implies the accuracy of dpa for the study area rather than using other existing diagnostic pigment weights the comparisons between in situ measured and estimated cm cn and cp by using the developed model of this study are shown in fig 6 the derived predictive errors such as mape 38 40 22 66 and 34 41 for cm cn and cp respectively are generally low and acceptable to a large degree meanwhile note that the predictive results derived by the previous model in sun et al 2017 study are also shown here with larger errors than that in this study as an update the currently established model in this study actually shows the following advantages 1 more in situ data collection from five cruises in different seasons used for the model s calibration and refinement 2 more effective diagnostic pigments available to us i e using seven categories for obtaining more accurate dpa rather than five as before 3 a certain physical basis is considered in the model development instead of more empirical relationships on the other hand the current study carries out satellite synchronization verification after matching the satellite derived r rs data with in situ measurements by a set of strict constraints see methodology section a limited dataset with 5 synchronous samples were obtained and then used for comparisons between measured and satellite derived pscs as shown in fig 7 a general good agreement could be seen between measured and satellite derived pscs with mape values of 22 9 11 4 and 35 0 for f m f n and f p respectively this indicates that the application of the psc model has a potential ability to produce relatively accurate and acceptable pscs results lastly the current study compared the spatial distributions of pscs produced by in situ measurement and satellite derivation note that the use of satellite data is from the specific monthly coverages concurrent with the two cruises as samples they are may 2016 cruise in zhejiang coastal waters and sep 2016 cruise in east china sea fig 8 showed the spatial distributions of pscs derived by three ways including in situ observations satellite derived results by nasa chla products and satellite derived results by region specific chla model in comparison with in situ observations we found that the pscs obtained by nasa chla products would show relatively large deviations with higher values for micro and nanophytoplankton and lower values for picophytoplankton especially in the nearshore waters this is mainly due to inaccurate chla input to our psc model fortunately the pscs derived by region specific chla model showed a spatial distribution that is close to the in situ observations although there did not exist absolutely real time synchronization between the in situ measured and satellite derived monthly pscs the cruise sampling covered a period of near one month and could roughly provide an accurate reference the generally similar spatial distribution between the in situ observation and our psc model with the regional chla correction implies the accuracy of our developed psc model our developed psc model is consisted of two main processes 1 retrieving cm from the total chlorophyll a concentration by means of the two component assumption and our proposed region specific parameters in eq 6 2 separating the cn and cp from cn p by using the more efficient method that has been proposed in this study and tested to perform better not shown here for simplicity than that of brewin et al 2010 2015 method that uses the two component assumption twice brewin et al 2010 2015 method relies on the assumption that the concentrations of different phytoplankton size structure change with the total chlorophyll a concentration which is used twice in the whole model process so if the assumption cannot function well for any given time this method would fail in the pscs retrievals although the two component assumption is also used to extract the cm in our model like that in brewin et al 2010 2015 studies the existing obvious difference lies in that our model utilizes the new method to separate the cn and cp from the cn p as well as proposing the region specific key parameters see fig 3c these novelties in our developed psc model lay the foundation for its good performance in the satellite application 3 5 model uncertainty analysis in order to test the uncertainty of our developed psc model to the r rs inputs we utilized some in situ collected samples with the measured r rs data n 35 from all cruises for delegates the two band r rs data namely r rs 488 and r rs 555 are the inputs of our model so random normal distribution errors their average value is 0 and standard deviation is 0 05 were proportionally added into r rs 488 and r rs 555 values namely r rs λ 1 error and then these new r rs values were used into our psc model to derive the new retrievals we could calculate corresponding errors such as mape and rmse between these new retrievals and the previous retrievals i e those estimations before adding random errors for the 35 representative samples these derived errors thus indicated the uncertainty of our psc model this process was repeated 50 times so that those random errors were representative following a normal distribution as shown in fig 9 the microphytoplankton retrievals showed a greater sensitivity than that of the nano and picophytoplankton on whether r rs 488 or r rs 555 the averaged mape at r rs 488 were 19 2 8 0 and 8 7 for micro nano and picophytoplankton respectively when calculated to be 20 1 8 1 and 8 9 at r rs 555 corresponding standard deviations were roughly below 2 for the microphytoplankton and less than 1 for both nano and picophytoplankton those relatively low errors indicated the stability and robustness of our model derived pscs calculations 4 two decade documentation of phytoplankton size class variation this study documented a recent two decade 1997 2017 variation in phytoplankton size classes in our study area the monthly r rs data from seawifs sep 1997 jun 2002 and modis jul 2002 sep 2017 were utilized to input our developed model to generate the time series of psc distribution fig 10 showed the general distribution patterns during this two decade period on the whole microphytoplankton contributed the most to phytoplankton assemblages in bs with ratios of 0 4 0 6 for most areas while nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton roughly showed contribution ratios of 0 3 and 0 2 respectively similar distributions also appeared in nearshore regions of ys and ecs yet in offshore regions of ys and ecs nanophytoplankton played the most important role in changing phytoplankton assemblages and explained an approximate half of the proportion meanwhile picophytoplankton also showed an important contribution especially for the central region of ys and offshore regions of ecs about 0 4 when noting that microphytoplankton would show the lowest proportion 0 2 fig 11 further showed the monthly psc variations for the study water areas during a whole year microphytoplankton dominated phytoplankton assemblages in bs and nearshore regions its high value spatial coverage approximately 0 4 would show a generally increasing trend during the first five months in each year when noting that the maximal coverage including many areas of ys and certain areas of ecs appeared in apr from jun to sep microphytoplankton showed a stable spatial distribution with low contribution in offshore waters a weak increase in high value coverage would happen in the last three months of a year nanophytoplankton dominated the offshore water areas about 0 5 during nearly all months of a whole year such as the central area of ys and offshore areas of ecs when picophytoplankton was the second contributor 0 3 0 4 for most areas meanwhile note that the monthly variations of nano and picophytoplankton would show a generally opposite trend with that of microphytoplankton five representative stations s1s5 throughout the whole study area were selected to exhibit the long time series of variations in pscs fig 12 although there existed a certain degree of fluctuations in the short run three pscs regardless of stations all showed generally stable temporal trends along with approximate central lines from a long term perspective meanwhile a mathematical mann kendall test to the long time series of the pscs had been done with results of no mutation for the pscs dynamics the above findings reveal a fact that the structure of phytoplankton size classes in our study area was generally steady at least in recent twenty years 5 discussion how are pscs dynamics influenced by environment conditions 5 1 mathematical correlations with environmental factors pscs dynamics could be linked to many environment conditions such as ocean circulation river discharge eutrophication aerosol deposition stratification upwelling and wind broecker and peng 1999 ware and thomson 2005 paytan et al 2009 behrenfeld et al 2006 martinez et al 2009 dickson et al 1988 and even some extreme climate events such as hurricanes and severe rainfall etc for parsimony this study focuses on five variables that may straightly change pscs dynamics in the upper ocean including sst k d salinity wind velocity and sshg these physical variables monthly averages were matched by time year month and location five typical stations each cell with a spatial range of 27 27 km2 with satellite derived pscs data to estimate the effects on the pscs changes within a uniform framework pearson correlation analysis was first carried out to show degrees that these variables were statistically related to the pscs k d was an important factor of controlling the pscs changes with relatively high correlation coefficients r fig 13 interestingly note that k d showed close positive relationships r 0 75 p 0 001 with microphytoplankton at these stations while negative relationships appeared with nano and picophytoplankton absolute r 0 70 p 0 001 this indicates that turbid water conditions with limited light intensity may stimulate the growth of microphytoplankton to some extent possibly due to large superficial areas of these large sized algal particles that possess stronger light availability than small suspended particulates riegman and noordeloos 1998 domingues et al 2011 yet the small sized nano and picophytoplankton growth would be suppressed by the turbidity of water bodies indeed k d will control the phytoplankton assemblages in water columns however the phytoplankton cells will probably influence the underwater light field especially in the phytoplankton dominance conditions they complement each other thus strictly speaking it should be the incident radiation rather than k d that regulate photosynthesis and physiology of phytoplankton in waters sst as the other important influencing factor showed significant correlations with the pscs in most cases sst had negative close relationships with microphytoplankton absolute r in the range of 0 43 0 66 with p 0 001 at s2 s3 and s5 stations when weak negative correlation appeared at s1 station and positive correlation at s4 station fig 13 opposite relationships happened in nano and picophytoplankton discussed in the following section as far as salinity and sshg were concerned there also existed certain correlations with the pscs at individual stations such as s3 though no sufficient valid salinity and sshg data were available in bs and nys wind velocity generally showed low correlations with the pscs fig 13 probably indicative of its weak effect on the pscs dynamics 5 2 quantitative contributions of environmental factors and potential influence in order to further quantify contributions from different environmental factors to the pscs changes this study implemented a multiple linear stepwise regression analysis based on the standardized data i e variable mean standard deviation contribution coefficients for the environmental factors at five representative stations were all shown in table 3 with very high significance level p 0 0001 for each relationship as for microphytoplankton these environmental factors could account for most of its variability with relatively high explanation ratios r 2 of 66 7 84 1 meanwhile note that nanophytoplankton and picophytoplankton could be also explained well and most variability of them r 2 62 5 83 6 for nano 56 0 84 5 for pico could be modeled by the environmental factors furthermore we found that k d and sst contributed most among these environmental factors with large contribution coefficients table 3 whereas salinity sshg and wind velocity generally showed very weak effects almost without valid contribution weights except individual cases it is also worthy to note that k d possesses the largest contribution weights which indicates light field plays a more dominant role in controlling the pscs changes for the study water areas three types of properties on influence of environmental factors on the pscs could be approximately generalized as 1 type 1 k d positive and sst negative effects on microphytoplankton and meanwhile k d negative and sst positive impacts on nano and picophytoplankton corresponding to s1 s2 and s3 stations table 3 in this study 2 type 2 positive effects from both k d and sst on microphytoplankton and simultaneously negative impacts on nano and picophytoplankton see s4 station 3 type 3 k d positive impact on microphytoplankton and negative to nano and pico phytoplankton and sst negative effects on micro and picophytoplankton and positive to nanophytoplankton like s5 station as for type 1 the corresponding representative stations s1 s2 and s3 in fig 12 all distributed at the offshore central regions of the seas with larger depths than other regions where terrestrial influence such as runoff discharge would be weak to a certain degree so the phytoplankton growth was mainly affected by the own conditions of water columns huang et al 1999 large k d implies weak water stratification and a certain strong vertical mixing of water columns which accordingly increases nutrients in the surface layer of water columns eutrophic water conditions with high nutrients are prone to facilitate the growth of microphytoplankton when oligotrophic water bodies are more suitable for nano and picophytoplankton propagation chisholm 1992 platt et al 2005 aiken et al 2009 opposite to k d increasing sst tends to generate a shallower mixed layer and more apparent water stratification boyce et al 2010 which further limits nutrient supply to the surface water layer and then constrains the increase of microphytoplankton compared with microphytoplankton k d and sst show opposite impacts on nano and picophytoplankton because increasing sst and decreasing k d easily lead to low nutrient input to the surface water layer in this status of low nutrient content nutrient absorption efficiency from nano and pico phytoplankton is higher than microphytoplankton nair et al 2008 which finally promotes their growth a distinct feature for type 2 is the presence of relatively strong terrigenous input effect that leads to high nutrient water conditions for instance the water region like s4 station fig 12 is located near to yangtze estuary water stratification may not exist very obviously and also k d value is usually high due to vertical mixing and a large quantity of suspended particulate discharge shen et al 2010 2013 high nutrient sources come from surface runoff vertical transport and also potentially seaweed farming in subei shoal shi et al 2015 li et al 2017a high nutrient water conditions along with increasing sst and k d provide a chance of rapid growth for microphytoplankton while growth rates of nano and picophytoplankton would be lower than microphytoplankton so the proportions of nano and picophytoplankton in the total phytoplankton biomass would be conversely affected along with the increase of sst and k d the water regions of type 3 see s5 station in fig 12 show similar natural conditions with type 1 such as large water depths and weak terrestrial influence due to far away from the land most influences from both sst and k d on the pscs are similar to that of type 1 but note that a difference is the negative effect of sst on picophytoplankton for type 3 this is probably owing to the impact of kuroshio current which is typically characterized by high temperature and high salinity water mass jiao et al 2005 yang et al 2011 lee et al 2014 li et al 2017b it has been demonstrated that picophytoplankton such as picoeukaryotes and synechococcus may be restrained by high salinity water condition in summer and also has been found to closely correlate with the total phytoplankton biomass in winter with relatively low temperature guo et al 2014 this supports the findings of our study that the picophytoplankton percentage increases under relatively low temperature environment in the water regions of type 3 5 3 periodic response of pscs to environmental factors fig 14 shows the time series of the pscs and environmental factors mainly k d and sst due to their dominant effects which have been processed by the wavelet analysis method to remove potential noise and high frequency information these shown curves indicate the general characteristics on temporal variations for pscs and environmental factors only micro and nanophytoplankton were shown here as delegates since pico phytoplankton would show similar trends with nanophytoplankton in general these quantities including micro and nanophytoplankton k d and sst have similar time cycles for their temporal variations fig 14 more specifically approximate one year interval is a change cycle for them also very short response time of phytoplankton to k d and sst less than one month is found in this study as revealed in mutshinda et al 2013 and macintyre et al 2000 studies the findings in the current study suggest a potentially rapid response of phytoplankton when the external environment conditions change 6 conclusions our study represents a first effort to document the past two decadal i e from 1997 to 2017 variations on phytoplankton assemblage structure using phytoplankton size classes as its first order delegate in the marginal seas of china based on a newly developed region specific semi analytical model satellite derived spatial patterns reveal a general rule i e microphytoplankton dominates nearshore regions while nanophytoplankton accounts for the most variation in offshore regions as well as a certain high contribution from picophytoplankton from a temporal perspective our records demonstrate a generally stable variation trend in phytoplankton assemblage structures during the past two decades while periodical changes happen in a short term scale approximately within a year spatiotemporally synchronous environment variables are matched to infer their influences on the pscs dynamics underwater light field and sea surface temperature are indicated as the two dominant environment factors and meanwhile can model the pscs changes very well in the study marginal seas also together with a fine generalization i e three types of influence by them another interesting finding is a swift response 1 month of phytoplankton to the changing external environment conditions also consistent with those marine biology studies such consequences in the current study provide incentive for an enhanced basic knowledge on understanding phytoplankton population evolution and environment responses given that the pscs variations are potentially affected by climate conditions such as some extreme climate events e g hurricanes severe rainfall etc that is not covered in the current study future research should focus on them for revealing climate change from marine phytoplankton status declaration of interests the

18849,many current treatments for brine wastewaters are energy intensive chemical intensive and involve independent process in the removal of salts and contaminants we demonstrate that through the integration of capacitive deionization and photocatalysis reactions within carbon nanotubes cnts based membrane system we are able to realize the purification and desalination of wastewaters via single step energy efficient and environmentally friendly route we firstly designed the membrane system consisting of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 cnts membrane and poly vinyl alcohol formaldehyde pvf foam then two identical membrane systems were used as permeable electrodes and photocatalytic microreactors to construct the flow through setup the tests of the setup with a variety of dye solution antibiotics solution and actual wastewaters prove that wastewaters passing through the setup promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity this is because the setup can use c3n4 modified cnts membrane to adsorb organic contaminants and inorganic ions and decompose contaminants via photocatalysis reactions in addition by discharging the setup its adsorption capacity towards salts is easily recovered consequently the flow through setup is observed to exhibit stable performance for concurrent removal of organic contaminants and inorganic salts in multiple cycles graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon nanotube membrane wastewater desalination photocatalysis 1 introduction the development of high efficient water treatment technologies including water purification and desalination has been identified as one of the major challenges facing the scientists in this century montgomery and elimelech 2007 schwarzenbach et al 2006 shannon et al 2008 werber et al 2016 generally either industrial wastewaters or municipal sewages contain both organic contaminants and inorganic salts to remove the organics in the wastewater conventional technologies involve in a series of chemical and biological processes and require the assistance of intense chemicals ahmed et al 2017 oturan and aaron 2014 which inevitably leads to the formation of unwanted by products to desalinate the water reverse osmosis ro and multistage flash distillation msf are widely implemented lee et al 2011 misdan et al 2012 shannon et al 2008 these technologies are known to rely on vast infrastructures and consume large amounts of energies elimelech and phillip 2011 membranes fabricated with inorganic or polymeric nanofibers which have mesh like structure and unique surface properties cao et al 2013b ioniţă et al 2018 lewis et al 2011 ma et al 2011 metreveli et al 2014 mohammed et al 2018 muhulet et al 2018 pandele et al 2018 sehaqui et al 2018 yuan et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 are now emerging as an efficient and robust way to purify water owing to the difference in diffusion adsorption rates nanofiber membranes permit the permeation of water molecules rapidly while retard or prevent the transport of bacteria virus and even organic small molecules consequently the purification of wastewaters through membranes is majorly based on physical processes and is environmentally friendly capacitive deionization cdi is being developed as a potential deionization technique that is competitive with conventional ion removal methods such as ro and msf porada et al 2013 welgemoed and schutte 2005 cdi methods desalinate the water through the specific adsorption of ions onto a pair of porous membrane electrodes on which a potential is applied li et al 2010 wu et al 2017 this is different from ro and msf processes where water molecules are removed instead of the ions using cdi the total energy consumption for the production of fresh water from brackish water could be less than 0 6 kwh m 3 welgemoed and schutte 2005 whereas ro and msf processes require significantly higher amounts of energy ro for brackish water 2 3 kwh m 3 ro for seawater 3 4 kwh m 3 msf for seawater 55 80 kwh m 3 jeon et al 2013 semiat 2008 through ongoing studies in the past decades great success has been achieved in the purification of wastewaters with nanofiber membrane technologies albu et al 2007 lee et al 2016 lewis et al 2011 ma et al 2011 peng et al 2016 thakur and voicu 2016 and the desalination with the cdi methods huang et al 2017 oladunni et al 2018 porada et al 2012 2013 zhang et al 2018 however since actual wastewaters usually contain both organic contaminants and salts the treatment of them through independent membrane and desalination process not only complicates the procedure but also brings disadvantages associated with the individual process another problem is that nanofiber membranes tend to show a declined flux and capture efficiency with the accumulation of the contaminants if photocatalytic properties were imparted to the membranes via surface modification techniques the membranes will be able to clean themselves and thus keep the activity to exclude the contaminants an et al 2014 bai et al 2015 gao et al 2014 moreover beneficial from the strong oxidizing power and non selectivity of photocatalytic reactions nanofiber membranes endowed with photocatalytic performances are of particular interests in dealing with complex wastewaters in a word it would be more elegant if a single membrane based process could integrate both photocatalysis and cdi functionalities recently we found that metal can induce carbon nanotubes cnts or other carbon nanomaterials to deposit onto its surface to form large area membranes under the control of electrical double layer mediated self assembly mechanism cao et al 2013a song et al 2017 an important feature of the self assembled cnts membrane hereafter termed sa cnts membrane is that its apparent density approaches 1 25 g cm 3 because of extremely dense packing of the cnts ye et al 2018 this value is comparable to the densities of highly aligned cnts forests 1 3 1 8 g cm 3 futaba et al 2006 a highly dense structure suggests that the sa cnts membrane is a good barrier layer to block microorganisms virus and even organic small molecules ma et al 2011 moreover since the sa cnts membrane is intrinsically porous and conductive it should be also the desirable electrode material for cdi zhao et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 furthermore as the relatively large voids among adjacent nanotubes offer abundant room to accommodate photocatalytic nanoparticles the sa cnts membrane can be easily modified with photocatalytic properties consequently cnts membranes prepared by the self assembly route may be an ideal platform to integrate multiple performances including the desalination of saline water the exclusion of pollutants and the degradation of pollutants in this study we firstly designed a membrane system with a configuration consisting of the outmost graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 layer the sa cnts membrane interlayer and the innermost poly vinyl alcohol formaldehyde pvf foam of them g c3n4 serves as metal free photocatalyst for decomposing organic contaminants cnts membrane acts as electrode and active material for capacitive deionization and pvf foam guarantees the mechanical stability of the membrane system next by using a pair of the composite membrane as the separators we fabricated a flow through setup that is capable of simultaneously removing organic pollutants and inorganic salts in wastewaters as expected the tests of the setup with a variety of model wastewaters solution of dyes and antibiotics prove that wastewaters passing through the setup promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity furthermore to extend this work to real world applications we used landfill leachate and effluent collected from a chemical plant to emphasize that the flow through setup is efficient in the purification of actual wastewaters 2 experimental 2 1 assembly of sa cnts membrane firstly multi walled cnts outer diameter 25 nm length 10 μm were oxidized with nitric acid steam which enables the cnts to suspend in water and form stable dispersion with a concentration of 100 mg l 1 then copper foil with optional sizes was immersed into the dispersion and placed in an oven 45 c during which the cnts were spontaneously organized on the surface of the copper to form continuous uniform film the copper foil covered by sa cnts membrane was rinsed carefully with deionized water and dried naturally to remove oxygen containing groups and improve the conductivity the sa cnts membrane was annealed at 250 c in h2 atmosphere for 3 h finally self standing sa cnts membrane was obtained by etching the copper foil with 1 mol l 1 ammonium persulfate aps solution the membrane has an apparent density around 1 2 g cm 3 2 2 preparation of sa cnts membrane coated by pvf foam in order to increase the strength of the sa cnts membrane highly porous pvf foam was employed to coat the membrane pan et al 2014 typically 1 g of poly vinyl alcohol was dissolved in 9 g of deionized water at 95 c leading to pva solution with a concentration of 10 wt the hot solution was added in sequence by formaldehyde 1 ml triton x 100 0 15 ml and h2so4 50 wt 3 ml under vigorous stirring after the completion of the chemicals liquid froth was quickly obtained which was spread on the surface of the sa cnts membrane and cured in an oven at 40 c for 5 h thus pvf foam coated cnts membrane was obtained 2 3 fabrication of flow through setup the laboratory scale flow through setup consist of a pair of pvf coated cnts membranes the membranes were mounted onto a single compartment cell volume 1 ml with a single outlet then they were clamped between two polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe plates with square window a ring shaped carbon cloth was sandwiched between ptfe plate and cnts membrane and used as the current collector of the setup diagrammatic drawings and photographs of the setup can be seen in scheme 1 and fig s1 respectively 2 4 modification of sa cnts membrane with g c3n4 nanoparticles firstly we synthesized g c3n4 through the pyrolysis of melamine at 550 c the pale yellow powder collected was dispersed in water by ultrasound the resulted dispersion was centrifugalized at 6000 rpm for 10 min to remove relatively large particles which leaded to colloidal c3n4 solution with high stability then colloidal c3n4 solution was pumped through the as fabricated setup at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 in this stage c3n4 nanoparticles in the solution were captured by the cnts membranes thus the modification of sa cnts membrane by g c3n4 nanoparticles was achieved 2 5 electrochemical performance of the flow through setup electrochemical performances of the setup were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry cv and galvanostatic charge discharge gcd tests using a chi 660c work station during the tests the electrolyte solution of 0 005 mol l 1 of na2so4 or nacl flowed through the setup continuously at a constant rate of 0 5 ml min 1 the capacitance of the setup was calculated from the gcd curve using the formula c i dv dt mass and areal capacitances of the setup were obtained by dividing the capacitance with the mass and area of the sa cnts membrane respectively 2 6 permeability of the flow through setup the permeability of the setup was evaluated by using a variety of model wastewaters and actual wastewaters as test liquids they include rhodamine b solution 10 mg l 1 methylene blue solution 10 mg l 1 fluorescein solution 10 mg l 1 tetracycline solution 10 mg l 1 actual industrial wastewater containing 4 4 oxybis benzenesulfonic acid received from a chemical plant at jiaxing city and landfill leachate received from a waste disposal station at jiaxing city the test liquids were pumped through the setup at a flow rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 the output stream was collected for uv vis absorption spectroscopy measurements in order to avoid photocatalytic effects all the permeation experiments were conducted in the dark 2 7 application of the flow through setup in desalination and removal of contaminants the test liquids in the studies are 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution dissolved by methylene blue 10 mg l 1 10 3 mol l 1 nacl solution dissolved by methylene blue 10 mg l 1 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution dissolved by tetracycline 10 mg l 1 and the above mentioned industrial wastewater they were pumped through the setup at a flow rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 during which the two cnts membranes were applied by a voltage 1 2 v and meanwhile irradiated by the light from a 200 w xe lamp the output streams were collected for uv vis absorption spectroscopy and conductivity measurements 2 8 physical characterizations scanning electron microscopy sem images were obtained from a hitachi s4800 electron microscope transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained from a jeol 2010 electron microscope x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed on an escalab220i xl electron spectrometer from vg scientific using al kα excitation raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on a hr800 raman microspectrometer with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light uv vis absorption spectra were recorded on a shimadzu uv 3150 spectrophotometer n2 absorption desorption analysis was conducted using micromeritics asap 2020 at 77 k and the surface area was calculated by using barrett emmett teller bet method x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded on a bruker d8 focus powder x ray diffractometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation structure and morphology of sa cnts membrane we began our studies from the assembly of large area cnts membrane scheme 1a the cnts used for current study are multi walled with diameter of 25 nm and average length of 10 μm fig s2 by inserting a piece of copper foil into the aqueous dispersion of cnts the electrical double layer between the metal and the solution would drive cnts to deposit layer by layer onto the surface of the copper foil which finally leaded to the formation of uniform and continuous membrane the inset in fig 1 a shows a piece of 4 cm 4 cm cnt membrane which was assembled at 40 c for 5 h larger cnts membrane can also be readily prepared by using a larger metal foil as the substrate fig s3 fig 1 exhibits the sem measurements of the as prepared sa cnts membrane the membrane has a thickness up to 5 μm fig 1b and is able to keep self standing after the etch of the copper foil with aps solution sem image also reveals that the cnts are aligned densely at the cross section of the membrane fig 1c which suggests that the membrane may exhibit selective permeability and will be particularly suitable for barrier layer different from the cross section the cnts on the skin layer of the membrane are interconnected and form a giant network fig 1d in addition it is worth noting that cracks pinholes and other defects were not observed throughout the whole membrane which is attributed to the fact that the self assembly process for the growth of the membrane is smooth and accurate further raman spectroscopy study of the cnts membrane shows the characteristic g band 1575 cm 1 and d band 1346 cm 1 found in carbon materials fig s4 g band arises from the e2g hexagonal graphitic lattice whereas the d band is associated with the disordered carbon the conductivity from the top to the bottom of the cnts membrane without the support of copper substrate was 95 8 ω cm 1 whereas the sheet resistance measured by the 4 point probe method was 72 6 ω sq which is sufficient for many electrochemical applications chung 2004 the pore properties of the sa cnts membrane were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption method as shown in fig s5a the isotherm curves reveal a large hysteresis in the high p p 0 range 0 45 1 0 demonstrating the presence of abundant mesopores in the cnts membrane the bet surface area of the membrane is 77 12 m2 g 1 which is about one third of that for the powdered cnts ca 210 m2 g 1 the reduced surface area for the membrane would be expected because the accumulation of the cnts diminishes a large number of external surfaces fig s5b shows the barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size distribution curve derived from the n2 desorption branch two types of pores are found the pores centering at 2 8 nm correspond to the inner channels of the cnts and the broad pore distributions in the range of 8 100 nm are associated with the voids among adjacent cnts seen in fig 1 in addition total pore volume of the membrane is 0 51 cm3 g 1 and the majority of the pore volume comes from mesopores mesoporosity 99 4 microporosity 0 6 a high microporosity can result in greater surface area but limits mass transport rates in publications by tsouris and co workers tsouris et al 2011 yang et al 2002 nanostructured carbon with high microporosity and large surface area does not show larger ion adsorption capacity due to the edl overlapping effects on the contrary mesopores are more easily accessed by ions and may contribute significantly to the electrosorption capacity tsouris et al 2011 consequently herein the sa cnts membrane integrating high conductivity and mesoporosity may be ideal candidate for cdi in order to further enhance the strength of the sa cnts membrane and guarantee its mechanical stability in subsequent applications the cnts membrane was coated with a layer of porous pvf foam scheme 1a this was achieved by casting liquid pvf forth onto the surface of the cnts membrane and curing at 60 c pan et al 2014 fig 2 a and b shows the surface morphology of the pvf foam which reveals that the foam is highly porous with pore width larger than 20 μm fig 2c and d displays the cross section of the pvf foam supported cnts membrane as seen pores in the foam are highly interconnected and there is a clear interface between the pvf foam and the cnts membrane that is the coverage of the foam on the cnts membrane will not affect the permeability 3 2 fabrication of flow through setup and modification of sa cnts membrane with g c3n4 next a pair of the pvf cnts membranes was mounted face to face onto a single compartment cell with cnts membrane facing outward thus a pressure driven setup for flow through treatment of wastewater is fabricated as shown in scheme 1a and fig s1 when wastewater is pumped through the setup sa cnts membranes can act as barrier layer to retard the transport of contaminants thus leading to the purification of the output stream moreover the flow through setup is essentially a parallel plate supercapacitor in a two electrode configuration where the porous and conductive cnts membranes serve as both active material and electrode if there are salts in the wastewater the ions will be extracted from the solution by the cnts membranes through electrosorption interactions which is the same as the charging process of supercapacitors although the as fabricated device now can be used to remove salts and contaminants simultaneously its efficiency in retaining the contaminants will not be long standing because of the limited adsorption capacity of the cnts membranes towards the contaminants consequently it is demanded to modify the cnts membrane with photocatalytic materials after that the cnts membrane will be a photocatalytic microreactor to eliminate the adsorbed contaminants by itself and keep the efficiency in retaining the contaminants in the study metal free g c3n4 nanoparticles prepared through the pyrolysis of melamine were chosen as the photocatalyst to modify the cnts membrane wang et al 2012 fig s6 shows the xrd pattern of the g c3n4 nanoparticles the peak at 27 7 corresponds to the characteristic diffraction from the 002 crystallographic plane of g c3n4 joint committee sem and tem measurements indicate that the g c3n4 nanoparticles are fine fig s7 this facilitates the dispersion of g c3n4 nanoparticles in water to yield colloidal solution with good stability fig s8a uv vis absorbance measurements indicate that the absorption edge of the g c3n4 nanoparticles locates at 2 8 ev fig s9 consistent with the data reported in the literature wang et al 2009 which means that parts of photons in the visible light region can be absorbed by the g c3n4 nanoparticles and utilized for photocatalytic reactions the colloidal g c3n4 solution was then pumped through the flow through setup shown in scheme 1b as expected colorless and transparent output stream was obtained fig s8b implying that c3n4 nanoparticles were efficiently blocked by the cnts membrane light scattering measurements also demonstrate that the output stream did not contain c3n4 nanoparticles figs s8c and s8d fig 2e shows the sem images of the cnts membrane after filtering the colloidal c3n4 solution as seen c3n4 nanoparticles are agglomerated and formed a layer of continuous or semi continuous coating on the surface of the cnts membrane a local view reveals that c3n4 nanoparticles are filled into the voids within the cnts membrane fig 2f due to structural affinity between graphitic c3n4 and carbon nanotubes intermolecular interactions may arise and allow c3n4 nanoparticles to combine with the membrane firmly besides visual evidences xps characterizations support the incorporation of c3n4 nanoparticles into the cnts membrane too if the cnts membrane was not modified by g c3n4 nanoparticles the major and minor elements are c 284 6 ev and o 533 3 ev coming from some oxygen containing groups respectively fig s10a when the cnts membrane was modified by g c3n4 nanoparticles the element of n 399 5 ev is detected besides c and o fig s10b deconvolution of the c 1s spectra figs s10c and s10d suggest the presence of c n species in the c3n4 modified membrane deconvolution of the n 1s spectrum fig s10e identifies three nitrogen containing components fig s10f c n c 398 0 ev hn c 2 398 5 ev and n c 3 399 8 ev these xps data are characteristic for g c3n4 li et al 2014 in a word by passing c3n4 dispersion through the device g c3n4 nanoparticles are successfully incorporated into the cnts membrane this will transform the flow through setup to a photoreactor with the desired self cleaning performance in addition the efficient exclusion of the nanoparticles indicate that the flow through device may be not only potential for pollutant removal but also for water sterilization in biotechnology or medical applications 3 3 studies on the electrochemical performances of the flow through setup before target applications in simultaneously removing salts and contaminants from wastewaters the flow through setup was evaluated by measuring the electrochemical properties and selective permeability upon applying a potential difference between two cnts membranes the one of negative polarity serves as the cathode and adsorbs cations and the other of positive polarity acts as the anode and adsorbs anions since na2so4 and nacl are widely used salts in industry they are selected as the electrolytes in current study fig 3 a shows the cv curves measured in 5 mmol l 1 na2so4 solution with a voltage window of 1 2 v and an increasing scan rate from 1 to 100 mv s 1 the quasi rectangular cv shapes indicate that the sa cnts membrane stores the charges mainly through an electrical double layer adsorption mechanism even at a fast scan rate 100 mv s 1 the electrical double layer behavior is still retained indicating the rapid charging discharging dynamic of the setup i e adsorbing and releasing ions rapidly the long term stability of the device is learned from the gcd tests after 10000 charging discharging cycles the device displays a low capacitance loss less than 5 and almost unchanged coulombic efficiency fig 3c and the insets the long cycle life and good durability of the setup are associated with the network structure of the cnts membrane electrode due to 3d interconnection of one dimensional nanotubes and the formation of elastic and deformable network the membrane electrode can tolerate the swelling and hold structural integrity during charge and discharge song et al 2017 based on the gcd results the areal specific capacitance and mass specific capacitance of the cnts membrane electrode were estimated to be 1 5 mf cm 2 and 26 7 f g 1 at the current density of 5 ma cm 2 fig 3b and d shows the electrochemical performances of the device measured in 5 mmol l 1 nacl solution as seen the electrochemical behaviors of the device are basically same with those measured in the na2so4 solution the calculated areal and mass specific capacitances for the device are about 0 82 mf cm 2 and 12 9 f g 1 lower than that measured in na2so4 solution the relatively large capacitance in na2so4 electrolyte is because of the higher ionic strength and more charges available to the formation of the electrical double layer tsouris et al 2011 3 4 permeability studies of the flow through setup after the study of the electrochemical properties of the flow through device we then investigated its separation and adsorption performances towards organic molecules model pollutants or actual wastewaters were employed as test liquids which include rhodamine b solution 10 mg l 1 methylene blue solution 10 mg l 1 fluorescein solution 10 mg l 1 tetracycline solution 10 mg l 1 actual industrial wastewater containing 4 4 oxybis benzenesulfonic acid received from a chemical plant at jiaxing city china and landfill leachate the test liquids were pumped through the device at a constant rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 in order to eliminate the impacts of photocatalytic effects on the results the operations were conducted in the dark the output streams were collected at an hourly interval and tested for the concentration of residual organic pollutants fig 4 shows the photographs of the filtered liquids and the plots of the concentrations of the organic pollutants in the output streams as seen the five test liquids were all obviously faded right column in fig 4 marked with sa membrane especially for samples collected in the first few hours since all the five liquids exhibit characteristic absorption bands in the regions of visible and ultraviolet lights fig s11 quantitative analysis can be performed on the basis of the optical absorption data quantitative analysis results indicate that more than 80 of the pollutants were blocked by the cnts membrane at the initial stage left column in fig 4 after which the concentrations of the pollutants in the output streams were increased slowly indicating the saturation of adsorption sites furthermore we had tried to use the device to treat landfill leachate received from a waste disposal station landfill leachate is known to have great environmental impacts on air soil and ground water fig s12 displays the photographs of the landfill leachate after passing through the setup it clearly shows that the landfill leachate changes its appearance from brown to clear and transparent indicative of efficient removal of the contaminants and the purification of the output stream however due to the complex composition of the landfill leachate we did not carry out quantitative analysis of the output stream in the current study a follow up work will focus on the purification of landfill leachate with the fabricated flow through setup theoretically speaking organic molecules in the test liquids may permeate the cnts mesh freely because the pores within the cnts membrane are much larger than the sizes of the organic molecules e g methylene blue 6 å qada et al 2006 rhodamine b 8 å auweraer et al 1988 however our results demonstrate that the cnts membrane exhibits an abnormal exclusion behavior for a large number of organic molecules we believe that there are at least four factors responsible for the selective permeability of the sa cnts membrane 1 the building blocks of the membrane are the terminal open carbon nanotubes which allow the pollutants to access both the inner and outer surfaces and accommodate them thus the concentrations of the pollutants in the output streams are decreased 2 the tortuous microstructure and the dense packing of the nanotubes raise the flow resistance of the pollutants which efficiently enhance the selectivity of the membrane 3 acid treatment prior to the assembly step introduce carboxylic cooh groups on the surfaces of the nanotubes the charged groups together with the hydrophobic graphite domains in the carbon nanotubes endow the membrane with the ability to discriminate small molecules on the basis of weak interactions e g electrostatic interactions hydrophobicity 4 sometimes organic small molecules may intend to form aggregates that will have a larger size which raise the resistance for the transport of the pollutants due to steric effects as we know large area cnts membranes can also be prepared by other solution based methods for instance a paper like cnts membrane was obtained rapidly through vacuum filtration of the dispersed solution on a filter membrane hereafter termed vf cnt membrane fig s13 in order to make a comparison we fabricated a flow through setup by replacing sa cnt membranes with vf cnt membranes and evaluated the permeability of the setup with the above mentioned test liquids at the initial stage the setup exhibited a good performance in the exclusion of the pollutants which lead to a noticeable decrease of pollutant concentrations in the output streams left column in fig 3 with the prolongation of the runtime pollutant concentrations in the output streams were risen and finally approached the levels in original test liquids by comparing the data presented in fig 3a one can find that pollutant levels in output streams from the setup fabricated by sa cnts membranes are relatively lower than those from the setup based on vf cnt membranes at the same sampling time in addition to the quantitative comparison the colors of the output streams should provide intuitive evidence that the liquids are relatively clean after filtration through the sa cnts membranes right column in fig 3 marked with vf membrane in short all the data demonstrate that sa cnts membrane is more efficient in retaining organic pollutants than the vf cnts membrane the reason why sa cnts membrane has a higher permeation selectivity than vf cnts membrane is correlated with structural differences between them as demonstrated sa cnts membrane is dense and free of defects fig 2 in contrast the structure of the vf cnts membrane is less uniform because it is manufactured through an uncontrolled filtration process according to the sem measurements there actually exist a large number of defects inside the membrane such as micron scale or larger cracks and holes figs s13d f these defects may serve as channels to facilitate transmembrane transport of pollutants thus making vf cnts membrane not qualify to be the permeation barrier to efficiently block small organic contaminant molecules furthermore we had attempted to use isolated pvf foam as the membrane to fabricate the flow through setup in this case the device was no longer efficient for water purification as the concentrations of the pollutants in the output streams are almost the same as those in the original test liquids data not shown 3 5 desalination and removal of contaminants with the flow through setup as indicated by the large capacitance and good permeation selectivity the flow through setup based on sa cnts membranes should be potential to simultaneously remove salts and organic pollutants in wastewaters more attractively since photocatalytically active c3n4 nanocrystals are coated on the surface of the sa cnts membrane the membrane now possesses the power to decompose organic pollutants under the irradiation of light this will solve the problem of adsorption saturation of the cnts membrane by pollutants and guarantee the cnts membrane to keep high efficiency in excluding the pollutants to conduct experiments that remove salts and organic pollutants simultaneously the membrane electrodes of the flow through setup were applied by a voltage of 1 2 v lower than the thermodynamic breakdown voltage of water and irradiated by light emitted from a 200 w xenon lamp scheme 1c illustrates the concept of the concurrent removal of salts and organic pollutants by using the flow through setup firstly a dye based brine solution 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution dissolved by 10 mg l 1 methylene blue was used to permeate the setup at constant flow rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 the analysis of the output stream by the uv vis spectroscopy reveals that the characteristic absorption bands at 664 nm and 613 nm for methylene blue are invisible during the whole studies fig s14a implying that c3n4 modified cnts membranes efficiently decomposed methylene blue molecules by means of photocatalytic reactions otherwise the cnts membrane would be saturated by the organics and lose the activity to trap them after the long term operation to determine the concentration of na2so4 in the output stream the conductivity of the liquid was measured by conductivity meter it is found that after the test liquid passes through the device about 80 of the na2so4 can be removed at the initial stage and the desalination rate still reach 55 at 30 min fig 5 a the result suggests that the adsorption capacity of the device defined as the total removed salt divided by the total mass of the cnts membrane is at least 28 7 mg na2so4 per gram of carbon nanotubes the heavy adsorption of na2so4 on the cnts membrane is also clarified by the sem figs s15a and s15b and xrd fig s16a data stability and cyclability are also critically important for water treatment equipment fortunately since our device is essentially a supercapacitor it can release the adsorbed salts through a simple discharge process by short circuiting the two membrane electrodes when the discharged device was evaluated again with the same dye based test liquid it exhibited a complete recovery of the removal capacity towards both mb and na2so4 fig 5a importantly similar results could be achieved in the four cycling experiments the membrane electrodes adsorbing the ions with an applied voltage of 1 2 v and then releasing the ions by a short circuiting step is recorded as one cycle suggesting the stable performance of the device to further elucidate that the flow through setup is bi functional and non selective the device was tested by more model wastewaters such as methylene blue 10 mg l 1 in 10 3 mol l 1 nacl solution and tetracycline 10 mg l 1 in 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution under identical conditions voltage 1 2 v flowing rate 1 ml cm 2 min 1 uv vis spectroscopy measurements show that there are almost no methylene blue and tetracycline in the output streams figs s14b and s14c the exclusion of methylene blue and tetracycline reinforces the findings that c3n4 modified cnts membrane can efficiently eliminate organic pollutants via photocatalytic reactions fig 5b and c also plot the desalination rate curves for the model wastewaters towards the nacl solution of methylene blue the device kept a desalination rate in the range of 65 32 in the four cycles fig 4b corresponding to an adsorption capacity of 9 2 mg nacl per gram of carbon nanotubes in one cycle it is worth noting that the adsorption of nacl onto the cnts membrane is also confirmed by sem figs s15c and s15d and xrd fig s16b characterizations towards the na2so4 solution of tetracycline the device kept a desalination rate at the level of 81 55 in the four cycles fig 5c corresponding to an adsorption capacity of 24 1 mg na2so4 per gram of carbon nanotubes in one cycle one can see that there is an obvious variance between the desalination rate for na2so4 solution and nacl solution this result is coincident with the relatively large capacitance measured in na2so4 solution fig 3a and b the higher desalination rate achieved for na2so4 solution is attributed to the larger ionic strength and more charge number which facilitate the adsorption of the ions onto the cnts membranes via electrostatic interactions in order to extend our technology to real world applications actual industrial wastewater was used to demonstrate how the flow through device is capable of performing dual functions at the same time as mentioned above the actual wastewater collected from a chemical plant was contaminated by 4 4 oxybis benzenesulfonic acid and it has a conductivity around 800 μs cm 1 which belongs to brackish water under the illumination of the xenon lamp the light brown wastewater passing through the membrane electrodes promptly transformed to clear liquid and importantly this phenomenon was lasted for whole experiments fig 5d fig s14d shows a representative uv vis absorption spectrum of the output stream where the characteristic absorption bands at 301 5 nm and 236 5 nm are significantly weakened relative to those of original wastewater fig s11e the results demonstrate again that the setup can maintain long term activity to retain the contaminants because c3n4 modified cnts membrane possesses the self cleaning performance under illumination condition meanwhile owing to the effect of capacitive deionization the conductivity of the output streams had declined from the initial 800 μs cm 1 to less than 350 μs cm 1 the salinity was decreased by at least 55 in each cycle fig 5d this suggests that the output stream now is comparable to natural freshwater that typically shows a conductivity in the range of 50 500 μs cm 1 besides the prominent advantage in the integration of multiple performances desalination excluding pollutants and then decomposing them etc it needs to highlight that the flow through strategy also simplifies the wastewater treatment process and avoids the use of expensive or harmful chemicals as demonstrated previously wastewaters are promptly purified after they pass through the cnts membrane based photoreactor if wastewaters were treated with conventional photocatalytic technique based on powdered photocatalysts it will involve a long reaction period and additional step to separate the photocatalysts dispersed in water 4 conclusions in this work we have demonstrated that through the utilization of ternary membranes consisting of c3n4 cnts and pvf a flow through setup integrating cdi and photocatalysis performances were constructed which can use c3n4 modified cnts membrane electrodes to adsorb contaminants and inorganic ions and decompose contaminants via photocatalysis reactions the tests of the setup with a variety of model wastewaters and actual industrial wastewater prove that the wastewaters promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity when they are pumped through the setup additionally by discharging the setup its adsorption capacity towards salts is easily recovered consequently the flow through setup is observed to exhibit stable performance for concurrent removal of organic contaminants and inorganic salts in multiple cycles the effectiveness of the flow through setup suggests that it may be useful for energy efficient and environment friendly purification of brine wastewaters especially if large area cnts membranes e g 1 m 1 m could be assembled in future and employed to fabricate the flow through setup the wastewater treatment capability is expected to be raised to several tens of tons per day this indicates the good promise of the flow through strategy for practical applications conflicts of interest there is no conflict of interest acknowledgements the financial support from national natural science foundation of china grant no 21473079 and 21673102 is

18849,many current treatments for brine wastewaters are energy intensive chemical intensive and involve independent process in the removal of salts and contaminants we demonstrate that through the integration of capacitive deionization and photocatalysis reactions within carbon nanotubes cnts based membrane system we are able to realize the purification and desalination of wastewaters via single step energy efficient and environmentally friendly route we firstly designed the membrane system consisting of graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 cnts membrane and poly vinyl alcohol formaldehyde pvf foam then two identical membrane systems were used as permeable electrodes and photocatalytic microreactors to construct the flow through setup the tests of the setup with a variety of dye solution antibiotics solution and actual wastewaters prove that wastewaters passing through the setup promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity this is because the setup can use c3n4 modified cnts membrane to adsorb organic contaminants and inorganic ions and decompose contaminants via photocatalysis reactions in addition by discharging the setup its adsorption capacity towards salts is easily recovered consequently the flow through setup is observed to exhibit stable performance for concurrent removal of organic contaminants and inorganic salts in multiple cycles graphical abstract image 1 keywords carbon nanotube membrane wastewater desalination photocatalysis 1 introduction the development of high efficient water treatment technologies including water purification and desalination has been identified as one of the major challenges facing the scientists in this century montgomery and elimelech 2007 schwarzenbach et al 2006 shannon et al 2008 werber et al 2016 generally either industrial wastewaters or municipal sewages contain both organic contaminants and inorganic salts to remove the organics in the wastewater conventional technologies involve in a series of chemical and biological processes and require the assistance of intense chemicals ahmed et al 2017 oturan and aaron 2014 which inevitably leads to the formation of unwanted by products to desalinate the water reverse osmosis ro and multistage flash distillation msf are widely implemented lee et al 2011 misdan et al 2012 shannon et al 2008 these technologies are known to rely on vast infrastructures and consume large amounts of energies elimelech and phillip 2011 membranes fabricated with inorganic or polymeric nanofibers which have mesh like structure and unique surface properties cao et al 2013b ioniţă et al 2018 lewis et al 2011 ma et al 2011 metreveli et al 2014 mohammed et al 2018 muhulet et al 2018 pandele et al 2018 sehaqui et al 2018 yuan et al 2008 zhao et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 are now emerging as an efficient and robust way to purify water owing to the difference in diffusion adsorption rates nanofiber membranes permit the permeation of water molecules rapidly while retard or prevent the transport of bacteria virus and even organic small molecules consequently the purification of wastewaters through membranes is majorly based on physical processes and is environmentally friendly capacitive deionization cdi is being developed as a potential deionization technique that is competitive with conventional ion removal methods such as ro and msf porada et al 2013 welgemoed and schutte 2005 cdi methods desalinate the water through the specific adsorption of ions onto a pair of porous membrane electrodes on which a potential is applied li et al 2010 wu et al 2017 this is different from ro and msf processes where water molecules are removed instead of the ions using cdi the total energy consumption for the production of fresh water from brackish water could be less than 0 6 kwh m 3 welgemoed and schutte 2005 whereas ro and msf processes require significantly higher amounts of energy ro for brackish water 2 3 kwh m 3 ro for seawater 3 4 kwh m 3 msf for seawater 55 80 kwh m 3 jeon et al 2013 semiat 2008 through ongoing studies in the past decades great success has been achieved in the purification of wastewaters with nanofiber membrane technologies albu et al 2007 lee et al 2016 lewis et al 2011 ma et al 2011 peng et al 2016 thakur and voicu 2016 and the desalination with the cdi methods huang et al 2017 oladunni et al 2018 porada et al 2012 2013 zhang et al 2018 however since actual wastewaters usually contain both organic contaminants and salts the treatment of them through independent membrane and desalination process not only complicates the procedure but also brings disadvantages associated with the individual process another problem is that nanofiber membranes tend to show a declined flux and capture efficiency with the accumulation of the contaminants if photocatalytic properties were imparted to the membranes via surface modification techniques the membranes will be able to clean themselves and thus keep the activity to exclude the contaminants an et al 2014 bai et al 2015 gao et al 2014 moreover beneficial from the strong oxidizing power and non selectivity of photocatalytic reactions nanofiber membranes endowed with photocatalytic performances are of particular interests in dealing with complex wastewaters in a word it would be more elegant if a single membrane based process could integrate both photocatalysis and cdi functionalities recently we found that metal can induce carbon nanotubes cnts or other carbon nanomaterials to deposit onto its surface to form large area membranes under the control of electrical double layer mediated self assembly mechanism cao et al 2013a song et al 2017 an important feature of the self assembled cnts membrane hereafter termed sa cnts membrane is that its apparent density approaches 1 25 g cm 3 because of extremely dense packing of the cnts ye et al 2018 this value is comparable to the densities of highly aligned cnts forests 1 3 1 8 g cm 3 futaba et al 2006 a highly dense structure suggests that the sa cnts membrane is a good barrier layer to block microorganisms virus and even organic small molecules ma et al 2011 moreover since the sa cnts membrane is intrinsically porous and conductive it should be also the desirable electrode material for cdi zhao et al 2018 zhu et al 2011 furthermore as the relatively large voids among adjacent nanotubes offer abundant room to accommodate photocatalytic nanoparticles the sa cnts membrane can be easily modified with photocatalytic properties consequently cnts membranes prepared by the self assembly route may be an ideal platform to integrate multiple performances including the desalination of saline water the exclusion of pollutants and the degradation of pollutants in this study we firstly designed a membrane system with a configuration consisting of the outmost graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 layer the sa cnts membrane interlayer and the innermost poly vinyl alcohol formaldehyde pvf foam of them g c3n4 serves as metal free photocatalyst for decomposing organic contaminants cnts membrane acts as electrode and active material for capacitive deionization and pvf foam guarantees the mechanical stability of the membrane system next by using a pair of the composite membrane as the separators we fabricated a flow through setup that is capable of simultaneously removing organic pollutants and inorganic salts in wastewaters as expected the tests of the setup with a variety of model wastewaters solution of dyes and antibiotics prove that wastewaters passing through the setup promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity furthermore to extend this work to real world applications we used landfill leachate and effluent collected from a chemical plant to emphasize that the flow through setup is efficient in the purification of actual wastewaters 2 experimental 2 1 assembly of sa cnts membrane firstly multi walled cnts outer diameter 25 nm length 10 μm were oxidized with nitric acid steam which enables the cnts to suspend in water and form stable dispersion with a concentration of 100 mg l 1 then copper foil with optional sizes was immersed into the dispersion and placed in an oven 45 c during which the cnts were spontaneously organized on the surface of the copper to form continuous uniform film the copper foil covered by sa cnts membrane was rinsed carefully with deionized water and dried naturally to remove oxygen containing groups and improve the conductivity the sa cnts membrane was annealed at 250 c in h2 atmosphere for 3 h finally self standing sa cnts membrane was obtained by etching the copper foil with 1 mol l 1 ammonium persulfate aps solution the membrane has an apparent density around 1 2 g cm 3 2 2 preparation of sa cnts membrane coated by pvf foam in order to increase the strength of the sa cnts membrane highly porous pvf foam was employed to coat the membrane pan et al 2014 typically 1 g of poly vinyl alcohol was dissolved in 9 g of deionized water at 95 c leading to pva solution with a concentration of 10 wt the hot solution was added in sequence by formaldehyde 1 ml triton x 100 0 15 ml and h2so4 50 wt 3 ml under vigorous stirring after the completion of the chemicals liquid froth was quickly obtained which was spread on the surface of the sa cnts membrane and cured in an oven at 40 c for 5 h thus pvf foam coated cnts membrane was obtained 2 3 fabrication of flow through setup the laboratory scale flow through setup consist of a pair of pvf coated cnts membranes the membranes were mounted onto a single compartment cell volume 1 ml with a single outlet then they were clamped between two polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe plates with square window a ring shaped carbon cloth was sandwiched between ptfe plate and cnts membrane and used as the current collector of the setup diagrammatic drawings and photographs of the setup can be seen in scheme 1 and fig s1 respectively 2 4 modification of sa cnts membrane with g c3n4 nanoparticles firstly we synthesized g c3n4 through the pyrolysis of melamine at 550 c the pale yellow powder collected was dispersed in water by ultrasound the resulted dispersion was centrifugalized at 6000 rpm for 10 min to remove relatively large particles which leaded to colloidal c3n4 solution with high stability then colloidal c3n4 solution was pumped through the as fabricated setup at a flow rate of 0 5 ml min 1 in this stage c3n4 nanoparticles in the solution were captured by the cnts membranes thus the modification of sa cnts membrane by g c3n4 nanoparticles was achieved 2 5 electrochemical performance of the flow through setup electrochemical performances of the setup were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry cv and galvanostatic charge discharge gcd tests using a chi 660c work station during the tests the electrolyte solution of 0 005 mol l 1 of na2so4 or nacl flowed through the setup continuously at a constant rate of 0 5 ml min 1 the capacitance of the setup was calculated from the gcd curve using the formula c i dv dt mass and areal capacitances of the setup were obtained by dividing the capacitance with the mass and area of the sa cnts membrane respectively 2 6 permeability of the flow through setup the permeability of the setup was evaluated by using a variety of model wastewaters and actual wastewaters as test liquids they include rhodamine b solution 10 mg l 1 methylene blue solution 10 mg l 1 fluorescein solution 10 mg l 1 tetracycline solution 10 mg l 1 actual industrial wastewater containing 4 4 oxybis benzenesulfonic acid received from a chemical plant at jiaxing city and landfill leachate received from a waste disposal station at jiaxing city the test liquids were pumped through the setup at a flow rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 the output stream was collected for uv vis absorption spectroscopy measurements in order to avoid photocatalytic effects all the permeation experiments were conducted in the dark 2 7 application of the flow through setup in desalination and removal of contaminants the test liquids in the studies are 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution dissolved by methylene blue 10 mg l 1 10 3 mol l 1 nacl solution dissolved by methylene blue 10 mg l 1 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution dissolved by tetracycline 10 mg l 1 and the above mentioned industrial wastewater they were pumped through the setup at a flow rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 during which the two cnts membranes were applied by a voltage 1 2 v and meanwhile irradiated by the light from a 200 w xe lamp the output streams were collected for uv vis absorption spectroscopy and conductivity measurements 2 8 physical characterizations scanning electron microscopy sem images were obtained from a hitachi s4800 electron microscope transmission electron microscopy tem images were obtained from a jeol 2010 electron microscope x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps measurements were performed on an escalab220i xl electron spectrometer from vg scientific using al kα excitation raman spectroscopy measurements were performed on a hr800 raman microspectrometer with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light uv vis absorption spectra were recorded on a shimadzu uv 3150 spectrophotometer n2 absorption desorption analysis was conducted using micromeritics asap 2020 at 77 k and the surface area was calculated by using barrett emmett teller bet method x ray diffraction xrd patterns were recorded on a bruker d8 focus powder x ray diffractometer 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation structure and morphology of sa cnts membrane we began our studies from the assembly of large area cnts membrane scheme 1a the cnts used for current study are multi walled with diameter of 25 nm and average length of 10 μm fig s2 by inserting a piece of copper foil into the aqueous dispersion of cnts the electrical double layer between the metal and the solution would drive cnts to deposit layer by layer onto the surface of the copper foil which finally leaded to the formation of uniform and continuous membrane the inset in fig 1 a shows a piece of 4 cm 4 cm cnt membrane which was assembled at 40 c for 5 h larger cnts membrane can also be readily prepared by using a larger metal foil as the substrate fig s3 fig 1 exhibits the sem measurements of the as prepared sa cnts membrane the membrane has a thickness up to 5 μm fig 1b and is able to keep self standing after the etch of the copper foil with aps solution sem image also reveals that the cnts are aligned densely at the cross section of the membrane fig 1c which suggests that the membrane may exhibit selective permeability and will be particularly suitable for barrier layer different from the cross section the cnts on the skin layer of the membrane are interconnected and form a giant network fig 1d in addition it is worth noting that cracks pinholes and other defects were not observed throughout the whole membrane which is attributed to the fact that the self assembly process for the growth of the membrane is smooth and accurate further raman spectroscopy study of the cnts membrane shows the characteristic g band 1575 cm 1 and d band 1346 cm 1 found in carbon materials fig s4 g band arises from the e2g hexagonal graphitic lattice whereas the d band is associated with the disordered carbon the conductivity from the top to the bottom of the cnts membrane without the support of copper substrate was 95 8 ω cm 1 whereas the sheet resistance measured by the 4 point probe method was 72 6 ω sq which is sufficient for many electrochemical applications chung 2004 the pore properties of the sa cnts membrane were characterized by nitrogen adsorption desorption method as shown in fig s5a the isotherm curves reveal a large hysteresis in the high p p 0 range 0 45 1 0 demonstrating the presence of abundant mesopores in the cnts membrane the bet surface area of the membrane is 77 12 m2 g 1 which is about one third of that for the powdered cnts ca 210 m2 g 1 the reduced surface area for the membrane would be expected because the accumulation of the cnts diminishes a large number of external surfaces fig s5b shows the barrett joyner halenda bjh pore size distribution curve derived from the n2 desorption branch two types of pores are found the pores centering at 2 8 nm correspond to the inner channels of the cnts and the broad pore distributions in the range of 8 100 nm are associated with the voids among adjacent cnts seen in fig 1 in addition total pore volume of the membrane is 0 51 cm3 g 1 and the majority of the pore volume comes from mesopores mesoporosity 99 4 microporosity 0 6 a high microporosity can result in greater surface area but limits mass transport rates in publications by tsouris and co workers tsouris et al 2011 yang et al 2002 nanostructured carbon with high microporosity and large surface area does not show larger ion adsorption capacity due to the edl overlapping effects on the contrary mesopores are more easily accessed by ions and may contribute significantly to the electrosorption capacity tsouris et al 2011 consequently herein the sa cnts membrane integrating high conductivity and mesoporosity may be ideal candidate for cdi in order to further enhance the strength of the sa cnts membrane and guarantee its mechanical stability in subsequent applications the cnts membrane was coated with a layer of porous pvf foam scheme 1a this was achieved by casting liquid pvf forth onto the surface of the cnts membrane and curing at 60 c pan et al 2014 fig 2 a and b shows the surface morphology of the pvf foam which reveals that the foam is highly porous with pore width larger than 20 μm fig 2c and d displays the cross section of the pvf foam supported cnts membrane as seen pores in the foam are highly interconnected and there is a clear interface between the pvf foam and the cnts membrane that is the coverage of the foam on the cnts membrane will not affect the permeability 3 2 fabrication of flow through setup and modification of sa cnts membrane with g c3n4 next a pair of the pvf cnts membranes was mounted face to face onto a single compartment cell with cnts membrane facing outward thus a pressure driven setup for flow through treatment of wastewater is fabricated as shown in scheme 1a and fig s1 when wastewater is pumped through the setup sa cnts membranes can act as barrier layer to retard the transport of contaminants thus leading to the purification of the output stream moreover the flow through setup is essentially a parallel plate supercapacitor in a two electrode configuration where the porous and conductive cnts membranes serve as both active material and electrode if there are salts in the wastewater the ions will be extracted from the solution by the cnts membranes through electrosorption interactions which is the same as the charging process of supercapacitors although the as fabricated device now can be used to remove salts and contaminants simultaneously its efficiency in retaining the contaminants will not be long standing because of the limited adsorption capacity of the cnts membranes towards the contaminants consequently it is demanded to modify the cnts membrane with photocatalytic materials after that the cnts membrane will be a photocatalytic microreactor to eliminate the adsorbed contaminants by itself and keep the efficiency in retaining the contaminants in the study metal free g c3n4 nanoparticles prepared through the pyrolysis of melamine were chosen as the photocatalyst to modify the cnts membrane wang et al 2012 fig s6 shows the xrd pattern of the g c3n4 nanoparticles the peak at 27 7 corresponds to the characteristic diffraction from the 002 crystallographic plane of g c3n4 joint committee sem and tem measurements indicate that the g c3n4 nanoparticles are fine fig s7 this facilitates the dispersion of g c3n4 nanoparticles in water to yield colloidal solution with good stability fig s8a uv vis absorbance measurements indicate that the absorption edge of the g c3n4 nanoparticles locates at 2 8 ev fig s9 consistent with the data reported in the literature wang et al 2009 which means that parts of photons in the visible light region can be absorbed by the g c3n4 nanoparticles and utilized for photocatalytic reactions the colloidal g c3n4 solution was then pumped through the flow through setup shown in scheme 1b as expected colorless and transparent output stream was obtained fig s8b implying that c3n4 nanoparticles were efficiently blocked by the cnts membrane light scattering measurements also demonstrate that the output stream did not contain c3n4 nanoparticles figs s8c and s8d fig 2e shows the sem images of the cnts membrane after filtering the colloidal c3n4 solution as seen c3n4 nanoparticles are agglomerated and formed a layer of continuous or semi continuous coating on the surface of the cnts membrane a local view reveals that c3n4 nanoparticles are filled into the voids within the cnts membrane fig 2f due to structural affinity between graphitic c3n4 and carbon nanotubes intermolecular interactions may arise and allow c3n4 nanoparticles to combine with the membrane firmly besides visual evidences xps characterizations support the incorporation of c3n4 nanoparticles into the cnts membrane too if the cnts membrane was not modified by g c3n4 nanoparticles the major and minor elements are c 284 6 ev and o 533 3 ev coming from some oxygen containing groups respectively fig s10a when the cnts membrane was modified by g c3n4 nanoparticles the element of n 399 5 ev is detected besides c and o fig s10b deconvolution of the c 1s spectra figs s10c and s10d suggest the presence of c n species in the c3n4 modified membrane deconvolution of the n 1s spectrum fig s10e identifies three nitrogen containing components fig s10f c n c 398 0 ev hn c 2 398 5 ev and n c 3 399 8 ev these xps data are characteristic for g c3n4 li et al 2014 in a word by passing c3n4 dispersion through the device g c3n4 nanoparticles are successfully incorporated into the cnts membrane this will transform the flow through setup to a photoreactor with the desired self cleaning performance in addition the efficient exclusion of the nanoparticles indicate that the flow through device may be not only potential for pollutant removal but also for water sterilization in biotechnology or medical applications 3 3 studies on the electrochemical performances of the flow through setup before target applications in simultaneously removing salts and contaminants from wastewaters the flow through setup was evaluated by measuring the electrochemical properties and selective permeability upon applying a potential difference between two cnts membranes the one of negative polarity serves as the cathode and adsorbs cations and the other of positive polarity acts as the anode and adsorbs anions since na2so4 and nacl are widely used salts in industry they are selected as the electrolytes in current study fig 3 a shows the cv curves measured in 5 mmol l 1 na2so4 solution with a voltage window of 1 2 v and an increasing scan rate from 1 to 100 mv s 1 the quasi rectangular cv shapes indicate that the sa cnts membrane stores the charges mainly through an electrical double layer adsorption mechanism even at a fast scan rate 100 mv s 1 the electrical double layer behavior is still retained indicating the rapid charging discharging dynamic of the setup i e adsorbing and releasing ions rapidly the long term stability of the device is learned from the gcd tests after 10000 charging discharging cycles the device displays a low capacitance loss less than 5 and almost unchanged coulombic efficiency fig 3c and the insets the long cycle life and good durability of the setup are associated with the network structure of the cnts membrane electrode due to 3d interconnection of one dimensional nanotubes and the formation of elastic and deformable network the membrane electrode can tolerate the swelling and hold structural integrity during charge and discharge song et al 2017 based on the gcd results the areal specific capacitance and mass specific capacitance of the cnts membrane electrode were estimated to be 1 5 mf cm 2 and 26 7 f g 1 at the current density of 5 ma cm 2 fig 3b and d shows the electrochemical performances of the device measured in 5 mmol l 1 nacl solution as seen the electrochemical behaviors of the device are basically same with those measured in the na2so4 solution the calculated areal and mass specific capacitances for the device are about 0 82 mf cm 2 and 12 9 f g 1 lower than that measured in na2so4 solution the relatively large capacitance in na2so4 electrolyte is because of the higher ionic strength and more charges available to the formation of the electrical double layer tsouris et al 2011 3 4 permeability studies of the flow through setup after the study of the electrochemical properties of the flow through device we then investigated its separation and adsorption performances towards organic molecules model pollutants or actual wastewaters were employed as test liquids which include rhodamine b solution 10 mg l 1 methylene blue solution 10 mg l 1 fluorescein solution 10 mg l 1 tetracycline solution 10 mg l 1 actual industrial wastewater containing 4 4 oxybis benzenesulfonic acid received from a chemical plant at jiaxing city china and landfill leachate the test liquids were pumped through the device at a constant rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 in order to eliminate the impacts of photocatalytic effects on the results the operations were conducted in the dark the output streams were collected at an hourly interval and tested for the concentration of residual organic pollutants fig 4 shows the photographs of the filtered liquids and the plots of the concentrations of the organic pollutants in the output streams as seen the five test liquids were all obviously faded right column in fig 4 marked with sa membrane especially for samples collected in the first few hours since all the five liquids exhibit characteristic absorption bands in the regions of visible and ultraviolet lights fig s11 quantitative analysis can be performed on the basis of the optical absorption data quantitative analysis results indicate that more than 80 of the pollutants were blocked by the cnts membrane at the initial stage left column in fig 4 after which the concentrations of the pollutants in the output streams were increased slowly indicating the saturation of adsorption sites furthermore we had tried to use the device to treat landfill leachate received from a waste disposal station landfill leachate is known to have great environmental impacts on air soil and ground water fig s12 displays the photographs of the landfill leachate after passing through the setup it clearly shows that the landfill leachate changes its appearance from brown to clear and transparent indicative of efficient removal of the contaminants and the purification of the output stream however due to the complex composition of the landfill leachate we did not carry out quantitative analysis of the output stream in the current study a follow up work will focus on the purification of landfill leachate with the fabricated flow through setup theoretically speaking organic molecules in the test liquids may permeate the cnts mesh freely because the pores within the cnts membrane are much larger than the sizes of the organic molecules e g methylene blue 6 å qada et al 2006 rhodamine b 8 å auweraer et al 1988 however our results demonstrate that the cnts membrane exhibits an abnormal exclusion behavior for a large number of organic molecules we believe that there are at least four factors responsible for the selective permeability of the sa cnts membrane 1 the building blocks of the membrane are the terminal open carbon nanotubes which allow the pollutants to access both the inner and outer surfaces and accommodate them thus the concentrations of the pollutants in the output streams are decreased 2 the tortuous microstructure and the dense packing of the nanotubes raise the flow resistance of the pollutants which efficiently enhance the selectivity of the membrane 3 acid treatment prior to the assembly step introduce carboxylic cooh groups on the surfaces of the nanotubes the charged groups together with the hydrophobic graphite domains in the carbon nanotubes endow the membrane with the ability to discriminate small molecules on the basis of weak interactions e g electrostatic interactions hydrophobicity 4 sometimes organic small molecules may intend to form aggregates that will have a larger size which raise the resistance for the transport of the pollutants due to steric effects as we know large area cnts membranes can also be prepared by other solution based methods for instance a paper like cnts membrane was obtained rapidly through vacuum filtration of the dispersed solution on a filter membrane hereafter termed vf cnt membrane fig s13 in order to make a comparison we fabricated a flow through setup by replacing sa cnt membranes with vf cnt membranes and evaluated the permeability of the setup with the above mentioned test liquids at the initial stage the setup exhibited a good performance in the exclusion of the pollutants which lead to a noticeable decrease of pollutant concentrations in the output streams left column in fig 3 with the prolongation of the runtime pollutant concentrations in the output streams were risen and finally approached the levels in original test liquids by comparing the data presented in fig 3a one can find that pollutant levels in output streams from the setup fabricated by sa cnts membranes are relatively lower than those from the setup based on vf cnt membranes at the same sampling time in addition to the quantitative comparison the colors of the output streams should provide intuitive evidence that the liquids are relatively clean after filtration through the sa cnts membranes right column in fig 3 marked with vf membrane in short all the data demonstrate that sa cnts membrane is more efficient in retaining organic pollutants than the vf cnts membrane the reason why sa cnts membrane has a higher permeation selectivity than vf cnts membrane is correlated with structural differences between them as demonstrated sa cnts membrane is dense and free of defects fig 2 in contrast the structure of the vf cnts membrane is less uniform because it is manufactured through an uncontrolled filtration process according to the sem measurements there actually exist a large number of defects inside the membrane such as micron scale or larger cracks and holes figs s13d f these defects may serve as channels to facilitate transmembrane transport of pollutants thus making vf cnts membrane not qualify to be the permeation barrier to efficiently block small organic contaminant molecules furthermore we had attempted to use isolated pvf foam as the membrane to fabricate the flow through setup in this case the device was no longer efficient for water purification as the concentrations of the pollutants in the output streams are almost the same as those in the original test liquids data not shown 3 5 desalination and removal of contaminants with the flow through setup as indicated by the large capacitance and good permeation selectivity the flow through setup based on sa cnts membranes should be potential to simultaneously remove salts and organic pollutants in wastewaters more attractively since photocatalytically active c3n4 nanocrystals are coated on the surface of the sa cnts membrane the membrane now possesses the power to decompose organic pollutants under the irradiation of light this will solve the problem of adsorption saturation of the cnts membrane by pollutants and guarantee the cnts membrane to keep high efficiency in excluding the pollutants to conduct experiments that remove salts and organic pollutants simultaneously the membrane electrodes of the flow through setup were applied by a voltage of 1 2 v lower than the thermodynamic breakdown voltage of water and irradiated by light emitted from a 200 w xenon lamp scheme 1c illustrates the concept of the concurrent removal of salts and organic pollutants by using the flow through setup firstly a dye based brine solution 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution dissolved by 10 mg l 1 methylene blue was used to permeate the setup at constant flow rate of 1 ml cm 2 min 1 the analysis of the output stream by the uv vis spectroscopy reveals that the characteristic absorption bands at 664 nm and 613 nm for methylene blue are invisible during the whole studies fig s14a implying that c3n4 modified cnts membranes efficiently decomposed methylene blue molecules by means of photocatalytic reactions otherwise the cnts membrane would be saturated by the organics and lose the activity to trap them after the long term operation to determine the concentration of na2so4 in the output stream the conductivity of the liquid was measured by conductivity meter it is found that after the test liquid passes through the device about 80 of the na2so4 can be removed at the initial stage and the desalination rate still reach 55 at 30 min fig 5 a the result suggests that the adsorption capacity of the device defined as the total removed salt divided by the total mass of the cnts membrane is at least 28 7 mg na2so4 per gram of carbon nanotubes the heavy adsorption of na2so4 on the cnts membrane is also clarified by the sem figs s15a and s15b and xrd fig s16a data stability and cyclability are also critically important for water treatment equipment fortunately since our device is essentially a supercapacitor it can release the adsorbed salts through a simple discharge process by short circuiting the two membrane electrodes when the discharged device was evaluated again with the same dye based test liquid it exhibited a complete recovery of the removal capacity towards both mb and na2so4 fig 5a importantly similar results could be achieved in the four cycling experiments the membrane electrodes adsorbing the ions with an applied voltage of 1 2 v and then releasing the ions by a short circuiting step is recorded as one cycle suggesting the stable performance of the device to further elucidate that the flow through setup is bi functional and non selective the device was tested by more model wastewaters such as methylene blue 10 mg l 1 in 10 3 mol l 1 nacl solution and tetracycline 10 mg l 1 in 10 3 mol l 1 na2so4 solution under identical conditions voltage 1 2 v flowing rate 1 ml cm 2 min 1 uv vis spectroscopy measurements show that there are almost no methylene blue and tetracycline in the output streams figs s14b and s14c the exclusion of methylene blue and tetracycline reinforces the findings that c3n4 modified cnts membrane can efficiently eliminate organic pollutants via photocatalytic reactions fig 5b and c also plot the desalination rate curves for the model wastewaters towards the nacl solution of methylene blue the device kept a desalination rate in the range of 65 32 in the four cycles fig 4b corresponding to an adsorption capacity of 9 2 mg nacl per gram of carbon nanotubes in one cycle it is worth noting that the adsorption of nacl onto the cnts membrane is also confirmed by sem figs s15c and s15d and xrd fig s16b characterizations towards the na2so4 solution of tetracycline the device kept a desalination rate at the level of 81 55 in the four cycles fig 5c corresponding to an adsorption capacity of 24 1 mg na2so4 per gram of carbon nanotubes in one cycle one can see that there is an obvious variance between the desalination rate for na2so4 solution and nacl solution this result is coincident with the relatively large capacitance measured in na2so4 solution fig 3a and b the higher desalination rate achieved for na2so4 solution is attributed to the larger ionic strength and more charge number which facilitate the adsorption of the ions onto the cnts membranes via electrostatic interactions in order to extend our technology to real world applications actual industrial wastewater was used to demonstrate how the flow through device is capable of performing dual functions at the same time as mentioned above the actual wastewater collected from a chemical plant was contaminated by 4 4 oxybis benzenesulfonic acid and it has a conductivity around 800 μs cm 1 which belongs to brackish water under the illumination of the xenon lamp the light brown wastewater passing through the membrane electrodes promptly transformed to clear liquid and importantly this phenomenon was lasted for whole experiments fig 5d fig s14d shows a representative uv vis absorption spectrum of the output stream where the characteristic absorption bands at 301 5 nm and 236 5 nm are significantly weakened relative to those of original wastewater fig s11e the results demonstrate again that the setup can maintain long term activity to retain the contaminants because c3n4 modified cnts membrane possesses the self cleaning performance under illumination condition meanwhile owing to the effect of capacitive deionization the conductivity of the output streams had declined from the initial 800 μs cm 1 to less than 350 μs cm 1 the salinity was decreased by at least 55 in each cycle fig 5d this suggests that the output stream now is comparable to natural freshwater that typically shows a conductivity in the range of 50 500 μs cm 1 besides the prominent advantage in the integration of multiple performances desalination excluding pollutants and then decomposing them etc it needs to highlight that the flow through strategy also simplifies the wastewater treatment process and avoids the use of expensive or harmful chemicals as demonstrated previously wastewaters are promptly purified after they pass through the cnts membrane based photoreactor if wastewaters were treated with conventional photocatalytic technique based on powdered photocatalysts it will involve a long reaction period and additional step to separate the photocatalysts dispersed in water 4 conclusions in this work we have demonstrated that through the utilization of ternary membranes consisting of c3n4 cnts and pvf a flow through setup integrating cdi and photocatalysis performances were constructed which can use c3n4 modified cnts membrane electrodes to adsorb contaminants and inorganic ions and decompose contaminants via photocatalysis reactions the tests of the setup with a variety of model wastewaters and actual industrial wastewater prove that the wastewaters promptly turn to clean water with significantly decreased salinity when they are pumped through the setup additionally by discharging the setup its adsorption capacity towards salts is easily recovered consequently the flow through setup is observed to exhibit stable performance for concurrent removal of organic contaminants and inorganic salts in multiple cycles the effectiveness of the flow through setup suggests that it may be useful for energy efficient and environment friendly purification of brine wastewaters especially if large area cnts membranes e g 1 m 1 m could be assembled in future and employed to fabricate the flow through setup the wastewater treatment capability is expected to be raised to several tens of tons per day this indicates the good promise of the flow through strategy for practical
