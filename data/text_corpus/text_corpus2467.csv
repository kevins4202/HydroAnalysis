12335,with the climatic changes occurrence of drought has become a major problem in agriculture which leads to scarcity of surface as well as groundwater which negatively affects the physiological responses of plants therefore farmers need to find ways to preserve groundwater for dry years groundwater can be preserved for dry years by reducing groundwater withdrawals by fallowing the crops with higher water use efficiency a symbiotic relationship between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi amf and plants which is an adaptation strategy to cope with water stress by increasing plant water use efficiency proline accumulation in plants is associated with the water stress objectives of this research were to study the effect of amf inoculation on physiological plant responses and on leaf proline concentration as a strategy to increase sustainable use of water during drought pot experiment was carried out by adding amf and without adding amf four water levels 50 ml 100 ml 150 ml and 200 ml were applied daily in respective treatments with four replicates statistical analysis revealed that treatments were significantly different p 0 05 for the number of leaves number of pods

strategy with using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi symbiosis with crop plants to take maximum use of groundwater while mitigating the adverse effects of water stress on crop yield due to scarcity of water this research was also planned to study the effect of amf inoculation on physiological plant responses and on leaf proline concentration as a strategy to increase sustainable use of groundwater 2 material and methods 2 1 study design and preparation of experimental pots and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculum the pot experiment was carried out in a greenhouse under natural light conditions at the rajarata university of sri lanka in mihintale sri lanka the day time temperature in the greenhouse during the trial was 31 35 c and night time temperature was 30 32 ⁰c with the 68 relative humidity the soil type red yellow podzolic ph 6 1 moisture content 67 and electrical conductivity 46 µs m was collected from the undisturbed site of mihintale sri lanka the experiment was established by a complete randomized block design crbd with the use of soybean glycine max l plants of pb 1 variety as test plants the experiment included the following experimental combinations with four replications t1 soil 50 ml of water t2 soil 100 ml of water t3 soil 150 ml of water t4 soil 200 ml of water t5 soil amf inoculum 50 ml of water t6 soil amf inoculum 100 ml of water t7 soil amf inoculum 150 ml of water t8 soil amf inoculum 200 ml of water a composite soil sample was collected 0 15 cm depth from the top soil layer and was air dried and sieved by 2 0 mm sieve prior to analysis and pot filling arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculums were added to sixteen pots and the other sixteen pots were prepared without adding amf inoculums pots with added amf were filled with 2 25 kg of soil and pots without added amf were filled with 2 75 kg of soil a mixture of air dried gliricidia sp leaves and cattle manure 0 25 kg was added to each pot to facilitate the nutrient requirements of the soybean for amf inoculum preparation trap culture technique was done with maize zea mays used as the host plants root pieces of uprooted maize plants and the soil containing mycorrhizal spores of 0 5 kg was added to the pots which required to add amf prior to adding root pieces into pots the percentage amf colonization was verified for randomly selected maize roots by using magnified root intersection method mcgonigle et al 1990 after staining the roots phillips and hayman 1970 two soybean seeds were grown in each pot and after two weeks of seedling growth thinned to one soybean plant during first three weeks all thirty two plants were watered daily with 100 ml of water which required by the initial growth of the plants after the third week 50 ml 100 ml 150 ml and 200 ml of water was added daily to the pots accordingly to the respective treatments any chemical fertilizer or herbicide was not applied to plants 2 2 collection of data for growth and yield parameters soybean plant height and number of leaves were measured in one month periods and dry weight of shoots and roots were determined after harvest photosynthetic rates were measured using a portable photosynthesis system li6400xt for randomly selected leaves leaf area was measured with a laser leaf area meter cid bio science ci 202 laser area meter usa for randomly selected leaves from 32 replicates measured yield parameters were total number of pods total number of seeds and fresh and dry weights of seeds 2 3 soil moisture analysis soil moisture content was estimated by using dry weight basis method black 1965 as the soil used in the study was sieved by 2 0 mm sieve prior to pot filling 50 g of wet soil was used in the analysis and it was oven dried at 105 c for 72 h percentage moisture content in dry weight basis was estimated following the eq 1 1 p e r c e n t a g e m o i s t u r e c o n t e n t w 2 w 3 w 3 w 1 100 w1 dry weights of the petri dishes with the lids w2 weight of the petri dishes with lids containing wet soil w3 final weights of petri dishes with lids containing dry soil 2 4 leaf proline determination colorimetric determination of proline was proceeded according to bates et al 1973 based on proline s reaction with ninhydrin three plant leaves were randomly sampled from each replicate and proline was determined using spectrophotometer uv vis spectrophotometer model t70 at 520 nm wavelength 2 5 data analysis minitab 16 2 1 was used to analyse data at 0 05 significant level normally distributed data and not normally distributed data were analysed respectively by using one way anova and kruskal wallis test correlations were analysed using the pearson correlation coefficient 3 results and discussion 3 1 percentage colonization of amf arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization were significantly decreased p 0 003 in soybean roots as the level of the drought stress raised with reduced amounts of water additions al karaki et al 2004 wolfe et al 2006 gonzalez dugo 2010 fig 1 however this result differs from the findings reported by mo et al 2016 that the drought stress did not significantly affect amf root colonization in watermelon although mycorrhizal colonization was detected in soybean plants without added amf percentage colonization was higher with the amf additions in this study in agreement with wu and xia 2006 3 2 soil moisture content it was shown that soil moisture content was significantly different p 0 001 in different treatments fig 2 with the addition of same water level soil with added amf was shown the higher soil moisture content than the soil without amf addition this might be due to the ability of amf to increase the retention of soil water kaya et al 2003 augé 2004 ruiz lozano and aroca 2010 previous studies were shown that soil with amf has formed more water stable aggregates than the non amf soils and correlative evidence has linked soil aggregation with increased drought resistance igiehon and babalola 2017 it is evidenced that amf could be used for the sustainable management of groundwater due to their ability to retain a higher percentage of soil moisture even under water stressed conditions 3 3 leaf proline concentration significantly higher p 0 018 leaf proline concentration was observed in the soybean watered with 50 ml of water and without added amf fig 3 it was revealed that leaf proline concentration was higher in non amf added plants than amf added plants at water stressed conditions hazzoumi et al 2015 a lower proline content is an indication of better tolerance to drought induced by amf colonization ruiz lozano et al 1995 this suggested that amf colonization enhanced the host plant s drought stress tolerance and thus plants were less stressed than the non amf added plants augé and moore 2005 this result is in agreement with previous findings in soybean porcel et al 2004 and other crops ruiz lozano and azcón 1997 wu and xia 2006 aroca et al 2008 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 abbaspour et al 2012 fan and liu 2011 asrar et al 2012 plouznikoff et al 2016 however it was also reported that the colonization of roots by amf in various plant species induces proline accumulation in water scarce conditions azcón et al 1996 yooyongwech et al 2013 the increased accumulation of proline in these studies were linked to amf induced drought resistance with proline acting as an osmoprotectant yooyongwech et al 2013 3 4 photosynthetic rate rate of photosynthesis of soybean leaves was significantly increased p 0 028 with added amf fig 4 this may be due to the result of amf symbiosis improved plant water status which greatly influenced the photosynthesis by increasing stomatal conductance and co2 fixing boldt et al 2011 zhu et al 2014 fernandez lizarazo and moreno fonseca 2016 arbuscular mycorrhizae improves photosynthesis rate in soybean than non amf added soybean under water stressed conditions fig 5 supported by many research findings augé 2001 ruiz lozano 2003 sánchez blanco et al 2004 khalvati et al 2005 high photosynthetic rates in amf inoculated plants in water deficit could also be explained by non stomatal factors mainly by increased production of photosynthetic pigments and higher carboxylation efficiency sánchez blanco et al 2004 zhu et al 2014 arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis avoids the photoinhibition and photodestruction of photosynthetic pigments by reactive oxygen species in stress conditions as compared to non mycorrhizal plants dixon et al 1994 asrar and elhindi 2011 therefore crop nutrient and water use efficiency could be improved by using crop varieties highly compatible with arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis singh et al 2012 3 5 growth parameters results revealed that the measured growth parameters leaf area index and relative growth rates of soybean were significantly increased p 0 05 with the increased amounts of water addition fig 5 and fig 6 however it was found that plants inoculated with amf had significantly greater specific leaf area leaf area ratio and root volume when compared with the non amf inoculated plants tian et al 2013 zhu et al 2014 researchers have also elucidated that leaf water potential and shoot and root dry matters were high in water stressed amf inoculated plants than non amf inoculated plants al karaki 1998 porcel and ruiz lozano 2004 gonzalez dugo 2010 3 6 yield parameters it was observed that treatments were significantly different p 0 05 for total number of pods fig 7 total number of seeds and fresh weight and dry weight of seeds an increased productivity of amf inoculated plants in soils under drought has also been reported habibzadeh 2015 3 7 correlation analysis there was a positive correlation between water levels and percentage amf colonization in both amf added and non amf added plants further it was revealed that percentage amf colonization increases with the increase of water level and this increment was higher in amf non inoculated plants than amf inoculated plants plants with added amf were shown a positive correlation while non amf added plants were shown a negative correlation between water levels and leaf proline concentration results revealed that leaf proline concentration decreases with the increase of water levels in amf non inoculated plants where leaf proline concentration increases with the increase of water levels in amf inoculated plants 4 conclusion it can be concluded that percentage amf colonization soil moisture content and measured growth and yield parameters of the test soybean plants were increased with the amount of water addition with added amf and without added amf further it was revealed that amf could increase growth yield and drought tolerance of soybean under drought stress even under non water stressed conditions also amf added plants could increase growth and yield compared to non amf added soybean plants so the overall results suggest that the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi colonization affects the host plant positively on growth and yield thereby alleviates water stress therefore arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi biofertilization may have great potential in growing plants under drought stress this will increase the profit of the farmers by increasing the yield as well as by reducing the cost on irrigation practices further amf biofertilization helps in meeting the increasing demand for irrigation water needed for food security by sustainable use of groundwater these potentials when fully harnessed under agricultural scenario will help to sustain agriculture and boost food security globally with sustainably managed use of groundwater and surface water acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge for the financial support from rajarata university of sri lanka

12336,successful management of groundwater resources depends on the available resource and degree of groundwater fluctuations fluctuation of groundwater level is associated with both anthropogenic activities such as over pumping and natural processes primarily through reduction in recharge it is difficult to identify the causes of fluctuations only by observing short term water level records therefore the long term groundwater level records in the johannesburg region were thoroughly analysed along with the results from the cumulative rainfall departure crd method in order to understand the causes for the groundwater level fluctuations in the mining region of johannesburg the crd results confirmed that during wetter conditions groundwater levels become shallower in the absence of correlation of groundwater level variation with rainfall groundwater abstraction was assumed as a possible cause for groundwater level fluctuations graphic abstract fx1 keywords cumulative rainfall departure groundwater level fluctuation groundwater recharge johannesburg 1 introduction in regions that are characterized by climatic aridity and minimal rainfall groundwater is a primary source of water supply for various community activities complexity in the management of groundwater is related to the nature of aquifers abstraction and recharge condition that affect groundwater level and hence has direct impact on the management of the resource this paper presents a thorough review and analyses of long term groundwater level fluctuations in the johannesburg region different methods were employed to determine if the observed fluctuations in water levels were related to recharge and groundwater pumping for various uses groundwater level fluctuations are happening within the fractured aquifers composed of meta sedimentary rocks such as quartzites and dolomites where groundwater occurrence is primarily controlled by fractures and weathering zones through which groundwater flow and storage take place numerous boreholes tap fractured and weathered aquifers for domestic industrial mining and agricultural activities the development of groundwater resources from these aquifers has been regarded as very important for economic growth of the region owing to its availability at shallow depth 40 m and scarcity of surface water sources often characterized by poor water quality due to pollution from wastewater and mining wastes boreholes that tap fractured crystalline aquifers reach depths of about 300 m below ground level bgl abiye et al 2011 as a result of abstraction or recharge variations groundwater level fluctuates at variable amplitude within the aquifer owing to over a century old gold mining activity in the region groundwater has been under stress from over pumping to sustain the underground mining operation dewatering activities for the underground mining operations has decreased groundwater level drastically for a long period of time and in many instances dried up the surrounding springs schrader and winde 2015 it is possible to suspect that mine related pumping has been affecting groundwater users and groundwater dependent ecosystem in the region due to the lowering of groundwater levels on the other hand the absence of abstraction and above average rainfall conditions are expected to raise groundwater level these changes could be short term based on the seasonal variation that manifests itself with seasonal groundwater level fluctuation or it can be long term that can be observed from the water level measurement from several years of water level record long term measurement is helpful to identify any significant water level change from the mean and increase and decrease rates over decades from the initial static water level long term groundwater measurement is reliable to observe indicators responsible for the groundwater level fluctuation provided the groundwater system remains the same the long term groundwater level measurement usually requires a dedicated monitoring program for several decades which also exists in south africa in highly populated areas groundwater abstraction could overtake natural recharge and hence water supply boreholes could show regular declining of water level trend over time in the johannesburg region gradual groundwater level rise was mostly associated with recharge from spring and summer rainfalls october to february abiye et al 2011 several studies across the world indicated that most frequent groundwater level fluctuations were related to over pumping of groundwater for example in the usa the decline of the potentiometric surface of the ozark aquifer in the springfield missouri was intensified during the 1980s as a result of intensive pumping dintelmann et al 2006 large groundwater abstraction has also caused a linear to exponential drop in groundwater level and substantial aquifer dewatering in dhaka bangladesh where the pattern of water level change largely replicates the change in the rate of groundwater abstraction hoque et al 2007 due to a rapid growth of population in the indus basin pakistan there was a dramatic increase in the intensity of groundwater exploitation leading to declining of water levels and poor groundwater quality khan et al 2008 in 1970s historical pumping led to water level decline of 100 m that caused fissures and subsidence in some areas of arizona usa where the long term decline in water levels was related to the less than average precipitation and consequent reduction in recharge entering the aquifer system while continued pumping removes groundwater tillman and leake 2010 spatial distribution of trends also indicated that the strongly declining rate 0 3 m year was mainly observed in urban areas around hanoi vietnam where there was an intensive abstraction of groundwater bui et al 2012 prominent aquifers that are characterized by very significant long term groundwater level declines are mostly located in arid and semi arid zones unesco 2012 the main reasons could be due to decrease in recharge and increase in pumping as a result of high water demand the study by gibrilla et al 2018 indicated that the modelling of rainfall temperature and groundwater level in the volta river basin showed no significant trend in ten years while the forecasting analysis revealed a relatively stable to slight increasing trend siva prasad and venkateswara rao 2018 documented continuous decrease in groundwater levels in the year with minimum rainfall groundwater depletion was observed mostly in the eastern and south western part of the kandivalasa river sub basin where lots of pumping wells abstract groundwater kahsay et al 2018 studied the effect of climate change on groundwater recharge and the base flow in the tekeze sub catchment in ethiopia the results indicated a decreasing trend in annual rainfall and an increasing trend in average temperature and evapotranspiration that generated a decrease in recharge by 1 3 3 5 and base flow by 0 55 1 5 for different scenarios due to the highly industrialized nature of the johannesburg region especially manufacturing and irrigation there is high demand for water which necessitates groundwater withdrawal besides mining companies that require water for reclamation of abandoned tailings dams high water demand and deep mining activity are believed to play a significant role in lowering the groundwater level in the region sinkholes often develop in dolomites where water tables were lowered by pumping to maintain dry working condition in mines for example groundwater pumping from dolomitic aquifer for mine dewatering in the adjacent gold mines west rand area led to the formation of sinkholes larger than 50 m in diameter and deeper than 30 m within a period of 39 years foose 1967 during the field visit in the carletonville and krugersdorp areas west of johannesburg the authors have documented at least three new sinkholes developed in the dolomitic terrain that is located about 5 10 km away from the mining centres however the mine dewatering effect has not been attempted in this study using the standard precipitation index and earth models meyer 2005 concluded that the observed groundwater level fluctuation in south africa is attributed to rainfall variation due to climate change however boreholes around the witwatersrand mining areas particularly around the city of johannesburg were excluded from the model simulation it is important to note that the el nino event related to the southern oscillation enso periods could also influence rainfall occurrence over much shorter intervals 5 7 years which south africa is undergoing since 2015 owing to the large scale abstraction of groundwater in the area rigorous analyses of long term fluctuations in the groundwater levels are of significant interest to have an insight into decadal changes steady declining or increasing trends in relation to seasons could be related to recharge variation induced recharge from rivers and dams maintains groundwater level even though regular pumping is being conducted in particular the target of separating induced water level change from rainfall recharge is useful in order to manage the resource sustainably therefore this work aims to elucidate regional trends in groundwater level and to characterize different aspect of well hydrographs in relation to the causes for the fluctuation based on the monitoring boreholes around the city of johannesburg the results are believed to assist the local water users and managers to sustainably manage the groundwater resource 2 geological and hydrogeological outline the johannesburg region is underlain by the crystalline rocks of archean age the rocks are broadly classified as granitic gneiss meta sedimentary and meta volcanic rocks fig 2 the johannesburg dome which is composed of basement rocks is located between the cities of johannesburg and pretoria and has a circular outline that consists of archean greenstone remnants c 3 34 ga barton et al 1989 the archean crystalline rocks are unconformably overlain by metasedimentary rocks of 3000 ma constituted by quartzite shale and dolomite meyers et al 1990 armstrong et al 1991 robb and meyer 1995 barton et al 1999 the former conformably overlies the meta volcanic rocks basalts of the dominion group the part of the witwatersrand supergroup that lies close to the johannesburg dome falls under the west rand central rand and east rand groups the west rand group consists primarily of quartzite and shale the central and east rand groups consist of different proportion of quartzite and shale with bands of conglomerate layers fig 1 the present landscape which plays important role in the recharge process is marked by east west elongated quartzite ridges that act as a water divide between the limpopo and vaal river basins and wide plain areas that are structurally controlled from hydrogeological point of view the rocks that outcrop in the area fall under hard rock aquifers with low to moderate groundwater productivity about 2 l s except the dolomites that contain dissolution cavities with a productivity that exceeds 5 l s barnard 2000 abiye et al 2011 the most important aquifers in the region are fractured quartzites weathered basement rocks and karstic dolomites that control groundwater flow as a result of the crystalline nature of the host rock groundwater flow and recharge processes are governed by the weathered and fractured zones the maximum depth of water supply boreholes reaches about 300 m abiye et al 2011 while depths of more than 900 m were frequent in the mining areas used to monitor groundwater levels in mine shafts mengistu et al 2015 the witwatersrand basin is well known for its large scale urbanization and industrial activity with a substantial water demand which was mostly drawn from groundwater since the area is intensively mined for gold and inhabited by large number of population that draws water from crystalline aquifers for various activities most of the monitoring boreholes that are considered for this study are concentrated to the western part of the city of johannesburg fig 2 3 methodology there are more than 250 monitoring boreholes in the area out of which 41 boreholes were selected with the monitoring period that ranges from 8 to 42 years for water level record analysis among these selected monitoring boreholes a limited number of boreholes with r2 0 78 for the cumulative rainfall departure crd and rainfall amount were used to generate the crd plots these long term groundwater level monitoring data were obtained from the national groundwater database of the department of water and sanitation pretoria groundwater levels were measured at three boreholes located in the soweto area in order to verify the credibility of data obtained from the national database and the measured data was found to be in good agreement the groundwater level data indicated that the frequency of water level monitoring ranges from hourly to weekly basis and in some instances measurements were conducted once in a month statistical estimation has been performed and binary plots have been generated from the selected monitoring data the groundwater level plots that have shown spectacular increase and decrease patterns have been given further attention to scrutinize the causes the harmonic mean hm values tend towards the least elements of records shallow water levels and mitigate the impact of large outliers deep water levels the main reason for using the hm method was that the majority of groundwater fluctuations take place in a short interval at a shallow level harmonic mean is given by 1 hm n 1 x 1 1 x 2 1 xn the variables x1 x2 xn in eq 1 represent measured water level data while n stands for the number of observations eq 1 in order to assess the possibility of recharge from rainfall cumulative rainfall departure crd method was applied which accounts for the cumulative standard deviation values of the rainfall according to xu and beekman 2003 the crd method is represented by eq 2 2 c r d i j 1 j i r f j i r f a v where crd i cumulative rainfall departure at end of i th time interval mm rf j rainfall in the j th interval mm rf av average rainfall in the interval mm positive crd values represent the presence of rainfall above an average rainfall wet condition and negative crd values represent the presence of lower than average rainfall dry condition forty one boreholes with complete water level records were statistically analysed to estimate the increasing and decreasing trends once a well hydrograph was plotted sharp increase and decease points were identified and water level changes were noted against time 4 results and discussion in order to understand the link between groundwater level fluctuation and its impact on the groundwater management the groundwater level data were systematically used to generate different diagrams the plot on fig 2 portrays borehole depth versus static water level swl where two boundary conditions were identified with the less likely productive aquifer deep static water level as compared to the borehole depth and likely to be productive aquifer where semi confined aquifers could involve in high potentiometric surface in the deep boreholes the plot also portrays variability in the water level in the region where strong variation of the groundwater level is a concern for groundwater users as long as boreholes are registered by the department of water and sanitation there is no monitoring of the pumping rates therefore it is essential to include long term groundwater level fluctuations in order to avoid any dispute over groundwater use groundwater level fluctuation is an effect related to aquifer type recharge abstraction and regional circulation of groundwater in the area high rainfalls above the mean are the most prominent sources of water that reach deep into the aquifers through recharge either locally or through regional circulation as a well known gold producing regions in the world the underground mining operation in the witwatersrand basin necessitated mine dewatering that lowered groundwater level around the mining areas where most mining operation were ceased in 1980s that caused recovery of groundwater level the mean static water level values were estimated using harmonic mean eq 1 that varies between 2 5 m and 81 8 m the results further suggest that boreholes are tapping both the shallow weathered and deep fractured aquifers in some cases borehole depths reach up to 300 m while swl oscillates between 20 and 40 m suggesting aquifers are not completely depressurized this could be due to the stratification of meta sedimentary rocks that exerts hydrostatic pressure in deep fractured aquifers and causes rise in the groundwater level into a shallow depth according to the calculated values the mean rate of groundwater level fluctuation ranges from 0 37 m year to 2 30 m year table 1 predominantly two zones of groundwater level fluctuations were identified in the area with shallow level 0 10 m fig 3a and relatively deeper level 20 40 m fig 3b the long term mean data generally show that in the past three decades the trend of groundwater level in the area was increasing shallowing to the surface which could be attributed to the cessation of the underground mining activity but not necessarily an increase in rainfall based on the observed data the increase rate from the minimum to the maximum water level record ranges from 2 m year to 15 m year where such high increase could not be accounted only to recharge from rainfall unless there is regional groundwater contribution through fractures even though groundwater is continuously pumped in the area some groundwater level records show an increasing trend from the initial static water level that varies between 0 02 m year and 3 4 m year with the corresponding decrease rate ranges from 0 02 m year to 0 5 m year table 2 on the other hand by considering the maximum and minimum water levels for a given borehole the average increase in water level in the area was in the range of 1 89 m year table 1 this indicates that rainfall is actively recharging the aquifers besides the possibility of lateral groundwater flow therefore it is essential to monitor such increases to maintain groundwater provision for agricultural sector steady increase and decrease in groundwater level in relation to rainfall can be used as a benchmark to manage groundwater abstraction to avoid rapid groundwater level decrease which will necessitates augmentation process through an artificial recharge special management attention should be directed towards groundwater use for agriculture that can involve farmers in the management process todd and mays 2005 indicated that rainfall amount alone is not an accurate indicator of groundwater level change recharge is a governing factor assuming annual withdrawals are constant groundwater level changes depend also on rainfall intensity distribution and amount of runoff in this regard application of the crd method eq 2 could be relevant in order to assess the recharge possibility from rainfall the crd pattern represents variability in the available rainfall that can potentially generate recharge therefore if the groundwater level fluctuation depends on the periodic recharge from rainfall it is expected to show a pattern of fluctuation that directly simulate either water level increase or decrease trend this could imply the presence or absence of recharge from the monthly total rainfall fig 4 the plots in fig 4 shows both small and large amplitudes of fluctuations that are associated to the recharge from rainfall where increase in groundwater level shallow water level is related to an increase in crd the decline and rise phase displays a number of smaller amplitudes of water level anomalies similar to the pattern displayed by the crd particular interest in fig 4a bh ac00175 is a distinct decrease in groundwater level in 1990s which was associated with the negative crd less than average rainfall in fig 4b bh ba00051 after 1995 it was observed that there was a limited fluctuation in the groundwater level drop by about 2 m and then rises by about 4 m while crd revealed substantial increase and decrease patterns particularly after 2001 the decrease in groundwater level has been related to decrease in the crd after 1976 the groundwater level showed substantial increase which was not related to rainfall further field investigation revealed that this borehole was located downstream of three small dams used for irrigation which might have sharply increased the groundwater level through an induced recharge the water level in this borehole maintained very shallow position there after from 1976 in fig 4c bh 37794 the groundwater level records appear to be strongly controlled by rainfall with positive crd and was related to an increase in water level and vice versa in the case of pumping groundwater for irrigation rapid water level fluctuation could not follow the crd trend fig 4d bh ac00002 in general there is a time lag between crd change and swl response for the plots in 4c and 4d compared to the plots in 4a and 4b which could be due to variation in the aquifer geology and hydrogeological setting that control recharge from rainfall such groundwater level fluctuations reflect that recharge may not immediately reach water table due to poor aquifer permeability or lack of fracture inter connectivity 5 conclusions long term monitored groundwater levels and rainfall data in the johannesburg area have indicated that fluctuations of groundwater levels could have direct implication on the groundwater management practice groundwater level fluctuation pattern was found to be a combined effect of direct and induced recharge abstraction and lateral groundwater flow through regional circulation the steady change in the water level amplitude has been considered as a reasonable indicator for the long term recharge variation rainfall in the region has erratic pattern with a torrential intensive characteristic limited to summer months that might have positive impact on groundwater level rise the long term temporal groundwater level fluctuation data also suggest that large deviation in the well hydrographs cannot be explained by recharge or abstraction alone unless we assume the impact from regional groundwater circulation boreholes that are situated downstream of small dams showed substantial change in water level rise owing to the induced recharge process acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the department of water and sanitation of south africa for providing groundwater level data the early finding of this work has laid a foundation for the grechlim project peer in the upper crocodile catchment which was funded by the national academy of sciences sub grant 2000006304 usa and the department of science and technology south africa 101594 
12336,successful management of groundwater resources depends on the available resource and degree of groundwater fluctuations fluctuation of groundwater level is associated with both anthropogenic activities such as over pumping and natural processes primarily through reduction in recharge it is difficult to identify the causes of fluctuations only by observing short term water level records therefore the long term groundwater level records in the johannesburg region were thoroughly analysed along with the results from the cumulative rainfall departure crd method in order to understand the causes for the groundwater level fluctuations in the mining region of johannesburg the crd results confirmed that during wetter conditions groundwater levels become shallower in the absence of correlation of groundwater level variation with rainfall groundwater abstraction was assumed as a possible cause for groundwater level fluctuations graphic abstract fx1 keywords cumulative rainfall

irrigation which might have sharply increased the groundwater level through an induced recharge the water level in this borehole maintained very shallow position there after from 1976 in fig 4c bh 37794 the groundwater level records appear to be strongly controlled by rainfall with positive crd and was related to an increase in water level and vice versa in the case of pumping groundwater for irrigation rapid water level fluctuation could not follow the crd trend fig 4d bh ac00002 in general there is a time lag between crd change and swl response for the plots in 4c and 4d compared to the plots in 4a and 4b which could be due to variation in the aquifer geology and hydrogeological setting that control recharge from rainfall such groundwater level fluctuations reflect that recharge may not immediately reach water table due to poor aquifer permeability or lack of fracture inter connectivity 5 conclusions long term monitored groundwater levels and rainfall data in the johannesburg area have indicated that fluctuations of groundwater levels could have direct implication on the groundwater management practice groundwater level fluctuation pattern was found to be a combined effect of direct and induced recharge abstraction and lateral groundwater flow through regional circulation the steady change in the water level amplitude has been considered as a reasonable indicator for the long term recharge variation rainfall in the region has erratic pattern with a torrential intensive characteristic limited to summer months that might have positive impact on groundwater level rise the long term temporal groundwater level fluctuation data also suggest that large deviation in the well hydrographs cannot be explained by recharge or abstraction alone unless we assume the impact from regional groundwater circulation boreholes that are situated downstream of small dams showed substantial change in water level rise owing to the induced recharge process acknowledgment the authors would like to thank the department of water and sanitation of south africa for providing groundwater level data the early finding of this work has laid a foundation for the grechlim project

augmentation steps to enhance the availability of water in the chennai city quantitatively by observing its effect on the unmet demand various scenarios have been run in weap model to obtain results the data used are mostly from chennai metro water supply imd and undp reports of chennai city 2 water resource of chennai 2 1 description of study area the study area comprising of chennai city and its surroundings is located within the latitudes of 13 0 00 to 13 10 00 north and longitudes 80 08 00 to 80 20 00 east it is situated on the coromandel coast of bay of bengal fig 1 and has the longest beach in asia the marina beach the last recorded population of chennai city for the year 2011 was about 47 million census 2011 and presently it is expected to exceed 62 million hence it is a megacity it is the largest industrial center in southern india and is also known as the detroit of india krishnamurthy and desouza 2014 with several automobile factories it is 37th in the list of largest urban areas of the world with delhi being 6th and kolkata 12th demographia world urban areas and population projections 2009 since the year 1961 its population has doubled approximately from 33 6 million to 62 4 million presently but its decadal growth rate has been falling over time from 22 30 in 1971 to 11 72 in 2001 and 7 8 in the year 2011 sekar and kanchanamala 2011 table 1 presents the population decadal growth rate and areal extent of this megacity the arani korttalaiyar river basin ak basin located in north of the city and the cooum adyar river basin ca basin which is in the central part of the city fig 1 are the two main river basins of the city the ak basin has a total catchment area of 5254 km and the ca basin 1542 sq km dhayamalar 2012 none of these rivers are perennial but adyar and cooum seemingly have become perennial as they carry the entire city s sewage which then flows into the sea the approximate contribution towards city water supply from the surface reservoirs well fields desalination plant veeranam lake and krishna river is 51 1 17 19 and 11 respectively additional water requirement in future is likely to be met from the new desalination plants planned new reservoir north west of chennai and additional water release from krishna canal cmda 2004 parimalarenganayaki 2014 2 2 water supply scenario in chennai until the year 1870 the people of chennai quenched most of their water demands by shallow wells harnessing water from the aquifers that are replenishable by rainfall cmwssb 2016 construction of a diversion channel on the kosathalaiyar river korttalaiyar river in 1872 was the cornerstone of a managed water supply system designed and supervised by a civil engineer j w madeley narain 2005 the water from the diversion flowed to the red hills reservoir from where with the help of a slow gravity filtration method after treatment it was supplied to meet the city s requirements since then there has been a multitude of steps have been undertaken to manage the vast amount of water made available by rainfall the average annual rainfall in chennai was 1200 mm and it has become 1350 mm after very heavy rainfall in the year 2015 a total of four major reservoirs poondi cholavaram red hills and chemabarambakkam along with six well fields in the ak basin and two distant sources of water from kandaleru reservoir supplying krishna river water and veeranam lake were the backbone of the water supply to the chennai city two major studies by the undp in 1969 and 1987 revealed possibilities of extraction of water from the ak basin and six well fields with a potential yield of 180 mld were set up in the region cmwssb 2016 the groundwater from these wellfields is mostly used by the industry apart from supplying to the city but since the drought in the year 2000 more groundwater from the well fields are being used to meet the city s water needs ruet et al 2007 since 2007 about 180 mld of water is being supplied from the veeranam lake located at a distance of about 230 km for chennai water from this lake after treatment at vadakuthu plant which has a capacity of 180 mld is pressure pumped to the city through closed iron conduit for distribution cmwssb 2016 chemabarambakkam has been an ancient reservoir used for irrigation purpose but it came to reuse for supplying water to the city since the year 2000 due to the severe drought during that period this reservoir began to meet a large fraction of city s water needs since the year 2004 due to the rapid decline in groundwater head in the wellfields resulting into seawater intrusion the pumping of groundwater for city s water supply reduced with the rapid increase in demand more innovative and modern steps were taken such as setting up desalination plants and new reservoirs two desalination plants have been set up till date each of 100 mld capacities at minjur in 2010 under dboot design build own operate and transfer scheme and nemmeli in 2013 by cmwssb chennai s water demand and supply are a complex mesh of social economic political and scientific dimensions chennai metro water supply and sewerage board cmwssb were formed in 1978 under the cmwssb act with the cmwssb the conjunctive use of the surface and groundwater is being done in a judicial manner during the drought times of 2000 2004 the farmers in ak basin region were compelled to sell water to cmwssb which led to social unrest among farmers janakarajan 2015 and common people to avail water due to the commercialization of this basic commodity 3 weap modelling of chennai city prediction of future demand supply gap in water for the chennai megacity was carried out using water evaluation and planning weap a software developed and distributed by the stockholm environment institute sei this software can be used to model analyze and optimize water use based on the principle of demand and supply balancing sei 2015 this is capable of hosting environmental and ecological considerations too apart from demand and supply gap by accommodating ecological flow constraints thus making itself complete software for modelling water and optimizing its management as the demand for biodiversity conservation is increasing and accommodating the climate change aspects for sustainable development the weap has emerged as a very effective tool for management smith 2007 for developing policies for effectively utilizing and managing surface and groundwater resources johnson et al 1995 apart from these it is also possible to model the water quality and flow of finance through the water supply cycle 3 1 data and schematic the modelling method adopted has been carried out by balancing the demand sites and supplies by water year method in order to accommodate yearly variation in rainfall modelling with weap demands a lot of data of various kinds that are used to create the mesh or grid of demands and supplies nodes all connected by transmission links the various data can be fed in the form of either read from file in which case weap would import the data from an external source or it can be done by setting one year data for which all parameters are known and then using water year method for reference scenarios the rivers flowing in the study region were modeled using the data available in the report of the undp 1987 and the data required about the reservoirs were from the cmwssb an abstract of the data on storage flow and losses obtained from the cmwssb and used for modelling are given in table 2 table 3 gives elevation of water level and corresponding volume of storage of the reservoirs that supply water to the city the volume of water in the reservoirs was calculated from past 30 years data is given in table 4 the rainfall data was obtained from and the indian meteorological department open government data 2014 estimation of the agricultural water demand has been made by considering the type of crop its water requirement and the total area cropped as given by rajaveni et al 2015 the evaporation data for the ak basin has been obtained from the national institute of hydrology 2016 data regarding the desalination plants has been published online by cmwssb and the generating capacity of 100 mld has been used for both the presently functioning plants as documented cmwssb 2016 table 5 the data related to groundwater that are required for weap modelling have been obtained from undp 1987 the agricultural water demand in the ak basin required for this study was considered as 0 5 from canals 50 3 from tanks and 49 2 from groundwater this high usage of groundwater for agricultural practice is thus a strong competitor to the city s demand apart from the agricultural demand there is also an industrial demand of approximately 50 mld ruet et al 2007 the data related to sewage treatment plants required for the study was obtained from cmwssb and a gist of it is given in table 6 3 2 model calibration and validation weap was used to estimate the water supply and demand gap from the year 1991 calibration of the model was done from 1991 to 2008 as weap is a semi theoretical model hamlat et al 2013 calibration is particularly important and it is done using the parameter estimation pest pest is a software preinstalled with weap it operates mainly in three formats such as stream flow reservoir and catchment snowpack out of which the reservoir method was used calibration was done using stream flow data obtained from the undp 1987 validation of the model was done by comparing the modeled output with the observed data from 2009 to 2015 the model prediction was carried out until the year 2050 the scenarios such as additional desalination plants additional reservoirs and reuse of treated wastewater for supplying to the city were considered the main assumptions used in the various predictive analyses are any scenario is explicit of the other scenarios and the discussion of the results based on a comparison of the modeled special scenario to only the normal scenario the scenarios such as the new desalination plants and reservoirs were considered from the year 2020 since they are expected to be operational by that time hence the model was used to simulate their effects from the year 2020 2050by including the additional water for supply from these the average monthly rainfall calculated from the past thirty year data was used from the year 2016 2030 fig 2 shows the network of water supply and the demand centers considered in weap model 4 result and discussion weap model gives the demand of water supply unmet demand coverage of demand monthly inflow and outflow and reliability of the supply system normal scenario was run with the business as usual and the demand supply was estimated values obtained from the other scenarios were compared against the output of normal scenario the modeled water demand for water in the chennai city with growth in population for the years from 1991 to 2030 is shown in fig 3 4 1 prediction under normal scenario with business as usual prediction under normal scenario for the future water demand and supply was carried out by using annual and monthly average option the demand supply gap is increasing from the year 2016 and it approximately doubles by 2030 the demand is found to increase by 20 mld per year but the supply cannot increase beyond 800 mld due to the absence of additional sources of water fig 4 shows the demand site coverage and fig 5 shows inflow and outflow the predicted monthly demand coverage varies and it reaches nearly 85 95 in the month of october while it is around 60 70 in the months of march and april in the year 2030 the maximum value of demand coverage is obtained as 83 for the month of october and the minimum of 55 for the months february and march the demand coverage is thus decreasing by 1 15 per year the aggregate reliability of the supply is found to be 3 6 4 2 additional desalination plant scenario cmwssb after building and operating two desalination plants successfully has initiated the process of constructing a new desalination plant at pattipulam at a location just south of nimmeli desalination plant the proposed plant will initially have a treatment capacity of 200 mld and later its capacity is expected to be increased to 400 mld the hindu 2016 the demand site coverage predicted for this scenario with 200 mld capacities by the year 2020 is shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows the inflow and outflow of water with the proposed third desalination plant scenario the unmet demand for water for the chennai city though not eliminated falls approximately to half of the normal scenario the annual water demand coverage for the year 2020 ranges from 100 to 75 i e 25 of fluctuation exists unlike the 37 under the normal scenario the desalination plant provides water irrespective of the season and hence much less variation in the monthly availability of water and coverage is observed that is the output of the desalination plant is not going to be dependent on ever wagering monsoonal rainfall and climate change 4 3 additional reservoir scenario in order to overcome the growing water demand a fifth reservoir is being established by joining two lakes in kannakotai and thervoykandigai to store water from the krishna river apart from its own catchment area the storage capacity of the new reservoir will be 1 tmc and krishna river water will be supplied to it twice every year the project with a budget of rupees 330 crores has been sanctioned by the tamil nadu state government the new indian express 2013 since this project is expected to be completed by 2020 from then its effect was simulated with the weap model with this new reservoir the unmet water demand is found to fall to less than half of the value under normal scenario the coverage with the proposed new reservoir is shown in fig 8 the inflow and outflow obtained are shown in fig 9 it is found that the average annual variation in coverage of demand for the year 2020 has fallen to 10 with maximum coverage value of 100 and minimum of 90 compared to the normal scenario value for the same year the fluctuation increases to 20 for the year 2030 but it is still much more stable as the minimum coverage is 80 in contrary to 55 of the normal scenario 4 4 reusing waste water scenario although none of the rivers of the study region is perennial the adyar and cooum rivers are seemingly so as they receive huge amounts of sewage effluents that account for its perennial nature although chennai s dependency on rainfall is uncertain this river promises a regular source of water if treated and reused doing so would also lead to huge amount of environmental benefits along with catering the city s water demand it is possible to treat 60 of the city s waste water completely by increasing the capacity and efficiency of treatment pants assuming 60 of the sewage is treated and used for various suitable purposes such as cleaning washing and toilet flushing about 486 mld of water can be reused the present operational sewage treatment plants partially treat the water and supply it to the industries but if used to cater the demand of the city then it can cater all the unmet water demand for the city though it is complicated and expensive a process to treat the water completely if undertaken it can be a serious source of water for uses other than drinking and cooking it is also possible to treat the water effectively and let it into the two rivers of the city desilting and cleaning the adyar and cooum rivers before this will lead to the groundwater recharge of this treated water the same can be pumped at suitable distances by taking into advantage of river bank filtration technology which can result in additional natural treatment of water and polishing saph 2016 hence assuming about 60 water supplied as on today is reused a water reuse scenario was studied using weap fig 10 shows the coverage obtained by reusing water fig 11 shows the inflow and outflow as obtained from weap model the annual average fluctuation in coverage is almost eliminated for the year 2020 and is merely 10 for the year 2030 which is one third the value of the coverage predicted under the normal scenario the demand supply gap is illustrated in fig 12 which demonstrates the success of the various augmentation steps in meeting the water demand in near future demand the reliability of the city s water supply is also increased to 30 when compared to the normal scenario which is much more than the values of 10 and 19 for the desalination and the additional reservoir although the new reservoir scenario is financially more feasible as it needs very negligible energy input for regular operation it is subjective to natures will in the form of the rainfall and inter state understanding unlike the desalination plants or the treated water reuse are independent and self reliant water sources the desalination and sewage treatment however come with an additional financial burden but with tremendous additional reliability 4 5 new desalination plant and new reservoir together although the reuse of wastewater promises a ready source of water for the chennai megacity it requires proper planning and implementation the new desalination plants and reservoir are already approved projects to study their effectiveness the weap model under the two scenarios has been run until the year 2050 the inflow and outflow curve is shown in fig 13 the coverage is enhanced and the maximum limit reached annually is 100 till the year 2050 but the maximum to minimum value variation has been increasing since the year 2030 by 1 5 annually from zero in the year 2030 as shown in fig 14 the projected reliability of various measures to improve the water supply by way of reducing the supply demand gap was found to increase to 35 as shown in fig 15 5 conclusion weap modelling was carried out to predict and quantify water management strategies under different scenarios for the chennai megacity the scenarios considered include business as usual new desalination plant new reservoir and reusing wastewater independently and finally the outcome of operating all the scenarios together it is inferred that out of all the already undertaken augmentation steps the new reservoir is more promising than the desalination plant also with the reuse of water the future demand supply gap can be highly overawed with the highest reliability of 30 when compared to all other scenarios of 10 for desalination plant and 19 for new reservoir also with the implementation of new desalination plant alone the water availability will increase by 25 with the new reservoir alone by 38 and with the proposed reuse of water alone by 50 the mix of the three augmentation steps of the sources of water for chennai city therefore promise a better water availability in the near future with these three augmentation options in place the water availability will be more than the requirement at least up to the year 2050 beyond this period it is necessary to look for new options to increase the water availability and meet the growing demand of water due to rapid urbanization water planning thus is a pivotal element of effectiveness and prosperity of any city within the coming future the potential of this element shall see a greater weight with a better planning system the cities shall become more resilient and robust in overcoming its present problems and developing effective measures in tackling any of such issues thus weap was effectively used to identify better options for water management in this megacity acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr

for biodiversity conservation is increasing and accommodating the climate change aspects for sustainable development the weap has emerged as a very effective tool for management smith 2007 for developing policies for effectively utilizing and managing surface and groundwater resources johnson et al 1995 apart from these it is also possible to model the water quality and flow of finance through the water supply cycle 3 1 data and schematic the modelling method adopted has been carried out by balancing the demand sites and supplies by water year method in order to accommodate yearly variation in rainfall modelling with weap demands a lot of data of various kinds that are used to create the mesh or grid of demands and supplies nodes all connected by transmission links the various data can be fed in the form of either read from file in which case weap would import the data from an external source or it can be done by setting one year data for which all parameters are known and then using water year method for reference scenarios the rivers flowing in the study region were modeled using the data available in the report of the undp 1987 and the data required about the reservoirs were from the cmwssb an abstract of the data on storage flow and losses obtained from the cmwssb and used for modelling are given in table 2 table 3 gives elevation of water level and corresponding volume of storage of the reservoirs that supply water to the city the volume of water in the reservoirs was calculated from past 30 years data is given in table 4 the rainfall data was obtained from and the indian meteorological department open government data 2014 estimation of the agricultural water demand has been made by considering the type of crop its water requirement and the total area cropped as given by rajaveni et al 2015 the evaporation data for the ak basin has been obtained from the national institute of hydrology 2016 data regarding the desalination plants has been published online by cmwssb and the generating capacity of 100 mld has been used for both the presently functioning plants as documented cmwssb 2016 table 5 the data related to groundwater that are required for weap modelling have been obtained from undp 1987 the agricultural water demand in the ak basin required for this study was considered as 0 5 from canals 50 3 from tanks and 49 2 from groundwater this high usage of groundwater for agricultural practice is thus a strong competitor to the city s demand apart from the agricultural demand there is also an industrial demand of approximately 50 mld ruet et al 2007 the data related to sewage treatment plants required for the study was obtained from cmwssb and a gist of it is given in table 6 3 2 model calibration and validation weap was used to estimate the water supply and demand gap from the year 1991 calibration of the model was done from 1991 to 2008 as weap is a semi theoretical model hamlat et al 2013 calibration is particularly important and it is done using the parameter estimation pest pest is a software preinstalled with weap it operates mainly in three formats such as stream flow reservoir and catchment snowpack out of which the reservoir method was used calibration was done using stream flow data obtained from the undp 1987 validation of the model was done by comparing the modeled output with the observed data from 2009 to 2015 the model prediction was carried out until the year 2050 the scenarios such as additional desalination plants additional reservoirs and reuse of treated wastewater for supplying to the city were considered the main assumptions used in the various predictive analyses are any scenario is explicit of the other scenarios and the discussion of the results based on a comparison of the modeled special scenario to only the normal scenario the scenarios such as the new desalination plants and reservoirs were considered from the year 2020 since they are expected to be operational by that time hence the model was used to simulate their effects from the year 2020 2050by including the additional water for supply from these the average monthly rainfall calculated from the past thirty year data was used from the year 2016 2030 fig 2 shows the network of water supply and the demand centers considered in weap model 4 result and discussion weap model gives the demand of water supply unmet demand coverage of demand monthly inflow and outflow and reliability of the supply system normal scenario was run with the business as usual and the demand supply was estimated values obtained from the other scenarios were compared against the output of normal scenario the modeled water demand for water in the chennai city with growth in population for the years from 1991 to 2030 is shown in fig 3 4 1 prediction under normal scenario with business as usual prediction under normal scenario for the future water demand and supply was carried out by using annual and monthly average option the demand supply gap is increasing from the year 2016 and it approximately doubles by 2030 the demand is found to increase by 20 mld per year but the supply cannot increase beyond 800 mld due to the absence of additional sources of water fig 4 shows the demand site coverage and fig 5 shows inflow and outflow the predicted monthly demand coverage varies and it reaches nearly 85 95 in the month of october while it is around 60 70 in the months of march and april in the year 2030 the maximum value of demand coverage is obtained as 83 for the month of october and the minimum of 55 for the months february and march the demand coverage is thus decreasing by 1 15 per year the aggregate reliability of the supply is found to be 3 6 4 2 additional desalination plant scenario cmwssb after building and operating two desalination plants successfully has initiated the process of constructing a new desalination plant at pattipulam at a location just south of nimmeli desalination plant the proposed plant will initially have a treatment capacity of 200 mld and later its capacity is expected to be increased to 400 mld the hindu 2016 the demand site coverage predicted for this scenario with 200 mld capacities by the year 2020 is shown in fig 6 fig 7 shows the inflow and outflow of water with the proposed third desalination plant scenario the unmet demand for water for the chennai city though not eliminated falls approximately to half of the normal scenario the annual water demand coverage for the year 2020 ranges from 100 to 75 i e 25 of fluctuation exists unlike the 37 under the normal scenario the desalination plant provides water irrespective of the season and hence much less variation in the monthly availability of water and coverage is observed that is the output of the desalination plant is not going to be dependent on ever wagering monsoonal rainfall and climate change 4 3 additional reservoir scenario in order to overcome the growing water demand a fifth reservoir is being established by joining two lakes in kannakotai and thervoykandigai to store water from the krishna river apart from its own catchment area the storage capacity of the new reservoir will be 1 tmc and krishna river water will be supplied to it twice every year the project with a budget of rupees 330 crores has been sanctioned by the tamil nadu state government the new indian express 2013 since this project is expected to be completed by 2020 from then its effect was simulated with the weap model with this new reservoir the unmet water demand is found to fall to less than half of the value under normal scenario the coverage with the proposed new reservoir is shown in fig 8 the inflow and outflow obtained are shown in fig 9 it is found that the average annual variation in coverage of demand for the year 2020 has fallen to 10 with maximum coverage value of 100 and minimum of 90 compared to the normal scenario value for the same year the fluctuation increases to 20 for the year 2030 but it is still much more stable as the minimum coverage is 80 in contrary to 55 of the normal scenario 4 4 reusing waste water scenario although none of the rivers of the study region is perennial the adyar and cooum rivers are seemingly so as they receive huge amounts of sewage effluents that account for its perennial nature although chennai s dependency on rainfall is uncertain this river promises a regular source of water if treated and reused doing so would also lead to huge amount of environmental benefits along with catering the city s water demand it is possible to treat 60 of the city s waste water completely by increasing the capacity and efficiency of treatment pants assuming 60 of the sewage is treated and used for various suitable purposes such as cleaning washing and toilet flushing about 486 mld of water can be reused the present operational sewage treatment plants partially treat the water and supply it to the industries but if used to cater the demand of the city then it can cater all the unmet water demand for the city though it is complicated and expensive a process to treat the water completely if undertaken it can be a serious source of water for uses other than drinking and cooking it is also possible to treat the water effectively and let it into the two rivers of the city desilting and cleaning the adyar and cooum rivers before this will lead to the groundwater recharge of this treated water the same can be pumped at suitable distances by taking into advantage of river bank filtration technology which can result in additional natural treatment of water and polishing saph 2016 hence assuming about 60 water supplied as on today is reused a water reuse scenario was studied using weap fig 10 shows the coverage obtained by reusing water fig 11 shows the inflow and outflow as obtained from weap model the annual average fluctuation in coverage is almost eliminated for the year 2020 and is merely 10 for the year 2030 which is one third the value of the coverage predicted under the normal scenario the demand supply gap is illustrated in fig 12 which demonstrates the success of the various augmentation steps in meeting the water demand in near future demand the reliability of the city s water supply is also increased to 30 when compared to the normal scenario which is much more than the values of 10 and 19 for the desalination and the additional reservoir although the new reservoir scenario is financially more feasible as it needs very negligible energy input for regular operation it is subjective to natures will in the form of the rainfall and inter state understanding unlike the desalination plants or the treated water reuse are independent and self reliant water sources the desalination and sewage treatment however come with an additional financial burden but with tremendous additional reliability 4 5 new desalination plant and new reservoir together although the reuse of wastewater promises a ready source of water for the chennai megacity it requires proper planning and implementation the new desalination plants and reservoir are already approved projects to study their effectiveness the weap model under the two scenarios has been run until the year 2050 the inflow and outflow curve is shown in fig 13 the coverage is enhanced and the maximum limit reached annually is 100 till the year 2050 but the maximum to minimum value variation has been increasing since the year 2030 by 1 5 annually from zero in the year 2030 as shown in fig 14 the projected reliability of various measures to improve the water supply by way of reducing the supply demand gap was found to increase to 35 as shown in fig 15 5 conclusion weap modelling was carried out to predict and quantify water management strategies under different scenarios for the chennai megacity the scenarios considered include business as usual new desalination plant new reservoir and reusing wastewater independently and finally the outcome of operating all the scenarios together it is inferred that out of all the already undertaken augmentation steps the new reservoir is more promising than the desalination plant also with the reuse of water the future demand supply gap can be highly overawed with the highest reliability of 30 when compared to all other scenarios of 10 for desalination plant and 19 for new reservoir also with the implementation of new desalination plant alone the water availability will increase by 25 with the new reservoir alone by 38 and with the proposed reuse of water alone by 50 the mix of the three augmentation steps of the sources of water for chennai city therefore promise a better water availability in the near future with these three augmentation options in place the water availability will be more than the requirement at least up to the year 2050 beyond this period it is necessary to look for new options to increase the water availability and meet the growing demand of water due to rapid urbanization water planning thus is a pivotal element of effectiveness and prosperity of any city within the coming future the potential of this element shall see a greater weight with a better planning system the cities shall become more resilient and robust in overcoming its present problems and developing effective measures in tackling any of such issues thus weap was effectively used to identify better options for water management in this megacity acknowledgements the authors would like to thank dr

ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes are recognized by the presence of bedrock in the surface cenotes sinkholes or caves the rainwater generally percolates through the bedrock contact to the karst aquifer water in the karst aquifer moves through sinkholes failures and fractures on the terrain subterranean caves and conduits that act as main flow paths of water steinich and marín 1996a steinich et al 1996b steinich et al 1997 gunn 2004 the karstic soils can act as a point of introduction of pollutants to the groundwater system wang et al 2013 the management of karst aquifer should focus on protecting the integrity of the groundwater from anthropogenic activities on the surface due to the very high filtration and vulnerability of the terrain pulido bosch 1999 stokes et al 2007 in mexico soil samples from the south central and north regions have shown that ocp are used and can act as a potential source of contamination on site or be transported when volatilized wong et al 2009 2010 the use of soil for productive systems is mainly restricted to the agriculture in the south and livestock on the northeast of yucatan however livestock breeding over the decades have led to the high levels of deforestation and generalized land degradation in the state fig 1 1 1 regulation the ocp included in the rotterdam convention 2010 were classified as highly dangerous to human health and the environment the main objective of this convention was to generate an international council worldwide on the commercialization and manipulation of these pesticides in the convention specifically in article 5 there is reference to the procedures for banned or severely restricted chemicals in order to adopt a final regulatory action in terms of notifying the secretariat in writing of such action fao and pnuma to prohibit and or severely restrict chemicals that affect the environment and human health annex iii is included in the rotterdam convention are the chemicals subject to the procedure of prior informed consent rotterdam convention 2015 table 1 stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants is an international environmental treaty that aims to eliminate or restrict to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants pops the chemicals targeted by the stockholm convention are listed in the table 2 parties must take measures to restrict the production and use of the chemicals listed although mexico is part of the rotterdam agreement 2010 and stockholm convention 2009 does not comply with these international regulations in mexico there are official norms e g nom 127 ssa1 1994 environmental health water for human use and consumption permissible limits of quality and treatments to which the water must undergo for its purification ssa 2000 that regulate the maximum permitted limits of pesticides and their residues in drinking water table 3 unfortunately although there are laws and regulations for the use and importation of organochlorine pesticides in mexico they are not applied although mexico is part of the rotterdam agreement 2010 and stockholm convention 2009 it does not comply with this international regulation and recommendations for organochlorine pesticides in mexico there is a list of pesticides registered for their use in the the federal commission for the protection against sanitary risk cofepris that includes organochlorines pesticides this commission is an organ of the health secretary of mexico with the objective of protection of the health risks cofepris 2010 however this goal is not fulfilled due to the use of organochlorine pesticides in practice and based on the evidence of their occurrence concentrations in water and their bioaccumulation in yucatan mexico 1 2 use of agrochemicals in yucatan pesticides frequently used by farmers in the municipalities of the ring of sinkholes are shown in table 4 the objective of this article is to review and show the impacts of banned ocp in human health under conditions of high fragility such as karst groundwater in yucatan mexico 2 method this work is a revision of studies on ocp polluted karst aquifer in yucatan mexico analysis of these studies was performed based on vulnerability and risks of ocp to the public health human bioccumulation management and regulation 3 places of study these studies were developed in 32 municipalities of yucatan state of high poverty in mexico conapo 2010 the water study was in an important fractured karstic area called the ring of sinkholes in 11 municipalities fig 2 which is a regional structure for groundwater recharge and water conduction composed by 99 sinkholes the ring of sinkholes surrounds the east west and south of merida the capital city of yucatan perry et al 1995 rohrer patrick 2012 in yucatan the only source of fresh water is the karstic aquifer through wells and the sinkholes schmitter soto et al 2002 and the ring of sinkholes is an important area for geographical distribution of groundwater according to rohrer patrick 2012 there are over 4000 sinkholes in yucatan the karstic characteristics in yucatan favor pollutant entry to the aquifer marin and perry 1994 smart et al 2006 metcalfe et al 2011 and studies on processes of contaminant transport are necessary in this region the study of ocp in blood of maya women with cervico uterine cancer was realized in the 18 municipalities of highest mortality for cervix uterine cancer this area include the agriculture livestock and metropolitan area of yucatan polanco rodríguez ángel et al 2017a fig 3 the study of levels of pesticides in breast milk was realized in three municipalities in the agriculture metropolitan and coastal area polanco rodríguez ángel et al 2017b fig 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 levels of ocp in water in the water area of the ring of sinkholes was detected highest levels of ocp 3 2 ppm of endrin 10 86 ppm of δ lindane 5 23 ppm of γ lindane 6 53 ppm of α lindane 13 61 and 12 54 ppm of heptachlore polanco rodríguez et al 2015a at same time to know the point of view of the population about the use and management of agrochemicals and their impact in the environment and public health a qualitative study about the risk perception of the population on agrochemicals management was carried out in the area polanco rodríguez et al 2015b the level of pesticide contamination in the karst aquifer and their bioaccumulation in the humans a relationship between the natural and social vulnerabilities in the pollution process and their high impact on the public health should be considered a multifactorial complex problem a similar karst area in southern italy shown that agricultural activities permitted in the area could increase the high risk to the aquifer pollution ducci et al 2008 the high density of sinkholes which are open air water bodies that are highly susceptible to pollution because they act as traps for rains and surface runoffs rich in pesticides due the productive activities there is a close relationship between the pollution of sinkholes and the groundwater pollution wang et al 2013 karstic aquifers are highly heterogenic systems due to the local development of their conduction systems which require research efforts to describe their routes of flow and discharge points steinich and marín 1996a 1997 oehlmann et al 2013 the ring of sinkholes of yucatan is a complex geohydrological net that acts as a dumper and conduction of water enabling the transportation of pesticides perry et al 1995 in this sense an unappropriate use and management of agrochemical in agricultural area can severely affect the aquifer and the human health miller 1996 miller and sharpe 1998 the evidence show a high degradation of the water quality mainly in the livestock area with high levels of 13 61 and 12 54 ppm of heptachlor in the municipality of dzilam gonzalez at north east of yucatan discharge zone of the ring of sinkholes to the gulf of mexico in celestun in the north west of yucatan discharge zone to gulf of mexico with levels of 3 2 ppm of endrin 4 1 ppm of ɗ lindane and in tecoh recharge zone at centre of the ring of sinkholes of 5 23 ppm of γ lindane 6 53 ppm of α lindane polanco rodríguez et al 2015a this is a problem for the water conservation in the ring of sinkholes because it is a declared natural area for protection dof 2013 in the municipality of tecoh in the centre of the recharge zone of the ring of sinkholes there are 128 cenotes and 724 agricultural production units distributed over the area of about 4000 ha in the other hand this recharge zone of the ring of sinkholes can receive pollutants from the main agriculture area in the southern area of yucatan and can affect the underground water flow from the south west to north east during the dry season in the study the highest levels of pesticides in water were in dry period by concentration of pollutants in a scarce water flow polanco rodríguez et al 2015a the municipality of dzilam gonzalez one of the discharge zone is located in the main livestock breeding region of the yucatan peninsula covering 440 000 ha of grasslands large areas of pasture for livestock that have replaced indigenous tropical forest since the 1940s inegi 2013 one of the vulnerabilities of the groundwater comes from the intensified deforestation in yucatan in the last 24 years 30 loss of vegetation with highest impact at northeast of yucatan durán 2010 deforestation by land use has promoted soil erosion and facilitated infiltration of ocp to the groundwater rashid 2011 agricultural activities have potential impacts on soil and water in karst regions including deforestation changes in grazing intensity and application of fertilizers pesticides and storage of farm wastes with a particular focus on water quality including suspended sediment nitrate pesticides and microbial pathogens coxon 2011 the environmental responses to reforestation increases a range of environmental benefits areas with shallow aquifers can be reforested to reduce water pollution reforestation should be used to build forest networks surrounded by low intensity land use and that provide links within regions and between biomes cunningham et al 2015 other vulnerability in this livestock area comes from the highest density of sinkholes worsening the vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination from the intensive farming and agricultural activities in the area perry et al 2002 celestun the other geographical discharge zone of the ring to the gulf of mexico in the north west with high levels of heptachlore and lindane receives pollutants in situ and from the municipalities that are close to the southern part of the ring of sinkholes the main agricultural area there are three areas with highest pollution with organochlorine pesticides in the discharge zone dzilam gonzalez and celestun at coast of gulf of mexico and in the recharge zone at centre of the ring of sinkholes mainly the municipality of tecoh fig 5 furthermore to the north east of the ring of sinkholes in the livestock area there is a large geographical zone of highest permeability that is vulnerable to pollution due to geological failures and strata fracturing as shown in the geologic map of failures and fractures inegi 2010 fig 6 these geological failures and fractures are formed by the dissolving action of the carbonic gas within the rocks of karstic hydric systems sarh 1988 and they facilitate the transport of pollutants into the underground aquifer bauer et al 2011 moreover in this livestock activity area there is the highest concentration of sinkholes in yucatan fig 7 another factor of pesticide groundwater pollution is the possibility of non point source pollution coming from the south of yucatan main agricultural area dragging the water pollutants traversing the ring of sinkholes spreading them to the north east and west and eventually reaching to the gulf of mexico perry et al 1993 1995 leonard 1990 albanis et al 1998 this pattern of the flow dynamic in the study area may explain the presence of particular spots of pollution in the recharge and discharge areas of the ring of the sinkholes it is relevant that the regional and local flow of the groundwater can be leakage to sinkholes wang et al 2001 groundwater are interconnected and can transport pollutants from diverse source of contamination that can be of high impact to the human health in this regard it has been stated that 30 of the population from yucatan drink water from polluted wells and sinkholes polanco rodríguez et al 2015b the water pollution is a potential risk for public health in maya communities since the 30 of inhabitants still drink polluted water from the wells and sinkholes the communities have a very low risk perception about the impact of pesticides on the human health and the environment and therefore health promotion programs and official support are needed torresan 2011 polanco rodríguez et al 2015b this scenery in mexico is similar to the indian pollution by pesticides and their impact on the public health mathur 2008 thakur 2008 abhilash and singh 2009 as well as in tunisia when users management and regulatory bodies are dispersed mekki et al 2017 4 2 bioaccumulation of ocp diverse studies of epidemiology occupational have shown associations between agriculture and pesticides management with endometrial cancer in jaipur india mathur et al 2008 breast and uterus cancers mortality in punjab india thakur et al 2008 there are very few investigations of pesticide levels in blood and maternal milk in mexico a study in veracruz mexico showed that concentrations of ddt and its metabolites were larger in women with breast cancer than in a control group waliszewski et al 2003 another study detected high levels of ocp in breast milk in chelem yucatan mexico in the cost area rodas ortiz et al 2008 the role of pesticides as endochrine disruptors ecd have related with cancers in the reproductive system with impacts on the public health ecd include a group of molecules of organochlorine pesticides epidemiologic studies in a country or region are crucial to alert the health systems and researchers about the geographical trends and prevalent spatial distribution of disease carrying agents diamanti kandarakis et al 2009 the international agency for research on cancer iarc are working on diverse environmental factors that can increase the risk of human cancer these include chemicals complex mixtures occupational exposures physical agents biological agents and lifestyle factors interdisciplinary working groups of expert scientists review the published studies and evaluate the weight of the evidence that an agent can increase the risk of cancer iarc 2017 the high level of pesticides in water at livestock area are similar for the results of high level of pesticides in blood of women with cervical uterine cancer from the same area livestock area of yucatan that showed concentrations of 7 352 ppm of endosulfan i 3 695 ppm of aldrin 2 336 ppm of 4 4 dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane 1 434 ppm of heptachlore in blood polanco rodríguez angel et al 2017a 2017b maya women with cancer showed a 72 2 of detection for ocp in blood the highest frequency of detection of pesticides were dieldrin at 66 6 and endosulfan i at 44 4 in agricultural and metropolitan area heptachlore at 38 8 ɗ hch 4 4 ddd 4 4 dde at 33 3 in the livestock area in the metropolitan area kanasin and progreso had high frequency of detection for dieldrin and endrin hch heptachlore endosulfan i ii endosulfan sulphate ddt and their metabolites polanco rodríguez angel et al 2017a the chronic exposure of maya women by long periods to ocp can be related to these high levels of detection of pesticides in blood the epidemiologic scientific literature actually are related with diverse cancer in the reproduction system of human being because ocp are endocrine disruptors interfering with the synthesis transport storage binding and activity of natural hormones this factors can be associated with the cancer risk falconer et al 2006 mustafa 2010 mnif et al 2011 eea 2010 on the other hand the high concentrations of pesticides in water at recharge area of the ring of sinkholes can be related with highest levels detected of 18 436 ppm of heptachlore epoxide in breast milk in yucatan in the municipality of kanasin near to the recharge zone of ring of sinkholes these results indicate that children are being feed of breast milk with high levels of ocp which may have an impact on central nervous system and cognitive development of child this problem also need a monitoring system in the official health system ocp studies on pollution that was conducted in yucatan mexico reported high levels of concentration of these pesticides in the karstic aquifer high bioaccumulation in the blood of women with cervix uterine cancer and high levels of ocp in breast milk samples from healthy women which shows that there is a generalization of bioaccumulation of ocp in the human due to the social scenario and natural vulnerabilities in the karstic ecosystem of high fragility to the pollution the use of ocp in yucatan together with the natural factor and their social condition have contributed to to the chronic exposure of these pesticides in the population with high impacts on the natural ecosystem and public health problems the social factors and the natural vulnerability of the karst aquifer could explain why in the last 20 years the state of yucatan has high rates to diverse cancer in women and men as well as increases in birth defects fetal and

12338,the anthropogenic activities in karst aquifer increase the vulnerability for groundwater pollution by organochlorine pesticides ocp recent research have been published about high level of ocp in water as well as the bioaccumulation of ocp in blood of women with cancer and in breast milk the use of banned ocp such as ddt heptachlore lindane endosulfan aldrin are the main sources of pollution of groundwater in yucatan mexico in yucatan the water pollution is increased by 30 of deforestation large zones of geological fracturing with high permeability and high density of sinkholes cenotes in the karst soils diverse studies indicate yucatan as a zone with high impact of water pollution 3 2 ppm of endrin 10 86 ppm of δ lindane 5 23 ppm of γ lindane 6 53 ppm of α lindane 13 61 and 12 54 ppm

ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes are recognized by the presence of bedrock in the surface cenotes sinkholes or caves the rainwater generally percolates through the bedrock contact to the karst aquifer water in the karst aquifer moves through sinkholes failures and fractures on the terrain subterranean caves and conduits that act as main flow paths of water steinich and marín 1996a steinich et al 1996b steinich et al 1997 gunn 2004 the karstic soils can act as a point of introduction of pollutants to the groundwater system wang et al 2013 the management of karst aquifer should focus on protecting the integrity of the groundwater from anthropogenic activities on the surface due to the very high filtration and vulnerability of the terrain pulido bosch 1999 stokes et al 2007 in mexico soil samples from the south central and north regions have shown that ocp are used and can act as a potential source of contamination on site or be transported when volatilized wong et al 2009 2010 the use of soil for productive systems is mainly restricted to the agriculture in the south and livestock on the northeast of yucatan however livestock breeding over the decades have led to the high levels of deforestation and generalized land degradation in the state fig 1 1 1 regulation the ocp included in the rotterdam convention 2010 were classified as highly dangerous to human health and the environment the main objective of this convention was to generate an international council worldwide on the commercialization and manipulation of these pesticides in the convention specifically in article 5 there is reference to the procedures for banned or severely restricted chemicals in order to adopt a final regulatory action in terms of notifying the secretariat in writing of such action fao and pnuma to prohibit and or severely restrict chemicals that affect the environment and human health annex iii is included in the rotterdam convention are the chemicals subject to the procedure of prior informed consent rotterdam convention 2015 table 1 stockholm convention on persistent organic pollutants is an international environmental treaty that aims to eliminate or restrict to eliminate or restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants pops the chemicals targeted by the stockholm convention are listed in the table 2 parties must take measures to restrict the production and use of the chemicals listed although mexico is part of the rotterdam agreement 2010 and stockholm convention 2009 does not comply with these international regulations in mexico there are official norms e g nom 127 ssa1 1994 environmental health water for human use and consumption permissible limits of quality and treatments to which the water must undergo for its purification ssa 2000 that regulate the maximum permitted limits of pesticides and their residues in drinking water table 3 unfortunately although there are laws and regulations for the use and importation of organochlorine pesticides in mexico they are not applied although mexico is part of the rotterdam agreement 2010 and stockholm convention 2009 it does not comply with this international regulation and recommendations for organochlorine pesticides in mexico there is a list of pesticides registered for their use in the the federal commission for the protection against sanitary risk cofepris that includes organochlorines pesticides this commission is an organ of the health secretary of mexico with the objective of protection of the health risks cofepris 2010 however this goal is not fulfilled due to the use of organochlorine pesticides in practice and based on the evidence of their occurrence concentrations in water and their bioaccumulation in yucatan mexico 1 2 use of agrochemicals in yucatan pesticides frequently used by farmers in the municipalities of the ring of sinkholes are shown in table 4 the objective of this article is to review and show the impacts of banned ocp in human health under conditions of high fragility such as karst groundwater in yucatan mexico 2 method this work is a revision of studies on ocp polluted karst aquifer in yucatan mexico analysis of these studies was performed based on vulnerability and risks of ocp to the public health human bioccumulation management and regulation 3 places of study these studies were developed in 32 municipalities of yucatan state of high poverty in mexico conapo 2010 the water study was in an important fractured karstic area called the ring of sinkholes in 11 municipalities fig 2 which is a regional structure for groundwater recharge and water conduction composed by 99 sinkholes the ring of sinkholes surrounds the east west and south of merida the capital city of yucatan perry et al 1995 rohrer patrick 2012 in yucatan the only source of fresh water is the karstic aquifer through wells and the sinkholes schmitter soto et al 2002 and the ring of sinkholes is an important area for geographical distribution of groundwater according to rohrer patrick 2012 there are over 4000 sinkholes in yucatan the karstic characteristics in yucatan favor pollutant entry to the aquifer marin and perry 1994 smart et al 2006 metcalfe et al 2011 and studies on processes of contaminant transport are necessary in this region the study of ocp in blood of maya women with cervico uterine cancer was realized in the 18 municipalities of highest mortality for cervix uterine cancer this area include the agriculture livestock and metropolitan area of yucatan polanco rodríguez ángel et al 2017a fig 3 the study of levels of pesticides in breast milk was realized in three municipalities in the agriculture metropolitan and coastal area polanco rodríguez ángel et al 2017b fig 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 levels of ocp in water in the water area of the ring of sinkholes was detected highest levels of ocp 3 2 ppm of endrin 10 86 ppm of δ lindane 5 23 ppm of γ lindane 6 53 ppm of α lindane 13 61 and 12 54 ppm of heptachlore polanco rodríguez et al 2015a at same time to know the point of view of the population about the use and management of agrochemicals and their impact in the environment and public health a qualitative study about the risk perception of the population on agrochemicals management was carried out in the area polanco rodríguez et al 2015b the level of pesticide contamination in the karst aquifer and their bioaccumulation in the humans a relationship between the natural and social vulnerabilities in the pollution process and their high impact on the public health should be considered a multifactorial complex problem a similar karst area in southern italy shown that agricultural activities permitted in the area could increase the high risk to the aquifer pollution ducci et al 2008 the high density of sinkholes which are open air water bodies that are highly susceptible to pollution because they act as traps for rains and surface runoffs rich in pesticides due the productive activities there is a close relationship between the pollution of sinkholes and the groundwater pollution wang et al 2013 karstic aquifers are highly heterogenic systems due to the local development of their conduction systems which require research efforts to describe their routes of flow and discharge points steinich and marín 1996a 1997 oehlmann et al 2013 the ring of sinkholes of yucatan is a complex geohydrological net that acts as a dumper and conduction of water enabling the transportation of pesticides perry et al 1995 in this sense an unappropriate use and management of agrochemical in agricultural area can severely affect the aquifer and the human health miller 1996 miller and sharpe 1998 the evidence show a high degradation of the water quality mainly in the livestock area with high levels of 13 61 and 12 54 ppm of heptachlor in the municipality of dzilam gonzalez at north east of yucatan discharge zone of the ring of sinkholes to the gulf of mexico in celestun in the north west of yucatan discharge zone to gulf of mexico with levels of 3 2 ppm of endrin 4 1 ppm of ɗ lindane and in tecoh recharge zone at centre of the ring of sinkholes of 5 23 ppm of γ lindane 6 53 ppm of α lindane polanco rodríguez et al 2015a this is a problem for the water conservation in the ring of sinkholes because it is a declared natural area for protection dof 2013 in the municipality of tecoh in the centre of the recharge zone of the ring of sinkholes there are 128 cenotes and 724 agricultural production units distributed over the area of about 4000 ha in the other hand this recharge zone of the ring of sinkholes can receive pollutants from the main agriculture area in the southern area of yucatan and can affect the underground water flow from the south west to north east during the dry season in the study the highest levels of pesticides in water were in dry period by concentration of pollutants in a scarce water flow polanco rodríguez et al 2015a the municipality of dzilam gonzalez one of the discharge zone is located in the main livestock breeding region of the yucatan peninsula covering 440 000 ha of grasslands large areas of pasture for livestock that have replaced indigenous tropical forest since the 1940s inegi 2013 one of the vulnerabilities of the groundwater comes from the intensified deforestation in yucatan in the last 24 years 30 loss of vegetation with highest impact at northeast of yucatan durán 2010 deforestation by land use has promoted soil erosion and facilitated infiltration of ocp to the groundwater rashid 2011 agricultural activities have potential impacts on soil and water in karst regions including deforestation changes in grazing intensity and application of fertilizers pesticides and storage of farm wastes with a particular focus on water quality including suspended sediment nitrate pesticides and microbial pathogens coxon 2011 the environmental responses to reforestation increases a range of environmental benefits areas with shallow aquifers can be reforested to reduce water pollution reforestation should be used to build forest networks surrounded by low intensity land use and that provide links within regions and between biomes cunningham et al 2015 other vulnerability in this livestock area comes from the highest density of sinkholes worsening the vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination from the intensive farming and agricultural activities in the area perry et al 2002 celestun the other geographical discharge zone of the ring to the gulf of mexico in the north west with high levels of heptachlore and lindane receives pollutants in situ and from the municipalities that are close to the southern part of the ring of sinkholes the main agricultural area there are three areas with highest pollution with organochlorine pesticides in the discharge zone dzilam gonzalez and celestun at coast of gulf of mexico and in the recharge zone at centre of the ring of sinkholes mainly the municipality of tecoh fig 5 furthermore to the north east of the ring of sinkholes in the livestock area there is a large geographical zone of highest permeability that is vulnerable to pollution due to geological failures and strata fracturing as shown in the geologic map of failures and fractures inegi 2010 fig 6 these geological failures and fractures are formed by the dissolving action of the carbonic gas within the rocks of karstic hydric systems sarh 1988 and they facilitate the transport of pollutants into the underground aquifer bauer et al 2011 moreover in this livestock activity area there is the highest concentration of sinkholes in yucatan fig 7 another factor of pesticide groundwater pollution is the possibility of non point source pollution coming from the south of yucatan main agricultural area dragging the water pollutants traversing the ring of sinkholes spreading them to the north east and west and eventually reaching to the gulf of mexico perry et al 1993 1995 leonard 1990 albanis et al 1998 this pattern of the flow dynamic in the study area may explain the presence of particular spots of pollution in the recharge and discharge areas of the ring of the sinkholes it is relevant that the regional and local flow of the groundwater can be leakage to sinkholes wang et al 2001 groundwater are interconnected and can transport pollutants from diverse source of contamination that can be of high impact to the human health in this regard it has been stated that 30 of the population from yucatan drink water from polluted wells and sinkholes polanco rodríguez et al 2015b the water pollution is a potential risk for public health in maya communities since the 30 of inhabitants still drink polluted water from the wells and sinkholes the communities have a very low risk perception about the impact of pesticides on the human health and the environment and therefore health promotion programs and official support are needed torresan 2011 polanco rodríguez et al 2015b this scenery in mexico is similar to the indian pollution by pesticides and their impact on the public health mathur 2008 thakur 2008 abhilash and singh 2009 as well as in tunisia when users management and regulatory bodies are dispersed mekki et al 2017 4 2 bioaccumulation of ocp diverse

metabolites were larger in women with breast cancer than in a control group waliszewski et al 2003 another study detected high levels of ocp in breast milk in chelem yucatan mexico in the cost area rodas ortiz et al 2008 the role of pesticides as endochrine disruptors ecd have related with cancers in the reproductive system with impacts on the public health ecd include a group of molecules of organochlorine pesticides epidemiologic studies in a country or region are crucial to alert the health systems and researchers about the geographical trends and prevalent spatial distribution of disease carrying agents diamanti kandarakis et al 2009 the international agency for research on cancer iarc are working on diverse environmental factors that can increase the risk of human cancer these include chemicals complex mixtures occupational exposures physical agents biological agents and lifestyle factors interdisciplinary working groups of expert scientists review the published studies and evaluate the weight of the evidence that an agent can increase the risk of cancer iarc 2017 the high level of pesticides in water at livestock area are similar for the results of high level of pesticides in blood of women with cervical uterine cancer from the same area livestock area of yucatan that showed concentrations of 7 352 ppm of endosulfan i 3 695 ppm of aldrin 2 336 ppm of 4 4 dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane 1 434 ppm of heptachlore in blood polanco rodríguez angel et al 2017a 2017b maya women with cancer showed a 72 2 of detection for ocp in blood the highest frequency of detection of pesticides were dieldrin at 66 6 and endosulfan i at 44 4 in agricultural and metropolitan area heptachlore at 38 8 ɗ hch 4 4 ddd 4 4 dde at 33 3 in the livestock area in the metropolitan area kanasin and progreso had high frequency of detection for dieldrin and endrin hch heptachlore endosulfan i ii endosulfan sulphate ddt and their metabolites polanco rodríguez angel et al 2017a the chronic exposure of maya women by long periods to ocp can be related to these high levels of detection of pesticides in blood the epidemiologic scientific literature actually are related with diverse cancer in the reproduction system of human being because ocp are endocrine disruptors interfering with the synthesis transport storage binding and activity of natural hormones this factors can be associated with the cancer risk falconer et al 2006 mustafa 2010 mnif et al 2011 eea 2010 on the other hand the high concentrations of pesticides in water at recharge area of the ring of sinkholes can be related with highest levels detected of 18 436 ppm of heptachlore epoxide in breast milk in yucatan in the municipality of kanasin near to the recharge zone of ring of sinkholes these results indicate that children are being feed of breast milk with high levels of ocp which may have an impact on central nervous system and cognitive development of child this problem also need a monitoring system in the official health system ocp studies on pollution that was conducted in yucatan mexico reported high levels of concentration of these pesticides in the karstic aquifer high bioaccumulation in the blood of women with cervix uterine cancer and high levels of ocp in breast milk samples from healthy women which shows that there is a generalization of bioaccumulation of ocp in the human due to the social scenario and natural vulnerabilities in the karstic ecosystem of high fragility to the pollution the use of ocp in yucatan together with the natural factor and their social condition have contributed to to the chronic exposure of these pesticides in the population with high impacts on the natural ecosystem and public health problems the social factors and the natural vulnerability of the karst aquifer could explain why in the last 20 years the state of yucatan has high rates to diverse cancer in women and men as well as increases in birth defects fetal and infant mortality inegi 2006 2009 the qualitative study of farmers and family mothers showed that the people in rural communities of yucatan have a very low risk perception about handling of ocp due to the low educative level which is of high impact for the public health polanco rodríguez et al 2015b and a transition to sustainable agricultural and food systems is necessary fao 2012 this scenery in

12339,in the present work terminalia arjuna sawdust tasd has been employed as an effective adsorbent for the elimination of crystal violet cv dye from synthetic wastewater the adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray analysis edax thermogravimetric analysis tga transmission electron microscopy tem and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy batch adsorption experiments have been conducted to optimize different factors affecting adsorption the findings were observed to be best followed by freundlich adsorption isotherm with 0 9964 as the correlation coefficient the equilibrium was attained in 120 min and the highest adsorption capacity was observed to be 45 99 mg g 1 at the optimum adsorbent dose and ph of 0 4 g l 1 and 7 respectively kinetic experiments revealed that the removing process of cv by tasd obeys pseudo first order kinetic model and the k1 value was found to be 0 013 min 1 the thermodynamic investigation indicates that the process of adsorption of cv by tasd is feasible endothermic and associated with an increase of entropy desorption analysis shows that the used adsorbent could be better regenerated in sodium hydroxide graphical abstract fx1 keywords terminalia arjuna sawdust crystal violet adsorptive decontamination wastewater treatment isotherm analysis adsorbent recoverability 1 introduction water is an important natural resource and unpolluted one is essential for human life good health and pleasure however various poisonous substances such as dyes heavy metals pesticides fertilizers etc are being introduced into the water bodies from domestic agricultural and industrial activities thus the treatment of contaminants prior to discharge of polluted wastewater is a challenge for the environmentalists the discovery of mauveine first synthetic dye in 1856 by william henry perkin led the way to the synthesis of a wide variety of dyes to be used for various purposes these synthetic dyes are commonly used in a variety of industries like textiles food cosmetics leather plastic glass medicine ceramics pharmaceuticals printing ink paper and pulp etc the textile industry is one of the largest sectors globally consuming substantial amounts of water in its manufacturing processes and thereby releasing large amounts of dye loaded effluents into the freshwater systems these dyes are known to have long term damaging effects on the environment dyes affect the photosynthetic activities of the aquatic flora by absorbing and reflecting the sunlight entering the water bodies and thus severely affecting the food chain however their toxic effects acute or chronic mild or severe on the organisms depend upon many factors viz nature concentration and length of exposure etc further sometimes dyes and their decomposition products are noxious carcinogenic and mutagenic dyes also cause allergies such as contact dermatitis skin irritation respiratory diseases and irritation to the mucous membrane and upper respiratory tract thus the elimination of dyes from wastewater prior to its discharge in a water body is a major challenge for the environmentalists various treatment technologies like membrane filtration ozonation fenton s process reverse osmosis coagulation photocatalytic degradation nanofiltration membranes combined photo fenton and biological oxidation colloidal manganese dioxide oxidation etc crini 2006 mahalakshmi et al 2007 ahmad et al 2008 martın et al 2008 bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2010 wu et al 2014 qamruzzaman and nasar 2014a 2014b 2015 kumar et al 2016 are available for the decontamination of water and wastewater containing different types of pollutants however amongst the various available techniques adsorption technique has been found to be one of the most efficient and superior technique because of the various advantages associated with it i e low cost insensitivity to toxic pollutants simplicity and flexibility of design gupta

the limitations associated with it such as high manufacturing cost and difficulty in regeneration has imposed restrictions on its use cao et al 2014 this has encouraged the investigators to develop cheap and effective adsorbents in order to improve the removal efficiency as well as to make the overall decontamination process more efficient the usage of industrial and agricultural waste products as adsorbents has grabbed much attention of the researchers because of their accessibility in abundance and low cost factor literature survey reveals the utilization of many industrial and agricultural waste products such as artocarpus altilis skin lim et al 2015 chaetophora elegans alga rammel et al 2011 citrus limetta peel shakoor and nasar 2016 cucumis sativus peel shakoor and nasar

terminalia arjuna is a tree belonging to genus terminalia and traditionally known as arjuna tree it is usually grown on river banks in different parts of india and bangladesh the bark of arjuna tree has flavonoids tannins saponin and gallic acid it is rich in calcium magnesium zinc and copper it also contains phytosterols which help in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases flavonoids help in the reduction of inflammation and affect the cognitive function improves heart and blood vessels it is also used to treat kidney liver and gallbladder complications when applied to lesions and cuts it helps in blood clotting the wood of arjuna tree is dark brown very hard lustrous and coarse textured it is used for making carts agricultural implements tool handles and other carpentry items which result in the production of a lot of sawdust which is usually rejected as waste literature survey reveals that the removal of crystal violet dye from wastewater by adsorption method has been studied using a variety of non conventional low cost adsorbents but this dye adsorbent combination i e crystal violet terminalia arjuna sawdust has not been studied so far hence in the present investigation terminalia arjuna sawdust tasd is employed to study the decontamination of synthetically polluted wastewater containing crystal violet cv dye the experiments were conducted with

and tem micrograph of adsorbent were recorded using a transmission electron microscope tem jem 2100 jeol japan ftir spectra of the tasd and cv loaded tasd were recorded in the spectral range of 4000 400 cm 1 in the solid state the point of zero charge of tasd was also measured by the solid addition method su et al 2011 2 3 batch equilibrium experiments the batch equilibrium studies were conducted by adding a uniform quantity 0 15 g of tasd to 25 ml of synthetic aqueous cv dye solution having different initial concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 in 100 ml conical flasks made of borosilicate glass the samples were agitated in a shaker attached to a thermostatic water bath at 298 k for 240 min to confirm the attainment of equilibrium after the establishment of equilibrium the residual concentration of the cv in the filtrate was measured spectrophotometrically at 590 nm the adsorption parameters such as adsorbent dosage ph contact time particle size and temperature were optimized in batch method the reproducibility of the results was checked by conducting each experiment at least two times the data with minor deviation were considered after averaging them while those with major deviation observed in few cases which might be due to some indeterminate errors were discarded and entire experiments were repeated the adsorption efficiency r and adsorption capacity qe were determined by using the following respective equations 1 r c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e m v where co and ce are the respective initial and equilibrium concentrations of cv dye in mg l 1 m is the mass of the adsorbent g and v is the volume of cv solution l the adsorption data so obtained were analyzed in the light of three well known isotherm models namely langmuir eq 3 freundlich eq 4 and temkin eq 5 the langmuir isotherm has been commonly used to discuss various adsorbate adsorbent combinations for both liquid and gas phase adsorptions langmuir 1916 langmuir adsorption isotherm model is based on the following assumptions a the surface of the adsorbent available for adsorption is assumed to be uniform i e all the sites available for adsorption are equivalent b there is no sideways interaction between molecules of adsorbate and c only a monolayer is assumed to be formed i e molecules of adsorbate do not deposit on another molecule of adsorbate which is already adsorbed instead they only deposit on the remaining surface available for the adsorption the langmuir equation can be represented in linearized form as 3 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m where qm mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity kl l mg 1 is langmuir constant represents the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate the freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that is based on adsorption on a heterogeneous surface freundlich 1906 the freundlich model can be mathematically represented respectively in the linear form as 4 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity n is freundlich constant representing the adsorption intensity temkin isotherm is the early model describing the adsorption of hydrogen onto platinum electrodes in acidic solutions temkin and pyzhev 1940 the isotherm contains a factor that explicitly taking into the account of adsorbent adsorbate interactions by ignoring the extremely low and large value of concentrations the model assumes that heat of adsorption a function of temperature of all molecules in the layer would decrease linearly rather than logarithmically with coverage aharoni and ungarish 1977 5 q e b ln c e b ln k t where b rt b b j mol 1 is temkin isotherm constant linked with the heat of adsorption and kt l g 1 is the temkin equilibrium binding constant 2 4 adsorption kinetics to investigate the kinetics associated with the adsorption of cv tasd system the reaction mixture were taken out from the flask at different pre decided intervals and the adsorption capacity qt was calculated by using expression similar to eq 2 where ce was replaced by ct residual concentration of cv after adsorption at any time t the experimental results so obtained were examined to fit in four different kinetic models viz pseudo first order eq 6 lagergren 1898 pseudo second order eq 7 ho and mckay 1998 2000 intraparticle diffusion eq 8 chen and bai 2013 xiong et al 2010 and elovich eq 9 low 1960 the above models can be best represented in their linear mathematical form as expressed below in respective order 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 8 q t k id t 1 2 c 9 q t ln α β β 1 β ln t where k1 min 1 is the adsorption pseudo first order rate constant k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant kid mg g 1min 1 2 is intraparticle diffusion rate constant c is a constant α mg g 1 min 1 is the initial adsorption rate of elovich model and β g mg g 1 is the desorption constant of elovich model 2 5 desorption the recoverability of the used tasd was studied in different media acidic basic and neutral under the optimum conditions of adsorbent dose 0 15 g ph 7 0 and particle size 80 150 bss mesh for desorption 0 15 g of the tasd was mixed to 25 ml of cv solution and agitated for 2 h the cv loaded tasd particles were filtered out from the cv solution and dried in an air oven this cv loaded tasd was poured into 25 ml of different desorbing agents dddw and 0 1 m each of hcl ch3cooh nacl and naoh and shaken for 6 h the percentage desorption d was determined by employing the following equation 10 d concentration of desorbed dye mg l 1 concentration of adsorbed d ye mg l 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tasd sem micrographs along with edax spectra of tasd before and after adsorption of cv dye are presented in fig 1 a b c and d the sem image of untreated tasd fig 1 a shows that its surface is highly uneven and porous with vessels clearly visible as hole like structures but after adsorption of crystal violet dye it can be clearly realized from fig 1 b that the surface of tasd is covered with layers of cv molecules filling the pores and irregularities on its surface the edax analysis of the tasd adsorbent reflects mainly the presence of carbon 48 35 wt oxygen 43 88 wt and nitrogen 7 52 wt along with the traces of silicon and sulfur the appearance of chlorine peak after the adsorption fig 1 d further confirms the attachment of cv molecule on tasd surface the tga thermogram of adsorbent tasd shown in fig 2 a is represented by four stages evolution of moisture i and three successive steps of the degradation of hemicellulose ii cellulose iii and lignin iv yang et al 2007 the tga curve shows that during the initial stage stage i the weight loss of about 8 up to the temperature rise of 98 c may be due to evaporation of moisture present in the adsorbent mass in the next stage the thermal degradation of hemicellulose taken place up to the temperature of 281 c it has already been reported that the hemicellulose is thermally the most unstable component and start decomposing at a much lower temperature than the other components raveendran et al 1996 stage iii represents the pyrolysis of cellulose in the temperature range of 281 373 c this stage is associated with the maximum sample loss about 50 and residual mass after this phase was 37 6 only a further weight loss of adsorbent was occurred up to the temperature of 546 c this stage is due to decomposition of the lignin which is a most stable component of the wood our results are comparable with those obtained earlier mohan et al 2006 raveendran et al 1996 yang et al 2007 tem image of tasd adsorbent shown in fig 2 b indicates that most of the particles have the spherical shape of different size ranging from 82 to 167 nm ftir spectrum of tasd before and after adsorption is presented in fig 2 c the band at 3414 cm 1 might be due to the stretching vibration of h bonded oh and nh groups in the adsorbent chieng et al 2015 zhao et al 2017b the sharp peak seen at 2925 cm 1 is assigned to asymmetric stretching of ch group pan et al 2015 the strong peak at 1735 cm 1 is due to the c o vibration of the carbonyl group pan et al 2015 zhao et al 2015b zhang et al 2011 and the band at 1636 cm 1 indicates the presence of c c bond can et al 2012 the peaks at 1247 1027 and 605 cm 1 are assigned to c c aromatic bending c c stretching and c h bending respectively can et al 2012 2013 mohammed ziegler and billes 2002 it was observed that some major decrease in peak intensity at 1735 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 appeared in the spectrum of cv loaded tasd signifying the involvement of c o and c c in binding with the cv dye in the adsorption process in this circumstance it is worth to comment that the significant involvement of the corresponding functional groups has been observed to be due to reduction of peak intensity wang et al 2005 bello et al 2012 markovic et al 2015 asgher and bhatti 2010 cui et al 2008 han et al 2010 deng et al 2011 3 2 effect of tasd dosage in order make the overall adsorption process more economical optimization of adsorbent dosage is an important aspect the effect of tasd dosage on the adsorption was studied in the concentration range of 0 4 10 g l 1 of tasd the variation of removal efficiency r and adsorption capacity qe is presented in fig 3 the removal efficiency is increased promptly from 91 99 to 95 58 and the adsorption capacity qe decreased from 45 99 to 7 96 mg g 1 on increasing the dose of tasd from 0 4 to 6 g l 1 thereafter there is no major change in r or qe with further increase in tasd dose the optimum tasd dosage of 6 g l 1 is selected for further adsorption studies the increase in r with dose might be due to the availability of more active sites for adsorption the reverse trend observed in the case of adsorption capacity might possibly be due to the particulate interactions like aggregation which leads to a reduction in the effective surface area and enhancement in diffusional path length ozacar and sengil 2005 3 3 effect of contact time and initial cv concentration contact time plays a major role in the decontamination of wastewater by adsorption process attainment of equilibrium in a short span of time with the rapid uptake of pollutants from wastewater is indicative of its efficiency as an adsorbent in the treatment of wastewater the effect of contact time on the removal of cv is depicted in fig 4 it can be clearly seen from the figure that the adsorption capacity qt increased very rapidly during the initial 30 min followed by a slow uptake of dye for the next 30 min and finally becoming almost constant after 120 min the reason for this trend is that initially there is the accessibility of a large number of vacant binding sites on the adsorbent surface promoting rapid uptake of cv but later on the binding sites are being occupied gradually with time leading to saturation of the adsorbent surface with dye molecules finally when all the sites are occupied no subsequent adsorption takes place mall et al 2006 wang and wang 2008 it is also inferred from the fig 4 that as the concentration of cv is increased from 10 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 qe increased from 1 58 mg g 1 to 15 96 mg g 1 the reason for such behavior might presumably be due to the availability of a large number of cv molecules in the solution for adsorption a high concentration gradient is established providing a thermodynamic driving force which overcomes the mass transfer resistance of cv molecules from aqueous solution on the solid phase this gives the increase in the probability of collision of cv molecules with the binding sites of the adsorbent increases resulting in higher adsorption capacity shroff and vaidya 2011 3 4 effect of particle size of adsorbent tasd the effect of particle size of tasd on the adsorption of cv dye was examined by taking three different particle size fractions namely 80 150 150 200 and 200 bss mesh it has been found that the removal efficiency increases with a decrease in particle size 95 9 for 80 150 bss mesh 97 0 for 150 200 bss mesh and 97 5 for 200 bss mesh the increase in removal efficiency is because of the fact that the lowering of particle size provides the larger surface area of the adsorbent jain and sikarwar 2008 but it has been observed that the reduction in particle size has only negligible effect on the removal efficiency perez marín et al 2009 also because of the management problems accompanying the use of smaller particles gupta et al 2000 particles of 80 150 bss mesh is used for further adsorption studies 3 5 effect of ph since ph of the medium influence the surface charge of the adsorbent and also the ionization of adsorbate and hence it is a very significant parameter to examine the adsorption process the influence of ph on the adsorptive elimination of cv by tasd was observed in the ph range of 2 12 and shown in fig 5 it has been observed that the removal efficiency is increased from 82 1 to 95 3 on enhancing the ph of the solution from 2 to 5 afterward there is no considerable rise in removal efficiency on further enhancement in ph of the medium thus an optimum ph 7 is selected for further adsorption studies on cv dye the effect of ph on the adsorptive elimination of dye has also been examined on the basis of the point of zero charge phpzc of tasd the phpzc is the ph at which the surface of the adsorbent has net zero charge the phpzc of tasd was established to be 5 0 fig 5 inset this means that at ph phpzc the surface of tasd is protonated by the absorption of h ions resulting in an electrostatic repulsion with the cationic cv dye bulut and aydın 2006 pavan et al 2008 further at ph phpzc tasd surface bears negative charge which causes an electrostatic attraction between the cationic dye this clearly indicates that for the adsorption of the cationic dye the ph of the reaction mixture should be greater than 5 0 which further justify our selection of ph 7 0 as optimum ph 3 6 equilibrium studies adsorption isotherm signifies the interactions of adsorbate adsorbent at constant temperature and also shows the distribution of species between the solid and the liquid phases on the establishment of equilibrium the different constants associated with the various isotherm models are summarized in table 1 the langmuir isotherm model is not applicable in the present case as the experimental data results in a negative value of qm the observation was also reported in the case of uranium vi aspergillus fumigatus system wang et al 2010 in the freundlich isotherm the factor 1 n was calculated to be greater than unity suggesting that the adsorption of cv onto tasd is cooperative fig 6 fytianos et al 2000 this indicates that the adsorbed adsorbate has an effect on the adsorption of new adsorbate molecules liu 2015 further the r2 value for the temkin isotherm was obtained to be 0 9239 which is much lower than 0 9964 as found for the freundlich isotherm based on the correlation coefficient values for all the three models the most appropriate isotherm fitting the equilibrium data is freundlich adsorption model it is relevant to comment here that the adsorptive treatment of cv dye by other adsorbents other non conventional low cost adsorbents such as groundnut shell akinola and umar 2015 bean pod akinola and umar 2015 citrullus lanatus rind bharathi and ramesh 2012 fugas sawdust aljeboree 2016 palm kernel fiber el sayed 2011 and cyperus rotundus suyamboo and srikrishnaperumal 2014 has also been reported to follow the freundlich isotherm model the values of the various freundlich parameters reported by the investigators for the above mentioned adsorbents are compared with the present investigation in table 2 3 7 kinetics the different kinetic parameters so determined are summarized in table 3 the experimental value of qe is found to be in close agreement with that obtained from the slope of the pseudo first order kinetic plot fig 7 on comparing the values of r2 table 3 it is clear that the pseudo first order model r2 0 9962 is best one to represent the kinetics associated with the adsorption of cv onto tasd in literature the majority of work on different adsorbate adsorbent systems reports the validity of pseudo second order kinetics however in the present case the pseudo first order kinetic model has been observed to be validated the cogency of pseudo first order kinetics has also been testified by other investigators for the adsorption of cv on to various other adsorbents such as calotropis procera ali and muhammad 2008 carbonaceous slurry jain et al 2003 sagaun sawdust khattri and singh 2012 the values of the rate constants reported by these investigators are compared in table 4 3 8 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism onto an adsorbent material may be due to the active functional groups available on it in order to elucidate of the active sites ftir spectrophotometric studies are usually performed the peaks observed in the ftir spectra may be assigned to different groups and bonds in accordance with their corresponding wavenumbers in the present investigation the surface properties of adsorbent were thoroughly analyzed as pointed out in section 3 1 that a major change in the ftir peak intensity occurred at 1735 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 after the adsorption of cv dye the peaks at these wave numbers are respectively assigned to the vibration of the carbonyl group c o and presence of c c bond the interaction of the cationic cv adsorbate with the tasd adsorbent might possibly be due to the electrostatic attraction of the c o group of tasd the interaction of carbonyl group of adsorbent and positively charged quaternary ammonium group of the adsorbate has been shown in a representative diagram as fig 8 a similar mechanism assuming the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged groups present in the cell wall of the grapefruit peel gfp and cationic dye molecule cv was suggested for the sorption of cv by gfp saeed et al 2010 an alternative adsorption mechanism based on the cv hydrogen ion exchange process may also be suggested tasd oh tasd o h tasd o cv cl tasd o cv cl tasd oh cv cl tasd o cv hcl in the above reactions the cationic cv dye molecular formula c25n3h30cl is represented as cv cl the possibility of this mechanism is supported by two facts i ftir studies indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of adsorbent and ii the adsorption is poor at lower ph section 3 5 at lower ph the formation of hcl is suppressed any increase in ph favors the net reaction due to neutralization of hcl a similar mechanism was proposed for the adsorption of cv onto naoh modified rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 thus the adsorption of cv on the surface of tasd takes place either due to the electrostatic attraction between the c o group of tasd and quaternary ammonium group of cv or by the cv hydrogen ion exchange process it is also quite possible that both the mechanistic routes involve simultaneously 3 9 thermodynamics the feasibility of the adsorption of cv onto tasd and the thermodynamic parameters were evaluated by using the followings 11 ln k c h rt s r 12 g rt ln k c 13 g h t s where g kj mol 1 h kj mol 1 and s j k 1 mol 1 are the respective changes in gibbs free energy enthalpy and entropy kc is the equilibrium constant r is the gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the temperature k the values h and s were determined from the linear equation obtained from the ln kc versus 1 t plot fig 9 the various thermodynamic quantities obtained for the cv tasd system are incorporated in table 5 the adsorption process has been observed to be associated with the decrease in free energy change throughout the entire temperature range this reflects the spontaneous nature of adsorption this table shows that the negative values of free energy change increase with the increase of temperature this indicates that the feasibility of the process increases with the increase of temperature the positive value of enthalpy change showed the endothermic nature of adsorption i e the adsorption is associated with the absorption of heat from the environmental surroundings hence the spontaneity of the cv removal by tasd is only based on the entropy factor a positive value of 57 869 j k 1mol 1 states that there is an increase in randomness at the adsorbent adsorbate interface 3 10 desorption in order to ensure the long term re usability and explore the probability of retrieval of used tasd desorption studies were planned using five different media desorption of the used tasd was studied using 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m nacl 0 1 m naoh and dddw the percentage desorption was found to be highest in the case of 0 1 m naoh 2 86 followed by 0 1 m ch3cooh 1 85 and 0 1 m hcl 1 04 least desorption was observed in the case of 0 1 m nacl 0 99 and dddw 1 00 thus the most effective desorbing agent for the cv tasd system is naoh however in order to improve the desorption efficiency further work is required in this area 4 conclusions the terminalia arjuna sawdust tasd has been established to be an efficient adsorbent for the decontamination of water and wastewater containing crystal violet cv dye the dye treatment process has been observed to be dependent on the factors such as initial dye concentration adsorbate adsorbent contact time adsorbent dosage ph of the medium particle size and temperature the adsorption capacity has been found to increase with the increase of initial dye concentration and the equilibrium was achieved attained in 2 h for the effective decontamination of water containing cv dye by tasd adsorbent the ph of the medium should be greater than 5 the isotherm studies showed that the adsorption obeys freundlich isotherm model indicating the multilayer cooperative type adsorption thermodynamic studies confirmed that the adsorption process is spontaneous endothermic and accompanied by an increase in entropy at the solute solution interface it has been established that the feasibility of adsorptive removal of cv by tasd increases with the increase of temperature pseudo first order kinetic model is the best one to represent kinetic data naoh is found to be the best desorbing agent among hcl ch3cooh nacl naoh and dddw for the cv tasd system acknowledgement the authors are thankful to the chairman department of applied chemistry faculty of engineering and technology aligarh muslim university for

12339,in the present work terminalia arjuna sawdust tasd has been employed as an effective adsorbent for the elimination of crystal violet cv dye from synthetic wastewater the adsorbent was characterized by scanning electron microscopy sem energy dispersive x ray analysis edax thermogravimetric analysis tga transmission electron microscopy tem and fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy batch adsorption experiments have been conducted to optimize different factors affecting adsorption the findings were observed to be best followed by freundlich adsorption isotherm with 0

respectively kinetic experiments revealed that the removing process of cv by tasd obeys pseudo first order kinetic model and the k1 value was found to be 0 013 min 1 the thermodynamic investigation indicates that the process of adsorption of cv by tasd is feasible endothermic and associated with an increase of entropy desorption analysis shows that the used adsorbent could be better regenerated

water is an important natural resource and unpolluted one is essential for human life good health and pleasure however various poisonous substances such as dyes heavy metals pesticides fertilizers etc are being introduced into the water bodies from domestic agricultural and industrial activities thus the treatment of contaminants prior to discharge of polluted wastewater is a challenge for the environmentalists the discovery of mauveine first synthetic dye in 1856 by william henry perkin led the way to the synthesis of a wide variety of dyes to be used for various purposes these synthetic dyes are commonly used in a variety of industries like textiles food cosmetics leather plastic glass medicine ceramics pharmaceuticals printing ink paper and pulp etc the textile industry is one of the largest sectors globally consuming substantial amounts of water in its manufacturing processes and thereby releasing large amounts of dye loaded effluents into the freshwater systems these dyes are known to have long term damaging effects on the environment dyes affect the photosynthetic activities of the aquatic flora by absorbing and reflecting the sunlight entering the water bodies and thus severely affecting the food chain however their toxic effects acute or chronic mild or severe on the organisms depend upon many factors viz nature concentration and length of exposure etc further sometimes dyes and their decomposition products are noxious carcinogenic and mutagenic dyes also cause allergies such as contact dermatitis skin irritation respiratory diseases and irritation to the mucous membrane and upper respiratory tract thus the elimination of dyes from wastewater prior to its discharge in a water body is a major challenge for the environmentalists various treatment technologies like membrane filtration ozonation fenton s process reverse osmosis coagulation photocatalytic degradation nanofiltration membranes combined photo fenton and biological oxidation colloidal manganese dioxide oxidation etc crini 2006 mahalakshmi et al 2007 ahmad et al 2008 martın et al 2008 bhatnagar and sillanpaa 2010 wu et al 2014 qamruzzaman and nasar 2014a 2014b 2015 kumar et al 2016 are available for the decontamination of water and wastewater containing different types of pollutants however amongst the various available techniques adsorption technique has been found to be one of the most efficient and superior technique because of the various advantages associated with it i e low cost insensitivity to toxic pollutants simplicity and flexibility of design gupta

the limitations associated with it such as high manufacturing cost and difficulty in regeneration has imposed restrictions on its use cao et al 2014 this has encouraged the investigators to develop cheap and effective adsorbents in order to improve the removal efficiency as well as to make the overall decontamination process more efficient the usage of industrial and agricultural waste products as adsorbents has grabbed much attention of the researchers because of their accessibility in abundance and low cost factor literature survey reveals the utilization of many industrial and agricultural waste products such as artocarpus altilis skin lim et al 2015 chaetophora elegans alga rammel et al 2011 citrus limetta peel shakoor and nasar 2016 cucumis sativus peel shakoor and nasar

carpentry items which result in the production of a lot of sawdust which is usually rejected as waste literature survey reveals that the removal of crystal violet dye from wastewater by adsorption method has been studied using a variety of non conventional low cost adsorbents but this dye adsorbent combination i e crystal violet terminalia arjuna sawdust has not been studied so far hence in the present investigation terminalia arjuna sawdust tasd is employed to study the decontamination of synthetically polluted wastewater containing crystal violet cv dye the experiments were conducted with the prime object to optimize the relevant and useful experimental parameters 2 materials and method 2 1 chemicals cv dye obtained from qualigens india and was used as received sodium hydroxide cdh india hydrochloric acid merck germany potassium nitrate cdh india acetic acid sd fine india and sodium chloride cdh india were used the water obtained by double distillation of deionized water dddw was used throughout the experiments 2 2 tasd adsorbent preparation and characterization tasd obtained locally from carpenter shop was washed numerous times by dddw to eliminate dirt dust and other visible or invisible impurities they were then dried in sunlight for about 48 h and pulverized to fine powder form by a mechanical grinder the processed material was passed through a sieve of 80 bss mesh and again washed by dddw several times till the appearance of clear and transparent filtrate the water and moisture present in this washed tasd were removed by drying the mass in an air oven at 95 c for 24 h the final adsorbent thus obtained was again crushed and sieved to get different sized portions i e 80 150 150 200 and 200 the elemental analysis and morphology of the cv loaded and unloaded tasd adsorbent were examined with samples coated with gold by using scanning electron microscope sem coupled with energy dispersive x ray analysis edax model jsm 6510lv jeol japan the thermal stability of the adsorbent was evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis tga with shimadzu analyser model no dtg 60h under a nitrogen atmosphere in the temperature range of 30 800 c the particle size and tem micrograph of adsorbent were recorded using a transmission electron microscope tem jem 2100 jeol japan ftir spectra of the tasd and cv loaded tasd were recorded in the spectral range of 4000 400 cm 1 in the solid state the point of zero charge of tasd was also measured by the solid addition method su et al 2011 2 3 batch equilibrium experiments the batch equilibrium studies were conducted by adding a uniform quantity 0 15 g of tasd to 25 ml of synthetic aqueous cv dye solution having different initial concentrations 10 100 mg l 1 in 100 ml conical flasks made of borosilicate glass the samples were agitated in a shaker attached to a thermostatic water bath at 298 k for 240 min to confirm the attainment of equilibrium after the establishment of equilibrium the residual concentration of the cv in the filtrate was measured spectrophotometrically at 590 nm the adsorption parameters such as adsorbent dosage ph contact time particle size and temperature were optimized in batch method the reproducibility of the results was checked by conducting each experiment at least two times the data with minor deviation were considered after averaging them while those with major deviation observed in few cases which might be due to some indeterminate errors were discarded and entire experiments were repeated the adsorption efficiency r and adsorption capacity qe were determined by using the following respective equations 1 r c o c e c o 100 2 q e c o c e m v where co and ce are the respective initial and equilibrium concentrations of cv dye in mg l 1 m is the mass of the adsorbent g and v is the volume of cv solution l the adsorption data so obtained were analyzed in the light of three well known isotherm models namely langmuir eq 3 freundlich eq 4 and temkin eq 5 the langmuir isotherm has been commonly used to discuss various adsorbate adsorbent combinations for both liquid and gas phase adsorptions langmuir 1916 langmuir adsorption isotherm model is based on the following assumptions a the surface of the adsorbent available for adsorption is assumed to be uniform i e all the sites available for adsorption are equivalent b there is no sideways interaction between molecules of adsorbate and c only a monolayer is assumed to be formed i e molecules of adsorbate do not deposit on another molecule of adsorbate which is already adsorbed instead they only deposit on the remaining surface available for the adsorption the langmuir equation can be represented in linearized form as 3 1 q e 1 q m k l c e 1 q m where qm mg g 1 is the maximum adsorption capacity qe mg g 1 is the equilibrium adsorption capacity kl l mg 1 is langmuir constant represents the affinity between the adsorbent and adsorbate the freundlich isotherm is an empirical model that is based on adsorption on a heterogeneous surface freundlich 1906 the freundlich model can be mathematically represented respectively in the linear form as 4 ln q e 1 n ln c e ln k f where kf mg1 1 n l1 n g 1 is the freundlich constant related to the adsorption capacity n is freundlich constant representing the adsorption intensity temkin isotherm is the early model describing the adsorption of hydrogen onto platinum electrodes in acidic solutions temkin and pyzhev 1940 the isotherm contains a factor that explicitly taking into the account of adsorbent adsorbate interactions by ignoring the extremely low and large value of concentrations the model assumes that heat of adsorption a function of temperature of all molecules in the layer would decrease linearly rather than logarithmically

the adsorption capacity qt was calculated by using expression similar to eq 2 where ce was replaced by ct residual concentration of cv after adsorption at any time t the experimental results so obtained were examined to fit in four different kinetic models viz pseudo first order eq 6 lagergren 1898 pseudo second order eq 7 ho and mckay 1998 2000 intraparticle diffusion eq 8 chen and bai 2013 xiong et al 2010 and elovich eq 9 low 1960 the above models can be best represented in their linear mathematical form as expressed below in respective order 6 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t 7 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e 8 q t k id t 1 2 c 9 q t ln α β β 1 β ln t where k1 min 1 is the adsorption pseudo first order rate constant k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant kid mg g 1min 1 2 is intraparticle diffusion rate constant c is a constant α mg g 1 min 1 is the initial adsorption rate of elovich model and β g mg g 1 is the desorption constant of elovich model 2 5 desorption the recoverability of the used tasd was studied in different media acidic basic and neutral under the optimum conditions of adsorbent dose 0 15 g ph 7 0 and particle size 80 150 bss mesh for desorption 0 15 g of the tasd was mixed to 25 ml of cv solution and agitated for 2 h the cv loaded tasd particles were filtered out from the cv solution and dried in an air oven this cv loaded tasd was poured into 25 ml of different desorbing agents dddw and 0 1 m each of hcl ch3cooh nacl and naoh and shaken for 6 h the percentage desorption d was determined by employing the following equation 10 d concentration of desorbed dye mg l 1 concentration of adsorbed d ye mg l 1 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of tasd sem micrographs along with edax spectra of tasd before and after adsorption of cv dye are presented in fig 1 a b c and d the sem image of untreated tasd fig 1 a shows that its surface is highly uneven and porous with vessels clearly visible as hole like structures but after adsorption of crystal violet dye it can be clearly realized from fig 1 b that the surface of tasd is covered with layers of cv molecules filling the pores and irregularities on its surface the edax analysis of the tasd adsorbent reflects mainly the presence of carbon 48 35 wt oxygen 43 88 wt and nitrogen 7 52 wt along with the traces of silicon and sulfur the appearance of chlorine peak after the adsorption fig 1 d further confirms the attachment of cv molecule on tasd surface the tga thermogram of adsorbent tasd shown in fig 2 a is represented by four stages evolution of moisture i and three successive steps of the degradation of hemicellulose ii cellulose iii and lignin iv yang et al 2007 the tga curve shows that during the initial stage stage i the weight loss of about 8 up to the temperature rise of 98 c may be due to evaporation of moisture present in the adsorbent mass in the next stage the thermal degradation of hemicellulose taken place up to the temperature of 281 c it has already been reported that the hemicellulose is thermally the most unstable component and start decomposing at a much lower temperature than the other components raveendran et al 1996 stage iii represents the pyrolysis of cellulose in the temperature range of 281 373 c this stage is associated with the maximum sample loss about 50 and residual mass after this phase was 37 6 only a further weight loss of adsorbent was occurred up to the temperature of 546 c this stage is due to decomposition of the lignin which is a most stable component of the wood our results are comparable with those obtained earlier mohan et al 2006 raveendran et al 1996 yang et al 2007 tem image of tasd adsorbent shown in fig 2 b indicates that most of the particles have the spherical shape of different size ranging from 82 to 167 nm ftir spectrum of tasd before and after adsorption is presented in fig 2 c the band at 3414 cm 1 might be due to the stretching vibration of h bonded oh and nh groups in the adsorbent chieng et al 2015 zhao et al 2017b the sharp peak seen at 2925 cm 1 is assigned to asymmetric stretching of ch group pan et al 2015 the strong peak at 1735 cm 1 is due to the c o vibration of the carbonyl group pan et al 2015 zhao et al 2015b zhang et al 2011 and the band at 1636 cm 1 indicates the presence of c c bond can et al 2012 the peaks at 1247 1027 and 605 cm 1 are assigned to c c aromatic bending c c stretching and c h bending respectively can et al 2012 2013 mohammed ziegler and billes 2002 it was observed that some major decrease in peak intensity at 1735 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 appeared in the spectrum of cv loaded tasd signifying the involvement of c o and c c in binding with the cv dye in the adsorption process in this circumstance it is worth to comment that the significant involvement of the corresponding functional groups has been observed to be due to reduction of peak intensity wang et al 2005 bello et al 2012 markovic et al 2015 asgher and bhatti 2010 cui et al 2008 han et al 2010 deng et al 2011 3 2 effect of tasd dosage in order make the overall adsorption process more economical optimization of adsorbent dosage is an important aspect the effect of tasd dosage on the adsorption was studied in the concentration range of 0 4 10 g l 1 of tasd the variation of removal efficiency r and adsorption capacity qe is presented in fig 3 the removal efficiency is increased promptly from 91 99 to 95 58 and the adsorption capacity qe decreased from 45 99 to 7 96 mg g 1 on increasing the dose of tasd from 0 4 to 6 g l 1 thereafter there is no major change in r or qe with further increase in tasd dose the optimum tasd dosage of 6 g l 1 is selected for further adsorption studies the increase in r with dose might be due to the availability of more active sites for adsorption the reverse trend observed in the case of adsorption capacity might possibly be due to the particulate interactions like aggregation which leads to a reduction in the effective surface area and enhancement in diffusional path length ozacar and sengil 2005 3 3 effect of contact time and initial cv concentration contact time plays a major role in the decontamination of wastewater by adsorption process attainment of equilibrium in a short span of time with the rapid uptake of pollutants from wastewater is indicative of its efficiency as an adsorbent in the treatment of wastewater the effect of contact time on the removal of cv is depicted in fig 4 it can be clearly seen from the figure that the adsorption capacity qt increased very rapidly during the initial 30 min followed by a slow uptake of dye for the next 30 min and finally becoming almost constant after 120 min the reason for this trend is that initially there is the accessibility of a large number of vacant binding sites on the adsorbent surface promoting rapid uptake of cv but later on the binding sites are being occupied gradually with time leading to saturation of the adsorbent surface with dye molecules finally when all the sites are occupied no subsequent adsorption takes place mall et al 2006 wang and wang 2008 it is also inferred from the fig 4 that as the concentration of cv is increased from 10 mg l 1 to 100 mg l 1 qe increased from 1 58 mg g 1 to 15 96 mg g 1 the reason for such behavior might presumably be due to the availability of a large number of cv molecules in the solution for adsorption a high concentration gradient is established providing a thermodynamic driving force which overcomes the mass transfer resistance of cv molecules from aqueous solution on the solid phase this gives the increase in the probability of collision of cv molecules with the binding sites of the adsorbent increases resulting in higher adsorption capacity shroff and vaidya 2011 3 4 effect of particle size of adsorbent tasd the effect of particle size of tasd on the adsorption of cv dye was examined by taking three different particle size fractions namely 80 150 150 200 and 200 bss mesh it has been found that the removal efficiency increases with a decrease in particle size 95 9 for 80 150 bss mesh 97 0 for 150 200 bss mesh and 97 5 for 200 bss mesh the increase in removal efficiency is because of the fact that the lowering of particle size provides the larger surface area of the adsorbent jain and sikarwar 2008 but it has been observed that the reduction in particle size has only negligible effect on the removal efficiency perez marín et al 2009 also because of the management problems accompanying the use of smaller particles gupta et al 2000 particles of 80 150 bss mesh is used for further adsorption studies 3 5 effect of ph since ph of the medium influence the surface charge of the adsorbent and also the ionization of adsorbate and hence it is a very significant parameter to examine the adsorption process the influence of ph on the adsorptive elimination of cv by tasd was observed in the ph range of 2 12 and shown in fig 5 it has been observed that the removal efficiency is increased from 82 1 to 95 3 on enhancing the ph of the solution from 2 to 5 afterward there is no considerable rise in removal efficiency on further enhancement in ph of the medium thus an optimum ph 7 is selected for further adsorption studies on cv dye the effect of ph on the adsorptive elimination of dye has also been examined on the basis of the point of zero charge phpzc of tasd the phpzc is the ph at which the surface of the adsorbent has net zero charge the phpzc of tasd was established to be 5 0 fig 5 inset this means that at ph phpzc the surface of tasd is protonated by the absorption of h ions resulting in an electrostatic repulsion with the cationic cv dye bulut and aydın 2006 pavan et al 2008 further at ph phpzc tasd surface bears negative charge which causes an electrostatic attraction between the cationic dye this clearly indicates that for the adsorption of the cationic dye the ph of the reaction mixture should be greater than 5 0 which further justify our selection of ph 7 0 as optimum ph 3 6 equilibrium studies adsorption isotherm signifies the interactions of adsorbate adsorbent at constant temperature and also shows the distribution of species between the solid and the liquid phases on the establishment of equilibrium the different constants associated with the various isotherm models are summarized in table 1 the langmuir isotherm model is not applicable in the present case as the experimental data results in a negative value of qm the observation was also reported in the case of uranium vi aspergillus fumigatus system wang et al 2010 in the freundlich isotherm the factor 1 n was calculated to be greater than unity suggesting that the adsorption of cv onto tasd is cooperative fig 6 fytianos et al 2000 this indicates that the adsorbed adsorbate has an effect on the adsorption of new adsorbate molecules liu 2015 further the r2 value for the temkin isotherm was obtained to be 0 9239 which is much lower than 0 9964 as found for the freundlich isotherm based on the correlation coefficient values for all the three models the most appropriate isotherm fitting the equilibrium data is freundlich adsorption model it is relevant to comment here that the adsorptive treatment of cv dye by other adsorbents other non conventional low cost adsorbents such as groundnut shell akinola and umar 2015 bean pod akinola and umar 2015 citrullus lanatus rind bharathi and ramesh 2012 fugas sawdust aljeboree 2016 palm kernel fiber el sayed 2011 and cyperus rotundus suyamboo and srikrishnaperumal 2014 has also been reported to follow the freundlich isotherm model the values of the various freundlich parameters reported by the investigators for the above mentioned adsorbents are compared with the present investigation in table 2 3 7 kinetics the different kinetic parameters so determined are summarized in table 3 the experimental value of qe is found to be in close agreement with that obtained from the slope of the pseudo first order kinetic plot fig 7 on comparing the values of r2 table 3 it is clear that the pseudo first order model r2 0 9962 is best one to represent the kinetics associated with the adsorption of cv onto tasd in literature the majority of work on different adsorbate adsorbent systems reports the validity of pseudo second order kinetics however in the present case the pseudo first order kinetic model has been observed to be validated the cogency of pseudo first order kinetics has also been testified by other investigators for the adsorption of cv on to various other adsorbents such as calotropis procera ali and muhammad 2008 carbonaceous slurry jain et al 2003 sagaun sawdust khattri and singh 2012 the values of the rate constants reported by these investigators are compared in table 4 3 8 adsorption mechanism the adsorption mechanism onto an adsorbent material may be due to the active functional groups available on it in order to elucidate of the active sites ftir spectrophotometric studies are usually performed the peaks observed in the ftir spectra may be assigned to different groups and bonds in accordance with their corresponding wavenumbers in the present investigation the surface properties of adsorbent were thoroughly analyzed as pointed out in section 3 1 that a major change in the ftir peak intensity occurred at 1735 cm 1 and 1636 cm 1 after the adsorption of cv dye the peaks at these wave numbers are respectively assigned to the vibration of the carbonyl group c o and presence of c c bond the interaction of the cationic cv adsorbate with the tasd adsorbent might possibly be due to the electrostatic attraction of the c o group of tasd the interaction of carbonyl group of adsorbent and positively charged quaternary ammonium group of the adsorbate has been shown in a representative diagram as fig 8 a similar mechanism assuming the electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged groups present in the cell wall of the grapefruit peel gfp and cationic dye molecule cv was suggested for the sorption of cv by gfp saeed et al 2010 an alternative adsorption mechanism based on the cv hydrogen ion exchange process may also be suggested tasd oh tasd o h tasd o cv cl tasd o cv cl tasd oh cv cl tasd o cv hcl in the above reactions the cationic cv dye molecular formula c25n3h30cl is represented as cv cl the possibility of this mechanism is supported by two facts i ftir studies indicate the presence of hydroxyl groups on the surface of adsorbent and ii the adsorption is poor at lower ph section 3 5 at lower ph the formation of hcl is suppressed any increase in ph favors the net reaction due to neutralization of hcl a similar mechanism was proposed for the adsorption of cv onto naoh modified rice husk chakraborty et al 2011 thus the adsorption of cv on the surface of tasd takes place either due to the electrostatic attraction between the c o group of tasd and quaternary ammonium group of cv or by the cv hydrogen ion exchange process it is also quite possible that both the mechanistic routes involve simultaneously 3 9 thermodynamics the feasibility of the adsorption of cv onto tasd and the thermodynamic parameters were evaluated by using the followings 11 ln k c h rt s r 12 g rt ln k c 13 g h t s where g kj mol 1 h kj mol 1 and s j k 1 mol 1 are the respective changes in gibbs free energy enthalpy and entropy kc is the equilibrium constant r is the gas constant 8 314 j k 1 mol 1 and t is the temperature k the values h and s were determined from the linear equation obtained from the ln kc versus 1 t plot fig 9 the various thermodynamic quantities obtained for the cv tasd system are incorporated in table 5 the adsorption process has been observed to be associated with the decrease in free energy change throughout the entire temperature range this reflects the spontaneous nature of adsorption this table shows that the negative values of free energy change increase with the increase of temperature this indicates that the feasibility of the process increases with the increase of temperature the positive value of enthalpy change showed the endothermic nature of adsorption i e the adsorption is associated with the absorption of heat from the environmental surroundings hence the spontaneity of the cv removal by tasd is only based on the entropy factor a positive value of 57 869 j k 1mol 1 states that there is an increase in randomness at the adsorbent adsorbate interface 3 10 desorption in order to ensure the long term re usability and explore the probability of retrieval of used tasd desorption studies were planned using five different media desorption of the used tasd was studied using 0 1 m hcl 0 1 m ch3cooh 0 1 m nacl 0 1 m naoh and dddw the percentage desorption was found to be highest in the case of 0 1 m naoh 2 86 followed by 0 1 m ch3cooh 1 85 and 0 1 m hcl 1 04 least desorption was observed in the case of 0 1 m nacl 0 99 and dddw 1 00 thus the most effective desorbing agent for the cv tasd system is naoh however in order to improve the desorption efficiency further work is required in this area 4 conclusions the terminalia arjuna sawdust tasd has been established to be an efficient adsorbent for the decontamination of water and wastewater containing crystal violet cv dye the dye treatment process has been observed to be dependent on the factors such as initial dye concentration adsorbate adsorbent contact time adsorbent dosage ph of the medium particle size and temperature the adsorption capacity has been found to increase with the increase of initial dye concentration and the equilibrium was achieved attained in 2 h for the effective decontamination of water containing cv dye by tasd adsorbent the ph of the medium should be greater than 5 the isotherm studies showed that the adsorption obeys freundlich isotherm model indicating the multilayer cooperative type adsorption thermodynamic studies confirmed that the adsorption process is spontaneous endothermic and accompanied by an increase in entropy at the solute solution interface it has been established that the feasibility of adsorptive removal of cv by tasd increases with the increase of temperature pseudo first order kinetic model is the best one to represent kinetic data naoh is found to be the best desorbing agent among hcl ch3cooh nacl naoh and dddw for the cv tasd system acknowledgement the authors are thankful to the chairman department of applied chemistry faculty of engineering and technology aligarh muslim university for
