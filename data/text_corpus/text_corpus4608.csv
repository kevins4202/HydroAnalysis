23040,two phase bubbly flows occur widely in nature and are extensively applied in industry the aeration processes underwater is one type of two phase bubbly flow that directly impacts on the downstream water quality by reducing the oxygen content in the water the most important influencing factors for optimization design of auto venting turbines avts for solving the low level of dissolved oxygen do in the discharged downstream water are the quantity of entrained air the bubble size distribution resulting from coalescence and breakage processes and the rate of oxygen transfer from the bubbles in order to better understand the influencing flow conditions on the bubble size distribution in this paper a numerical investigation for flow around naca0015 hydrofoil is carried out the numerical simulations require the consideration of the dynamic behaviors of two phase flow and bubbles undergoing coalescence and breakup for this purpose the ensemble averaged mass and momentum transport equations for continuous and dispersed phases are modeled within the two fluid modeling framework these equations are coupled with population balance equations pbe to aptly account for the coalescence and break up of the bubbles the resultant bubble size normalised velocity and void fraction distributions for different flow conditions including angle of attack aoa air entrainment coefficient and reynolds number are presented and discussed the results show that varying aoa has the most significant impact on the distribution of the bubbles in the wake keywords gas liquid flow bubble size distribution hydrofoil cavitation 1 introduction two phase flows are prevalent in nature and in industry cavitation is one type of two phase flows that occurs in many hydrodynamic applications e g hydrofoils hydrodynamic pumps propellers etc it happens when the pressure is dramatically reduced typically due to high speed flow or existence of a sharp object in the flow where the liquid medium breaks down leading to creation of some cavities in the liquid or vaporous bubbles cavitation could lead to bubbly flows during the underwater ventilation where the air is entrained inside water for example in turbine aeration clearly waters in lakes rivers reservoirs and underground aquifers are of most importance for people and to the world s ecological systems daskiran et al 2017 however hydroelectric facilities discharge water with low dissolved oxygen which impacts on the downstream water quality especially at greater depths auto venting turbine avt march et al 1992 is one of the techniques proposed for solving the low dissolved oxygen do level in the discharged downstream water avt selects the locations of the turbine where the aeration could be satisfactorily performed by increasing the do of the discharged water while keeping the efficiency of the system in the acceptable range by computing the pressures velocities and turbulence levels throughout a turbine s flow passageway however there is limited research on optimization design of avts in which the most important influencing factors are the quantity of entrained air the bubble size distribution resulted from coalescence and breakage processes and the rate of oxygen transfer from the bubbles the interactions of the bubbles including the bubble coalescence and breakup as well as the bubble deformation process determine the bubble size distribution in the wake of the hydrofoil these processes are governed by the flow conditions and system configurations including the reynolds number air ventilation flow rate and angle of attack of hydrofoil the impact of the operating conditions such as the air ventilation rate liquid velocity etc on the resultant bubble size distribution in the wake which will subsequently influence on the dissolved oxygen amount in the downstream water through the bubbles interfacial area thompson and gulliver 1997 needs to be investigated one of the methods to investigate the bubble size distribution which would help to understand the underlying physics and tackle the problem of optimization design of avts is through computational fluid dynamics recently daskiran daskiran et al 2017 investigated the dissolved oxygen characteristics in water through computational fluid dynamics they conducted a parametric study for a two dimensional geometry by adopting eulerian multiphase model their results could help the design and optimization of energy harvesting devices like translating blades zhou et al 2013 employed direct numerical simulations dns coupled with lagrangian particle dynamics lpd to numerically investigate the bubble dispersion over a hydrofoil they found that bubble stream deflection increases with increasing angle of attack hsiao et al 2013 performed a numerical and experimental investigation on bubble entrainment and the resultant bubbly wake due to horizontal plunging jet they employed an eulerian lagrangian one way coupled two phase flow model which could capture the flow structures velocity field and overall bubble spreading region near the plunging region krepper et al 2009 investigated the polydispersed bubbly two phase flow around an obstacle they considered the coalescence and breakup phenomena and momentum interphase transfers related to drag and lift forces also kerdouss et al 2006 carried out simulations for a double impeller stirred tank since the stirred tanks could improve the dissolution performance through the momentum mixing of one or more impellers they could obtain the bubble diameter in the tank and the gas volume fraction they observed that the impeller induces small eddies that break the bubbles hence smaller bubbles are located around the impeller min et al 2008 conducted cfd simulations for three impeller agitators they concluded that bubble coalescence and breakup needs to be accounted for accurately capturing a local gas holdup in the stirred tank consequently a detailed numerical simulation considering coalescence and breakup of the bubbles is necessary to obtain the bubble size distribution in this paper the numerical investigation on the bubble size distribution around naca0015 hydrofoil is conducted to ensure that our model on population balance modelling cheung et al 2010 is capturing the coalescence and breakage processes cheung et al 2013 deju et al 2013 and the proposed mechanistic model for predicting the bubble size distribution in bubbly flows cheung et al 2014 yeoh et al 2014 vahaji et al 2017 performs correctly the results are validated against the existing experimental data on a ventilated hydrofoil in a closed loop water channel performed by karn et al karn et al 2015a b c karn et al 2015a b c karn et al 2015a b c karn et al 2016 accordingly a systematic numerical investigation on bubbly wake of naca0015 hydrofoil is carried out under different conditions including angle of attack aoa air entrainment coefficient and reynolds number to allow the study of their influence on the bubble size distribution in the bubbly wake 2 mathematical modelling 2 1 two fluid model ensemble averaged of mass momentum and energy transport equations are considered for each phase in the eulerian eulerian modelling framework the liquid phase is the continuum whose volume fraction is shown as α l and the vapour phase bubbles is the disperse phase whose volume fraction is shown as α g these equations can be written as continuity equation of liquid phase 1 ρ l α l t ρ l α l u l γ l g continuity equation of vapour phase 2 ρ g α g f i t ρ g α g u g s i f i γ l g momentum equation of liquid phase 3 ρ l α l u l t ρ l α l u l u l α l p α l ρ l g α l μ l e u l u l t γ l g u g γ g l u l f l g momentum equation of

range of bubble classes that are present in the population balance model for the vapour phase the interfacial force f lg appearing in equation 3 is formulated through appropriate consideration of different sub forces affecting the interface between each phase for the liquid phase the interfacial force comprises the sum of the sub forces such as drag lift wall lubrication and turbulent dispersion respectively note that for the gas phase f gl x202f x202f f lg detail descriptions of these forces can be found in anglart and nylund 1996 and lahey jr and drew 2001 briefly interphase momentum transfer between gas and liquid due to drag force is given by 5 f l g d r a g 1 8 c d a i f ρ l u g u l u g u l lift force in terms of the slip velocity and the curl of the liquid phase velocity is described by 6 f l g l i f t α g ρ l c l u g u l u l wall lubrication force is the force that appears when the rising bubble approaches the wall at the close proximity of the wall drainage of the fluid around the bubble which is usually uniform changes significantly the drainage rate on the wall side decreases due to no slip boundary condition and on the opposite side increases which results in creating a hydrodynamic force that acts in the normal direction away from the wall and decays with distance from the wall the wall lubrication force is expressed by 7 f l g l u b r i c a t i o n α g ρ g u g u l d s m a x 0 c w 1 c w 2 d s y w n turbulent dispersion force acts as a turbulent diffusion in dispersed flows for example for a boiling flow in a heated vertical pipe vapour is generated on heated wall surfaces the turbulent dispersion force plays a crucial role in driving the vapour away from the vicinity of the wall towards the centre of the pipe turbulence dispersion taken as a function of turbulent kinetic energy and gradient of the void fraction of the liquid yields in the form of 8 f lg t u r b u l e n t d i s p e r s i o n c t d ρ l κ α l the drag coefficient c d in equation 5 has been correlated for several distinct reynolds number regions for individual bubbles according to ishii and zuber 1979 the constant c l takes a value of 0 01 wang et al 1987 the wall lubrication constants c w1 and c w2 as suggested by antal et al 1991 are 0 01 and 0 05 respectively recommended value for c td according to kurul and podowski 1990 of 0 1 is used for the turbulent dispersion force 2 2 population balance modelling population balance equations pbes have been applied in many diverse applications that involve particulate systems theoretically the changes of bubble size distribution and its evolution can be captured by the population balance equation pbe pbes are developed in integro differential form that are accompanied by coalescence and breakup kernels in order to solve the pbes for practical systems many numerical methods have been proposed the class method cm is one of the existing methods for solving pbe that is widely adopted in cm the internal coordinate for example the particle volume is discretised into a finite series of classes bins in literature encouraging results can be found for using cm in the form of musig multi size group model for simulating bubbly flows olmos et al 2001 pohorecki et al 2001 frank et al 2004 yeoh and tu 2004 yeoh and tu 2005 cheung et al 2007a b cheung et al 2007a b cheung et al 2008 in the musig model a number of transport equations and mechanistic bubble coalescence and breakup kernels are solved for each discrete bubble class in the cfd framework to predict the evolution of the bubble size distribution in pbe a desired quantity e g volume fraction or the number density is conserved for each discrete bubble class whose conservation is evaluated through coalescence and breakup mechanisms the solution of these equations results in the population balance of bubbles the particle bubble size distribution is calculated according to the population balance equation that is generally expressed in an integro differential form 9 f x ξ t t v x ξ t f x ξ t s x ξ t where f x ξ t is the particle bubble number density distribution per unit mixture and particle bubble volume v x ξ t is velocity vector in external space dependent on the external variables x for a given time t and the internal space ξ whose components could be characteristic dimensions such as volume mass etc on the right hand side the term s x ξ t contains the particle bubble source sink rates per unit mixture volume due to the particle bubble interactions such as coalescence break up and phase change homogeneous musig represents the most commonly used technique for solving pbe the discrete form of the number density equation expressed in terms of size fraction f i of m bubble size groups can be written as 10 ρ j g α j g f i t u g ρ j g α j g f i s i in the above equation s i represents the net change in the number density distribution due to coalescence and break up processes this entails the use of a fixed non uniform volume distribution along a grid which allows a range of large sizes to be covered with a small number of bins and yet still offers good resolution such discretisation of the population balance equation has been found to allow for accurate determination of the desired characteristics of the number density distribution the interaction term s i b c b b d c d b contains the source rates of b c b b d c and d b which are the birth rates due to coalescence b c and break up b d and the death rates to coalescence d c and break up b b of bubbles respectively for coalescence between fluid particles the coalescence efficiency a m i m j could be calculated as a product of collision frequency h m i m j and coalescence efficiency λ m i m j 11 a m i m j h m i m j λ m i m j in this paper the turbulent random collision is considered for the bubble coalescence proposed by prince blanch prince and blanch 1990 the coalescence rate in terms of mass can be expressed as liao and lucas 2010 12 a m i m j π 4 d i d j 2 u t i 2 u t j 2 0 5 exp t i j τ i j where τ i j is the contact time for two bubbles given by d i j 2 2 3 ϵ l 1 3 and t i j is the time required for two bubbles to coalesce having diameters d i and d j which is estimated to be ϑ 0 5 ln h 0 h f the equivalent diameter d i j is calculated based on the proposal by chesters and hofman 1982 d i j 2 d i 2 d j 1 the initial film thickness h 0 1 10 4 m and critical film thickness h f 1 10 8 m at which rupture occurs for air water systems have been employed the turbulent velocity u t in the inertial sub range of isotropic turbulence is given by rotta u t 2 ϵ l 1 3 d 1 3 for breakup of fluid particles the partial breakage frequency r m i m j is a function of total breakage frequency r m i and the daughter size distribution β m i m j 13 β m i m j r m i m j r m i the bubble binary break up under isotropic turbulence situation is considered for the bubble breakage proposed by luo and svendsen 1996 in this model a stochastic break up volume fraction f b v is used for the daughter size distribution the break up rate in terms of mass can be obtained as 14 r m i m j c 1 α g ϵ d j 2 1 3 ξ m i n 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 exp 12 c f σ β ρ l ϵ l 2 3 d 5 3 ξ 11 3 d ξ where c f f b v 2 3 1 f b v 2 3 1 is the increase coefficient of surface area ξ λ d j is the size ratio between an eddy and a particle in the inertial sub range and consequently ξ m i n λ m i n d j and c 0 923 and β 2 0 are determined from fundamental consideration of the break up of drops or bubbles in turbulent dispersion systems 3 experimental details experimental data of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c is used in this study for investigating the bubble size distribution at the wake of the hydrofoil at different flow conditions the experiments were conducted in the safl high speed water tunnel at university of minnesota the test section s dimensions in the water tunnel are 1 x202f m length x202f x202f 0 19 x202f m width x202f x202f 0 19 x202f m height the naca0015 hydrofoil used in the experiments has a span of 190 x202f mm and a chord length of 81 x202f mm a narrow span wise slot was carved near the leading edge of the hydrofoil so that air could be injected for creating a dense bubbly wake they used particle shadow velocimetry psv technique to capture the bubble images at different downstream locations in the wake they carried out three different sets of experiments in the first set of experiments the air entrainment coefficient c q q u c s where q u c and s are air ventilation flow rate liquid velocity hydrofoil chord and span respectively and reynolds number r e u c ν were fixed and the angle of attack was changed the other two sets of experiments were performed at zero angle of attack in the second set of experiments the air entrainment coefficient was fixed and experiments were repeated at different reynolds numbers whereas in the third set of experiments the reynolds number was fixed and the air entrainment coefficient was changing 4 numerical details the conservation equations for mass momentum and energy of each phase are discretised using the finite volume technique for a 2d geometry in ansys cfx 17 2 the geometry was borrowed from karn et al karn et al 2015a b c where a naca0015 hydrofoil with the span of 0 19 x202f m and a chord length of 0 081 x202f m was used air was discharged from the injection slot at an angle of 45 to the hydrofoil chord the computational domain air injection slot and specific definition of injection angle are illustrated in figs 1 and 2 respectively appropriate meshing techniques were employed to mesh the computational domain with structured grids quadrilateral grid resulting in 174200 grids in total the near wall regions are refined for more accurate predictions of the flow behaviour in the boundary layer fig 3 demonstrates the mesh around the hydrofoil in the computational domain in this study sixteen bubble classes with minimum diameter of 0 000125 x202f m and the maximum diameter of 0 002 x202f m are initialised for the dispersed phases to represent the characteristics of the dispersed phase in the musig model this means sixteen more transport equations which are progressively solved and coupled with the flow equations during the simulations the turbulent flows are simulated based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for both carrier and dispersed phases 5 results and discussion two phase gas liquid flows in the wake of naca0015 at different conditions were simulated to study the effects of air discharging configurations on the interactions between the carrier fluid flow and bubbles the investigated flow conditions are summarized in tables 1 3 in these tables q is air volume flow rate u is liquid velocity c is the hydrofoil chord length 0 081 x202f m s is hydrofoil span length 0 19 x202f m ν is kinematic viscosity μ is dynamic viscosity and aoa is angle of attack due to the different interactions between the turbulent flow and bubbles the final distributions of bubbles are varying depending on the discharging configurations 5 1 validation the simulation results are first validated against the existing experimental data of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c for this purpose the bubble size distribution profiles in the form of probability density function pdf for two different air discharging conditions are compared against the existing experimental data in fig 4 in this figure the angle of attack aoa is zero and reynolds number re is equal to 4 1e5 the air entrainment coefficient cq is 1 6e 4 for fig 4a and cq x202f x202f 1 1e 4 for fig 4b the length scale used in defining the reynolds number is hydrofoil chord r e u c ν and the air entrainment coefficient was borrowed from karn et al karn et al 2015a b c studies which is defined similar to other ventilated cavitation studies laali and michel 1984 in these figures the bubble size distribution is bimodal which is similar to the findings of other researchers tse et al 2003 karn et al 2015a b c two modes are at 0 3 and 0 62 x202f mm with more bubbles in the smaller size first mode that shows many small bubbles exist in the bubbly wake of the hydrofoil 5 2 impact of different angle of attacks aoa the impact of changing the angle of attack of hydrofoil on bubble size distribution is investigated in this section fig 5 shows the bubble diameter distribution at 4 65c downstream the hydrofoil centre of rotation for different aoas by increasing the angle of attack the bubble size decreases it is evident from the bubble size distribution profile where the smallest size group significantly increases from 10 at zero aoa to 17 at 6 aoa to 30 at 10 aoa the reason goes back to the fact that as the air is discharged from the ventilation slot it gets disturbed by the liquid turbulent velocity fluctuations which leads to breakup of the air jet into small bubbles on one hand the turbulence in the wake downstream of a hydrofoil directly impacts on the bubble size and the velocity in the wake on the other hand the bubble velocity fluctuations impact on the local liquid velocities fig 6 depicts the wake velocity distribution at 4 65c downstream of the hydrofoil centre of rotation for different aoa this figure shows that the bubble velocity in the wake varies within 15 with the lowest velocities near the centreline of wake it shows that the velocities decrease vertically from both sides however the wake is not symmetrical about the line where the minimum velocity occurs this could be caused by the dispersion of the bubbles with different sizes at different locations for example larger bubbles tend to rise within the wake due to buoyancy force karn et al karn et al 2015a b c observed that the larger bubbles have slightly lower velocities compared to tiny bubbles that follow the liquid streamlines more closely karn et al 2015a b c however since in these simulations we are adopting homogeneous musig population balance modelling this phenomenon could not be reflected in our simulation results in our results the wake velocity distribution is almost symmetrical around the minimum velocity line another interesting observation is that within the same location downstream of the hydrofoil increasing the aoa causes the minimum velocity to drift upwards and experience more fluctuations in the wake velocity from 9 variation at zero aoa to 13 at 6 aoa to 15 at 10 aoa the void fraction contours for varying aoa are presented in fig 7 this figure clearly demonstrates the vortex generation and vortex shedding phenomena by increasing the aoa to 10 in order to have a closer examination on the void fraction distribution downstream the discharging slot the local void fractions at 1 34c 3c and 4 65c for varying aoa are presented in fig 8 in this figure the maximum local void fraction for aoa x202f x202f 0 fig 8a can get as high as 0 951 x202f at 1 34c downstream hydrofoil and is reached below the centreline which is caused based on the fact that air is discharged from the slot that is located at 6 x202f mm below the centreline the void fraction distribution along transverse vertical direction is almost symmetrical about the location of discharging slot also as expected the void fraction is reduced farther away from the hydrofoil less void fraction is observed at 3c and much less at 4 65c as shown if fig 8a c the greater void fraction close to the discharging slot could be attributed to both larger number of bubbles and greater size of bubbles moreover the maximum void fraction value decreases by increasing aoa from 0 951 x202f at aoa x202f x202f 0 to 0 437 x202f at aoa x202f x202f 6 to 0 125 x202f at aoa x202f x202f 10 which indicates that the bubbles are dispersed more effectively at larger aoas the variation of aoa of hydrofoil is expected to also cause a drift in the bubbly wake downstream in order to examine the dispersion of the gas phase more closely the area average of gas phase void fraction vs x direction for different angles of attack is demonstrated in fig 9 in this figure the area average is evaluated on the vertical lines y dimension where y is limited to 0 01 x202f m x202f x202f y x202f x202f 0 015 x202f m to capture the location where the most variation of the void fraction is happening in this figure it is clearly shown that by increasing the angle of attack less void fraction is observed at farthest downstream also the oscillation of vortices impacts on the distribution of the void fraction which is clearly observed in the case of angle of attack equal to 10 5 3 impact of different air entrainment coefficients in this section the influence of air entrainment coefficient c q on the bubble size distribution is studied fig 10 presents the bubble size distribution at 4 65c downstream the hydrofoil at the centre of rotation with air entrainment coefficients changing from 1 1e 4 to 4 4e 4 as the c q is increased bubbles interactions and collisions increase that lead to greater breakup rate of bubbles resulting in smaller size of the bubbles therefore at higher c q there is a greater fraction of small size bubbles interestingly there is also a greater fraction of medium size bubbles for higher c q the experiments of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c suggest that bubbles are more closely spaced at a higher c q these bubbles located at the vicinity of each other would interact effectively resulting in the coalescence in the bubbly wake which leads to increase in the number of bubbles in intermediate size range as well tse et al 2003 it is also expected that since by increasing c q the net amount of air ventilated per unit time is also increased larger values of c q result in a larger number of bubbles in fig 11 the wake velocity distribution for varying c q at 4 65c downstream hydrofoil is demonstrated the bubble velocity in the wake for all c q conditions varies within 10 of the stream velocity also as mentioned earlier the minimum velocity occurs below the centreline of the hydrofoil due to the air discharge at 6 x202f mm below the hydrofoil s centreline in addition the largest value of c q experiences the highest value of velocity amongst the cases studied in fig 12 the void fraction contour plots for different c q conditions are presented clearly by increasing the c q larger areas with high void fraction have resulted consequently when the air is discharged at higher c q the bubbles are dispersed at higher concentrations with larger values of void fraction in similar areas compared to lower values of c q the wake is spread more in larger c q value which leads to greater breakup events and results in having smaller size bubbles as was earlier shown in fig 10 fig 13 provides the prospect for a closer examination of local void fraction plot in this figure the local void fraction contour plots for varying c q at 1 34c 3c and 4 65c downstream of the hydrofoil are presented the maximum value of void fraction varies by changing the air ventilation rate 0 53 x202f at c q equal to 1 1e 4 to 0 998 x202f at c q equal to 2 2e 4 to 1 0 x202f at c q equal to 4 4e 4 for all of the cases the maximum void fraction occurs below the hydrofoil centreline due to discharging air from the slot that is located below the centreline the bubbles disperse in an almost symmetrical distribution in the transverse vertical direction resulting in a similar void fraction distribution for all cases 5 4 impact of different reynolds numbers changing the flow condition by varying the reynolds number has direct impact on the bubble size distribution at the wake of the hydrofoil however it has insignificant impact on both the average bubble size and the void fraction distribution in the wake of the hydrofoil in fig 14 the bubble size distribution at 4 65c downstream of the hydrofoil at the centre of rotation for different reynolds numbers changing from 2 4e5 to 8 1e5 is presented this figure shows that by increasing the reynolds number the fraction of smallest bubble size increases from 7 to 27 for the range of reynolds numbers investigated in this study however opposite trend is observed for the second smallest bubble size 0 25 x202f mm by increasing the reynolds number the fraction of the bubble decreases from 30 to 13 consequently changing the reynolds number does not have a significant impact on the average bubble size in the wake of the hydrofoil this finding is aligned with experimental findings of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c in fig 15 the wake velocity distribution at different reynolds numbers is presented the velocity in this graph is normalised versus the free stream velocity therefore all three conditions exhibit similar behaviour in the wake in terms of non dimensional velocity distribution the void fraction contour plots for different reynolds numbers are presented in fig 16 in this figure by increasing the reynolds number no significant variation is observed in the void fraction distribution in the wake of the hydrofoil in order to have a closer examination of the void fraction distribution for varying reynolds numbers in fig 17 the void fraction at 1 34c 3c and 4 65c downstream the hydrofoil for 2 1e5 4 1e5 6 1e5 and 8 1e5 is displayed the maximum void fraction in this figure slightly changes from 0 521 to 0 537 by increasing the reynolds number from 2 1e5 to 8 1e5 6 conclusion in this paper numerical simulation of two phase bubbly flow in the wake of naca0015 hydrofoil is investigated and validated against the experimental data of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c a systematic numerical investigation on bubbly wake of naca0015 hydrofoil is carried out under different conditions including angle of attack aoa air entrainment coefficient and reynolds number to allow the study of the influence of these parameters on the bubble size distribution in the bubbly wake the results show that aoa has significant impact on the bubble size distribution velocity distribution and void fraction distribution in the wake the bubble size is reduced by increasing the angle of attack due to the higher turbulence imposed by larger aoa change in aoa also creates a drift in the location where the minimum velocity occurs in the wake which is an upward drift by increasing the aoa also by increasing the aoa the bubbles are dispersed more effectively within the wake increasing the air entrainment coefficient results in production of smaller size bubbles due to higher collision and break up rate of bubbles also with higher air entrainment coefficient larger areas with higher void fraction are observed downstream the hydrofoil changing the reynolds number does not have significant influence on the average bubble size in the wake of the hydrofoil similarly the void fraction distribution is not drastically changed by varying the reynolds number however reynolds number has direct impact on the bubble size distribution at the wake of the hydrofoil acknowledgement the authors are grateful for the support provided by australia china centre for maritime engineering accme project no acsrf48199

23040,two phase bubbly flows occur widely in nature and are extensively applied in industry the aeration processes underwater is one type of two phase bubbly flow that directly impacts on the downstream water quality by reducing the oxygen content in the water the most important influencing factors for optimization design of auto venting turbines avts for solving the low level of dissolved

transport equations for continuous and dispersed phases are modeled within the two fluid modeling framework these equations are coupled with population balance equations pbe to aptly account for the coalescence and break up of the bubbles the resultant bubble size normalised velocity and void fraction distributions for different flow conditions including angle of attack aoa air entrainment coefficient and reynolds number are presented and discussed the results show that varying aoa has the most significant impact on the distribution of the bubbles in the wake keywords gas liquid flow bubble size distribution hydrofoil cavitation 1 introduction two phase flows are prevalent in nature and in industry cavitation is one type of two phase flows that occurs in many hydrodynamic applications e g hydrofoils hydrodynamic pumps propellers etc it happens when the pressure is dramatically reduced typically due to high speed flow or existence of a sharp object in the flow where the liquid medium breaks down leading to creation of some cavities in the liquid or vaporous bubbles cavitation could lead to bubbly flows during the underwater ventilation where the air is entrained inside water for example in turbine aeration clearly waters in lakes rivers reservoirs and underground aquifers are of most importance for people and to the world s ecological systems daskiran et al 2017 however hydroelectric facilities discharge water with low dissolved oxygen which impacts on the downstream water quality especially at greater depths auto venting turbine avt march et al 1992 is one of the techniques proposed for solving the low dissolved oxygen do level in the discharged downstream water avt selects the locations of the turbine where the aeration could be satisfactorily performed by increasing the do of the discharged water while keeping the efficiency of the system in the acceptable range by computing the pressures velocities and turbulence levels throughout a turbine s flow passageway however there is limited research on optimization design of avts in which the most important influencing factors are the quantity of entrained air the bubble size distribution resulted from coalescence and breakage processes and the rate of oxygen transfer from the bubbles the interactions of the bubbles including the bubble coalescence and breakup as well as the bubble deformation process determine the bubble size distribution in the wake of the hydrofoil these processes are governed by the flow conditions and system configurations including the reynolds number air ventilation flow rate and angle of attack of hydrofoil the impact of the operating conditions such as the air ventilation rate liquid velocity etc on the resultant bubble size distribution in the wake which will subsequently influence on the dissolved oxygen amount in the downstream water through the bubbles interfacial area thompson and gulliver 1997 needs to be investigated one of the methods to investigate the bubble size distribution which would help to understand the underlying physics and tackle the problem of optimization design of avts is through computational fluid dynamics recently daskiran daskiran et al 2017 investigated the dissolved oxygen characteristics in water through computational fluid dynamics they conducted a parametric study for a two dimensional geometry by adopting eulerian multiphase model their results could help the design and optimization of energy harvesting devices like translating blades zhou et al 2013 employed direct numerical simulations dns coupled with lagrangian particle dynamics lpd to numerically investigate the bubble dispersion over a hydrofoil they found that bubble stream deflection increases with increasing angle of attack hsiao et al 2013 performed a numerical and experimental investigation on bubble entrainment and the resultant bubbly wake due to horizontal plunging jet they employed an eulerian lagrangian one way coupled two phase flow model which could capture the flow structures velocity field and overall bubble spreading region near the plunging region krepper et al 2009 investigated the polydispersed bubbly two phase flow around an obstacle they considered the coalescence and breakup phenomena and momentum interphase transfers related to drag and lift forces also kerdouss et al 2006 carried out simulations for a double impeller stirred tank since the stirred tanks could improve the dissolution performance through the momentum mixing of one or more impellers they could obtain the bubble diameter in the tank and the gas volume fraction they observed that the impeller induces small eddies that break the bubbles hence smaller bubbles are located around the impeller min et al 2008 conducted cfd simulations for three impeller agitators they concluded that bubble coalescence and breakup needs to be accounted for accurately capturing a local gas holdup in the stirred tank consequently a detailed numerical simulation considering coalescence and breakup of the bubbles is necessary to obtain the bubble size distribution in this paper the numerical investigation on the bubble size distribution around naca0015 hydrofoil is conducted to ensure that our model on population balance modelling cheung et al 2010 is capturing the coalescence and breakage processes cheung et al 2013 deju et al 2013 and the proposed mechanistic model for predicting the bubble size distribution in bubbly flows cheung et al 2014 yeoh et al 2014 vahaji et al 2017 performs correctly the results are validated against the existing experimental data on a ventilated hydrofoil in a closed loop water channel performed by karn et al karn et al 2015a b c karn et al 2015a b c karn et al 2015a b c karn et al 2016 accordingly a systematic numerical investigation on bubbly wake of naca0015 hydrofoil is carried out under different conditions including angle of attack aoa air entrainment coefficient and reynolds number to allow the study of their influence on the bubble size distribution in the bubbly wake 2 mathematical modelling 2 1 two fluid model ensemble averaged of mass momentum and energy transport equations are considered for each phase in the eulerian eulerian modelling framework the liquid phase is the continuum whose volume fraction is shown as α l and the vapour phase bubbles is the disperse phase whose volume fraction is shown as α g these equations can be written as continuity equation of liquid phase 1 ρ l α l t ρ l α l u l γ l g continuity equation of vapour phase 2 ρ g α g f i t ρ g α g u g s i f i γ l g momentum equation of liquid phase 3 ρ l α l u l t ρ l α l u l u l α l p α l ρ l g α l μ l e u l u l t γ l g u g γ g l u l f l g momentum equation of

range of bubble classes that are present in the population balance model for the vapour phase the interfacial force f lg appearing in equation 3 is formulated through appropriate consideration of different sub forces affecting the interface between each phase for the liquid phase the interfacial force comprises the sum of the sub forces such as drag lift wall lubrication and turbulent dispersion respectively note that for the gas phase f gl x202f x202f f lg detail descriptions of these forces can be found in anglart and nylund 1996 and lahey jr and drew 2001 briefly interphase momentum transfer between gas and liquid due to drag force is given by 5 f l g d r a g 1 8 c d a i f ρ l u g u l u g u l lift force in terms of the slip velocity and the curl of the liquid phase velocity is described by 6 f l g l i f t α g ρ l c l u g u l u l wall lubrication force is the force that appears when the rising bubble approaches the wall at the close proximity of the wall drainage of the fluid around the bubble which is usually uniform changes significantly the drainage rate on the wall side decreases due to no slip boundary condition and on the opposite side increases which results in creating a hydrodynamic force that acts in the normal direction away from the wall and decays with distance from the wall the wall lubrication force is expressed by 7 f l g l u b r i c a t

generated on heated wall surfaces the turbulent dispersion force plays a crucial role in driving the vapour away from the vicinity of the wall towards the centre of the pipe turbulence dispersion taken as a function of turbulent kinetic energy and gradient of the void fraction of the liquid yields in the form of 8 f lg t u r b u l e n t d i s p e r s i o n c t d ρ l κ α l the drag coefficient c d in equation 5 has been correlated for several distinct reynolds number regions for individual bubbles according to ishii and zuber 1979 the constant c l takes a value of 0 01 wang et al 1987 the wall lubrication constants c w1 and c w2 as suggested by antal et al 1991 are 0 01 and 0 05 respectively recommended value for c td according to kurul and podowski 1990 of 0 1 is used for the turbulent dispersion force 2 2 population balance modelling population balance equations pbes have been applied in many diverse applications that involve particulate systems theoretically the changes of bubble size distribution and its evolution can be captured by the population balance equation pbe pbes are developed in integro differential form that are accompanied by coalescence and breakup kernels in order to solve the pbes for practical systems many numerical methods have been proposed the class method cm is one of the existing methods for solving pbe that is widely adopted in cm the internal coordinate for example the particle volume is discretised into a finite series of classes bins in literature encouraging results can be found for using cm in the form of musig multi size group model for simulating bubbly flows olmos et al 2001 pohorecki et al 2001 frank et al 2004 yeoh and tu 2004 yeoh and tu 2005 cheung et al 2007a b cheung et al 2007a b cheung et al 2008 in the musig model a number of transport equations and mechanistic bubble coalescence and breakup kernels are solved for each discrete bubble class in the cfd framework to predict the evolution of the bubble size distribution in pbe a desired quantity e g volume fraction or the number density is conserved for each discrete bubble class whose conservation is evaluated through coalescence and breakup mechanisms the solution of these equations results in the population balance of bubbles the particle bubble size distribution is calculated according to the population balance equation that is generally expressed in an integro differential form 9 f x ξ t t v x ξ t f x ξ t s x ξ t where f x ξ t is the particle bubble number density distribution per unit mixture and particle bubble volume v x ξ t is velocity vector in external space dependent on the external variables x for a given time t and the internal space ξ whose components could be characteristic dimensions such as volume mass etc on the right hand side the term s x ξ t contains the particle bubble source sink rates per unit mixture volume due to the particle bubble interactions such as coalescence break up and phase change homogeneous musig represents the most commonly used technique for solving pbe the discrete form of the number density equation expressed in terms of size fraction f i of m bubble size groups can be written as 10 ρ j g α j g f i t u g ρ j g α j g f i s i in the above equation s i represents the net change in the number density distribution due to coalescence and break up processes this entails the use of a fixed non uniform volume distribution along a grid which allows a range of large sizes to be covered with a small number of bins and yet still offers good resolution such discretisation of the population balance equation has been found to allow for accurate determination of the desired characteristics of the number density distribution the interaction term s i b c b b d c d b contains the source rates of b c b b d c and d b which are the birth rates due to coalescence b c and break up b d and the death rates to coalescence d c and break up b b of bubbles respectively for coalescence between fluid particles the coalescence efficiency a m i m j could be calculated as a product of collision frequency h m i m j and coalescence efficiency λ m i m j 11 a m i m j h m i m j λ m i m j in this paper the turbulent random collision is considered for the bubble coalescence proposed by prince blanch prince and blanch 1990 the coalescence rate in terms of mass can be expressed as liao and lucas 2010 12 a m i m j π 4 d i d j 2 u t i 2 u t j 2 0 5 exp t i j τ i j where τ i j is the contact time for two bubbles given by d i j 2 2 3 ϵ l 1 3 and t i j is the time required for two bubbles to coalesce having diameters d i and d j which is estimated to be ϑ 0 5 ln h 0 h f the equivalent diameter d i j is calculated based on the proposal by chesters and hofman 1982 d i j 2 d i 2 d j 1 the initial film thickness h 0 1 10 4 m and critical film thickness h f 1 10 8 m at which rupture occurs for air water systems have been employed the turbulent velocity u t in the inertial sub range of isotropic turbulence is given by rotta u t 2 ϵ l 1 3 d 1 3 for breakup of fluid particles the partial breakage frequency r m i m j is a function of total breakage frequency r m i and the daughter size distribution β m i m j 13 β m i m j r m i m j r m i the bubble binary break up under isotropic turbulence situation is considered for the bubble breakage proposed by luo and svendsen 1996 in this model a stochastic break up volume fraction f b v is used for the daughter size distribution the break up rate in terms of mass can be obtained as 14 r m i m j c 1 α g ϵ d j 2 1 3 ξ m i n 1 1 ξ 2 ξ 11 3 exp 12 c f σ β ρ l ϵ l 2 3 d 5 3 ξ 11 3 d ξ where c f f b v 2 3 1 f b v 2 3 1 is the increase coefficient of surface area ξ λ d j is the size ratio between an eddy and a particle in the inertial sub range and consequently ξ m i n λ m i n d j and c 0 923 and β 2 0 are determined from fundamental consideration of the break up of drops or bubbles in turbulent dispersion systems 3 experimental details experimental data of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c is used in this study for investigating the bubble size distribution at the wake of the hydrofoil at different flow conditions the experiments were conducted in the safl high speed water tunnel at university of minnesota the test section s dimensions in the water tunnel are 1 x202f m length x202f x202f 0 19 x202f m width x202f x202f 0 19 x202f m height the naca0015 hydrofoil used in the experiments has a span of 190 x202f mm and a chord length of 81 x202f mm a narrow span wise slot was carved near the leading edge of the hydrofoil so that air could be injected for creating a dense bubbly wake they used particle shadow velocimetry psv technique to capture the bubble images at different downstream locations in the wake they carried out three different sets of experiments in the first set of experiments the air entrainment coefficient c q q u c s where q u c and s are air ventilation flow rate liquid velocity hydrofoil chord and span respectively and reynolds number r e u c ν were fixed and the angle of attack was changed the other two sets of experiments were performed at zero angle of attack in the second set of experiments the air entrainment coefficient was fixed and experiments were repeated at different reynolds numbers whereas in the third set of experiments the reynolds number was fixed and the air entrainment coefficient was changing 4 numerical details the conservation equations for mass momentum and energy of each phase are discretised using the finite volume technique for a 2d geometry in ansys cfx 17 2 the geometry was borrowed from karn et al karn et al 2015a b c where a naca0015 hydrofoil with the span of 0 19 x202f m and a chord length of 0 081 x202f m was used air was discharged from the injection slot at an angle of 45 to the hydrofoil chord the computational domain air injection slot and specific definition of injection angle are illustrated in figs 1 and 2 respectively appropriate meshing techniques were employed to mesh the computational domain with structured grids quadrilateral grid resulting in 174200 grids in total the near wall regions are refined for more accurate predictions of the flow behaviour in the boundary layer fig 3 demonstrates the mesh around the hydrofoil in the computational domain in this study sixteen bubble classes with minimum diameter of 0 000125 x202f m and the maximum diameter of 0 002 x202f m are initialised for the dispersed phases to represent the characteristics of the dispersed phase in the musig model this means sixteen more transport equations which are progressively solved and coupled with the flow equations during the simulations the turbulent flows are simulated based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations for both carrier and dispersed phases 5 results and discussion two phase gas liquid flows in the wake of naca0015 at different conditions were simulated to study the effects of air discharging configurations on the interactions between the carrier fluid flow and bubbles the investigated flow conditions are summarized in tables 1 3 in these tables q is air volume flow rate u is liquid velocity c is the hydrofoil chord length 0 081 x202f m s is hydrofoil span length 0 19 x202f m ν is kinematic viscosity μ is dynamic viscosity and aoa is angle of attack due to the different interactions between the turbulent flow and bubbles the final distributions of bubbles are varying depending on the discharging configurations 5 1 validation the simulation results are first validated against the existing experimental data of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c for this purpose the bubble size distribution profiles in the form of probability density function pdf for two different air discharging conditions are compared against the existing experimental data in fig 4 in this figure the angle of attack aoa is zero and reynolds number re is equal to 4 1e5 the air entrainment coefficient cq is 1 6e 4 for fig 4a and cq x202f x202f 1 1e 4 for fig 4b the length scale used in defining the reynolds number is hydrofoil chord r e u c ν and the air entrainment coefficient was borrowed from karn et al karn et al 2015a b c studies which is defined similar to other ventilated cavitation studies laali and michel 1984 in these figures the bubble size distribution is bimodal which is similar to the findings of other researchers tse et al 2003 karn et al 2015a b c two modes are at 0 3 and 0 62 x202f mm with more bubbles in the smaller size first mode that shows many small bubbles exist in the bubbly wake of the hydrofoil 5 2 impact of different angle of attacks aoa the impact of changing the angle of attack of hydrofoil on bubble size distribution is investigated in this section fig 5 shows the bubble diameter distribution at 4 65c downstream the hydrofoil centre of rotation for different aoas by increasing the angle of attack the bubble size decreases it is evident from the bubble size distribution profile where the smallest size group significantly increases from 10 at zero aoa to 17 at 6 aoa to 30 at 10 aoa the reason goes back to the fact that as the air is discharged from the ventilation slot it gets disturbed by the liquid turbulent velocity fluctuations which leads to breakup of the air jet into small bubbles on one hand the turbulence in the wake downstream of a hydrofoil directly impacts on the bubble size and the velocity in the wake on the other hand the bubble velocity fluctuations impact on the local liquid velocities fig 6 depicts the wake velocity distribution at 4 65c downstream of the hydrofoil centre of rotation for different aoa this figure shows that the bubble velocity in the wake varies within 15 with the lowest velocities near the centreline of wake it shows that the velocities decrease vertically from both sides however the wake is not symmetrical about the line where the minimum velocity occurs this could be caused by the dispersion of the bubbles with different sizes at different locations for example larger bubbles tend to rise within the wake due to buoyancy force karn et al karn et al 2015a b c observed that the larger bubbles have slightly lower velocities compared to tiny bubbles that follow the liquid streamlines more closely karn et al 2015a b c however since in these simulations we are adopting homogeneous musig population balance modelling this phenomenon could not be reflected in our simulation results in our results the wake velocity distribution is almost symmetrical around the minimum velocity line another interesting observation is that within the same location downstream of the hydrofoil increasing the aoa causes the minimum velocity to drift upwards and experience more fluctuations in the wake velocity from 9 variation at zero aoa to 13 at 6 aoa to 15 at 10 aoa the void fraction contours for varying aoa are presented in fig 7 this figure clearly demonstrates the vortex generation and vortex shedding phenomena by increasing the aoa to 10 in order to have a closer examination on the void fraction distribution downstream the discharging slot the local void fractions at 1 34c 3c and 4 65c for varying aoa are presented in fig 8 in this figure the maximum local void fraction for aoa x202f x202f 0 fig 8a can get as high as 0 951 x202f at 1 34c downstream hydrofoil and is reached below the centreline which is caused based on the fact that air is discharged from the slot that is located at 6 x202f mm below the centreline the void fraction distribution along transverse vertical direction is almost symmetrical about the location of discharging slot also as expected the void fraction is reduced farther away from the hydrofoil less void fraction is observed at 3c and much less at 4 65c as shown if fig 8a c the greater void fraction close to the discharging slot could be attributed to both larger number of bubbles and greater size of bubbles moreover the maximum void fraction value decreases by increasing aoa from 0 951 x202f at aoa x202f x202f 0 to 0 437 x202f at aoa x202f x202f 6 to 0 125 x202f at aoa x202f x202f 10 which indicates that the bubbles are dispersed more effectively at larger aoas the variation of aoa of hydrofoil is expected to also cause a drift in the bubbly wake downstream in order to examine the dispersion of the gas phase more closely the area average of gas phase void fraction vs x direction for different angles of attack is demonstrated in fig 9 in this figure the area average is evaluated on the vertical lines y dimension where y is limited to 0 01 x202f m x202f x202f y x202f x202f 0 015 x202f m to capture the location where the most variation of the void fraction is happening in this figure it is clearly shown that by increasing the angle of attack less void fraction is observed at farthest downstream also the oscillation of vortices impacts on the distribution of the void fraction which is clearly observed in the case of angle of attack equal to 10 5 3 impact of different air entrainment coefficients in this section the influence of air entrainment coefficient c q on the bubble size distribution is studied fig 10 presents the bubble size distribution at 4 65c downstream the hydrofoil at the centre of rotation with air entrainment coefficients changing from 1 1e 4 to 4 4e 4 as the c q is increased bubbles interactions and collisions increase that lead to greater breakup rate of bubbles resulting in smaller size of the bubbles therefore at higher c q there is a greater fraction of small size bubbles interestingly there is also a greater fraction of medium size bubbles for higher c q the experiments of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c suggest that bubbles are more closely spaced at a higher c q these bubbles located at the vicinity of each other would interact effectively resulting in the coalescence in the bubbly wake which leads to increase in the number of bubbles in intermediate size range as well tse et al 2003 it is also expected that since by increasing c q the net amount of air ventilated per unit time is also increased larger values of c q result in a larger number of bubbles in fig 11 the wake velocity distribution for varying c q at 4 65c downstream hydrofoil is demonstrated the bubble velocity in the wake for all c q conditions varies within 10 of the stream velocity also as mentioned earlier the minimum velocity occurs below the centreline of the hydrofoil due to the air discharge at 6 x202f mm below the hydrofoil s centreline in addition the largest value of c q experiences the highest value of velocity amongst the cases studied in fig 12 the void fraction contour plots for different c q conditions are presented clearly by increasing the c q larger areas with high void fraction have resulted consequently when the air is discharged at higher c q the bubbles are dispersed at higher concentrations with larger values of void fraction in similar areas compared to lower values of c q the wake is spread more in larger c q value which leads to greater breakup events and results in having smaller size bubbles as was earlier shown in fig 10 fig 13 provides the prospect for a closer examination of local void fraction plot in this figure the local void fraction contour plots for varying c q at 1 34c 3c and 4 65c downstream of the hydrofoil are presented the maximum value of void fraction varies by changing the air ventilation rate 0 53 x202f at c q equal to 1 1e 4 to 0 998 x202f at c q equal to 2 2e 4 to 1 0 x202f at c q equal to 4 4e 4 for all of the cases the maximum void fraction occurs below the hydrofoil centreline due to discharging air from the slot that is located below the centreline the bubbles disperse in an almost symmetrical distribution in the transverse vertical direction resulting in a similar void fraction distribution for all cases 5 4 impact of different reynolds numbers changing the flow condition by varying the reynolds number has direct impact on the bubble size distribution at the wake of the hydrofoil however it has insignificant impact on both the average bubble size and the void fraction distribution in the wake of the hydrofoil in fig 14 the bubble size distribution at 4 65c downstream of the hydrofoil at the centre of rotation for different reynolds numbers changing from 2 4e5 to 8 1e5 is presented this figure shows that by increasing the reynolds number the fraction of smallest bubble size increases from 7 to 27 for the range of reynolds numbers investigated in this study however opposite trend is observed for the second smallest bubble size 0 25 x202f mm by increasing the reynolds number the fraction of the bubble decreases from 30 to 13 consequently changing the reynolds number does not have a significant impact on the average bubble size in the wake of the hydrofoil this finding is aligned with experimental findings of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c in fig 15 the wake velocity distribution at different reynolds numbers is presented the velocity in this graph is normalised versus the free stream velocity therefore all three conditions exhibit similar behaviour in the wake in terms of non dimensional velocity distribution the void fraction contour plots for different reynolds numbers are presented in fig 16 in this figure by increasing the reynolds number no significant variation is observed in the void fraction distribution in the wake of the hydrofoil in order to have a closer examination of the void fraction distribution for varying reynolds numbers in fig 17 the void fraction at 1 34c 3c and 4 65c downstream the hydrofoil for 2 1e5 4 1e5 6 1e5 and 8 1e5 is displayed the maximum void fraction in this figure slightly changes from 0 521 to 0 537 by increasing the reynolds number from 2 1e5 to 8 1e5 6 conclusion in this paper numerical simulation of two phase bubbly flow in the wake of naca0015 hydrofoil is investigated and validated against the experimental data of karn et al karn et al 2015a b c a systematic numerical investigation on bubbly wake of naca0015 hydrofoil is carried out under different conditions including angle of attack aoa air entrainment coefficient and reynolds number to allow the study of the influence of these parameters on the bubble size distribution in the bubbly wake the results show that aoa has significant impact on the bubble size distribution velocity distribution and void fraction distribution in the wake the bubble size is reduced by increasing the angle of attack due to the higher turbulence imposed by larger aoa change in aoa also creates a drift in the location where the minimum velocity occurs in the wake which is an upward drift by increasing the aoa also by increasing the aoa the bubbles are dispersed more effectively within the wake increasing the air entrainment coefficient results in production of smaller size bubbles due to higher collision and break up rate of bubbles also with higher air entrainment coefficient larger areas with higher void fraction are observed downstream the hydrofoil changing the reynolds number does not have significant influence on the average bubble size in the wake of the hydrofoil similarly the void fraction distribution is not drastically changed by varying the reynolds number however reynolds number has direct impact on the bubble size distribution at the wake of the hydrofoil acknowledgement the authors are grateful for the support provided by australia china centre for maritime engineering accme project no acsrf48199

23041,route planning in maritime transportation is the key to safe efficient and smart navigation we propose a multi criteria route planning technique for operators to objectively determine the routes according to their intentions in this study the navigational traffic risk of a route is quantitatively assessed using a model of a ship then a risk contour map is visualized by structuring the data as absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors which is a framework for route planning finally a multi criteria route could be modeled by considering the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation as the main criteria the technique assesses each criterion by analyzing the cumulative risk per distance distance number of waypoints and risk gradient of derived routes in addition the technique proposes routes by utilizing its algorithm and incorporating contour based projection and reference points to verify the proposed technique we carried out numerical simulations and evaluated actual ais data the results show that this technique can not only suggest goal oriented routes but also assess the used routes therefore the proposed technique can improve the route planning method to be more systematic which contributes both to smart navigation based on the user s purposes and to future autonomous navigation keywords multi criteria navigational traffic risk risk contour ship route planning smart navigation 1 introduction among various transportation modes maritime transportation comprises a significant portion not only in korea but also worldwide equasis 2016 united nations 2017 to operate vessels through maritime navigation their routes should be appropriate and reasonable based on the requirements of operators even if the primary objectives of routes are slightly different from each other the routes must typically avoid any risky areas to prevent accidents such as groundings save distances to destinations if possible and consider the characteristics of vessels operators and surrounding situations however route planning that is the procedure of designing and creating an appropriate route is empirically carried out by on scene experts such as captains and second mates swift 1993 lee et al 2018 however their qualitative experience based and subjective approaches to planning routes can be limited indeed officers in charge of route planning are frequently observed to follow what their predecessors have developed and what the captain asks them to do or they slightly modify routes without using any detailed verifiable and objective method one of the major problems caused by this conventional approach is that unless any accidents occur nobody would recognize the risk or the problem additionally despite the numerous available route planning methods the efficiency based method receives the most focus andersson 2015 bijlsma 2001 2002 2004 guinness et al 2014 jeon 2018 kang et al 2015 kobayashi et al 2011 lee 2005 lee et al 2018 roh 2013 vettor and soares 2016 yoo et al 2015 yoo and kim 2016 szlapczynski 2005 2011 which consider a prerequisite for navigation i e safety to a lesser extent more seriously officers do not appear to have a specific standard to determine the distance at which a ship is considered to safely pass by obstructions shorelines and other hazards moreover finding authorized publications or guidelines for route planning is difficult therefore the operators only refer to vague expressions such as substantially far adequately safe and in ample time international maritime organization 1999 consequently numerous navigational traffic accidents occur because of inappropriate route planning because the standards for route planning vary considerably depending on individuals european maritime safety agency 2017 mazaheri 2009 mazaheri et al 2015 pedersen 2010 in this vein recent reports have also emphasized that contextual geographic data and information from various sources should be considered in order to correctly understand the circumstances and make a better decision in particular data and information related to meteorological oceanographic and user related datasets have become necessary for calculating and planning alternative routes for vessels riveiro et al 2018 in this study we developed a multi criteria planning technique to plan a route that satisfies the purpose of a navigator and ensures the smart navigation of a vessel in the corresponding circumstances first the navigational traffic risk of a vessel s route is assessed using a model of a ship then a risk contour map is visualized by structuring data such as absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors which is used as a framework for the route planning finally the multi criteria route planning could be modeled by considering the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation as the main criteria for route planning this technique assesses each criterion by analyzing the cumulative risk per distance distance number of waypoints and risk gradient of the derived routes the technique then proposes multi criteria routes by utilizing its algorithm and incorporating contour based route projection and a combination of reference points to confirm the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed technique we numerically simulated case studies and evaluated actual automatic identification system ais data for the modeled ship on the west coast of korea the results show that the proposed technique can suggest multi criteria routes in accordance with a user s intentions and quantitatively assess the current routes used by vessels based on various criteria of interest hence this study presents a novel and significant contribution to the literature as well as a practical application specifically this study can improve a user s cognitive ability to assess risk by visualizing risk using contour lines thus shifting the risk paradigm from formerly invisible discrete data to visible continuous curves furthermore the proposed technique can plan routes and support objective decision making to meet a user s requirements in the corresponding circumstances in contrast with conventionally qualitative and empirical methods thus the proposed technique can be used by a navigator to plan a fit for purpose route the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 systematically reviews related works to gather necessary information and analyzes the focus of existing works to develop the proposed novel approach section 3 introduces risk contour mapping as the framework of multi criteria route planning the detailed technique and process underlying the multi criteria route planning are described in section 4 as the core part of this study section 5 discusses the results and applications and finally concluding remarks and the directions for future work are presented in section 6 2 related work 2 1 phase of navigation and route planning there are four phases of navigation that must be determined in general the criteria for determining the phase of navigation comply with standards set by the international association of marine aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities 2018 and the national imagery and mapping agency 2002 first the inland waterway phase is for piloting through canals channels and rivers second the harbor harbor approach phase is for navigating around harbor entrances and approach channels third the coastal phase is for navigation within approximately 50 miles of a coast or within a depth of 200 m around a shoreline lastly the ocean phase is for navigation outside a coastal area at open sea determining the phase is particularly important because the scope and method of route planning depends on the phase of navigation then the route planning is performed which is a sequential process to assess design plan execute and monitor the route for operating the vessel this process is also categorized into four phases the appraisal planning execution and monitoring phases international maritime organization 1999 national imagery and mapping agency 2002 swift 1993 the appraisal phase is one of the most important phases because it should both include the risk assessment and provide abundant data to a navigator the planning phase refers to planning plotting and designing a ship s route from the start to the destination helping the ship to prevent accidents by minimizing risk and navigating efficiently by reducing distance and fuel consumption the execution and monitoring phases are to evaluate and monitor both the ship being operated by the plan and its compliance 2 2 ship route planning studies several previous works have investigated route planning using diverse methods under different scopes here they were systematically reviewed based on the main focus of the route planning and the applied phase of navigation table 1 shows the categorization and specific details of the studies the main focuses of the studies are divided into two categories according to the ultimate goal of the proposed methods namely efficiency and safety furthermore the route planning methods that focus on efficiency consider the following factors distance fuel consumption time required expected cost and weather effects the route planning methods that focus on safety mainly deal with avoiding other ships or obstacles in efficiency oriented studies dynamic programming and the bolza problem were used to minimize fuel consumption in an ocean passage bijlsma 2001 2002 2004 a genetic algorithm was used by lee 2005 for determining the optimal distance in the ocean phase and by lee et al 2018 for optimizing fuel consumption and speed szlapczynski 2005 focused on avoiding obstacles and encounters with other ships as well as minimizing course changes szlapczynski 2011 a route for autonomous navigation including the collision avoidance or obstacle avoidance of unmanned surface vehicles was proposed by larson et al 2006 the relationship between fuel consumption and weather routing was examined in the ocean phase by kobayashi et al 2011 and roh 2013 a route through icy conditions in the baltic sea was optimized using the associated cost function while avoiding floating ice guinness et al 2014 a grid search approach was adopted to design routes that separately minimize time wave height and fuel consumption andersson 2015 kang et al 2015 found a route by considering depth triangulation fuel consumption and time in a coastal area yoo et al 2015 provided comparative results through weather routing simulations using a great circle route ocean currents were mainly considered to optimize paths based on machine learning yoo and kim 2016 vettor and soares 2016 studied weather routing to save fuel and time the past transit data of ships were collected and analyzed to determine a route that prevents the risk of collision in the coastal sea jeon 2018 analyzing these related works revealed that most route planning methods and algorithms were related to making routes more efficient in other words they focused on reducing distance required time fuel consumption and associated costs based on weather routing the same tendency was also identified in commercially developed programs that used the energy efficiency operational indicator eniram 2018 lg cns 2018 stormgeo 2018 weathernews 2018 however the suggested routes are not necessarily the best route in terms of the navigator s intentions in addition these works were limited in that they considered safety as a subsidiary factor or assumed the establishment of safety before the application of their methods moreover the routes worked only when a ship was confronted with obstacles and did not preemptively set courses during the planning phase therefore they do not propose fit for purpose routes that satisfy user requirements depending on the situations in this study using the basic concepts mentioned above a route planning technique is proposed to determine multi criteria routes during the appraisal and planning phases we focus on the coastal phase because the navigational traffic risks fluctuate widely there due to topographical and sea conditions the route planning technique considers four criteria which are defined as the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation to satisfy diverse user requirements 3 risk contour mapping framework 3 1 scope of study 3 1 1 study area janganseo a specific area should be selected to assess navigational traffic risk and to apply and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed route planning technique the selected area is janganseo as shown in fig 1 which is one of the busiest regions near large korean ports such as daesan pyeongtaek dangjin incheon and taean ports kim et al 2013 korea hydrographic and oceanographic administration 2018 in particular this study concentrated on the area close to the janganseo pilot station to effectively perform experiments and validate results another reason for selecting this region is that it has no specific traffic lane or scheme thus it is appropriate for testing the route planning technique without any predetermined direction of a route 3 1 2 model of the ship a liquefied natural gas lng ship is selected as a representative model of a ship for this study because lng ships are one of the largest most frequently observed ships in addition lng ships require the highest safety considerations the specific ship modeled here is a 135 k lng carrier which currently occupies the largest portion of the lng fleet managed and operated by the korea gas corporation javanmardi et al 2006 table 2 lists its specifications 3 1 3 navigational traffic risk this study defines navigational traffic risk as the probabilistic risk associated with navigational accidents such as grounding contact capsizing and sinking resulting from stationary obstacles jeong et al 2017 kristiansen 2005 ulusçu et al 2009 thus other ships or moving objects are not considered because the route planning technique developed in this study focuses on the phases of appraisal and planning in addition as the objective of risk assessment is to ensure a ship s safety by not entering a risky area to prevent accidents the consequential factor of risk is assigned as a constant zhen et al 2017 3 2 formulation of risk assessment 3 2 1 design variables in the assessment area the variables to be assessed for navigational traffic risk should be identified and analyzed based on previous studies past accident records and expert opinions international association of marine aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities 2009 international maritime organization 2002 jebsen and papakonstantinous 1997 kim and lee 2012 korea maritime safety tribunal 2018 lee and kim 2013 lin 1998 pianc 2014 swift 1993 the variables in the target area can be structured by analyzing and evaluating the data using an electronic navigational chart enc as shown in fig 2 a unit assessment area was designated by the definition of the position fixing interval which is the standard that a ship does not run into a danger during the interval between fixes oil companies international marine forum 2016 therefore the shape of the unit area is circular as shown in the navigational risk assessment stage in fig 2 in this study the applied position fixing interval was 6 min based on the speed and topographical conditions of the area in the risk data structure shown in fig 2 the absolute danger is the non navigable area according to a ship s maximum draft including squat and its margin the hazard factor in the navigable area which is related to the hazardous depth and the obstacles refers to a stationary hazard the hazardous depth is the minimum water depth within the navigable area of the unit area artificial obstacles are typically man made objects and structures whereas natural obstacles are naturally created finally the influential factor stands for the sea conditions that indirectly affect an accident jeong et al 2018 3 2 2 navigational traffic risk the assessment of navigational traffic risk for route planning can be described by eq 1 1 n t r i f a r e a i h i w a t e r h i o b s t a c l e a i w a t e r a i o b s t a c l e ω i s e a c o n d i where ntr i is the navigational traffic risk in an area i the subscript i is the area identification number h i water is the hazard index derived from the water depth and draft h i obstacle is the hazard index derived from the obstacle a i water is the geometric weight coefficient for the non navigable area a i obstacle is the geometric weight coefficient for the domain of the obstacle and ω i sea condi is the weight coefficient of the influential factor each variable is evaluated using a matrix of hazard and influential factors as shown in table 3 where h is the minimum depth m d is the maximum draft of a ship m c is the speed of current knots and v is the speed of a ship knots thus the default value of the ntr index without ω i sea condi ranges from 1 to 20 after including influential factors ntr is fully quantified in consideration of all factors 3 2 3 assessment of hazard factor in table 3 the hazardous depth is determined by comparing the ratio of the ship s draft to the minimum depth from the enc however the obstacle cohesion should be calculated through a geometric analysis which includes the number of obstacles and shows the cohesion characteristics in the unit area as described in eq 2 2 c o h e s i o n i 1 n p x y a r e a i p r o x i m i t y p c 1 n p x y a r e a i x x i c 2 y y i c 2 where cohesion i is the obstacle cohesion in area i n is the number of obstacles in the area p is the position of an obstacle in the area expressed as x y and c is the position of the centroid in the area expressed as x i c y i c note that the unit of obstacle cohesion is f where f is the position fixing interval defined as the radius of the unit area which is a circle the obstacle cohesion represents the characteristics of the inter obstacle distance in eq 1 a i water can be calculated by the ratio of the non navigable area to the unit area which is expressed as the incremental percentage weight a i obstacle can be calculated in the same manner if obstacles are polygonal however it can be calculated by the ratio of the domain to the unit area if obstacles are points such as buoys and wrecks the domain of the obstacle is defined using the concept of the safe distance which represents the marginal distance area inside which a ship should not be present this is determined by the overall length of the ship through the review of studies and a survey of experts inoue 2013 pianc 2014 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 3 2 4 assessment of influential factors influential factors are computed by determining the effects of sea conditions on navigational traffic accidents based on an analysis of past data from 2011 to 2017 korea maritime safety tribunal 2018 therefore three principal parameters namely wind current and visibility were found to affect the occurrence of accidents among 786 cases 631 cases were not related to the sea conditions whereas 155 cases were influenced by the sea conditions as shown in table 4 accordingly these three influential factors are reflected by the calculation of ω i sea condi using eqs 3 and 4 from previous studies that calculated the effect of sea conditions bialystocki and konovessis 2016 jeong et al 2018 3 ω s e a c o n d i m a x 1 n u m t o t a l n u m n e t n u m n e t 1 n u m d i f f n u m n e t where ω s e a c o n d i m a x is the nominal maximum weight coefficient of an influential factor num total is the total number of navigational traffic accidents during the period num net is the net number of the navigational traffic accidents not affected by sea conditions and num diff is the difference between the total number and net number of navigational traffic accidents 4 ω i s e a c o n d i 1 1 100 ρ w i n d ρ c u r r e n t ρ v i s i b i l i t y s i w i n d s i c u r r e n t s i v i s i b i l i t y where ρ wind ρ current and ρ visibility are the portions of wind current and visibility among influential factors and s i wind s i current and s i visibility are the index of wind current and visibility among influential factors respectively as shown in table 3 after analyzing 786 cases from the abovementioned historical data from 2011 to 2017 korea maritime safety tribunal 2018 the portion indexes provided in table 4 were calculated by multiplying each ratio by a constant of 4 91 to match ω s e a c o n d i m a x according to eq 3 wherein s i wind s i current and s i visibility are 5 the highest possible value 3 3 risk contour mapping model 3 3 1 risk contour contour lines are widely used in diverse areas such as topographic maps barometric pressure magnetic field and oceanographic bathymetry casola and wallace 2007 chen et al 2004 cronin 1995 li and liu 2010 similarly we developed novel risk contour mapping technique to enable a ship operator not only to identify the distribution of navigational traffic risk in a transit area but also to conduct the smart navigation of a vessel by utilizing risk contours jeong et al 2017 2018 after the risk assessment a risk contour is visualized as a two dimensional equal curve that connects areas with the same risk through interpolation 3 3 2 procedure of mapping model risk contour mapping is a sequential process consisting of geometric and spatial analysis risk assessment and the visualization on the enc based on essential risk data structures as shown in fig 2 the process consists of the following steps first data are received via the enc in connection with equipment and they are identified and structured according to their category second the non navigable area is identified and filtered out by assessing the transit area then the navigational traffic risk in each unit area is assessed finally risk contours are mapped and visualized on the enc 3 3 3 expected value of model an example of a visualized risk contour map is shown in the last stage in fig 2 the risk contours have a significant role and applicability first they represent distributed and dispersed data as continuous and connected information in addition risk contour mapping enables quantifying and visualizing important data that were previously invisible and intangible next it can be applied to a navigator s decision making such as route planning in accordance with the navigator s intentions and the analyses of subsequent data obtained from the contour can broaden the applicability of the risk contours the multi criteria route planning technique which is the core of this study was developed by utilizing the abovementioned advantage of the model as described in section 4 4 multi criteria route planning model 4 1 design criteria of route planning based on an extensive literature review including technical references and previous studies the main goals of route planning can be categorized into four main criteria even if the specific requirements might vary depending on the respective studies these four main criteria are the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation as shown in fig 3 they significantly influence planning routes among various options and for various purposes in addition we defined and developed particular standards to assess each criterion based on the risk contour map for quantitative analysis first safety is the standard for how safe a route is to prevent navigational traffic accidents furthermore efficiency refers to how efficiently a ship can be operated along a route without significant consumption of fuel next convenience indicates the ease in maneuvering a ship without frequently altering course last the ability of navigation refers to whether a ship and its navigator can perform a voyage along a route and it is correlated to the risk gradient the gradient of a mountain is an apt metaphor for the risk gradient selecting a route with a steep or gradual gradient when climbing a mountain depends on the ability and professionalism of a climber similarly the ability of navigation differs between high and low gradients a higher gradient is found to require a higher ability of navigation e g it requires the assistance of additional operators including a master and a pilot auxiliary equipment and the experience and expertise of operators 4 2 assessment of criteria in this study we divided the criteria into a relative five scale rating from very low to very high as shown in fig 3 using this concept we can objectively compare routes and plan a multi criteria route that satisfies the purposes of navigators in the corresponding circumstances safety is measured by the cumulative risk per distance along the suggested route on the risk contour plane as described in eq 5 5 c r d p d e p p a r r n t r d i s t where crd is the cumulative risk per distance p dep is the position of the departure point p arr is the position of the arrival point and dist is the distance of the leg from p dep to p arr as cumulative risk is inversely proportional to safety a small value of cumulative risk implies a high safety rating furthermore efficiency is defined by the sum of the distance over an entire route the distance is also inversely proportional to efficiency and the rating method is the same as that for safety next convenience is determined by the number of waypoints the proportional relationship and rating method are the same as those for safety and efficiency last the ability of navigation is determined by the average risk gradient along a route on the contour map as described in eq 6 6 a g r δ n t r p d e p p a r r d i s t where agr is the average risk gradient along a route and δntr p dep p arr is the difference between the navigational traffic risk at p dep and p arr as the gradient is directly proportional to ability a small value of the average risk gradient implies a low rating of ability in summary each criterion is measured on a five tier scale by relative comparison between the minimum and maximum values among all proposed routes obtained by the route planning method the safety efficiency and convenience ratings are inversely proportional to their assessed values while the ability rating is directly proportional to its value the ideal goal of each criterion is illustrated in blue in fig 3 4 3 contour based route planning the multi criteria route planning technique was applied using algorithm codes developed in matlab and it was run on a computer with a 3 30 ghz intel core i3 processor and 8 gb ddr4 ram fig 4 illustrates the flowchart of how route planning is based on multiple criteria depending on different situations inputs purposes and other elements of navigators the subsequent sections describe each component of the methodological model 4 3 1 defining navigational direction after the risk contour map is visualized the essential data for route planning should be initially inputted a navigator defines the departure point arrival point acceptable risk and principal data of a ship according to the inputted data the navigational direction used for determining the proposed route is defined the pseudo code for defining the navigational direction is expressed as algorithm 1 image 1 the algorithm defines and returns the quadrant that contains the direction between p dep and p arr then it is assumed that the direction of the proposed route should lie within this quadrant otherwise there can be an infinite number of solutions to reach the destination e g courses from backward to forward and zig zag courses such solutions are not reasonable when actually planning a route for instance fig 5 a represents the navigating area for entering pyeongtaek port expressed on the risk contour map which visualizes p dep p arr the non navigable area at a depth of 15 m red polygons and an unacceptable risk of 8 ntr red contours the values were calculated using the maximum draft including squats and default thresholds for the minimum margin in addition it was assumed that the route planning technique was performed with no influences from the tide or weather to propose and verify the method under the default conditions p dep was randomly selected as the position where ships enter and p arr was the pilot station of janganseo in this case as the bearing from p dep to p arr lies in the first quadrant the direction of the proposed routes and their subordinate segments should be within that quadrant therefore the algorithm enables validating the technique regardless of the conditions or the location of p dep and p arr 4 3 2 ship s route projection in this study the route projection method was developed in accordance with how topographic engineers typically design a road or route in reality gu et al 2015 rogers 2005 engineers find intersections with the height contours of a mountain using a designated gradient up to a destination and they find the possible routes that are appropriate for cases such as constructing roads and installing a network of lines between stations however in contrast with most studies which used the contours of geographic information this study adopted the novel risk contour visualization for creating a ship s route projection at sea a ship s preliminary routes were projected by the available risk gradients in other words upon calculating the displacement of risk from p dep to p arr the gradients were tested to confirm technical applicability and thus numerous values of radius were simulated the values of radius were applied in consideration of the risk contour s interval the distance between adjacent lines and the vessel s size and maneuvering characteristics in addition to derive each route segment on the preliminary route across the risk contour the concept of the gradient circle was utilized as described in eq 7 gu et al 2015 rogers 2005 7 r a d i u s d e l t a r i s k g r a d i e n t where radius is the distance between two adjacent risk contour lines as the radius of a circle deltarisk is the displacement of ntr between two adjacent lines and gradient is the intended risk gradient of the route as deltarisk was fixed as a constant after the visualization of the risk contour radius depended only on gradient in addition it was assumed that the changes in the risk value across the contours are continuous as a result the technique modeled the entire process of the route planning technique via numerical programming the process of projecting the ship s route can be structured as follows 1 from the departure point draw a circle with radius and find any intersection with the next adjacent risk contour 2 if an intersection exists mark it as a reference point connect a segment line from the previous point and repeat step 1 starting from the reference point if no intersection exists draw a line directly to the arrival point 3 finish the procedure until the last route segment ends at the arrival point and check the availability of the preliminary route fig 5 a demonstrates the ship s route projection as a preliminary route based on the proposed process in case of multiple intersections on the adjacent contour line all options are considered by splitting the direction of the segments according to the intersections additionally when there is no intersection in the middle of the process the route segment directly reaches the arrival point the extreme cases of radius such as too small or too large to have an intersection from the departure point were excluded because the technical applicability was already tested at the beginning if another risk gradient is applied the results would be different owing to different route projection fig 5 b shows the results obtained for a steeper gradient using circles with smaller radius the pseudo code for the entire route projection process is expressed in algorithm 2 image 2 4 3 3 feasible route options and assessment based on the projected preliminary route a mathematical model was developed to analyze and select the feasible route options by combining reference points in other words the feasible route options were proposed by the combination of the reference points on the initial preliminary route if there are n reference points from p dep to p arr on the preliminary route the option of selecting r reference points can be expressed as eq 8 8 c h o o s e r n c r where choose r is the possible number of options of selecting r among n reference points and n c r is the combination of r points among n points furthermore the total possible number of options can be expressed using the binomial theorem in eq 9 9 t t l n n c 0 n c 1 n c n 1 n c n r 0 n n c r 2 n where ttl n is the total possible number of options in the case of n reference points for example if two reference points are selected in fig 5 a the total options are three cases owing to 3c2 and the results are shown in magenta in fig 5 c during this stage any route option that enters the non navigable area should be excluded and the remaining options are finally considered feasible to generalize the method it is considered that a principle exists regarding the portion of each criterion reflected in the route planning this is mathematically meaningful with the use of pascal s triangle as shown in fig 6 in the figure if there are three reference points n 3 the total options are 3c0 3c1 3c2 3c3 8 cases the pink region which contains the routes that select none of the reference points is the region with the maximum portions of efficiency and convenience in route planning but the minimum portion of ability owing to the straight line from p dep to p arr in contrast the yellow region which contains the routes that select all reference points is the region with the maximum portion of ability but the minimum portions of efficiency and convenience these low portions are due to the route being longest because the path is most evasive as it follows the designated gradient on the risk contour furthermore in the blue region the portions of the criteria can range between the pink and yellow regions however as the safety criterion cannot be generalized in this principle because of irregular distribution of hazard factors across the risk contour it is individually assessed and calculated for each route 4 3 4 multi criteria route after the assessment of criteria among the feasible routes using the proposed method multi criteria routes are found by comparison with the portions of the criteria selected by a user therefore in this study smart navigation is not the one route normally obtained by certain optimizing algorithms in other studies but flexible routes based on the requirement of situations and the purposes and intentions of users as the non navigable area is initially filtered out as a default safety criterion users only have to adjust the portions of safety efficiency convenience and ability without being concerned about any navigational traffic accidents this is the multi criteria route planning technique that best fits the requirements of users and makes routes applicable to actual situations through smart navigation 5 results and discussion 5 1 numerical simulation of application 5 1 1 design of simulation to check the applicability and usefulness of the proposed route planning technique numerical simulation was performed by utilizing the modeled ship in the region the simulation was conducted under the default conditions i e without the influence of either weather or tide and under changed conditions with the influence of weather and tide p dep and p arr were identified after the visualization of the risk contour map as the ship approached p arr the risk contour level showed the tendency to increase because the position became closer to the pilot station of pyeongtaek port based on this navigational environment the route planning model was applied to mathematically test and verify the results as the technique uses radius which is related to gradient during the route projection stage to derive a preliminary route the feasible route options depend on the value of radius despite the importance of radius to the results if there is no standard for it there might be infinite cases of radius that can be applied as a variable therefore to resolve this problem the sensitivity analysis of radius was performed at regular intervals and applied in consideration of the risk contour s interval the distance between adjacent lines and the vessel s size and maneuvering characteristics as per section 4 3 2 as a result 153 cases were derived through the simulations of radius to find multi criteria routes 5 1 2 results of multi criteria routes all feasible routes proposed by the route planning technique were analyzed and the four criteria were assessed based on the relative comparison among all suggested routes the portions of criteria were normalized so that a user can compare and select them on a common scale fig 7 shows the results of the multi criteria route planning under the default conditions as solid lines the simulation found the routes with the maximum portion of one criterion compared to the others the details of the multi criteria routes are given in table 5 first the safety based route almost follows the valley of the risk contour to enable the maximum consideration of the cumulative risk per distance compared to the other criteria second the efficiency based route is relatively close to the non navigable area owing to reduction in distance next the convenience based route consists of only one waypoint while minimizing course alteration last the ability based route is quite long however it does not require considerable support for navigation compared to other routes to minimize the average risk gradient the route circumvents a risky area through frequent evasive alterations for further verification the route planning technique was applied to the conditions with actual sea conditions and tidal data under a different resolution of the risk contour map the sea conditions and tidal data were obtained from the taean tidal station and taean ocean data buoy which are located close to the study area a different position fixing interval of 3 min was applied for the resolution the data for a randomly selected date and time were a tidal height of 2 15 m a wind speed of 5 6 m s a current of 0 46 knots and a visibility of 10 nm as a result the risk contour including the non navigable area in the same enc was newly assessed and visualized as shown in fig 8 then the route planning model was applied in the same manner to check its applicability and effectiveness the dashed lines as shown in fig 7 show the results of the changes to the proposed routes the details of the multi criteria routes in these conditions are given in table 6 these results confirm that the proposed route planning technique can be applied in real time at sea under various conditions to summarize although the examples were cases based on the maximum portion for each criterion the proposed technique ensures that routes are based on the options selected by a user adjusting portions of the criteria this technique is novel because it enables selecting user based options among several options this study is different from other studies in which only one optimized route is obtained based on the efficiency 5 2 model application to ais data 5 2 1 ais data preprocess the ais consists of three types of structured data i e static data dynamic data and voyage related data international maritime organization 2006 liu and chen 2014 zhang et al 2017 the past ais data from korea ministry of oceans and fisheries were procured to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed route planning model the ais data of 3717 ships for three months from september 27 to december 27 2017 were analyzed as shown by the blue lines in fig 9 the data that were not related to this study including noise were filtered out owing to their broadness therefore the extracted data consisted of the ship s specifications static data the ships underway dynamic data and the ships entering the lng terminal in pyeongtaek voyage related data initially the sea conditions and tidal influence were not considered to compare and analyze the track data on a common scale under the default conditions however the extreme sea states during the period such as typhoons or storm warnings were excluded to prevent unexpected discrepancy in the data through this pretreatment 36 statistical samples of the past tracks that had the same direction from the west sea of korea to the janganseo pilot station were sorted and visualized as shown by the red lines in fig 9 5 2 2 results of ais data evaluation the route planning technique proposed in this study was applied to statistically analyze current routes based on actual ais data as a case study however owing to the continuous movements of ships in reality ais data were not shown as straight lines or conspicuous waypoints which is how route plans normally appear for this reason the polygonal boundary that connects the outermost parts of past ais data was identified and plotted as shown in fig 10 within this boundary area the routes suggested by the technique were analyzed to evaluate their trends and the portions of the criteria considered by the actual routes regarding the trends of criteria in accordance with the five tier scale shown in fig 3 it was meaningful to find how criteria were distributed using the route planning model as shown in fig 11 the results show that the safety of routes is distributed mainly in the low and medium scales as the cumulative risk per distance is fairly high in addition the efficiency criterion is distributed between the high and very high scales owing to short distance routes next the convenience criterion is distributed from the medium to very high scale because most routes consisted of one to three waypoints lastly the ability criterion is distributed mainly in the high or very high scales this implies that these routes require considerable ability of navigation in addition to the scaled analysis of the routes obtained by ais data we evaluated the relative portions of the criteria that were considered by actual tracks as shown in fig 12 efficiency is the most significantly considered criterion followed by convenience safety and ability this indicates that most currently used routes attempt to reduce their distance and course alteration by focusing on efficient easy and convenient navigation however the ability criterion lies between the default and a maximum of 18 this illustrates that ships are relatively vulnerable to handling an abrupt change in navigational traffic risks which can be recognized by the risk gradient on the risk contour map moreover route suggestions become available by selecting the portions of the criteria which were based on evaluated ais data for instance in the event that a navigator wants to design a route conforming to the median value of the statistically assessed results the route indicated by the blue line in fig 10 can be proposed the suggested routes adopt each criterion at almost the median value of past ais tracks it comprises 20 safety 41 efficiency 31 convenience and 8 ability in addition the navigator can adjust the portions as freely as possible according to the requirements in conclusion the proposed route planning technique was verified to be effective and sufficiently applicable not only for quantitatively analyzing current routes using ais data but also for suggesting the route that achieves the desired portions of the criteria 6 discussion in this study we proposed a route planning technique using four criteria i e the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation unlike other studies which optimize only one route by concentrating mainly on efficiency this study provides several route options as smart navigation according to the preference of users providing users with options to select from is useful because the weight of each criterion can vary depending on a user s experience capability and situations therefore in addition to the proposed technique smart navigation must be further developed to realize the automated adjustment of the portions of the criteria the four criteria were also evaluated based on respective factors in the process of route planning however there are other factors such as fuel consumption cost and weather which should be considered in more sophisticated route planning in addition the ability criterion is determined by whether or not a vessel and operators can conduct navigation based on a ship s specification cargo specification other auxiliary systems and operators eligibility therefore this technique requires a more detailed objective and quantified method for evaluating ability to connect it with the risk gradient furthermore this study considers the navigational traffic risk posed by stationary obstacles when visualizing the risk contour map as a framework during the appraisal and planning phases of route planning therefore in addition to the current categorization of absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors other mobile and dynamic factors should be further considered such as moving ships real time traffic volume more accurate data on sea conditions and their correlations with navigational traffic risks these considerations can improve the route planning technique and make it more sophisticated in the execution and monitoring phases the proposed technique was applied to a coastal area in korea using the modeled ship a limitation of this technique is that it cannot be applied to an atypical shape of the risk contour or in an extreme case such as an area within traffic separation schemes therefore to extend the validation of this study other regions with various conditions should be considered with more statistical ais data for the modeled ship however using the risk contour is verified and validated to be useful and advantageous in normal sea areas regardless of the types and sizes of vessels this technique will provide the advantage of fully smart navigation if it is expanded to the entire voyage from a departure port to an arrival port despite the abovementioned challenges which will be strengthened in the future this study is valuable because it can provide a user with multi criteria route options from an infinite number of possible routes as demonstrated by the results of the applications this route planning technique is expected to be utilized in diverse areas we can apply the technique not only to smart navigation but also to broader areas such as the quantitative analysis of traffic accidents arising from inappropriate routes and decision making for the navigation of autonomous vessels 7 conclusions and future work in this study a multi criteria route planning technique was developed to enable navigators to quantitatively and objectively determine their routes in compliance with their goals and preferences first risk contour mapping which uses absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors was applied as a framework of the route planning technique to assess and visualize navigational traffic risk of a navigation area as equal curves then as the core part of this study the multi criteria route planning technique was modeled by designing four main criteria i e the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation parameters such as the cumulative risk per distance distance number of waypoints and risk gradient were considered to assess the four criteria the suggested algorithm analyzed feasible route options derived by utilizing contour based preliminary route projections and a combination of reference points to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed technique we numerically simulated case studies and evaluated actual ais data within the west coast of korea the results showed that this novel technique is effective for objectively planning routes that fit the intentions of users in real time in addition it can be applied to quantitatively evaluate the routes currently used by maritime transportation therefore the proposed technique practically supports on scene decision making by overcoming the empirical and subjective method which has been conventionally used thus far in summary the proposed technique is novel not only because was the new risk contour developed to continuously express previously discrete data but also because multi criteria route planning enables the navigator to plan a fit for purpose route using quantitative and objective methods which can significantly beneficial to the operator s decision making even though the technique proposes multi criteria routes more factors such as dynamic objects or traffic volumes should be considered to improve the route planning technique in addition this study can be more broadly applied not only to the appraisal and planning phases in route planning but also to the execution and monitoring phases the study is expected to provide more advantages once the method can be more universally applied in other terrestrial areas finally in the future we will examine the automated adjustments of criteria portions combined with this technique to contribute to the analysis of traffic accidents related to route decisions as well as decision making for autonomous ships acknowledgement this research was a part of a project titled development of management technology for hns accident funded by the ministry of oceans and fisheries korea 
23041,route planning in maritime transportation is the key to safe efficient and smart navigation we propose a multi criteria route planning technique for operators to objectively determine the routes according to their intentions in this study the navigational traffic risk of a route is quantitatively assessed using a model of a ship then a risk contour map is visualized by structuring the data as absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors which is a framework for route planning finally a multi criteria route could be modeled by considering the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation as the main criteria the technique assesses each criterion by analyzing the cumulative risk per distance distance number of waypoints and risk gradient of derived routes in addition the technique proposes routes by utilizing its algorithm and incorporating contour based projection and reference points to verify the proposed technique we carried out numerical simulations and evaluated actual ais data the results show that this technique can not only suggest goal oriented routes but also assess the used routes therefore the proposed technique can improve the route planning method to be more systematic which contributes both to smart navigation based on the user s purposes and to future autonomous navigation keywords multi criteria navigational traffic risk risk contour ship route planning smart navigation 1 introduction among various transportation modes maritime transportation comprises a significant portion not only in korea but also worldwide equasis 2016 united nations 2017 to operate vessels through maritime navigation their routes should be appropriate and reasonable based on the requirements of operators even if the primary objectives of routes are slightly different from each other the routes must typically avoid any risky areas to prevent accidents such as groundings save distances to destinations if possible and consider the characteristics of vessels operators and surrounding situations however route planning that is the procedure of designing and creating an appropriate route is empirically carried out by on scene experts such as captains and second mates swift 1993 lee et al 2018 however their qualitative experience based and subjective approaches to planning routes can be limited indeed officers in charge of route planning are frequently observed to follow what their predecessors have developed and what the captain asks them to do or they slightly modify routes without using any detailed verifiable and objective method one of the major problems caused by this conventional approach is that unless any accidents occur nobody would recognize the risk or the problem additionally despite the numerous available route planning methods the efficiency based method receives the most focus andersson 2015 bijlsma 2001 2002 2004 guinness et al 2014 jeon 2018 kang et al 2015 kobayashi et al 2011 lee 2005 lee et al 2018 roh 2013 vettor and soares 2016 yoo et al 2015 yoo and kim 2016 szlapczynski 2005 2011 which consider a prerequisite for navigation i e safety to a lesser extent more seriously officers do not appear to have a specific standard to determine the distance at which a ship is considered to safely pass by obstructions shorelines and other hazards moreover finding authorized publications or guidelines for route planning is difficult therefore the operators only refer to vague expressions such as substantially far adequately safe and in ample time international maritime organization 1999 consequently numerous navigational traffic accidents occur because of inappropriate route planning because the standards for route planning vary considerably depending on individuals european maritime safety agency 2017 mazaheri 2009 mazaheri et al 2015 pedersen 2010 in this vein recent reports have also emphasized that contextual geographic data and information from various sources should be considered in order to correctly understand the circumstances and make a better decision in particular data and information related to meteorological oceanographic and user related datasets have become necessary for calculating and planning alternative routes for vessels riveiro et al 2018 in this study we developed a multi criteria planning technique to plan a route that satisfies the purpose of a navigator and ensures the smart navigation of a vessel in the corresponding circumstances first the navigational traffic risk of a vessel s route is assessed using a model of a ship then a risk contour map is visualized by structuring data such as absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors which is used as a framework for the route planning finally the multi criteria route planning could be modeled by considering the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation as the main criteria for route planning this technique assesses each criterion by analyzing the cumulative risk per distance distance number of waypoints and risk gradient of the derived routes the technique then proposes multi criteria routes by utilizing its algorithm and incorporating contour based route projection and a combination of reference points to confirm the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed technique we numerically simulated case studies and evaluated actual automatic identification system ais data for the modeled ship on the west coast of korea the results show that the proposed technique can suggest multi criteria routes in accordance with a user s intentions and quantitatively assess the current routes used by vessels based on various criteria of interest hence this study presents a novel and significant contribution to the literature as well as a practical application specifically this study can improve a user s cognitive ability to assess risk by visualizing risk using contour lines thus shifting the risk paradigm from formerly invisible discrete data to visible continuous curves furthermore the proposed technique can plan routes and support objective decision making to meet a user s requirements in the corresponding circumstances in contrast with conventionally qualitative and empirical methods thus the proposed technique can be used by a navigator to plan a fit for purpose route the rest of this paper is organized as follows section 2 systematically reviews related works to gather necessary information and analyzes the focus of existing works to develop the proposed novel approach section 3 introduces risk contour mapping as the framework of multi criteria route planning the detailed technique and process underlying the multi criteria route planning are described in section 4 as the core part of this study section 5 discusses the results and applications and finally concluding remarks and the directions for future work are presented in section 6 2 related work 2 1 phase of navigation and route planning there are four phases of navigation that must be determined in general the criteria for determining the phase of navigation comply with standards set by the international association of marine aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities 2018 and the national imagery and mapping agency 2002 first the inland waterway phase is for piloting through canals channels and rivers second the harbor harbor approach phase is for navigating around harbor entrances and approach channels third the coastal phase is for navigation within approximately 50 miles of a coast or within a depth of 200 m around a shoreline lastly the ocean phase is for navigation outside a coastal area at open sea determining the phase is particularly important because the scope and method of route planning depends on the phase of navigation then the route planning is performed which is a sequential process to assess design plan execute and monitor the route for operating the vessel this process is also categorized into four phases the appraisal planning execution and monitoring phases international maritime organization 1999 national imagery and mapping agency 2002 swift 1993 the appraisal phase is one of the most important phases because it should both include the risk assessment and provide abundant data to a navigator the planning phase refers to planning plotting and designing a ship s route from the start to the destination helping the ship to prevent accidents by minimizing risk and navigating efficiently by reducing distance and fuel consumption the execution and monitoring phases are to evaluate and monitor both the ship being operated by the plan and its compliance 2 2 ship route planning studies several previous works have investigated route planning using diverse methods under different scopes here they were systematically reviewed based on the main focus of the route planning and the applied phase of navigation table 1 shows the categorization and specific details of the studies the main focuses of the studies are divided into two categories according to the ultimate goal of the proposed methods namely efficiency and safety furthermore the route planning methods that focus on efficiency consider the following factors distance fuel consumption time required expected cost and weather effects the route planning methods that focus on safety mainly deal with avoiding other ships or obstacles in efficiency oriented studies dynamic programming and the bolza problem were used to minimize fuel consumption in an ocean passage bijlsma 2001 2002 2004 a genetic algorithm was used by lee 2005 for determining the optimal distance in the ocean phase and by lee et al 2018 for optimizing fuel consumption and speed szlapczynski 2005 focused on avoiding obstacles and encounters with other ships as well as minimizing course changes szlapczynski 2011 a route for autonomous navigation including the collision avoidance or obstacle avoidance of unmanned surface vehicles was proposed by larson et al 2006 the relationship between fuel consumption and weather routing was examined in the ocean phase by kobayashi et al 2011 and roh 2013 a route through icy conditions in the baltic sea was optimized using the associated cost function while avoiding floating ice guinness et al 2014 a grid search approach was adopted to design routes that separately minimize time wave height and fuel consumption andersson 2015 kang et al 2015 found a route by considering depth triangulation fuel consumption and time in a coastal area yoo et al 2015 provided comparative results through weather routing simulations using a great circle route ocean currents were mainly considered to optimize paths based on machine learning yoo and kim 2016 vettor and soares 2016 studied weather routing to save fuel and time the past transit data of ships were collected and analyzed to determine a route that prevents the risk of collision in the coastal sea jeon 2018 analyzing these related works revealed that most route planning methods and algorithms were related to making routes more efficient in other words they focused on reducing distance required time fuel consumption and associated costs based on weather routing the same tendency was also identified in commercially developed programs that used the energy efficiency operational indicator eniram 2018 lg cns 2018 stormgeo 2018 weathernews 2018 however the suggested routes are not necessarily the best route in terms of the navigator s intentions in addition these works were limited in that they considered safety as a subsidiary factor or assumed the establishment of safety before the application of their methods moreover the routes worked only when a ship was confronted with obstacles and did not preemptively set courses during the planning phase therefore they do not propose fit for purpose routes that satisfy user requirements depending on the situations in this study using the basic concepts mentioned above a route planning technique is proposed to determine multi criteria routes during the appraisal and planning phases we focus on the coastal phase because the navigational traffic risks fluctuate widely there due to topographical and sea conditions the route planning technique considers four criteria which are defined as the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation to satisfy diverse user requirements 3 risk contour mapping framework 3 1 scope of study 3 1 1 study area janganseo a specific area should be selected to assess navigational traffic risk and to apply and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed route planning technique the selected area is janganseo as shown in fig 1 which is one of the busiest regions near large korean ports such as daesan pyeongtaek dangjin incheon and taean ports kim et al 2013 korea hydrographic and oceanographic administration 2018 in particular this study concentrated on the area close to the janganseo pilot station to effectively perform experiments and validate results another reason for selecting this region is that it has no specific traffic lane or scheme thus it is appropriate for testing the route planning technique without any predetermined direction of a route 3 1 2 model of the ship a liquefied natural gas lng ship is selected as a representative model of a ship for this study because lng ships are one of the largest most frequently observed ships in addition lng ships require the highest safety considerations the specific ship modeled here is a 135 k lng carrier which currently occupies the largest portion of the lng fleet managed and operated by the korea gas corporation javanmardi et al 2006 table 2 lists its specifications 3 1 3 navigational traffic risk this study defines navigational traffic risk as the probabilistic risk associated with navigational accidents such as grounding contact capsizing and sinking resulting from stationary obstacles jeong et al 2017 kristiansen 2005 ulusçu et al 2009 thus other ships or moving objects are not considered because the route planning technique developed in this study focuses on the phases of appraisal and planning in addition as the objective of risk assessment is to ensure a ship s safety by not entering a risky area to prevent accidents the consequential factor of risk is assigned as a constant zhen et al 2017 3 2 formulation of risk assessment 3 2 1 design variables in the assessment area the variables to be assessed for navigational traffic risk should be identified and analyzed based on previous studies past accident records and expert opinions international association of marine aids to navigation and lighthouse authorities 2009 international maritime organization 2002 jebsen and papakonstantinous 1997 kim and lee 2012 korea maritime safety tribunal 2018 lee and kim 2013 lin 1998 pianc 2014 swift 1993 the variables in the target area can be structured by analyzing and evaluating the data using an electronic navigational chart enc as shown in fig 2 a unit assessment area was designated by the definition of the position fixing interval which is the standard that a ship does not run into a danger during the interval between fixes oil companies international marine forum 2016 therefore the shape of the unit area is circular as shown in the navigational risk assessment stage in fig 2 in this study the applied position fixing interval was 6 min based on the speed and topographical conditions of the area in the risk data structure shown in fig 2 the absolute danger is the non navigable area according to a ship s maximum draft including squat and its margin the hazard factor in the navigable area which is related to the hazardous depth and the obstacles refers to a stationary hazard the hazardous depth is the minimum water depth within the navigable area of the unit area artificial obstacles are typically man made objects and structures whereas natural obstacles are naturally created finally the influential factor stands for the sea conditions that indirectly affect an accident jeong et al 2018 3 2 2 navigational traffic risk the assessment of navigational traffic risk for route planning can be described by eq 1 1 n t r i f a r e a i h i w a t e r h i o b s t a c l e a i w a t e r a i o b s t a c l e ω i s e a c o n d i where ntr i is the navigational traffic risk in an area i the subscript i is the area identification number h i water is the hazard index derived from the water depth and draft h i obstacle is the hazard index derived from the obstacle a i water is the geometric weight coefficient for the non navigable area a i obstacle is the geometric weight coefficient for the domain of the obstacle and ω i sea condi is the weight coefficient of the influential factor each variable is evaluated using a matrix of hazard and influential factors as shown in table 3 where h is the minimum depth m d is the maximum draft of a ship m c is the speed of current knots and v is the speed of a ship knots thus the default value of the ntr index without ω i sea condi ranges from 1 to 20 after including influential factors ntr is fully quantified in consideration of all factors 3 2 3 assessment of hazard factor in table 3 the hazardous depth is determined by comparing the ratio of the ship s draft to the minimum depth from the enc however the obstacle cohesion should be calculated through a geometric analysis which includes the number of obstacles and shows the cohesion characteristics in the unit area as described in eq 2 2 c o h e s i o n i 1 n p x y a r e a i p r o x i m i t y p c 1 n p x y a r e a i x x i c 2 y y i c 2 where cohesion i is the obstacle cohesion in area i n is the number of obstacles in the area p is the position of an obstacle in the area expressed as x y and c is the position of the centroid in the area expressed as x i c y i c note that the unit of obstacle cohesion is f where f is the position fixing interval defined as the radius of the unit area which is a circle the obstacle cohesion represents the characteristics of the inter obstacle distance in eq 1 a i water can be calculated by the ratio of the non navigable area to the unit area which is expressed as the incremental percentage weight a i obstacle can be calculated in the same manner if obstacles are polygonal however it can be calculated by the ratio of the domain to the unit area if obstacles are points such as buoys and wrecks the domain of the obstacle is defined using the concept of the safe distance which represents the marginal distance area inside which a ship should not be present this is determined by the overall length of the ship through the review of studies and a survey of experts inoue 2013 pianc 2014 pietrzykowski and uriasz 2009 3 2 4 assessment of influential factors influential factors are computed by determining the effects of sea conditions on navigational traffic accidents based on an analysis of past data from 2011 to 2017 korea maritime safety tribunal 2018 therefore three principal parameters namely wind current and visibility were found to affect the occurrence of accidents among 786 cases 631 cases were not related to the sea conditions whereas 155 cases were influenced by the sea conditions as shown in table 4 accordingly these three influential factors are reflected by the calculation of ω i sea condi using eqs 3 and 4 from previous studies that calculated the effect of sea conditions bialystocki and konovessis 2016 jeong et al 2018 3 ω s e a c o n d i m a x 1 n u m t o t a l n u m n e t n u m n e t 1 n u m d i f f n u m n e t where ω s e a c o n d i m a x is the nominal maximum weight coefficient of an influential factor num total is the total number of navigational traffic accidents during the period num net is the net number of the navigational traffic accidents not affected by sea conditions and num diff is the difference between the total number and net number of navigational traffic accidents 4 ω i s e a c o n d i 1 1 100 ρ w i n d ρ c u r r e n t ρ v i s i b i l i t y s i w i n d s i c u r r e n t s i v i s i b i l i t y where ρ wind ρ current and ρ visibility are the portions of wind current and visibility among influential factors and s i wind s i current and s i visibility are the index of wind current and visibility among influential factors respectively as shown in table 3 after analyzing 786 cases from the abovementioned historical data from 2011 to 2017 korea maritime safety tribunal 2018 the portion indexes provided in table 4 were calculated by multiplying each ratio by a constant of 4 91 to match ω s e a c o n d i m a x according to eq 3 wherein s i wind s i current and s i visibility are 5 the highest possible value 3 3 risk contour mapping model 3 3 1 risk contour contour lines are widely used in diverse areas such as topographic maps barometric pressure magnetic field and oceanographic bathymetry casola and wallace 2007 chen et al 2004 cronin 1995 li and liu 2010 similarly we developed novel risk contour mapping technique to enable a ship operator not only to identify the distribution of navigational traffic risk in a transit area but also to conduct the smart navigation of a vessel by utilizing risk contours jeong et al 2017 2018 after the risk assessment a risk contour is visualized as a two dimensional equal curve that connects areas with the same risk through interpolation 3 3 2 procedure of mapping model risk contour mapping is a sequential process consisting of geometric and spatial analysis risk assessment and the visualization on the enc based on essential risk data structures as shown in fig 2 the process consists of the following steps first data are received via the enc in connection with equipment and they are identified and structured according to their category second the non navigable area is identified and filtered out by assessing the transit area then the navigational traffic risk in each unit area is assessed finally risk contours are mapped and visualized on the enc 3 3 3 expected value of model an example of a visualized risk contour map is shown in the last stage in fig 2 the risk contours have a significant role and applicability first they represent distributed and dispersed data as continuous and connected information in addition risk contour mapping enables quantifying and visualizing important data that were previously invisible and intangible next it can be applied to a navigator s decision making such as route planning in accordance with the navigator s intentions and the analyses of subsequent data obtained from the contour can broaden the applicability of the risk contours the multi criteria route planning technique which is the core of this study was developed by utilizing the abovementioned advantage of the model as described in section 4 4 multi criteria route planning model 4 1 design criteria of route planning based on an extensive literature review including technical references and previous studies the main goals of route planning can be categorized into four main criteria even if the specific requirements might vary depending on the respective studies these four main criteria are the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation as shown in fig 3 they significantly influence planning routes among various options and for various purposes in addition we defined and developed particular standards to assess each criterion based on the risk contour map for quantitative analysis first safety is the standard for how safe a route is to prevent navigational traffic accidents furthermore efficiency refers to how efficiently a ship can be operated along a route without significant consumption of fuel next convenience indicates the ease in maneuvering a ship without frequently altering course last the ability of navigation refers to whether a ship and its navigator can perform a voyage along a route and it is correlated to the risk gradient the gradient of a mountain is an apt metaphor for the risk gradient selecting a route with a steep or gradual gradient when climbing a mountain depends on the ability and professionalism of a climber similarly the ability of navigation differs between high and low gradients a higher gradient is found to require a higher ability of navigation e g it requires the assistance of additional operators including a master and a pilot auxiliary equipment and the experience and expertise of operators 4 2 assessment of criteria in this study we divided the criteria into a relative five scale rating from very low to very high as shown in fig 3 using this concept we can objectively compare routes and plan a multi criteria route that satisfies the purposes of navigators in the corresponding circumstances safety is measured by the cumulative risk per distance along the suggested route on the risk contour plane as described in eq 5 5 c r d p d e p p a r r n t r d i s t where crd is the cumulative risk per distance p dep is the position of the departure point p arr is the position of the arrival point and dist is the distance of the leg from p dep to p arr as cumulative risk is inversely proportional to safety a small value of cumulative risk implies a high safety rating furthermore efficiency is defined by the sum of the distance over an entire route the distance is also inversely proportional to efficiency and the rating method is the same as that for safety next convenience is determined by the number of waypoints the proportional relationship and rating method are the same as those for safety and efficiency last the ability of navigation is determined by the average risk gradient along a route on the contour map as described in eq 6 6 a g r δ n t r p d e p p a r r d i s t where agr is the average risk gradient along a route and δntr p dep p arr is the difference between the navigational traffic risk at p dep and p arr as the gradient is directly proportional to ability a small value of the average risk gradient implies a low rating of ability in summary each criterion is measured on a five tier scale by relative comparison between the minimum and maximum values among all proposed routes obtained by the route planning method the safety efficiency and convenience ratings are inversely proportional to their assessed values while the ability rating is directly proportional to its value the ideal goal of each criterion is illustrated in blue in fig 3 4 3 contour based route planning the multi criteria route planning technique was applied using algorithm codes developed in matlab and it was run on a computer with a 3 30 ghz intel core i3 processor and 8 gb ddr4 ram fig 4 illustrates the flowchart of how route planning is based on multiple criteria depending on different situations inputs purposes and other elements of navigators the subsequent sections describe each component of the methodological model 4 3 1 defining navigational direction after the risk contour map is visualized the essential data for route planning should be initially inputted a navigator defines the departure point arrival point acceptable risk and principal data of a ship according to the inputted data the navigational direction used for determining the proposed route is defined the pseudo code for defining the navigational direction is expressed as algorithm 1 image 1 the algorithm defines and returns the quadrant that contains the direction between p dep and p arr then it is assumed that the direction of the proposed route should lie within this quadrant otherwise there can be an infinite number of solutions to reach the destination e g courses from backward to forward and zig zag courses such solutions are not reasonable when actually planning a route for instance fig 5 a represents the navigating area for entering pyeongtaek port expressed on the risk contour map which visualizes p dep p arr the non navigable area at a depth of 15 m red polygons and an unacceptable risk of 8 ntr red contours the values were calculated using the maximum draft including squats and default thresholds for the minimum margin in addition it was assumed that the route planning technique was performed with no influences from the tide or weather to propose and verify the method under the default conditions p dep was randomly selected as the position where ships enter and p arr was the pilot station of janganseo in this case as the bearing from p dep to p arr lies in the first quadrant the direction of the proposed routes and their subordinate segments should be within that quadrant therefore the algorithm enables validating the technique regardless of the conditions or the location of p dep and p arr 4 3 2 ship s route projection in this study the route projection method was developed in accordance with how topographic engineers typically design a road or route in reality gu et al 2015 rogers 2005 engineers find intersections with the height contours of a mountain using a designated gradient up to a destination and they find the possible routes that are appropriate for cases such as constructing roads and installing a network of lines between stations however in contrast with most studies which used the contours of geographic information this study adopted the novel risk contour visualization for creating a ship s route projection at sea a ship s preliminary routes were projected by the available risk gradients in other words upon calculating the displacement of risk from p dep to p arr the gradients were tested to confirm technical applicability and thus numerous values of radius were simulated the values of radius were applied in consideration of the risk contour s interval the distance between adjacent lines and the vessel s size and maneuvering characteristics in addition to derive each route segment on the preliminary route across the risk contour the concept of the gradient circle was utilized as described in eq 7 gu et al 2015 rogers 2005 7 r a d i u s d e l t a r i s k g r a d i e n t where radius is the distance between two adjacent risk contour lines as the radius of a circle deltarisk is the displacement of ntr between two adjacent lines and gradient is the intended risk gradient of the route as deltarisk was fixed as a constant after the visualization of the risk contour radius depended only on gradient in addition it was assumed that the changes in the risk value across the contours are continuous as a result the technique modeled the entire process of the route planning technique via numerical programming the process of projecting the ship s route can be structured as follows 1 from the departure point draw a circle with radius and find any intersection with the next adjacent risk contour 2 if an intersection exists mark it as a reference point connect a segment line from the previous point and repeat step 1 starting from the reference point if no intersection exists draw a line directly to the arrival point 3 finish the procedure until the last route segment ends at the arrival point and check the availability of the preliminary route fig 5 a demonstrates the ship s route projection as a preliminary route based on the proposed process in case of multiple intersections on the adjacent contour line all options are considered by splitting the direction of the segments according to the intersections additionally when there is no intersection in the middle of the process the route segment directly reaches the arrival point the extreme cases of radius such as too small or too large to have an intersection from the departure point were excluded because the technical applicability was already tested at the beginning if another risk gradient is applied the results would be different owing to different route projection fig 5 b shows the results obtained for a steeper gradient using circles with smaller radius the pseudo code for the entire route projection process is expressed in algorithm 2 image 2 4 3 3 feasible route options and assessment based on the projected preliminary route a mathematical model was developed to analyze and select the feasible route options by combining reference points in other words the feasible route options were proposed by the combination of the reference points on the initial preliminary route if there are n reference points from p dep to p arr on the preliminary route the option of selecting r reference points can be expressed as eq 8 8 c h o o s e r n c r where choose r is the possible number of options of selecting r among n reference points and n c r is the combination of r points among n points furthermore the total possible number of options can be expressed using the binomial theorem in eq 9 9 t t l n n c 0 n c 1 n c n 1 n c n r 0 n n c r 2 n where ttl n is the total possible number of options in the case of n reference points for example if two reference points are selected in fig 5 a the total options are three cases owing to 3c2 and the results are shown in magenta in fig 5 c during this stage any route option that enters the non navigable area should be excluded and the remaining options are finally considered feasible to generalize the method it is considered that a principle exists regarding the portion of each criterion reflected in the route planning this is mathematically meaningful with the use of pascal s triangle as shown in fig 6 in the figure if there are three reference points n 3 the total options are 3c0 3c1 3c2 3c3 8 cases the pink region which contains the routes that select none of the reference points is the region with the maximum portions of efficiency and convenience in route planning but the minimum portion of ability owing to the straight line from p dep to p arr in contrast the yellow region which contains the routes that select all reference points is the region with the maximum portion of ability but the minimum portions of efficiency and convenience these low portions are due to the route being longest because the path is most evasive as it follows the designated gradient on the risk contour furthermore in the blue region the portions of the criteria can range between the pink and yellow regions however as the safety criterion cannot be generalized in this principle because of irregular distribution of hazard factors across the risk contour it is individually assessed and calculated for each route 4 3 4 multi criteria route after the assessment of criteria among the feasible routes using the proposed method multi criteria routes are found by comparison with the portions of the criteria selected by a user therefore in this study smart navigation is not the one route normally obtained by certain optimizing algorithms in other studies but flexible routes based on the requirement of situations and the purposes and intentions of users as the non navigable area is initially filtered out as a default safety criterion users only have to adjust the portions of safety efficiency convenience and ability without being concerned about any navigational traffic accidents this is the multi criteria route planning technique that best fits the requirements of users and makes routes applicable to actual situations through smart navigation 5 results and discussion 5 1 numerical simulation of application 5 1 1 design of simulation to check the applicability and usefulness of the proposed route planning technique numerical simulation was performed by utilizing the modeled ship in the region the simulation was conducted under the default conditions i e without the influence of either weather or tide and under changed conditions with the influence of weather and tide p dep and p arr were identified after the visualization of the risk contour map as the ship approached p arr the risk contour level showed the tendency to increase because the position became closer to the pilot station of pyeongtaek port based on this navigational environment the route planning model was applied to mathematically test and verify the results as the technique uses radius which is related to gradient during the route projection stage to derive a preliminary route the feasible route options depend on the value of radius despite the importance of radius to the results if there is no standard for it there might be infinite cases of radius that can be applied as a variable therefore to resolve this problem the sensitivity analysis of radius was performed at regular intervals and applied in consideration of the risk contour s interval the distance between adjacent lines and the vessel s size and maneuvering characteristics as per section 4 3 2 as a result 153 cases were derived through the simulations of radius to find multi criteria routes 5 1 2 results of multi criteria routes all feasible routes proposed by the route planning technique were analyzed and the four criteria were assessed based on the relative comparison among all suggested routes the portions of criteria were normalized so that a user can compare and select them on a common scale fig 7 shows the results of the multi criteria route planning under the default conditions as solid lines the simulation found the routes with the maximum portion of one criterion compared to the others the details of the multi criteria routes are given in table 5 first the safety based route almost follows the valley of the risk contour to enable the maximum consideration of the cumulative risk per distance compared to the other criteria second the efficiency based route is relatively close to the non navigable area owing to reduction in distance next the convenience based route consists of only one waypoint while minimizing course alteration last the ability based route is quite long however it does not require considerable support for navigation compared to other routes to minimize the average risk gradient the route circumvents a risky area through frequent evasive alterations for further verification the route planning technique was applied to the conditions with actual sea conditions and tidal data under a different resolution of the risk contour map the sea conditions and tidal data were obtained from the taean tidal station and taean ocean data buoy which are located close to the study area a different position fixing interval of 3 min was applied for the resolution the data for a randomly selected date and time were a tidal height of 2 15 m a wind speed of 5 6 m s a current of 0 46 knots and a visibility of 10 nm as a result the risk contour including the non navigable area in the same enc was newly assessed and visualized as shown in fig 8 then the route planning model was applied in the same manner to check its applicability and effectiveness the dashed lines as shown in fig 7 show the results of the changes to the proposed routes the details of the multi criteria routes in these conditions are given in table 6 these results confirm that the proposed route planning technique can be applied in real time at sea under various conditions to summarize although the examples were cases based on the maximum portion for each criterion the proposed technique ensures that routes are based on the options selected by a user adjusting portions of the criteria this technique is novel because it enables selecting user based options among several options this study is different from other studies in which only one optimized route is obtained based on the efficiency 5 2 model application to ais data 5 2 1 ais data preprocess the ais consists of three types of structured data i e static data dynamic data and voyage related data international maritime organization 2006 liu and chen 2014 zhang et al 2017 the past ais data from korea ministry of oceans and fisheries were procured to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed route planning model the ais data of 3717 ships for three months from september 27 to december 27 2017 were analyzed as shown by the blue lines in fig 9 the data that were not related to this study including noise were filtered out owing to their broadness therefore the extracted data consisted of the ship s specifications static data the ships underway dynamic data and the ships entering the lng terminal in pyeongtaek voyage related data initially the sea conditions and tidal influence were not considered to compare and analyze the track data on a common scale under the default conditions however the extreme sea states during the period such as typhoons or storm warnings were excluded to prevent unexpected discrepancy in the data through this pretreatment 36 statistical samples of the past tracks that had the same direction from the west sea of korea to the janganseo pilot station were sorted and visualized as shown by the red lines in fig 9 5 2 2 results of ais data evaluation the route planning technique proposed in this study was applied to statistically analyze current routes based on actual ais data as a case study however owing to the continuous movements of ships in reality ais data were not shown as straight lines or conspicuous waypoints which is how route plans normally appear for this reason the polygonal boundary that connects the outermost parts of past ais data was identified and plotted as shown in fig 10 within this boundary area the routes suggested by the technique were analyzed to evaluate their trends and the portions of the criteria considered by the actual routes regarding the trends of criteria in accordance with the five tier scale shown in fig 3 it was meaningful to find how criteria were distributed using the route planning model as shown in fig 11 the results show that the safety of routes is distributed mainly in the low and medium scales as the cumulative risk per distance is fairly high in addition the efficiency criterion is distributed between the high and very high scales owing to short distance routes next the convenience criterion is distributed from the medium to very high scale because most routes consisted of one to three waypoints lastly the ability criterion is distributed mainly in the high or very high scales this implies that these routes require considerable ability of navigation in addition to the scaled analysis of the routes obtained by ais data we evaluated the relative portions of the criteria that were considered by actual tracks as shown in fig 12 efficiency is the most significantly considered criterion followed by convenience safety and ability this indicates that most currently used routes attempt to reduce their distance and course alteration by focusing on efficient easy and convenient navigation however the ability criterion lies between the default and a maximum of 18 this illustrates that ships are relatively vulnerable to handling an abrupt change in navigational traffic risks which can be recognized by the risk gradient on the risk contour map moreover route suggestions become available by selecting the portions of the criteria which were based on evaluated ais data for instance in the event that a navigator wants to design a route conforming to the median value of the statistically assessed results the route indicated by the blue line in fig 10 can be proposed the suggested routes adopt each criterion at almost the median value of past ais tracks it comprises 20 safety 41 efficiency 31 convenience and 8 ability in addition the navigator can adjust the portions as freely as possible according to the requirements in conclusion the proposed route planning technique was verified to be effective and sufficiently applicable not only for quantitatively analyzing current routes using ais data but also for suggesting the route that achieves the desired portions of the criteria 6 discussion in this study we proposed a route planning technique using four criteria i e the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation unlike other studies which optimize only one route by concentrating mainly on efficiency this study provides several route options as smart navigation according to the preference of users providing users with options to select from is useful because the weight of each criterion can vary depending on a user s experience capability and situations therefore in addition to the proposed technique smart navigation must be further developed to realize the automated adjustment of the portions of the criteria the four criteria were also evaluated based on respective factors in the process of route planning however there are other factors such as fuel consumption cost and weather which should be considered in more sophisticated route planning in addition the ability criterion is determined by whether or not a vessel and operators can conduct navigation based on a ship s specification cargo specification other auxiliary systems and operators eligibility therefore this technique requires a more detailed objective and quantified method for evaluating ability to connect it with the risk gradient furthermore this study considers the navigational traffic risk posed by stationary obstacles when visualizing the risk contour map as a framework during the appraisal and planning phases of route planning therefore in addition to the current categorization of absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors other mobile and dynamic factors should be further considered such as moving ships real time traffic volume more accurate data on sea conditions and their correlations with navigational traffic risks these considerations can improve the route planning technique and make it more sophisticated in the execution and monitoring phases the proposed technique was applied to a coastal area in korea using the modeled ship a limitation of this technique is that it cannot be applied to an atypical shape of the risk contour or in an extreme case such as an area within traffic separation schemes therefore to extend the validation of this study other regions with various conditions should be considered with more statistical ais data for the modeled ship however using the risk contour is verified and validated to be useful and advantageous in normal sea areas regardless of the types and sizes of vessels this technique will provide the advantage of fully smart navigation if it is expanded to the entire voyage from a departure port to an arrival port despite the abovementioned challenges which will be strengthened in the future this study is valuable because it can provide a user with multi criteria route options from an infinite number of possible routes as demonstrated by the results of the applications this route planning technique is expected to be utilized in diverse areas we can apply the technique not only to smart navigation but also to broader areas such as the quantitative analysis of traffic accidents arising from inappropriate routes and decision making for the navigation of autonomous vessels 7 conclusions and future work in this study a multi criteria route planning technique was developed to enable navigators to quantitatively and objectively determine their routes in compliance with their goals and preferences first risk contour mapping which uses absolute danger hazard factors and influential factors was applied as a framework of the route planning technique to assess and visualize navigational traffic risk of a navigation area as equal curves then as the core part of this study the multi criteria route planning technique was modeled by designing four main criteria i e the safety efficiency convenience and ability of navigation parameters such as the cumulative risk per distance distance number of waypoints and risk gradient were considered to assess the four criteria the suggested algorithm analyzed feasible route options derived by utilizing contour based preliminary route projections and a combination of reference points to illustrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed technique we numerically simulated case studies and evaluated actual ais data within the west coast of korea the results showed that this novel technique is effective for objectively planning routes that fit the intentions of users in real time in addition it can be applied to quantitatively evaluate the routes currently used by maritime transportation therefore the proposed technique practically supports on scene decision making by overcoming the empirical and subjective method which has been conventionally used thus far in summary the proposed technique is novel not only because was the new risk contour developed to continuously express previously discrete data but also because multi criteria route planning enables the navigator to plan a fit for purpose route using quantitative and objective methods which can significantly beneficial to the operator s decision making even though the technique proposes multi criteria routes more factors such as dynamic objects or traffic volumes should be considered to improve the route planning technique in addition this study can be more broadly applied not only to the appraisal and planning phases in route planning but also to the execution and monitoring phases the study is expected to provide more advantages once the method can be more universally applied in other terrestrial areas finally in the future we will examine the automated adjustments of criteria portions combined with this technique to contribute to the analysis of traffic accidents related to route decisions as well as decision making for autonomous ships acknowledgement this research was a part of a project titled development of management technology for hns accident funded by the ministry of oceans and fisheries korea 
23042,an inland waterway transportation system is often claimed to be safe efficient and economic however traffic congestion and vessel collision have become serious threats to marine safety especially in the one way waterways the aim of this paper is to rank the vessels in the controlled waterways of the upper yangtze river and to generate the optimal traffic commands for each vessel so as to ensure marine safety and traffic efficiency in this study the proposed approach is based on the combination of fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp with an expert system es vessel data collected from automatic identification systems ais are first analyzed by experts and some external environment and internal factors are selected as significant influencing factors sifs fahp is then used for modelling a hierarchical structure and determining the weight of each sif finally the sorted vessel sequence and appropriate traffic commands can be achieved using es the experiment result shows that the waiting time of vessels is averagely decreased about 22 min compared with the existing traffic signal revealing system this will not only significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the vessel traffic scheduling but also increase the waterway capacity by reducing the travelling time keywords vessel scheduling waterway transportation one way waterway fahp es 1 introduction yangtze river the busiest navigable inland waterway connects eastern central and western parts of china and its freight volume has ranked the first all around the world since 2010 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 however when vessel traffic intensifies the inland waterway transportation system iwts is at an increased threat from traffic congestion and vessel collisions especially in the controlled waterways the controlled waterways exist in the upper yangtze river and usually hold poor natural conditions such as sharp corner narrow channel and turbulent water flow gan et al 2016 for the sake of safety two vessels which have opposite direction cannot get into the controlled waterway at the same time therefore a traffic signal revealing system tsrs a service implemented by a competent authority for improving safety and efficiency of vessel traffic must be applied to reveal correct command of waiting or going forward which compels the vessels to pass through the controlled waterway in one direction at one time according to the command in tsrs operators have to confirm the position of vessels by visual observation and very high frequency vhf radio communication first then estimate vessels time of arriving in the border of the controlled waterway and list a prioritization of the vessels after that operators could make decision based on the traffic rules obviously the process of ranking vessels is of intuition and experience in this case some dangerous and irksome scenarios are inevitable such as collision downward vessels turning around making sharp turns overtaking or long waiting etc as a result it may lead to casualty property loss and marine pollution accordingly the ability that tsrs provides operators with a powerful tool which help sorting vessel sequence and giving a correct traffic command in time is extremely important tsrs is a complex and dynamic vessel scheduling system and takes various factors into account such as vessel type carrying capacity vessel speed vessel position river velocity etc these static and dynamic information influence each other and increase the difficulty of assessing the priority of vessels passing through the controlled waterways furthermore uncertainties are involved because vessel data is sometimes incomplete and the subjective factors of human and management cannot be ignored fortunately vessels are forced to be equipped with automatic identification system ais which automatically broadcasts and transmits information of the sailing status of vessels the information includes vessel positions from global positioning system vessel speed sailing course vessel types navigation status together with an unique identification number maritime mobile service identity haratimokhtari et al 2007 and so on ais data are neutral and carry little subjective distortion to provide insight in vessel traffic wang et al 2013 and the spread of ais makes observation of vessels actual state more accurately easily and faster than before this motivates us to appropriately consider influencing factors and uncertainties and develop an ais based mathematical model to improve the ability of vessel traffic scheduling for the controlled waterways with this goal in mind as the core element of intelligent tsrs the vessel scheduling algorithm then will be evolved considerably in the literature general research on marine safety and maritime transportation has been reported for example the ais data analysis usually forms the basis of the navigation study and deepens the understanding about the vessel traffic in the waterways mou et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 and methods like fuzzy set evidential reasoning and bayesian network were utilized to assesses navigational risk in inland waterway zhang et al 2013 2016 some analysis based on spatial temporal fusion risk indices and quantitative risk assessment qra were adopted to evaluate the risk about vessel collisions and traffic congestions chai et al 2017 qu et al 2011 wang et al 2013 the findings reveal that the urgent task to keep the safety efficiency and fairness of the vessel scheduling at the same time is difficult and the overall efficiency and transportation safety are sometimes sacrificed as a result vessel traffic scheduling approach for safety and efficiency in the narrow shallow and busy waterways have attracted more attentions jovanović et al 2005 discussed non preemptive priority servicing with limited anchorage area and indicated that a trade off between number of berths and anchorage capacity should be made prandtstetter et al 2015 proposed a variable neighborhood search approach to find an optimal lock schedule for multiple watergates which reduced the number of empty lockage while decreased the overall vessel travel times for avoiding vessel collision caused by ship awaiting in outbound in congested one way waterways xu et al 2008 selected the distance of berth the size type and draught of vessel as weights to sort vessel queue and lin et al 2014 further considered the route of vessel as factors of vessel scheduling priority zhang et al 2017 proposed a much more efficient traffic scheduling approach for restricted two way waterway compared with the first come first served fcfs model considering some physical characteristics of the waterway and vessels a queueing model of ship traffic in the bosporus straits was proposed to perform the simulation of maritime traffic at the actual situation mavrakis and kontinakis 2008 the result reveals that a linear increase of arriving vessels would give rise to an approximately exponential increment for both average waiting time and queue length although these findings could enhance traffic efficiency to a certain degree transportation service operation flow and environmental characteristics for navigation are completely different between the above channels and a one way inland waterway therefore they cannot be used to solve such problems in the controlled waterways regarding the aspect of the controlled waterways few studies have investigated the traffic management there since the variance of vessel speed has been treated as one of the most important factors of impeding the traffic efficiency wang et al 2017 gan et al 2017 constructed an improved multilayer perceptron network model based on easily acquired dynamic data of the vessels the accurate long term vessel speed prediction in the controlled waterways is obtained gan et al 2018 further proposed a data driven approach for forecasting the vessel trajectory length in the controlled waterways additionally zhao et al 2012 proposed an improved kalman filter model to accurately predict the location of vessels in the case of ais data is missing the above researches emphasized on the prediction of various navigation characteristics in the controlled waterways and provided a platform for guiding vessels in an optimal manner nevertheless they are still failed to support decision making for intelligent traffic management in other words they cannot generate the optimal traffic commands for each vessel directly in this paper a novel approach is proposed to enhance traffic vessel scheduling and generate optimal traffic commands for each vessel in the controlled waterways for the first time the vessel information gathered from ais is first analyzed by experts and some external environment and internal factors i e vessel type freight type navigation state vessel course and sailing time are selected as significant influencing factors sifs fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp is then used for modelling a hierarchical structure and determining the weight of each sif which helps to prioritize the vessels finally the sorted vessel sequence and appropriate traffic commands can be achieved by an expert system es this study aims not only to optimize vessel sequence passing through the controlled waterways with higher efficiency but also to develop general guidelines for ensuring marine safety and facilitating the improvement of tsrs the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the detailed issues for traffic management in the controlled waterways are presented section 3 illustrates the theory preliminaries and the proposed methodology structure is given in section 4 then in section 5 the case study is given to verify the applicability and performance of this approach followed by the discussion illustrated in section 6 finally section 7 concludes the paper 2 background problem statement 2 1 controlled waterway and tsrs the controlled waterway is defined as the one way waterway where the vessels can only navigate in one direction to upstream or to downstream at one time it widely exists in the upper reaches of yangtze river a typical controlled waterway in sichuan province of china shenbeizui controlled waterway is shown in fig 1 and there is a signal station inside as a significant part of tsrs signal station is usually set up to reveal correct traffic commands and guides the vessels to pass through the controlled waterway in one direction at one time thus ensuring marine safety and traffic efficiency all vessels that prepare to pass through controlled waterway have to stay in the waiting area until signal station sends traffic signal to the appointed vessel the traffic signals of tsrs can be divided into five categories go downstream allowing the appointed vessel from upstream of the controlled waterway to enter and pass through the controlled waterway follow downstream allowing appointed vessel from upstream of the controlled waterway to follow the previous one to enter and pass through the controlled waterway go upstream allowing appointed vessel from downstream of the controlled waterway to enter and pass through the controlled waterway follow upstream allowing appointed vessel from downstream of the controlled waterway to follow the previous one to enter and pass through the controlled waterway wait signal all vessels have to wait at the outer of controlled waterway while the appointed one has got one of above signals to enter the controlled waterway it is usually for upward vessels in traditional tsrs operators confirm the position of navigating vessels based on observation and vhf radio communication then make decision for traffic commands according to the traffic rules of the controlled waterways there are two basic rules as follows fcfs the first vessel to arrive at the waiting area of the controlled waterway is the first to be allowed to pass through one for consideration of fairness fcfs is a popular rule for vessel traffic scheduling in inland waterways downward vessels have priority over upward vessel tsrs should make every effort to avoid the downward vessels turning around or making sharp turns since these operations are extremely dangerous for navigating downward vessel for safety concerns this rule is the first and foremost consideration for vessel traffic scheduling in the controlled waterways the duty of staff in tsrs is to determine which vessel first pass through the controlled waterway by ranking the vessels using above simple rules however it is difficult to keep the scheduling safe and effective at the same time with the maritime traffic growth thus the staffs usually make decisions where some efficiency would be sacrificed for the greater safety this will result in upward vessels spending more unnecessary waiting time which causes a negative economic and environmental impact on fuel consumption and route timing for example fig 2 gan et al 2017 shows the waiting time of a randomly selected vessel crossed the shenbeizui controlled waterway in 2014 the vessel crossed the area for 86 times during this period and the average waiting time it spent was 62 6 min per journey gan et al 2017 since hundreds of vessels operate on the controlled waterway each day it will be quite dangerous once one downward vessel stops waiting and turns around 2 2 problem formulation based on the above introduction and analysis the goal of vessel traffic scheduling should be improving the traffic efficiency when guarantee navigation safety in the controlled waterway and one should attempt to reduce the total waiting time of all vessels due to the complexity of the actual navigation and the variety of ais information it is very difficult to analyze each affecting factors of vessel traffic scheduling however these factors can be selected and divided into several kinds with the help of experts and then quantified as numerical values to weight their relative importance the inference engine of the expert system calculates the attribute weights of each vessel separately and these weight values can be used to rank the vessel traffic sequence where the vessel with high value has the priority to pass through the controlled waterways suppose a hierarchical structure of the sifs of vessel traffic scheduling could be set up with the help of experts or tsrs the goal of the first stage is to calculate and quantify the weight of each sif using fahp the second stage aims to rank the vessels according to their sums of weights and generate accurate traffic commands for the vessels based on es in this paper a fahp es methodology is adopted 3 methodology 3 1 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process the analytic hierarchy process ahp proposed by saaty 1980 is an evaluation method that helps to make a choice from several alternatives for complex systems and provides a comparison of the related options based on the subdivision of the issue in a hierarchical form a hierarchy structure of ahp consisted of three layers aim layer criteria layer and element layer wang et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 to be specific the aim is to achieve the sorted vessel sequence in this paper and the second layer includes the sifs about vessels and navigation conditions while the detailed indexes make up the element layer however the traditional ahp is difficult to meet the consistency and cannot reflect the human thinking style a fuzzy ahp method is thus applied to tackle this problem based on the combination of ahp and fuzzy theory zadeh 1987 fahp has several advantages compared with ahp the most obvious difference between them is the fuzzy consistent matrix introduced in fahp which simplifies the computing there are numerous methods based on fahp proposed in various literature these methods combine fahp with other theories to complete the whole calculation process after determining the main and sub indicators weights güngör et al 2009 jia et al 2012 chamoli 2015 for easy computing the procedure of fahp method we chose in this paper is as follows step 1 determine the sifs and detailed elements by experts or experience and then develop a hierarchy structure after analyzing the indexes system of evaluation these assessment criteria could be either qualitative or quantitative step 2 construct a fuzzy reciprocal judgment matrix and the corresponding fuzzy consistent matrix they can be achieved by the pair wise comparisons based on the judgments of experts and the relative importance of one factor to another then can be seen step 3 calculate the weights of sifs and its sub indicators utilizing the fuzzy consistent matrix and the assessment can be carried out by these weights 3 2 expert system es is a branch of artificial intelligence and can be extensively used to cope with problems at the human expert level in a specific domain sihwi et al 2017 this paper adopts the rule based es which represents expert knowledge in the form of rules such as if then the rules can then be served to perform operations on data and inference for reaching proper conclusion ikram and qamar 2014 knowledge base and inference engine are the most important parts of an expert system the establishment of knowledge base mainly includes knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation knowledge acquisition is the process of gathering knowledge from experts or relevant equipment and the expert in this paper is someone who has years of experience in traffic management knowledge representation is the process of organizing the knowledge and the method of production rule is adopted based on certain rules the inference engine derives a conclusion from known facts and can be successfully applied in different domains arias aranda et al 2010 grahovac and devedzic 2010 in order to enhance the traffic management and ensure navigation safety in the controlled waterways we try to find an optimal sorted sequence of vessels using the inference engine 4 fahp es construction the ultimate purpose of this paper is to sort vessel sequence and generate the optimal traffic commands with the help of effective factors to begin with the main criteria are comprehensively analyzed by experts to determine the sifs in the process after that the experts evaluate the importance of these factors based on their experience and previous analysis fahp is employed for determining the weights of the main criteria and then es is utilized for data processing and reasoning in this way the prioritization of vessels and traffic commands are obtained taking the component essentials of tsrs into consideration the vessel priority is strongly affected by the man vessel equipment factor experts think the most vital characteristics that affect the vessel traffic scheduling are vessel type freight type vessel course navigation state and sailing time in view of these parameters we build a corresponding hierarchical structure and these static characteristics and dynamic characteristics are shown in fig 4 4 1 confirming the weight of sifs different people judge on the prioritization of vessels quite differently therefore affecting factors have various levels of importance from different perspectives because of that we propose a fahp based method which takes the subjective judgments into account to reduce the uncertainty and vagueness mikaeil et al 2011 by establishing the fuzzy consistent matrix the weights of the criteria and elements can be calculated after that the hierarchy structure percentage weight is obtained the detailed procedure is given as follows step 1 several experts carry out pair wise comparison for the factors in same layer individually by using 0 1 0 9 scale to be specific the larger scale gets the more important this factor becomes for instance vessel type b 1 and freight type b 2 are equally important if the scale is 0 5 while b 1 is much more important than b 2 if the scale is 0 9 the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix r can be described as 1 r r 11 r 1 n r n 1 r n n where r i j represents the membership of fuzzy relation that factor b i is more important than another factor b j which is in the same layer and r i j meets the condition that 2 r i j r j i 1 i j 1 2 n step 2 establish the fuzzy consistent matrix b based on the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix r and the concrete calculating formulas are as follows 3 r i j 1 n r i j i j 1 2 n 4 b i j r i r j 2 n 1 0 5 i j 1 2 n where b i j denotes the element of the fuzzy consistent matrix due to the subjective judgments of different decision makers we invite m experienced experts to score and the relevant formulas now can be defined as 5 r i k j 1 n r i j k i j 1 2 n k 1 2 m 6 b i j k r i k r j k 2 n 1 0 5 i j 1 2 n k 1 2 m now we get m matrices b k b i j k n n aim to obtain the final fuzzy consistent matrix the concept of important degree is introduced the new matrix b b i j n n satisfies the condition that 7 b i j k 1 m γ k b i j k γ k 0 k 1 m γ k 1 where γ k is the important degree of one expert sept 3 calculate the weight of each factor by 8 ω i j 1 n b i j n 2 1 n n 1 i j 1 2 n where ω i represents the weight of one criteria or element to prepare the comparison matrices we have got the assistance of four experienced experts who perform the pairwise comparisons on each index of criteria layer shown in fig 4 first and the four fuzzy complementary judgment matrices are as follows r 1 0 5 0 6 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 9 0 9 0 5 0 6 0 3 0 9 0 9 0 4 0 5 0 4 0 9 0 9 0 7 0 6 0 5 r 2 0 5 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 7 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 9 0 9 0 5 0 5 0 4 0 8 0 9 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 9 0 8 0 6 0 5 0 5 r 3 0 5 0 4 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 6 0 5 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 8 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 9 0 9 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 9 0 9 0 7 0 6 0 5 r 4 0 5 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 9 0 9 0 5 0 4 0 4 0 9 0 9 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 8 0 9 0 6 0 6 0 5 according to eqs 3 6 we get four fuzzy consistent matrices b k the knowledge and experience of four experts involved are considered as equivalent for this reason suppose the important degree of each expert is equal while combining their judgments and let γ k 0 25 based on eq 7 the final fuzzy consistent matrices b is obtained as follows b 0 500 0 491 0 282 0 263 0 232 0 509 0 500 0 291 0 272 0 241 0 718 0 709 0 500 0 482 0 450 0 737 0 728 0 518 0 500 0 469 0 768 0 759 0 550 0 531 0 500 then after calculating the weight of each factor in criteria layer the assessment concerning criteria layer can be accomplished in a similar way we can obtain the weight of other factor in criteria layer and element layer therefore the specific calculation processes are not given here and the whole hierarchy structure percentage weight of sorting vessel sequence can be seen from table 1 4 2 sorting vessel sequence the weights of these factors offer a reference for sorting vessel sequence since all the data in this work are real data collected from ais machine we need decode these data and then store them in the knowledge base for this reason the knowledge base need to be set up with the ability of storing these decoded real time data about vessels apart from traffic rules and expert experience this paper does not deal with specific decoding procedure and suppose these ais data are available and decoded the structure of knowledge base zhou and chen 2014 in this expert system is modified as fig 5 according to the expert knowledge and knowledge base management experience we analyze the specific parameters of vessels and then figure out a summary of the five basic traffic commands which given in table 2 to describe the knowledge we use the method of production rule in backus naur form bnf grammar which is a notation technique for context free grammars and could be used to design detailed and clear rules laros et al 2011 the basic form in this expert system can be defined as follows p r e d i c a t e p 1 v e s s e l t y p e p a s s e n g e r v e s s e l c a r g o v e s s e l p 2 f r e i g h t t y p e c o n t a i n e r g e n e r a l o t h e r s p 3 n a v i g a t i o n s t a t e g o u p s t r e a m g o d o w n s t r e a m n o

experts can be written as follows image 1 being the foremost part of es the inference engine mainly has the following functions process and analyze the useful ais data about vessels judge whether there is a vessel approaches the controlled waterway evaluate the static and dynamic parameters of vessels reason and sort vessel sequence dynamically generate traffic commands based on the knowledge base for eliminating the effect of changing speed and position of vessels the reasoning process of inference engine shown in fig 6 is ongoing and the sorted vessel sequence is refreshed dynamically generally the larger sum of the weights brings about a higher priority of traffic order especially a vessel waiting too long will be ranked the first to cross the controlled waterways 5 case study the problem is the decision making of traffic management which means giving the appropriate traffic command after sorting vessel sequence to address this problem basic five criteria are first determined to evaluate vessels by experienced experts as we mentioned above second via considering these criteria the weights of criteria and elements are calculated using fahp and these calculated weight values are used for es then the sorted result and the reliable traffic command can be achieved after the inference procedure of es in this section 130 test cases and one experiment have been made to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the scheduling results are analyzed in detail 5 1 simulation the arrivals and operations of vessels are considered to be of a stochastic nature and the capacity is limited thus it is rarely seen that more than 30 vessels flock in the controlled waterway in the rush hour in reality in order to simulate comprehensive situations of vessel traffic in the controlled waterway 100 independent test cases have been conducted based on fahp es and tsrs respectively case settings are shown in table 3 where all the vessel information is randomized and max ttnl means that the earliest vessel may arrive at the controlled waterway in one minute and the latest one may take 60 120 min the case where max ttnl is 60 120 min and vessel number is 50 100 is only an imaginary extreme crowded scenario fig 7 and fig 8 depict total and average waiting time of vessels in each test case respectively it is obvious that the total waiting time increases along the number of vessels but this can be significantly reduced by employing the proposed fahp es traffic scheduling method especially when the number of vessels exceeds 20 besides the scheduling result from tsrs could be unstable with the increase of vessel numbers in unit interval where the average waiting time may exceed 100 min in the worst case while it can be kept under 50 min using fahp es as a result the average waiting time could be reduced 30 min 56 per journey using the proposed method the computational time of tsrs is almost 0 since there is no complex calculation in scheduling process fig 9 shows the computational time of 100 independent cases using fahp es it is evident that a linear increase of arriving vessels will bring about a linear increment for the computational time the computational time is close to 3 s when 100 vessels arrives within 2 h however it is rare for so many vessels to approach the controlled waterway in the rush hour and furthermore the computational process of fahp es methodology can be further optimized and adjusted to explore the impact of vessel course on average waiting time another independent 30 test cases vessel numbers is 30 and max ttnl 60 using fahp es and tsrs respectively are given let the upward vessel number increase from 1 to 30 the average waiting time of each experiment is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that both results have similar trend where the waiting time reaches maximal when the vessel number is 13 or 17 respectively moreover when upward vessel number beyond the scope from 3 to 27 the average waiting time is less than 5 min this illustrates that vessels can pass through the controlled waterway with remarkable efficiency when there is little conflicts of vessel course however when the number of conflicts is large the vessel course has slight influence on scheduling result and other factors should also be considered 5 2 experiment in this paper 30 vessels crossed the shenbeizui controlled waterway during the same period are randomly selected and factual vessel information are shown in table 4 note that course and sailing time can be estimated based on vessels ais data i e east longitude north latitude and speed and suppose navigation state is ns and wt is zero for all vessels at the beginning for existing tsrs downward vessels have the priority of passing through the controlled waterways even there is a few minutes e g 5 min late they can pass through the controlled waterways earlier than upward vessels apart from that the traffic management always follows the fcfs rule which keeps the order of arrival after a simple calculation the scheduling and sequencing result can be achieved as shown in table 5 where w t represents the waiting time before the vessel passing though the controlled waterway note that in tsrs sequence the command wait go upstream for v e s s l e 1 which means keep waiting until v e s s l e 3 get out of the controlled waterway then v e s s l e 1 would get go upstream signal the rest can be done in the same manner and as a result each vessel can get its command for the fahp es methodology adopted in this paper the inference engine of es would take the attribute values of vessels into account and figure out the vessels dynamic characteristics mainly including vessel course and ttnl since these historical data collected form changjiang waterway bureau are reliable the inference engine is just employed for calculating the sum of index weights and ranking vessel sequence in this stage combine the above analysis with traffic rules in knowledge base the final scheduling and sequencing result for 30 vessels can be achieved according to table 5 the total waiting time of fcfs sequence is 1955 min with an average of 43 min waiting time per journey while the total waiting time of fahp es sequence is 1281 min with an average of 65 min per journey thus the waiting time can be averagely decreased 22 min with the proposed approach which help to relieve traffic congestion it has great potential for vessel scheduling to improve the traffic capacity and prevent potential bottlenecks thus tsrs should pay more attention to these dynamic influencing factors and revise the traffic rules appropriately by the contrast and analysis in fig 11 it can be seen that seven upward cargo vessels 23 3 among fahp es sequence may lengthen individual waiting time for the total optimal strategy for vessel scheduling from another point of view the vast majority of vessels 76 7 save individual waiting time and leave the waterway earlier which is valuable for making full use of waterway resource to promote its efficiency furthermore upward cargo vessels give way to downward passenger vessels will enhance service satisfaction and navigational safety the total benefits are not directly obtainable by adding individual benefits and it is inevitable that individual waiting time of certain vessels would be increased more efforts should be made to reduce the losses of these vessels in the further study 6 discussion the research with respect to traffic commands for vessels is relatively scarce especially in the controlled waterways while traffic congestion and vessel collision that occurred regularly have become main threatens to marine safety and traffic scheduling in this study we proposed an approach for vessel scheduling in the controlled waterways for the first time to ensure marine safety and facilitate the improvement of tsrs in the controlled waterways this fahp es methodology is set up to cut down the waiting time of vessels passing though the controlled waterways and give the optimal traffic commands for each vessel the experimental results indicate that the dynamic characteristics i e navigation state vessel course and sailing time have biggest the influence 67 1 on ranking vessels thus we can pay more attention to these dynamic influencing factors in addition the waiting time is averagely decreased about 22 min 33 8 in the experiment which brings about a decreased total sailing time of vessels and helps with prevention of traffic congestion some limitations of this study are narrow considerations about sifs for ranking vessels though we have taken vessel type freight type navigation state vessel course and sailing time into account there are some other important factors influencing the prioritization of the vessels such as vessel speed water depth fuel consumption and river velocity etc to be specific the real time vessel speed is much complicated and changing all the time however the sorted vessel sequence is refreshed dynamically and fahp es method have considered sailing time where the mean value of vessel speed is employed for calculating other factors could be involved in fahp es method according to the situation of the waterway in a word the problem could be solved if we consider more comprehensive sifs in further study moreover it should be noted that this result of the experiment is relatively limited to indicate the accurate increased efficiency and the concrete increased efficiency might be different each time owing to different vessel parameters and navigation situations notwithstanding its limitation this study does introduce an approach which tries to ensure the marine safety and improve the efficiency for vessels crossing the controlled waterways 7 conclusions the busy inland waterway with high density of vessel traffic is at an increased threat form the vessel collision and traffic congestion however the lack of criterion which used to list the prioritization of the vessels is a major bottleneck for the further development of the existing traffic management systems in yangtze river especially in the controlled waterways this paper proposed a novel method to sort vessel sequence for the controlled waterways in the upper yangtze river where fahp was employed for building a hierarchical mode and determining the weights of sifs and es was utilized for data processing and reasoning compared with the traditional methods of tsrs whose performances are not satisfactory the method would be more beneficial for enhancing the navigation efficiency and its strengths are as follows 1 the vessel data collected from ais are discussed and analyzed in detail which makes the sorted results of navigating vessels more scientific reasonable and practical 2 it provides a hierarchical structure to reveal how the sifs affect the vessel traffic scheduling in the controlled waterway which is valuable for the further research 3 the waiting time of vessels passing though the controlled waterways can be cut down considerably and it can be tailored to tackle vessel congestion problem 4 it provides concrete traffic command to each vessel passing through the waterway and facilitates the work of staff in tsrs the proposed methodology has been applied to shenbeizui controlled waterway according to the case study it can be seen that the management efficiency of vessel traffic scheduling could be enhanced without loss of generality this methodology can be used for other narrow one way restricted waterway and provide insight in vessel traffic of port areas coastal areas or even ocean as a future direction other decision making methods could be included in the methodology to make it more reliable and flexible and the evolved methodology could be applied to the dual controlled waterways where the navigation situation is much more dangerous and complicated acknowledgements this research is supported by science and

23042,an inland waterway transportation system is often claimed to be safe efficient and economic however traffic congestion and vessel collision have become serious threats to marine safety especially in the one way waterways the aim of this paper is to rank the vessels in the controlled waterways of the upper yangtze river and to generate the optimal traffic commands for each vessel so as to ensure marine safety and traffic efficiency in this study the proposed approach is based on the combination of fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp with an expert system es vessel data collected from automatic identification systems ais are first analyzed by experts and some external environment and internal factors are selected as significant influencing factors sifs fahp is then used for modelling a hierarchical structure and determining the weight of each sif finally the sorted vessel sequence and appropriate traffic commands can be achieved using es the experiment result shows that the waiting time of vessels is averagely decreased about 22 min compared with the existing traffic signal revealing system this will not only significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of the vessel traffic scheduling but also increase the waterway capacity by reducing the travelling time keywords vessel scheduling waterway transportation one way waterway fahp es 1 introduction yangtze river the busiest navigable inland waterway connects eastern central and western parts of china and its freight volume has ranked the first all around the world since 2010 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2014 however when vessel traffic intensifies the inland waterway transportation system iwts is at an increased threat from traffic congestion and vessel collisions especially in the controlled waterways the controlled waterways exist in the upper yangtze river and usually hold poor natural conditions such as sharp corner narrow channel and turbulent water flow gan et al 2016 for the sake of safety two vessels which have opposite direction cannot get into the controlled waterway at the same time therefore a traffic signal revealing system tsrs a service implemented by a competent authority for improving safety and efficiency of vessel traffic must be applied to reveal correct command of waiting or going forward which compels the vessels to pass through the controlled waterway in one direction at one time according to the command in tsrs operators have to confirm the position of vessels by visual observation and very high frequency vhf radio communication first then estimate vessels time of arriving in the border of the controlled waterway and list a prioritization of the vessels after that operators could make decision based on the traffic rules obviously the process of ranking vessels is of intuition and experience in this case some dangerous and irksome scenarios are inevitable such as collision downward vessels turning around making sharp turns overtaking or long waiting etc as a result it may lead to casualty property loss and marine pollution accordingly the ability that tsrs provides operators with a powerful tool which help sorting vessel sequence and giving a correct traffic command in time is extremely important tsrs is a complex and dynamic vessel scheduling system and takes various factors into account such as vessel type carrying capacity vessel speed vessel position river velocity etc these static and dynamic information influence each other and increase the difficulty of assessing the priority of vessels passing through the controlled waterways furthermore uncertainties are involved because vessel data is sometimes incomplete and the subjective factors of human and management cannot be ignored fortunately vessels are forced to be equipped with automatic identification system ais which automatically broadcasts and transmits information of the sailing status of vessels the information includes vessel positions from global positioning system vessel speed sailing course vessel types navigation status together with an unique identification number maritime mobile service identity haratimokhtari et al 2007 and so on ais data are neutral and carry little subjective distortion to provide insight in vessel traffic wang et al 2013 and the spread of ais makes observation of vessels actual state more accurately easily and faster than before this motivates us to appropriately consider influencing factors and uncertainties and develop an ais based mathematical model to improve the ability of vessel traffic scheduling for the controlled waterways with this goal in mind as the core element of intelligent tsrs the vessel scheduling algorithm then will be evolved considerably in the literature general research on marine safety and maritime transportation has been reported for example the ais data analysis usually forms the basis of the navigation study and deepens the understanding about the vessel traffic in the waterways mou et al 2010 xiao et al 2015 and methods like fuzzy set evidential reasoning and bayesian network were utilized to assesses navigational risk in inland waterway zhang et al 2013 2016 some analysis based on spatial temporal fusion risk indices and quantitative risk assessment qra were adopted to evaluate the risk about vessel collisions and traffic congestions chai et al 2017 qu et al 2011 wang et al 2013 the findings reveal that the urgent task to keep the safety efficiency and fairness of the vessel scheduling at the same time is difficult and the overall efficiency and transportation safety are sometimes sacrificed as a result vessel traffic scheduling approach for safety and efficiency in the narrow shallow and busy waterways have attracted more attentions jovanović et al 2005 discussed non preemptive priority servicing with limited anchorage area and indicated that a trade off between number of berths and anchorage capacity should be made prandtstetter et al 2015 proposed a variable neighborhood search approach to find an optimal lock schedule for multiple watergates which reduced the number of empty lockage while decreased the overall vessel travel times for avoiding vessel collision caused by ship awaiting in outbound in congested one way waterways xu et al 2008 selected the distance of berth the size type and draught of vessel as weights to sort vessel queue and lin et al 2014 further considered the route of vessel as factors of vessel scheduling priority zhang et al 2017 proposed a much more efficient traffic scheduling approach for restricted two way waterway compared with the first come first served fcfs model considering some physical characteristics of the waterway and vessels a queueing model of ship traffic in the bosporus straits was proposed to perform the simulation of maritime traffic at the actual situation mavrakis and kontinakis 2008 the result reveals that a linear increase of arriving vessels would give rise to an approximately exponential increment for both average waiting time and queue length although these findings could enhance traffic efficiency to a certain degree transportation service operation flow and environmental characteristics for navigation are completely different between the above channels and a one way inland waterway therefore they cannot be used to solve such problems in the controlled waterways regarding the aspect of the controlled waterways few studies have investigated the traffic management there since the variance of vessel speed has been treated as one of the most important factors of impeding the traffic efficiency wang et al 2017 gan et al 2017 constructed an improved multilayer perceptron network model based on easily acquired dynamic data of the vessels the accurate long term vessel speed prediction in the controlled waterways is obtained gan et al 2018 further proposed a data driven approach for forecasting the vessel trajectory length in the controlled waterways additionally zhao et al 2012 proposed an improved kalman filter model to accurately predict the location of vessels in the case of ais data is missing the above researches emphasized on the prediction of various navigation characteristics in the controlled waterways and provided a platform for guiding vessels in an optimal manner nevertheless they are still failed to support decision making for intelligent traffic management in other words they cannot generate the optimal traffic commands for each vessel directly in this paper a novel approach is proposed to enhance traffic vessel scheduling and generate optimal traffic commands for each vessel in the controlled waterways for the first time the vessel information gathered from ais is first analyzed by experts and some external environment and internal factors i e vessel type freight type navigation state vessel course and sailing time are selected as significant influencing factors sifs fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp is then used for modelling a hierarchical structure and determining the weight of each sif which helps to prioritize the vessels finally the sorted vessel sequence and appropriate traffic commands can be achieved by an expert system es this study aims not only to optimize vessel sequence passing through the controlled waterways with higher efficiency but also to develop general guidelines for ensuring marine safety and facilitating the improvement of tsrs the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the detailed issues for traffic management in the controlled waterways are presented section 3 illustrates the theory preliminaries and the proposed methodology structure is given in section 4 then in section 5 the case study is given to verify the applicability and performance of this approach followed by the discussion illustrated in section 6 finally section 7 concludes the paper 2 background problem statement 2 1 controlled waterway and tsrs the controlled waterway is defined as the one way waterway where the vessels can only navigate in one direction to upstream or to downstream at one time it widely exists in the upper reaches of yangtze river a typical controlled waterway in sichuan province of china shenbeizui controlled waterway is shown in fig 1 and there is a signal station inside as a significant part of tsrs signal station is usually set up to reveal correct traffic commands and guides the vessels to pass through the controlled waterway in one direction at one time thus ensuring marine safety and traffic efficiency all vessels that prepare to pass through controlled waterway have to stay in the waiting area until signal station sends traffic signal to the appointed vessel the traffic signals of tsrs can be divided into five categories go downstream allowing the appointed vessel from upstream of the controlled waterway to enter and pass through the controlled waterway follow downstream allowing appointed vessel from upstream of the controlled waterway to follow the previous one to enter and pass through the controlled waterway go upstream allowing appointed vessel from downstream of the controlled waterway to enter and pass through the controlled waterway follow upstream allowing appointed vessel from downstream of the controlled waterway to follow the previous one to enter and pass through the controlled waterway wait signal all vessels have to wait at the outer of controlled waterway while the appointed one has got one of above signals to enter the controlled waterway it is usually for upward vessels in traditional tsrs operators confirm the position of navigating vessels based on observation and vhf radio communication then make decision for traffic commands according to the traffic rules of the controlled waterways there are two basic rules as follows fcfs the first vessel to arrive at the waiting area of the controlled waterway is the first to be allowed to pass through one for consideration of fairness fcfs is a popular rule for vessel traffic scheduling in inland waterways downward vessels have priority over upward vessel tsrs should make every effort to avoid the downward vessels turning around or making sharp turns since these operations are extremely dangerous for navigating downward vessel for safety concerns this rule is the first and foremost consideration for vessel traffic scheduling in the controlled waterways the duty of staff in tsrs is to determine which vessel first pass through the controlled waterway by ranking the vessels using above simple rules however it is difficult to keep the scheduling safe and effective at the same time with the maritime traffic growth thus the staffs usually make decisions where some efficiency would be sacrificed for the greater safety this will result in upward vessels spending more unnecessary waiting time which causes a negative economic and environmental impact on fuel consumption and route timing for example fig 2 gan et al 2017 shows the waiting time of a randomly selected vessel crossed the shenbeizui controlled waterway in 2014 the vessel crossed the area for 86 times during this period and the average waiting time it spent was 62 6 min per journey gan et al 2017 since hundreds of vessels operate on the controlled waterway each day it will be quite dangerous once one downward vessel stops waiting and turns around 2 2 problem formulation based on the above introduction and analysis the goal of vessel traffic scheduling should be improving the traffic efficiency when guarantee navigation safety in the controlled waterway and one should attempt to reduce the total waiting time of all vessels due to the complexity of the actual navigation and the variety of ais information it is very difficult to analyze each affecting factors of vessel traffic scheduling however these factors can be selected and divided into several kinds with the help of experts and then quantified as numerical values to weight their relative importance the inference engine of the expert system calculates the attribute weights of each vessel separately and these weight values can be used to rank the vessel traffic sequence where the vessel with high value has the priority to pass through the controlled waterways suppose a hierarchical structure of the sifs of vessel traffic scheduling could be set up with the help of experts or tsrs the goal of the first stage is to calculate and quantify the weight of each sif using fahp the second stage aims to rank the vessels according to their sums of weights and generate accurate traffic commands for the vessels based on es in this paper a fahp es methodology is adopted 3 methodology 3 1 fuzzy analytic hierarchy process the analytic hierarchy process ahp proposed by saaty 1980 is an evaluation method that helps to make a choice from several alternatives for complex systems and provides a comparison of the related options based on the subdivision of the issue in a hierarchical form a hierarchy structure of ahp consisted of three layers aim layer criteria layer and element layer wang et al 2011 as shown in fig 3 to be specific the aim is to achieve the sorted vessel sequence in this paper and the second layer includes the sifs about vessels and navigation conditions while the detailed indexes make up the element layer however the traditional ahp is difficult to meet the consistency and cannot reflect the human thinking style a fuzzy ahp method is thus applied to tackle this problem based on the combination of ahp and fuzzy theory zadeh 1987 fahp has several advantages compared with ahp the most obvious difference between them is the fuzzy consistent matrix introduced in fahp which simplifies the computing there are numerous methods based on fahp proposed in various literature these methods combine fahp with other theories to complete the whole calculation process after determining the main and sub indicators weights güngör et al 2009 jia et al 2012 chamoli 2015 for easy computing the procedure of fahp method we chose in this paper is as follows step 1 determine the sifs and detailed elements by experts or experience and then develop a hierarchy structure after analyzing the indexes system of evaluation these assessment criteria could be either qualitative or quantitative step 2 construct a fuzzy reciprocal judgment matrix and the corresponding fuzzy consistent matrix they can be achieved by the pair wise comparisons based on the judgments of experts and the relative importance of one factor to another then can be seen step 3 calculate the weights of sifs and its sub indicators utilizing the fuzzy consistent matrix and the assessment can be carried out by these weights 3 2 expert system es is a branch of artificial intelligence and can be extensively used to cope with problems at the human expert level in a specific domain sihwi et al 2017 this paper adopts the rule based es which represents expert knowledge in the form of rules such as if then the rules can then be served to perform operations on data and inference for reaching proper conclusion ikram and qamar 2014 knowledge base and inference engine are the most important parts of an expert system the establishment of knowledge base mainly includes knowledge acquisition and knowledge representation knowledge acquisition is the process of gathering knowledge from experts or relevant equipment and the expert in this paper is someone who has years of experience in traffic management knowledge representation is the process of organizing the knowledge and the method of production rule is adopted based on certain rules the inference engine derives a conclusion from known facts and can be successfully applied in different domains arias aranda et al 2010 grahovac and devedzic 2010 in order to enhance the traffic management and ensure navigation safety in the controlled waterways we try to find an optimal sorted sequence of vessels using the inference engine 4 fahp es construction the ultimate purpose of this paper is to sort vessel sequence and generate the optimal traffic commands with the help of effective factors to begin with the main criteria are comprehensively analyzed by experts to determine the sifs in the process after that the experts evaluate the importance of these factors based on their experience and previous analysis fahp is employed for determining the weights of the main criteria and then es is utilized for data processing and reasoning in this way the prioritization of vessels and traffic commands are obtained taking the component essentials of tsrs into consideration the vessel priority is strongly affected by the man vessel equipment factor experts think the most vital characteristics that affect the vessel traffic scheduling are vessel type freight type vessel course navigation state and sailing time in view of these parameters we build a corresponding hierarchical structure and these static characteristics and dynamic characteristics are shown in fig 4 4 1 confirming the weight of sifs different people judge on the prioritization of vessels quite differently therefore affecting factors have various levels of importance from different perspectives because of that we propose a fahp based method which takes the subjective judgments into account to reduce the uncertainty and vagueness mikaeil et al 2011 by establishing the fuzzy consistent matrix the weights of the criteria and elements can be calculated after that the hierarchy structure percentage weight is obtained the detailed procedure is given as follows step 1 several experts carry out pair wise comparison for the factors in same layer individually by using 0 1 0 9 scale to be specific the larger scale gets the more important this factor becomes for instance vessel type b 1 and freight type b 2 are equally important if the scale is 0 5 while b 1 is much more important than b 2 if the scale is 0 9 the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix r can be described as 1 r r 11 r 1 n r n 1 r n n where r i j represents the membership of fuzzy relation that factor b i is more important than another factor b j which is in the same layer and r i j meets the condition that 2 r i j r j i 1 i j 1 2 n step 2 establish the fuzzy consistent matrix b based on the fuzzy complementary judgment matrix r and the concrete calculating formulas are as follows 3 r i j 1 n r i j i j 1 2 n 4 b i j r i r j 2 n 1 0 5 i j 1 2 n where b i j denotes the element of the fuzzy consistent matrix due to the subjective judgments of different decision makers we invite m experienced experts to score and the relevant formulas now can be defined as 5 r i k j 1 n r i j k i j 1 2 n k 1 2 m 6 b i j k r i k r j k 2 n 1 0 5 i j 1 2 n k 1 2 m now we get m matrices b k b i j k n n aim to obtain the final fuzzy consistent matrix the concept of important degree is introduced the new matrix b b i j n n satisfies the condition that 7 b i j k 1 m γ k b i j k γ k 0 k 1 m γ k 1 where γ k is the important degree of one expert sept 3 calculate the weight of each factor by 8 ω i j 1 n b i j n 2 1 n n 1 i j 1 2 n where ω i represents the weight of one criteria or element to prepare the comparison matrices we have got the assistance of four experienced experts who perform the pairwise comparisons on each index of criteria layer shown in fig 4 first and the four fuzzy complementary judgment matrices are as follows r 1 0 5 0 6 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 4 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 9 0 9 0 5 0 6 0 3 0 9 0 9 0 4 0 5 0 4 0 9 0 9 0 7 0 6 0 5 r 2 0 5 0 3 0 1 0 2 0 1 0 7 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 9 0 9 0 5 0 5 0 4 0 8 0 9 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 9 0 8 0 6 0 5 0 5 r 3 0 5 0 4 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 6 0 5 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 8 0 5 0 4 0 3 0 9 0 9 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 9 0 9 0 7 0 6 0 5 r 4 0 5 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 2 0 5 0 5 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 9 0 9 0 5 0 4 0 4 0 9 0 9 0 6 0 5 0 4 0 8 0 9 0 6 0 6 0 5 according to eqs 3 6 we get four fuzzy consistent matrices b k the knowledge and experience of four experts involved are considered as equivalent for this reason suppose the important degree of each expert is equal while combining their judgments and let γ k 0 25 based on eq 7 the final fuzzy consistent matrices b is obtained as follows b 0 500 0 491 0 282 0 263 0 232 0 509 0 500 0 291 0 272 0 241 0 718 0 709 0 500 0 482 0 450 0 737 0 728 0 518 0 500 0 469 0 768 0 759 0 550 0 531 0 500 then after calculating the weight of each factor in criteria layer the assessment concerning criteria layer can be accomplished in a similar way we can obtain the weight of other factor in criteria layer and element layer therefore the specific calculation processes are not given here and the whole hierarchy structure percentage weight of sorting vessel sequence can be seen from table 1 4 2 sorting vessel sequence the weights of these factors offer a reference for sorting vessel sequence since all the data in this work are real data collected from ais machine we need decode these data and then store them in the knowledge base for this reason the knowledge base need to be set up with the ability of storing these decoded real time data about vessels apart from traffic rules and expert experience this paper does not deal with specific decoding procedure and suppose these ais data are available and decoded the structure of knowledge base zhou and chen 2014 in this expert system is modified as fig 5 according to the expert knowledge and knowledge base management experience we analyze the specific parameters of vessels and then figure out a summary of the five basic traffic commands which given in table 2 to describe the knowledge we use the method of production rule in backus naur form bnf grammar which is a notation technique for context free grammars and could be used to design detailed and clear rules laros et al 2011 the basic form in this expert system can be defined as follows p r e d i c a t e p 1 v e s s e l t y p e p a s s e n g e r v e s s e l c a r g o v e s s e l p 2 f r e i g h t t y p e c o n t a i n e r g e n e r a l o t h e r s p 3 n a v i g a t i o n s t a t e g o u p s t r e a m g o d o w n s t r e a m n o

experts can be written as follows image 1 being the foremost part of es the inference engine mainly has the following functions process and analyze the useful ais data about vessels judge whether there is a vessel approaches the controlled waterway evaluate the static and dynamic parameters of vessels reason and sort vessel sequence dynamically generate traffic commands based on the knowledge base for eliminating the effect of changing speed and position of vessels the reasoning process of inference engine shown in fig 6 is ongoing and the sorted vessel sequence is refreshed dynamically generally the larger sum of the weights brings about a higher priority of traffic order especially a vessel waiting too long will be ranked the first to cross the controlled waterways 5 case study the problem is the decision making of traffic management which means giving the appropriate traffic command after sorting vessel sequence to address this problem basic five criteria are first determined to evaluate vessels by experienced experts as we mentioned above second via considering these criteria the weights of criteria and elements are calculated using fahp and these calculated weight values are used for es then the sorted result and the reliable traffic command can be achieved after the inference procedure of es in this section 130 test cases and one experiment have been made to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the scheduling results are analyzed in detail 5 1 simulation the arrivals and operations of vessels are considered to be of a stochastic nature and the capacity is limited thus it is rarely seen that more than 30 vessels flock in the controlled waterway in the rush hour in reality in order to simulate comprehensive situations of vessel traffic in the controlled waterway 100 independent test cases have been conducted based on fahp es and tsrs respectively case settings are shown in table 3 where all the vessel information is randomized and max ttnl means that the earliest vessel may arrive at the controlled waterway in one minute and the latest one may take 60 120 min the case where max ttnl is 60 120 min and vessel number is 50 100 is only an imaginary extreme crowded scenario fig 7 and fig 8 depict total and average waiting time of vessels in each test case respectively it is obvious that the total waiting time increases along the number of vessels but this can be significantly reduced by employing the proposed fahp es traffic scheduling method especially when the number of vessels exceeds 20 besides the scheduling result from tsrs could be unstable with the increase of vessel numbers in unit interval where the average waiting time may exceed 100 min in the worst case while it can be kept under 50 min using fahp es as a result the average waiting time could be reduced 30 min 56 per journey using the proposed method the computational time of tsrs is almost 0 since there is no complex calculation in scheduling process fig 9 shows the computational time of 100 independent cases using fahp es it is evident that a linear increase of arriving vessels will bring about a linear increment for the computational time the computational time is close to 3 s when 100 vessels arrives within 2 h however it is rare for so many vessels to approach the controlled waterway in the rush hour and furthermore the computational process of fahp es methodology can be further optimized and adjusted to explore the impact of vessel course on average waiting time another independent 30 test cases vessel numbers is 30 and max ttnl 60 using fahp es and tsrs respectively are given let the upward vessel number increase from 1 to 30 the average waiting time of each experiment is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that both results have similar trend where the waiting time reaches maximal when the vessel number is 13 or 17 respectively moreover when upward vessel number beyond the scope from 3 to 27 the average waiting time is less than 5 min this illustrates that vessels can pass through the controlled waterway with remarkable efficiency when there is little conflicts of vessel course however when the number of conflicts is large the vessel course has slight influence on scheduling result and other factors should also be considered 5 2 experiment in this paper 30 vessels crossed the shenbeizui controlled waterway during the same period are randomly selected and factual vessel information are shown in table 4 note that course and sailing time can be estimated based on vessels ais data i e east longitude north latitude and speed and suppose navigation state is ns and wt is zero for all vessels at the beginning for existing tsrs downward vessels have the priority of passing through the controlled waterways even there is a few minutes e g 5 min late they can pass through the controlled waterways earlier than upward vessels apart from that the traffic management always follows the fcfs rule which keeps the order of arrival after a simple calculation the scheduling and sequencing result can be achieved as shown in table 5 where w t represents the waiting time before the vessel passing though the controlled waterway note that in tsrs sequence the command wait go upstream for v e s s l e 1 which means keep waiting until v e s s l e 3 get out of the controlled waterway then v e s s l e 1 would get go upstream signal the rest can be done in the same manner and as a result each vessel can get its command for the fahp es methodology adopted in this paper the inference engine of es would take the attribute values of vessels into account and figure out the vessels dynamic characteristics mainly including vessel course and ttnl since these historical data collected form changjiang waterway bureau are reliable the inference engine is just employed for calculating the sum of index weights and ranking vessel sequence in this stage combine the above analysis with traffic rules in knowledge base the final scheduling and sequencing result for 30 vessels can be achieved according to table 5 the total waiting time of fcfs sequence is 1955 min with an average of 43 min waiting time per journey while the total waiting time of fahp es sequence is 1281 min with an average of 65 min per journey thus the waiting time can be averagely decreased 22 min with the proposed approach which help to relieve traffic congestion it has great potential for vessel scheduling to improve the traffic capacity and prevent potential bottlenecks thus tsrs should pay more attention to these dynamic influencing factors and revise the traffic rules appropriately by the contrast and analysis in fig 11 it can be seen that seven upward cargo vessels 23 3 among fahp es sequence may lengthen individual waiting time for the total optimal strategy for vessel scheduling from another point of view the vast majority of vessels 76 7 save individual waiting time and leave the waterway earlier which is valuable for making full use of waterway resource to promote its efficiency furthermore upward cargo vessels give way to downward passenger vessels will enhance service satisfaction and navigational safety the total benefits are not directly obtainable by adding individual benefits and it is inevitable that individual waiting time of certain vessels would be increased more efforts should be made to reduce the losses of these vessels in the further study 6 discussion the research with respect to traffic commands for vessels is relatively scarce especially in the controlled waterways while traffic congestion and vessel collision that occurred regularly have become main threatens to marine safety and traffic scheduling in this study we proposed an approach for vessel scheduling in the controlled waterways for the first time to ensure marine safety and facilitate the improvement of tsrs in the controlled waterways this fahp es methodology is set up to cut down the waiting time of vessels passing though the controlled waterways and give the optimal traffic commands for each vessel the experimental results indicate that the dynamic characteristics i e navigation state vessel course and sailing time have biggest the influence 67 1 on ranking vessels thus we can pay more attention to these dynamic influencing factors in addition the waiting time is averagely decreased about 22 min 33 8 in the experiment which brings about a decreased total sailing time of vessels and helps with prevention of traffic congestion some limitations of this study are narrow considerations about sifs for ranking vessels though we have taken vessel type freight type navigation state vessel course and sailing time into account there are some other important factors influencing the prioritization of the vessels such as vessel speed water depth fuel consumption and river velocity etc to be specific the real time vessel speed is much complicated and changing all the time however the sorted vessel sequence is refreshed dynamically and fahp es method have considered sailing time where the mean value of vessel speed is employed for calculating other factors could be involved in fahp es method according to the situation of the waterway in a word the problem could be solved if we consider more comprehensive sifs in further study moreover it should be noted that this result of the experiment is relatively limited to indicate the accurate increased efficiency and the concrete increased efficiency might be different each time owing to different vessel parameters and navigation situations notwithstanding its limitation this study does introduce an approach which tries to ensure the marine safety and improve the efficiency for vessels crossing the controlled waterways 7 conclusions the busy inland waterway with high density of vessel traffic is at an increased threat form the vessel collision and traffic congestion however the lack of criterion which used to list the prioritization of the vessels is a major bottleneck for the further development of the existing traffic management systems in yangtze river especially in the controlled waterways this paper proposed a novel method to sort vessel sequence for the controlled waterways in the upper yangtze river where fahp was employed for building a hierarchical mode and determining the weights of sifs and es was utilized for data processing and reasoning compared with the traditional methods of tsrs whose performances are not satisfactory the method would be more beneficial for enhancing the navigation efficiency and its strengths are as follows 1 the vessel data collected from ais are discussed and analyzed in detail which makes the sorted results of navigating vessels more scientific

23043,this paper explores the role of wave spectral characteristics and wave time history on the estimation of extreme mooring loads on floating offshore wind turbines this research is applied to the deepcwind semi submersible platform located at the bimep test site in the north of spain extreme sea states are selected using the inverse first order reliability method i form mooring loads are modelled by quasi static and dynamic numerical approaches different wave time series are generated numerically for each sea state to investigate the variability in predicted peak loads all cases simulated incorporate the combined effect of wind and waves differences of approximately 30 in peak loads are found for the mooring system reaching 40 79 for the most extreme sea states safety factors are proposed to account for sensitivity to wave groupiness in modelling loads under extreme work conditions of the deepcwind platform e g pitch and velocity control a comparison between theoretical and real sea wave spectra is also modelled to investigate possible differences due to the presence of multiple spectral peaks associated with swell and wind seas in general results show differences below 12 in the prediction of loads between both assumptions keywords mooring system spectrum wave groupiness extreme loads quasi static model dynamic model 1 introduction offshore wind energy is one of the most prominent competitive and reliable sources for power generation traditionally wind turbines are installed on fixed foundations such as gravity based structures monopiles jackets or tripods however the cost effectiveness ratio of fixed foundations in deep waters is not competitive and the continuous technological development have contributed to the emergence of new alternatives the most immediate option is installing wind turbines on floating platforms different floating offshore wind turbine fowt concepts have been developed such as the spar buoy the semi submersible and the tension leg platform each has specific technical challenges and a unique dynamic response despite conceptual differences among them all concepts require a mooring system to ensure their survival and station keeping in the harsh marine environment and to achieve a successful platform design mooring systems are an important element to the stability of fowts currently several possible mooring configurations and types of components are available harris et al 2004 spread moorings catenary multi catenary with weights and buoys and taut spread mooring single point mooring turret mooring catenary anchor leg mooring calm and single anchor leg mooring salm and dynamic positioning active mooring and propulsion numerical modelling techniques are commonly applied to estimate the performance of these systems on a floating platform traditionally tensions at the fairlead can be evaluated by quasi static or dynamic models quasi static models have a low computational cost but do not evaluate drag and inertial forces considered in dynamic models mooring models have been widely studied through simulations and laboratory tests barrera et al 2019 barrera et al 2017 azcona et al 2017a lindahl 1985 models coupling hydrodynamics aerodynamics and mooring systems are especially relevant when estimating the response of offshore floating platforms numerous studies have been carried out to address possible uncertainties that these models may induce specifications used for numerical modelling are described in the offshore code comparison collaboration continuation with correlation oc5 project robertson et al 2014b robertson et al 2017 the effects of the different approaches on hydrodynamic models were demonstrated in hall and goupee 2015 in which approaches with full second order wave forces and viscous mean drift forces were compared with laboratory tests traditionally the design of mooring lines for floating structures is based on considering several limit states dnvgl os e301 2015 haukanes et al 2017 ultimate uls accidental als fatigue fls and service sls the uls and fls contribute to determining the mooring line resistance required to withstand extreme environmental loads and the accumulated load cycles over a given lifetime of a structure the als refers to events of accidental damage and evaluates the resistance of a mooring system after damage has occurred the sls represents the requirement that structure be able to meet its service criteria the verification of each limit state requires the identification of the metocean conditions and their variability at a particular location to estimate the profitability of a project different techniques including algorithms based on clustering and selection camus et al 2011 and environmental contour lines methods haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 dnv rp c205 2014 have been developed to evaluate the long term effects of metocean conditions this article focuses on the design of extreme loads uls on the mooring lines of a fowt building on prior research on this topic the evaluation of the mooring loads according to iec 61400 3 iec 61400 3 was reported in azcona et al 2017b and different formulations have been proposed to characterise the extreme mooring tensions due to snap loads hsu et al 2017 additionally the effects of environmental conditions on peak mooring loads were evaluated for marine energy converters through field tests in harnois et al 2016 previous studies have not clearly demonstrated the influence of wave time history or real sea wave spectra in the evaluation of extreme loads as key factors for a safe mooring design the innovation of this study is the evaluation of the impact of different wave characterisation spectrum and time series on mooring design load wave definitions can be described in the time domain or frequency domain a particular sea state can be defined by multiple free surface temporal series each one with a different wave groupiness distribution in the time domain wave groupiness is a sequence of wave trains characterised by a height period and energy taking part of a sea state the adding of all wave groupiness constitutes the complete sea state time series this study analyses the design load through two statistical techniques the selection of peak loads and the maximum local additionally safety factors are proposed to quantify the uncertainty associated with wave history from the frequency domain point of view the wave description is achieved by means of a theoretical spectrum such as a jonswap or pierson moskowitz however this assumption can generate wave energy distribution uncertainties in comparison with real sea wave spectra in the target location theoretical spectra concentrate wave energy around one peak but the wave energy may be distributed over multiple peaks the different wave energy distribution in the spectrum is evaluated comparing theoretical and buoy measurements to estimate the variability of peak loads on mooring system a methodology involving numerical models of mooring systems is implemented to evaluate the variability of peak loads as a consequence of different wave definitions loads on a mooring system are analysed according to two different sources of uncertainty associated with waves 1 wave time history characterised by the presence of different wave groupiness and 2 wave spectrum shape the remainder of the paper is organised as follows in section 2 the methodology used in this work the location examined metocean databases and buoys the definition of fowt and the numerical models studied are described section 3 describes the sea states selected and the numerical results obtained from the calibration and validation as well as the analysis of loads on the mooring systems the main conclusions of this investigation are presented in section 4 2 methodology this section describes the method developed to evaluate loads on a mooring system considering i site conditions ii sea states iii platform design criteria iv numerical model approach and v peak load assessment of the mooring system a schematic description of the methodology is provided in fig 1 the study considers a particular location and a specific type of floating platform using three different steps the objective of the first step is to analyse the design sea states of the proposed installation location using metocean data the second step involves the implementation and validation of the numerical model developed to simulate fowt behaviour in terms of movements and tensions relative to laboratory tests finally the third step uses the validated numerical model to estimate the peak mooring loads for specific sea states selected in the first step 2 1 site assessment the location selected for this study is bimep test site 2 894 43 563 an area off armintza in the basque coast north of spain this location is characterised by a predominant regime of waves coming from the north west direction with an average significant wave height of 1 7 m maximum values of approximately 9 m and periods between 8 and 12 s fig 2 metocean analysis of bimep 2017 iturrioz et al 2017 the average wind speed is 7 m s and winds generally come from the west south and east with the strongest winds blowing westward at a velocity of over 20 m s regime of winds is presented in fig 2 at 10 m over the surface 2 2 sea states sea states are defined by combining metocean hindcast and instrumental data using statistical techniques two different sea state selection methods are considered in this research the first one is based on the application of i form described in haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 its main target is to predict the metoceanic characteristics for different return periods the data used in this selection comprise the reanalysis database described in section 2 2 1 the objective of this first selection method is to study the variability of the loads of the mooring lines based on a theoretical spectrum jonswap using random seedings on the wave time series reconstruction to obtain different distributions of wave groupiness the goal of the second selection method is to analyse the variability of the loads on the mooring lines by comparing the theoretical and observed spectra observations are described in detail in section 2 2 2 the results of the selection methods are presented in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 2 2 1 numerical metocean data wind and wave resource assessment at global regional and local scales requires the use of numerical databases due to the coarse spatial resolution of instrumental measurements numerical databases provide long time series that allow for the characterisation of wind and wave performance in the long term information used in this work is derived from the reanalysis databases developed by ihcantabria and bimep in the framework of trl project metocean analysis of bimep 2017 the methodology used to generate the wind numerical database seawind is described in menendez et al 2014 undisturbed mean wind speeds and directions for the 1985 2015 period are provided with a resolution of 1 h wind data are modelled with the weather research forecasting model and the module advanced research dynamical solver developed by the national center for atmospheric research skamarock et al 2008 this limited area model lam is coupled to the global atmospheric climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 which provides the boundary and initial conditions regarding sea state parameters the simulating waves nearshore model ris et al 1999 is used to generate the global ocean waves gow database reguero et al 2012 significant wave heights wave peak periods and prevailing wave directions for the 1985 2015 period are provided with a 1 h resolution metocean hindcast is used to assess long term environmental conditions in a specific location marine structures design standards recommend using environmental conditions for a given annual exceedance probability for this reason different methods have been proposed over the years for the selection of a representative subset of a large amount of data in this paper the inverse first order reliability method i form is applied haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 this method proposes to obtain the long term metocean conditions generating an environmental contour corresponding to a certain return period given by standards dnv rp c205 2014 2 2 2 measured metocean data two different sources of observations are used in this work 1 the bimep wavescan buoy and 2 the anteia buoy the wavescan directional buoy installed at the bimep metocean analysis of bimep 2017 iturrioz et al 2017 test site is located two nautical miles off the basque coast 2 8848 e 43 4682 n 80 m depth the collected metocean data currents wind and waves are stored internally in the data logger and only a limited number of parameters are transmitted to the shore station in real time using satellite communication only one set of statistical data are available from this buoy specifically mean wind speed significant wave height and wave peak period wind characteristics provided by this buoy are used in this research the anteia is a directional wave buoy located at bimep with a diameter of 0 6 m and a weight of 26 kg this oceanographic buoy allows for the collection of wave height direction period data as well as water temperature in real time statistical and spectral parameters are provided by the buoy every 1800 s wave spectral data provided by this buoy are employed in this research 2 3 definition of offshore semisubmersible platform deepcwind semisubmersible the fowt under investigation was the deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson et al fig 3 the platform has three columns with heave plates and a fourth central column where a 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is mounted station keeping is provided by three catenary chain moorings this platform has been widely studied by laboratory tests and simulations robertson et al 2014 hall and goupee 2015 robertson et al 2017 the most important features of this platform and its mooring system with respect to sea water level swl and centre of mass cm are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively the coordinate system fig 4 used in this investigation is set such that waves and wind travel from the negative to positive x axis this direction is set to represent zero degrees all simulations in this work are referred to this direction 2 4 description of the numerical model a complete numerical model in the time domain has been implemented with the purpose of modelling the dynamic behaviour of fowt martini et al 2015 armesto et al 2016 armesto et al 2017 this section presents the main characteristics of the model describing the governing equation and other relevant considerations related to it the numerical model is built by coupling three different models corresponding to the hydrodynamic aerodynamic and mooring systems each model solves the governing equations from each system individually the hydrodynamic model is focused on describing the global response movements and rotations of the platform the mooring model analyses the evolution of the forces on the mooring lines that are applied over the floating platform the aerodynamic model examines the velocity of rotation of the wind turbine which provides forces and momenta over the floating platform the three models are coupled and solved under a unique system of equations providing information at each time step the hydrodynamic model solves the cummins equation cummins 1962 a second order ordinary differential equation with a convolution integral applied to solve the radiation problem 1 1 m a k t 0 k t τ k τ d τ g k t f e t f c t f w t f m t where m is the corresponding inertia matrix of the floating structure a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency k is the retardation matrix g is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix t is time and k k and k are the floating platform acceleration velocity and displacements respectively external forces are represented by wave excitation forces f e current forces f c wind forces f w and mooring system forces f m traditionally the majority of hydrodynamic codes use only first order theory for potential flow therefore the codes only consider forces and movements at the same frequency as that of the incident wave the first order theory neglects the nonlinearity in the incident wave potential of steeper waves the first order velocity potential is obtained by a superposition of the hydrostatic radiation and diffraction problems in the floating structure mean position this solution is adequate for small wave amplitudes as well as small platform motions the available alternatives to take into account the nonlinearity range from the higher order boundary element methods to cutting edge navier stokes equations the second order hydrodynamic theory pinkster 1980 simos et al 2018 attempts to approximate the nonlinear free surface boundary condition and wave body interactions using the superposition of the quadratic interaction of the first order velocity terms as well as terms of the second order solution of the velocity potential the model presented herein neglects the contribution of the second order potential in the numerical computation of the force term simos et al 2018 for irregular waves with n components and j degrees of freedom the first order wave excitation force can be represented by 2 2 f e 1 j r e n 1 n a n q j w n e i w n t j 1 2 3 4 5 6 where a n e i w n t is the complex wave component a n is the complex wave amplitude w n is the wave frequency i is the imaginary number and q j w n represents the first order complex excitation transfer function associated with w n and j a n can be written as a n a n e i ε n where a n is the wave amplitude and ε n the wave phase and q j w n is q j w n q n w n e i φ n j where q n is the amplitude of the first order force per wave amplitude unit and φ n j its phase the second order wave excitation pinkster 1980 gueydon et al 2014 duarte et al 2014 simos et al 2018 is defined by the contributions of the sum and difference frequencies between pairs of waves using the double fourier transform 3 therefore for each pair with amplitudes a n and a m and frequencies w n and w m two different quadratic transfer functions qtfs q j w n w m and q j w n w m can be obtained 3 f e 2 j r e n 1 n m 1 n a n a m q j w n w m e i w n w m t a n a m q j w n w m e i w n w m t where denotes the complex conjugate according to gueydon et al 2014 the sum frequency second order loads can be neglected in spread moored semisubmersible platforms because the sum frequency loads can exceed the wave frequency following pinkster 1980 duarte et al 2014 the difference frequency term can separate the double summation into three regions m n m n and m n however these three regions can be written as two terms due to the symmetry of m n and m n hence the second order wave excitation force can be represented as follows 4 4 f e 2 j r e n 1 n a n a n q j w n w n 2 n 1 n m n 1 n a n a m q j w n w m e i w n w m t the first term represents the mean drift loads and the second the slow drift loads the mean drift loads generate a mean offset while the slow drift loads can excite resonant movements in the low frequency range of the floating structure the transfer functions as well as the hydrodynamic matrices are calculated by ansys aqwa ansys aqwa 2013 and transfer into the time domain is performed using an in house numerical code the qtfs of the difference for the zero degree direction are represented in fig 5 it should be noted that the highest difference between qtfs is found in the pitch motion gueydon et al 2014 the aerodynamic model used de los dolores et al 2017 is based on blade element momentum bem theory each blade is discretised into separate elements with different physical and aerodynamic properties the relative velocity of each element is calculated at each time step the angle of attack can then be obtained providing the lift and drag coefficients over the element and the normal and tangential components of the force the model does not take into account aeroelasticity and its possible effects the rotor torque tr and forces and momenta of the wind turbine over the floating platform are obtained by integrating the forces computed at each element of the blades a control system variable in pitch and velocity is implemented as part of the bem model which provides the generator torque tg and the pitch of each blade the variation of the velocity of rotation of the blades ω is given as a function of the inertia of the wind turbine iwt the rotor torque tr and the generator torque tg as follows 5 i w t ω t t r t t g t two different approaches to obtain the behaviour of the catenary in terms of tensions and movements are built into the mooring model a quasi static model and a dynamic model the quasi static approach assumes that the line is in static equilibrium at each time step neglecting the inertia current and wave forces on the line the main advantage of this approach is its numerical efficiency the analytical equations of the mooring lines jonkman and buhl 2007 with seabed interactions are given in 6 these equations are described in 2d for a vertical plane including an anchor and fairlead x s s 0 s l b h f c b ρ 0 s

unstretched length of a mooring line h f the horizontal component of the tension at the fairlead x s the horizontal distance between the anchor and a point on a mooring line z s the vertical distance between the anchor and a point on a mooring line and t s the tension at a point on a mooring line the dynamic approach aamo and fossen 2000 solves the mooring line as a flexible cable by means of a one dimensional second order non linear wave equation this equation is formulated using newton s second law 7 and solved by a finite element method neglecting bending and torsion stiffness 7 ρ 0 2 r t

stiffness and viscous coefficients respectively in the horizontal term k μ is the coefficient of kinetic friction corresponding to a maximum velocity v μ and r x y represents the velocity of the horizontal projection of the position vector 2 5 detection of peak loads the methodology used to detect peak loads on mooring lines is described in harnois et al 2016 the detection of peaks in a load time series is achieved by defining two parameters τ and k τ is a threshold used to identify peak loads with sufficient amplitude while k isolates all of them the parameter τ is defined as a percentage n over the mean value of the load f and the parameter k is compared to the standard maximum score s that relates the dynamic part of the load f f to its dispersion σ f the variable k defines the maximum force threshold using k the formulation of the standard maximum score is given by 9 s m a x max f f σ f the effect of these parameters on the selection of peak loads is shown in fig 6 and fig 8 in fig 6 a load time series is represented as a continuous line together with the load thresholds given by the parameters τ dotted line and k dashed line the peak loads in circles are chosen as a result of this selection this figure reveals the importance of these parameters on the selection of peak loads in addition the parameters depend on the sea state considered and the number of mooring lines of the floating structure for this reason the parameters must be determined through a sensitivity analysis the mooring system of the deepcwind semisubmersible platform has three mooring lines a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the percentage of peak loads on the most and least loaded mooring line the results presented correspond to the tensions obtained using a dynamic model for a sea state with a significant height of 10 3 m peak period of 17 s and wind speed of 25 69 m s the percentages of the peak loads are shown in table 3 and table 4 the two analysis show that if the k and τ parameters are low the number of peaks increases and vice versa the percentage of peak loads is more dependent on the τ parameter in the least loaded line mooring line 1 than on k for a value of τ the number of peaks is the same regardless of the k parameter however the results show that k parameter is more important in the most loaded line mooring line 2 than τ parameter because for a given k value the number of peaks remains constant regardless of the value of τ load distribution functions for different τ and k values are displayed in fig 7 a first selection is made to set τ to a value that would allow for the construction of a representative distribution function of all mooring line loads a value of τ 1 1 is selected subsequently another selection based on a parametric analysis of k allows for the construction of different distribution functions of extreme peak loads a value of k 3 5 allows for the selection of a sufficient number of peak loads to define a representative extreme function next the selection of peak loads for sea state 3 case 2 is detailed table 3 fig 8 shows the load time series and the selection of peak loads for mooring line 2 the figure is divided into three panels the first represents the load time series highlighting all peaks on the mooring line as points with crosses the second includes a preselection of the peak loads indicated by points applying the τ parameter threshold finally from the k parameter threshold the peak loads generated by the sea state considered are selected as circles represented in the third panel 3 results results are described next including the definition of sea states the validation of the numerical model and the analysis of loads on the mooring system 3 1 definition of sea states in this section the results of the two different methods proposed for the definition of the sea states are presented 1 severe sea state selection based on i form section 3 1 1 and 2 the selection of a set of sea states given by local measurements section 3 1 2 based on these two data sets the importance of wave history and spectral shape will be analysed 3 1 1 severe sea state definition on the importance of wave history assessment of long term metocean conditions is evaluated by means of i form madsen et al 1986 haver and winterstein 2008 dnv rp c205 2014 del jesus et al 2015 the significant wave height hs is used as the marginal variable in this study using a lognormal distribution function the peak period tp is adjusted with a normal distribution function and wind velocity at 90 m over the surface w according to a weibull distribution function finally i form is applied for different return periods the results are presented in fig 9 the selection of the sea states simulated is shown in table 5 according to the offshore standard dnv os j101 2014 the sea states selected for fowt must have a 50 year return period four wind velocities are simulated in response to cases with single generator torque control 7 93 m s single blade pitch control 16 08 m s and 25 69 m s and intermediate situations 11 93 m s the concomitant wave heights with these velocities are obtained from fig 9 which also considers cases with short and long periods for each situation in addition the case involving a higher wave height is also selected a total of seven sea states are analysed twenty cases or iterations for each sea state are generated using a jonswap spectrum with gamma 3 3 to investigate the effect of wave groupiness on the loads on the mooring lines these iterations also contribute to obtain a good definition of the maximum wave height the same wind velocity time series is used in all cases to capture the importance of the wave history the length of the series is 10000 s therefore each sea state is long enough to be statistically representative the wave generation is obtained with an in house code lara et al 2006 developed by ihcantabria and the wind generation is obtained by the turbsim code jonkman and kilcher 2012 the following parameters are analysed to highlight differences between each case generated a statistical parameters mean wave height hm standard deviation wave height hstd root mean square wave height hrms significant wave height hs mean of the fifty highest waves h50 mean of the ten highest waves h10 maximum wave height hmax mean crest value hp m significant crest value hp s maximum crest hpm mean trough value hn m significant trough value hn s minimum trough hnm mean period tm significant period ts and hmax hm0 b spectral parameters significant wave height from zero order moment hm0 peak period tp spectral period with n 1 tm01 and spectral period with n 2 tm02 an analysis of these parameters is presented in fig 10 in particular these parameters correspond to sea state 6 this figure reveals that as expected aggregated parameters have limited variability while other individual indicators such as hmax show significant variability in addition the wave time history analysis and the comparison of the computed spectra of certain cases to sea state 6 is presented in fig 11 it is demonstrated that from an energy point of view all cases show similar characteristics 3 1 2 synthetic versus observed sea spectra on the importance of spectral shape from an instrumental database located in bimep four sea states fig 12 are selected taking into account the shape of the spectrum from the database of the anteia buoy two are swell sea states sea state 1 and sea state 2 one is a wind sea state sea state 3 and the last is a calm sea state sea state 4 it is worth noting that energy is higher in swell seas than in other seas in addition it is important to highlight the difference in the shape of the wind sea spectrum with respect to the theoretical ones due to the presence of two peaks the main objective of this research is to analyse the influence of the spectra definition on the mooring line loads to this end different spectral definitions are proposed in fig 12 the continuous line represents the buoy spectrum and the dashed and dotted lines represent the jonswap with gamma 3 3 and jonswap with the best gamma fit respectively it can be observed that the jonswap spectrum does not adequately represent the measured spectra with more than one peak this effect will be investigated with respect to the loads on the mooring system considering that the anteia buoy only measures waves data provided by the wavescan buoy are used to obtain the wind velocity concomitant with the selected sea states at 90 m over the surface therefore the most realistic representation of local sea states is achieved the characteristics of the selected sea states are presented in table 6 according to the data provided in table 6 different random synthetic wave and wind time series are generated for each database table 7 shows the target parameters and the real parameters obtained for each approach and sea state it should be noted that thanks to the anteia buoy the hmax is known based on hmax and other aggregated parameters a representative sea state has been reconstructed for each wave spectrum method 3 2 validation of floating wind turbine model the numerical model built for the time domain simulation described in section 2 4 of the fowt has been validated against laboratory tests performed by the maritime research institute netherlands marin in 2013 and published in the context of the oc5 project robertson et al 2014 robertson et al 2017 a complete calibration and validation are performed based on results pertaining to static tension decay tests and regular and irregular waves with and without wind the results are validated along the zero degrees direction comparing the movements surge heave and pitch in the platform and the tension on the mooring lines the results of this validation for irregular waves with and without wind are presented in figs 13 16 the agreement between the code and laboratory tests in terms of movements and tensions is very good the linear and non linear damping are calibrated by a superposition of decay tests between the numerical model and laboratory tests the comparison of natural periods show an accuracy close to 100 between the code and the experimental results regular wave tests are predicted in terms of the platform movements and tensions on the mooring lines in the region of 95 similar discrepancies reported in hall and goupee 2015 are obtained with respect to movements with irregular waves these discrepancies are attributed to the influence of the different approaches adopted in the hydrodynamic models the model developed in this study neglects viscous forces and the second order potential for this reason the model does not capture the low frequency energy in surge properly however the load results on the mooring lines are more than acceptable as demonstrated by the comparison of the load time series and the spectra the results obtained support the aims of this article 3 3 analysis of loads on the mooring lines in the present subsection the analysis of mooring performance is discussed three studies are carried out first the importance of dynamic modelling to the mooring line design is discussed in section 3 3 1 second the influence of wave time history on mooring loads analysed by statistical techniques is discussed and safety factors are proposed in section 3 3 2 finally the influence of spectral shape on mooring loads is discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 1 the importance of dynamic modelling over mooring line performance assessment the influence of wave history on the peak loads is analysed using a dynamic and quasi static model for the seven sea states proposed a comparison between quasi static and dynamic model is presented in fig 17 for the three mooring lines of the semisubmersible platform the results correspond to sea state 6 case 8 this figure shows the loads in terms of time series and power spectra together with the wave power spectrum the behaviour between both analyses is very different not only in force magnitude but also energy in general the quasi static model does not properly capture peak loads and underestimates the spectral energy these results are a consequence of the model limitations by not accounting for inertia wave forces and seabed dynamic friction jonkman and buhl 2007 moreover different parameters are evaluated to corroborate the differences shown in fig 17 the average load time series t the average of all crests tc the significant value among all crests ts the maximum crest tmax and the average of selected crests tlp using the load peak method fig 18 shows all these parameters for sea state 6 and the corresponding 20 iterations comparing quasi static and dynamic tensions it can be concluded that the mean load differences are approximately 5 however by far the highest discrepancies are obtained for the tc and ts parameters in the regions of 30 and 45 respectively extreme loads are underestimated by the quasi static model with respect to the dynamic model according to the tmax and tlp parameters 3 3 2 influence of wave time series on mooring loads safety factors to evaluate the importance of wave time history the 20 iterations of sea state 6 are shown in fig 18 although t tc and ts present low discrepancy rates tmax and tlp which are directly related to mooring line design show large discrepancies differences of up to 57 in tmax and 34 in tlp are detected in the most extreme sea state sea state 7 and the most loaded mooring line this variability justifies the importance of statistical techniques application on mooring line design dnvgl os e301 2015 moreover from wave history analysis it can be concluded that the maximum tension discrepancies are directly related to the distribution of wave groupiness and not to the maximum wave height the left panel of fig 19 shows the instant at which the maximum tension and the height of the maximum wave are produced for all cases of sea state 6 the maximum wave height and the maximum tension do not coincide so the maximum wave does not generate the maximum load on moorings maximum load is generated by the distribution of wave groupiness this conclusion is reinforced by results shown on the right panel where it can be seen that similar wave heights generate significant load differences on the mooring system the maximum tension together with the maximum wave height hmax the maximum crest hpm and the minimum trough hnm are also shown for all cases of sea state 6 on mooring line 2 noticeable differences in maximum tensions are observed between the 20 cases hence it is demonstrated that the evaluation of the maximum tension is a complex process and only possible making use of statistical techniques because the maximum tension does not necessarily have to occur simultaneously with the maximum wave height to understand extreme mooring load performance two methodologies are applied to assess the variability of the peak loads first the extreme events are identified following the procedure described in section 2 5 and second the extreme events are characterised according to the maximum local load for each case the selection of the load peaks reveals significant variability in the determination of the extreme load table 8 summarises the maximum minimum and difference in percentages for all iterations in each sea state and for each mooring line load differences between 6 and 17 are obtained for the least loaded line and between 25 and 40 for the most loaded line discrepancies between 21 and 28 and 79 are obtained for the most extreme sea state loads are fitted using a generalized extreme value gev distribution function for the two studies this fit is shown in fig 20 for the peak load method a and for the maximum local load b to check the quality of fit a quantile quantile plot is generated qq plot the diagnostic quality of this test is very good with points near the diagonal fig 20 shows the qq plot for the most loaded mooring line in sea state 6 the most accurate adjustment is achieved by the peak load method to produce more load data as opposed to the maximum local load in which only 20 data one per case are available nevertheless an acceptable correlation coefficient of 0 9872 is obtained with respect to mooring design the dnv mooring standard dnvgl os e301 2015 proposes the load evaluated by the most likely value based on the extreme distribution the most likely value most probable maximum mpm of tensions for each criterion sea state and mooring line is presented in table 9 higher mpm values are obtained by the maximum local load method in general differences in the region of 5 are obtained for all sea states reaching discrepancies of approximately 8 for the most extreme sea state the distribution function enables us to design mooring lines against extreme loads with a high level of probability however from designers point of view it is more appropriate to employ safety factors taking into account only the mean load on the mooring line to this end table 10 proposes different safety factors obtained for the different sea states and mooring lines in general coefficients between 1 2 1 4 and 2 1 3 2 are obtained for the least and most loaded lines respectively coefficients ranging from 1 5 to 4 1 are obtained for the most severe sea state 3 3 3 influence of spectral shape on mooring loads this section analyses the mooring loads from perspective of spectral shape the wave spectra considered are described in section 3 1 2 and the results are presented in this section load analysis is performed by comparing spectra and percentiles of tensions in fig 21 tension spectra are shown for the most loaded mooring line the figure also shows a comparison among the three wave spectra considered buoy data jonswap γ 3 3 jonswap best γ fit for the four sea states in general the different approaches capture the main frequencies of tensions well however some discrepancies in the distribution of frequency energy are obtained sea states 1 and 2 can be considered swell sea states for this reason similar results in terms of spectral energy for each frequency are obtained between the buoy data and the jonswap formulation however the main frequency according to the buoy data shows a discrepancy with respect to the jonswap spectra in sea state 2 this difference can be explained by the fact that the spectrum measured presents a second peak with an appreciable amount of energy at that frequency as shown in fig 12 the spectra of sea states 3 and 4 are generated by local wind characterised by a lower amount of energy but with considerable frequency dispersion because the jonswap formulation considers a dominant frequency it is expected to yield higher discrepancies in terms of frequency energy in these sea states nevertheless similar results for the load spectrum are provided by the different spectra in sea state 3 generating significant differences in the distribution of energy in sea state 4 after the frequency domain analysis a statistical analysis of the mooring load response is carried out first a gev distribution function is used to fit the tension series to be able to more accurately compare the implications of each approach fig 22 compares the different mooring load distribution functions among the different approaches a suitable adjustment is obtained through the gev distribution with correlation coefficients in the region of 0 99 for each approach and sea state considered according to the qq plot shown in fig 22 in general buoy data overestimate the seaward line tension and underestimate the leeward line tension as opposed to the jonswap approaches the discrepancy of these results suggests differences in the coupling to the platform response fig 23 presents the surge offset for each state considered all buoy sea states generate higher offset than jonswap approaches similar responses are obtained for the different jonswap spectrum definitions these results show the importance of considering real spectra instead of theoretical spectra finally fig 24 shows the percentile differences between the jonswap approaches and the buoy data for all moorings and sea states the percentiles used are 0 5 0 9 0 95 and 0 99 positive values mean that predicted loads by jonswap spectra are higher than predicted loads by buoy data and vice versa in general loads obtained by the jonswap spectrum are overestimated for mooring lines m1 and m3 and underestimated for m2 with respect to the buoy data overestimated differences of less than 2 are observed in the least loaded mooring lines m1 and m3 for jonswap with gamma 3 3 and differences of less than 4 are observed for the best jonswap fit in sea states 1 and 2 the most loaded mooring line shows underestimated differences of less than 2 and 4 for jonswap with gamma 3 3 and jonswap with the best gamma fit respectively however differences of approximately 12 are obtained in the 0 99 percentile in sea state 2 for the two jonswap approaches overestimated differences of less than 1 are observed between the jonswap approaches and the buoy data for the least loaded mooring lines in sea states 3 and 4 whereas those for the most loaded mooring are less than 4 the results show that similar patterns are obtained for the different jonswap approaches with differences between them of less than 3 in the prediction of loads the assumption of a theoretical spectrum instead of a real spectrum can generate uncertainties of up to 12 according to the sea states considered in this work 4 conclusions to survive ultimate limit states a mooring system must be designed to accurately estimate extreme line loads an in house numerical model calibrated by tank testing is used to estimate loads in a catenary mooring system the estimated loads are sensitive to model setting quasi static or dynamic and input wave characteristic wave groupiness or spectra in this article extreme loads are analysed with various model settings and safety factors on the mooring lines are recommended by taking into account different working regimes of the wind turbine the aforementioned parameters are analysed on a fowt located in the north of spain the influence of the mooring numerical model is investigated in the analysis of peak loads dynamic models are more accurate than quasi static models in the evaluation of extreme loads slight differences are found between the two models for mean loads of approximately 5 reaching 70 with respect to the maximum load parameters i form is used to select the long term data of the sea states different sea states are selected by considering the control used in the turbine and the characteristics of the waves the effect of wave time history for each sea state is analysed by proposing several cases with different distribution of wave groupiness the results of simulations show significant load variability for this reason two extreme load studies are performed one considering all peak loads and another considering only the maximum local load the most probable maximum mpm is provided for each methodology as the design load proposed by the standards the influence of the real spectra in contrast to that of the theoretical spectra is analysed in this study in general the assumption of jonswap spectra implied an error below 12 in the evaluation of loads relative to that implied by real spectra to summarise a methodology for evaluating the effect of different parameters related to metocean conditions on a mooring system is presented this approach combines aerodynamic hydrodynamic and mooring models with statistical methods for the selection of sea states and the evaluation of loads the dynamic analysis achieves better approximations in the evaluation of extreme loads than other methods adopting statistical

23043,this paper explores the role of wave spectral characteristics and wave time history on the estimation of extreme mooring loads on floating offshore wind turbines this research is applied to the deepcwind semi submersible platform located at the bimep test site in the north of spain extreme sea states are selected using the inverse first order reliability method i form mooring loads are modelled by quasi static and dynamic numerical approaches different wave time series are generated numerically for each sea state to investigate the variability in predicted peak loads all cases simulated incorporate the combined effect of wind and waves differences of approximately 30 in peak loads are found for the mooring system reaching 40 79 for the most extreme sea states safety factors are proposed to account for sensitivity to wave groupiness in modelling loads under extreme work conditions of the deepcwind platform e g pitch and velocity control a comparison between theoretical and real sea wave spectra is also modelled to investigate possible differences due to the presence of multiple spectral peaks associated with swell and wind seas in general results show differences below 12 in the prediction of loads between both assumptions keywords mooring system spectrum wave groupiness extreme loads quasi static model dynamic model 1 introduction offshore wind energy is one of the most prominent competitive and reliable sources for power generation traditionally wind turbines are installed on fixed foundations such as gravity based structures monopiles jackets or tripods however the cost effectiveness ratio of fixed foundations in deep waters is not competitive and the continuous technological development have contributed to the emergence of new alternatives the most immediate option is installing wind turbines on floating platforms different floating offshore wind turbine fowt concepts have been developed such as the spar buoy the semi submersible and the tension leg platform each has specific technical challenges and a unique dynamic response despite conceptual differences among them all concepts require a mooring system to ensure their survival and station keeping in the harsh marine environment and to achieve a successful platform design mooring systems are an important element to the stability of fowts currently several possible mooring configurations and types of components are available harris et al 2004 spread moorings catenary multi catenary with weights and buoys and taut spread mooring single point mooring turret mooring catenary anchor leg mooring calm and single anchor leg mooring salm and dynamic positioning active mooring and propulsion numerical modelling techniques are commonly applied to estimate the performance of these systems on a floating platform traditionally tensions at the fairlead can be evaluated by quasi static or dynamic models quasi static models have a low computational cost but do not evaluate drag and inertial forces considered in dynamic models mooring models have been widely studied through simulations and laboratory tests barrera et al 2019 barrera et al 2017 azcona et al 2017a lindahl 1985 models coupling hydrodynamics aerodynamics and mooring systems are especially relevant when estimating the response of offshore floating platforms numerous studies have been carried out to address possible uncertainties that these models may induce specifications used for numerical modelling are described in the offshore code comparison collaboration continuation with correlation oc5 project robertson et al 2014b robertson et al 2017 the effects of the different approaches on hydrodynamic models were demonstrated in hall and goupee 2015 in which approaches with full second order wave forces and viscous mean drift forces were compared with laboratory tests traditionally the design of mooring lines for floating structures is based on considering several limit states dnvgl os e301 2015 haukanes et al 2017 ultimate uls accidental als fatigue fls and service sls the uls and fls contribute to determining the mooring line resistance required to withstand extreme environmental loads and the accumulated load cycles over a given lifetime of a structure the als refers to events of accidental damage and evaluates the resistance of a mooring system after damage has occurred the sls represents the requirement that structure be able to meet its service criteria the verification of each limit state requires the identification of the metocean conditions and their variability at a particular location to estimate the profitability of a project different techniques including algorithms based on clustering and selection camus et al 2011 and environmental contour lines methods haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 dnv rp c205 2014 have been developed to evaluate the long term effects of metocean conditions this article focuses on the design of extreme loads uls on the mooring lines of a fowt building on prior research on this topic the evaluation of the mooring loads according to iec 61400 3 iec 61400 3 was reported in azcona et al 2017b and different formulations have been proposed to characterise the extreme mooring tensions due to snap loads hsu et al 2017 additionally the effects of environmental conditions on peak mooring loads were evaluated for marine energy converters through field tests in harnois et al 2016 previous studies have not clearly demonstrated the influence of wave time history or real sea wave spectra in the evaluation of extreme loads as key factors for a safe mooring design the innovation of this study is the evaluation of the impact of different wave characterisation spectrum and time series on mooring design load wave definitions can be described in the time domain or frequency domain a particular sea state can be defined by multiple free surface temporal series each one with a different wave groupiness distribution in the time domain wave groupiness is a sequence of wave trains characterised by a height period and energy taking part of a sea state the adding of all wave groupiness constitutes the complete sea state time series this study analyses the design load through two statistical techniques the selection of peak loads and the maximum local additionally safety factors are proposed to quantify the uncertainty associated with wave history from the frequency domain point of view the wave description is achieved by means of a theoretical spectrum such as a jonswap or pierson moskowitz however this assumption can generate wave energy distribution uncertainties in comparison with real sea wave spectra in the target location theoretical spectra concentrate wave energy around one peak but the wave energy may be distributed over multiple peaks the different wave energy distribution in the spectrum is evaluated comparing theoretical and buoy measurements to estimate the variability of peak loads on mooring system a methodology involving numerical models of mooring systems is implemented to evaluate the variability of peak loads as a consequence of different wave definitions loads on a mooring system are analysed according to two different sources of uncertainty associated with waves 1 wave time history characterised by the presence of different wave groupiness and 2 wave spectrum shape the remainder of the paper is organised as follows in section 2 the methodology used in this work the location examined metocean databases and buoys the definition of fowt and the numerical models studied are described section 3 describes the sea states selected and the numerical results obtained from the calibration and validation as well as the analysis of loads on the mooring systems the main conclusions of this investigation are presented in section 4 2 methodology this section describes the method developed to evaluate loads on a mooring system considering i site conditions ii sea states iii platform design criteria iv numerical model approach and v peak load assessment of the mooring system a schematic description of the methodology is provided in fig 1 the study considers a particular location and a specific type of floating platform using three different steps the objective of the first step is to analyse the design sea states of the proposed installation location using metocean data the second step involves the implementation and validation of the numerical model developed to simulate fowt behaviour in terms of movements and tensions relative to laboratory tests finally the third step uses the validated numerical model to estimate the peak mooring loads for specific sea states selected in the first step 2 1 site assessment the location selected for this study is bimep test site 2 894 43 563 an area off armintza in the basque coast north of spain this location is characterised by a predominant regime of waves coming from the north west direction with an average significant wave height of 1 7 m maximum values of approximately 9 m and periods between 8 and 12 s fig 2 metocean analysis of bimep 2017 iturrioz et al 2017 the average wind speed is 7 m s and winds generally come from the west south and east with the strongest winds blowing westward at a velocity of over 20 m s regime of winds is presented in fig 2 at 10 m over the surface 2 2 sea states sea states are defined by combining metocean hindcast and instrumental data using statistical techniques two different sea state selection methods are considered in this research the first one is based on the application of i form described in haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 its main target is to predict the metoceanic characteristics for different return periods the data used in this selection comprise the reanalysis database described in section 2 2 1 the objective of this first selection method is to study the variability of the loads of the mooring lines based on a theoretical spectrum jonswap using random seedings on the wave time series reconstruction to obtain different distributions of wave groupiness the goal of the second selection method is to analyse the variability of the loads on the mooring lines by comparing the theoretical and observed spectra observations are described in detail in section 2 2 2 the results of the selection methods are presented in sections 3 1 1 and 3 1 2 2 2 1 numerical metocean data wind and wave resource assessment at global regional and local scales requires the use of numerical databases due to the coarse spatial resolution of instrumental measurements numerical databases provide long time series that allow for the characterisation of wind and wave performance in the long term information used in this work is derived from the reanalysis databases developed by ihcantabria and bimep in the framework of trl project metocean analysis of bimep 2017 the methodology used to generate the wind numerical database seawind is described in menendez et al 2014 undisturbed mean wind speeds and directions for the 1985 2015 period are provided with a resolution of 1 h wind data are modelled with the weather research forecasting model and the module advanced research dynamical solver developed by the national center for atmospheric research skamarock et al 2008 this limited area model lam is coupled to the global atmospheric climate forecast system reanalysis saha et al 2010 which provides the boundary and initial conditions regarding sea state parameters the simulating waves nearshore model ris et al 1999 is used to generate the global ocean waves gow database reguero et al 2012 significant wave heights wave peak periods and prevailing wave directions for the 1985 2015 period are provided with a 1 h resolution metocean hindcast is used to assess long term environmental conditions in a specific location marine structures design standards recommend using environmental conditions for a given annual exceedance probability for this reason different methods have been proposed over the years for the selection of a representative subset of a large amount of data in this paper the inverse first order reliability method i form is applied haver and winterstein 2008 del jesus et al 2015 this method proposes to obtain the long term metocean conditions generating an environmental contour corresponding to a certain return period given by standards dnv rp c205 2014 2 2 2 measured metocean data two different sources of observations are used in this work 1 the bimep wavescan buoy and 2 the anteia buoy the wavescan directional buoy installed at the bimep metocean analysis of bimep 2017 iturrioz et al 2017 test site is located two nautical miles off the basque coast 2 8848 e 43 4682 n 80 m depth the collected metocean data currents wind and waves are stored internally in the data logger and only a limited number of parameters are transmitted to the shore station in real time using satellite communication only one set of statistical data are available from this buoy specifically mean wind speed significant wave height and wave peak period wind characteristics provided by this buoy are used in this research the anteia is a directional wave buoy located at bimep with a diameter of 0 6 m and a weight of 26 kg this oceanographic buoy allows for the collection of wave height direction period data as well as water temperature in real time statistical and spectral parameters are provided by the buoy every 1800 s wave spectral data provided by this buoy are employed in this research 2 3 definition of offshore semisubmersible platform deepcwind semisubmersible the fowt under investigation was the deepcwind semisubmersible platform robertson et al fig 3 the platform has three columns with heave plates and a fourth central column where a 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 from the national renewable energy laboratory nrel is mounted station keeping is provided by three catenary chain moorings this platform has been widely studied by laboratory tests and simulations robertson et al 2014 hall and goupee 2015 robertson et al 2017 the most important features of this platform and its mooring system with respect to sea water level swl and centre of mass cm are shown in table 1 and table 2 respectively the coordinate system fig 4 used in this investigation is set such that waves and wind travel from the negative to positive x axis this direction is set to represent zero degrees all simulations in this work are referred to this direction 2 4 description of the numerical model a complete numerical model in the time domain has been implemented with the purpose of modelling the dynamic behaviour of fowt martini et al 2015 armesto et al 2016 armesto et al 2017 this section presents the main characteristics of the model describing the governing equation and other relevant considerations related to it the numerical model is built by coupling three different models corresponding to the hydrodynamic aerodynamic and mooring systems each model solves the governing equations from each system individually the hydrodynamic model is focused on describing the global response movements and rotations of the platform the mooring model analyses the evolution of the forces on the mooring lines that are applied over the floating platform the aerodynamic model examines the velocity of rotation of the wind turbine which provides forces and momenta over the floating platform the three models are coupled and solved under a unique system of equations providing information at each time step the hydrodynamic model solves the cummins equation cummins 1962 a second order ordinary differential equation with a convolution integral applied to solve the radiation problem 1 1 m a k t 0 k t τ k τ d τ g k t f e t f c t f w t f m t where m is the corresponding inertia matrix of the floating structure a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency k is the retardation matrix g is the hydrostatic stiffness matrix t is time and k k and k are the floating platform acceleration velocity and displacements respectively external forces are represented by wave excitation forces f e current forces f c wind forces f w and mooring system forces f m traditionally the majority of hydrodynamic codes use only first order theory for potential flow therefore the codes only consider forces and movements at the same frequency as that of the incident wave the first order theory neglects the nonlinearity in the incident wave potential of steeper waves the first order velocity potential is obtained by a superposition of the hydrostatic radiation and diffraction problems in the floating structure mean position this solution is adequate for small wave amplitudes as well as small platform motions the available alternatives to take into account the nonlinearity range from the higher order boundary element methods to cutting edge navier stokes equations the second order hydrodynamic theory pinkster 1980 simos et al 2018 attempts to approximate the nonlinear free surface boundary condition and wave body interactions using the superposition of the quadratic interaction of the first order velocity terms as well as terms of the second order solution of the velocity potential the model presented herein neglects the contribution of the second order potential in the numerical computation of the force term simos et al 2018 for irregular waves with n components and j degrees of freedom the first order wave excitation force can be represented by 2 2 f e 1 j r e n 1 n a n q j w n e i w n t j 1 2 3 4 5 6 where a n e i w n t is the complex wave component a n is the complex wave amplitude w n is the wave frequency i is the imaginary number and q j w n represents the first order complex excitation transfer function associated with w n and j a n can be written as a n a n e i ε n where a n is the wave amplitude and ε n the wave phase and q j w n is q j w n q n w n e i φ n j where q n is the amplitude of the first order force per wave amplitude unit and φ n j its phase the second order wave excitation pinkster 1980 gueydon et al 2014 duarte et al 2014 simos et al 2018 is defined by the contributions of the sum and difference frequencies between pairs of waves using the double fourier transform 3 therefore for each pair with amplitudes a n and a m and frequencies w n and w m two different quadratic transfer functions qtfs q j w n w m and q j w n w m can be obtained 3 f e 2 j r e n 1 n m 1 n a n a m q j w n w m e i w n w m t a n a m q j w n w m e i w n w m t where denotes the complex conjugate according to gueydon et al 2014 the sum frequency second order loads can be neglected in spread moored semisubmersible platforms because the sum frequency loads can exceed the wave frequency following pinkster 1980 duarte et al 2014 the difference frequency term can separate the double summation into three regions m n m n and m n however these three regions can be written as two terms due to the symmetry of m n and m n hence the second order wave excitation force can be represented as follows 4 4 f e 2 j r e n 1 n a n a n q j w n w n 2 n 1 n m n 1 n a n a m q j w n w m e i w n w m t the first term represents the mean drift loads and the second the slow drift loads the mean drift loads generate a mean offset while the slow drift loads can excite resonant movements in the low frequency range of the floating structure the transfer functions as well as the hydrodynamic matrices are calculated by ansys aqwa ansys aqwa 2013 and transfer into the time domain is performed using an in house numerical code the qtfs of the difference for the zero degree direction are represented in fig 5 it should be noted that the highest difference between qtfs is found in the pitch motion gueydon et al 2014 the aerodynamic model used de los dolores et al 2017 is based on blade element momentum bem theory each blade is discretised into separate elements with different physical and aerodynamic properties the relative velocity of each element is calculated at each time step the angle of attack can then be obtained providing the lift and drag coefficients over the element and the normal and tangential components of the force the model does not take into account aeroelasticity and its possible effects the rotor torque tr and forces and momenta of the wind turbine over the floating platform are obtained by integrating the forces computed at each element of the blades a control system variable in pitch and velocity is implemented as part of the bem model which provides the generator torque tg and the pitch of each blade the variation of the velocity of rotation of the blades ω is given as a function of the inertia of the wind turbine iwt the rotor torque tr and the generator torque tg as follows 5 i w t ω t t r t t g t two different approaches to obtain the behaviour of the catenary in terms of tensions and movements are built into the mooring model a quasi static model and a dynamic model the quasi static approach assumes that the line is in static equilibrium at each time step neglecting the inertia current and wave forces on the line the main advantage of this approach is its numerical efficiency the analytical equations of the mooring lines jonkman and buhl 2007 with seabed interactions are given in 6 these equations are described in 2d for a vertical plane including an anchor and fairlead x s s 0 s l b h f c b ρ 0 s

unstretched length of a mooring line h f the horizontal component of the tension at the fairlead x s the horizontal distance between the anchor and a point on a mooring line z s the vertical distance between the anchor and a point on a mooring line and t s the tension at a point on a mooring line the dynamic approach aamo and fossen 2000 solves the mooring line as a flexible cable by means of a

stiffness and viscous coefficients respectively in the horizontal term k μ is the coefficient of kinetic friction corresponding to a maximum velocity v μ and r x y represents the velocity of the horizontal projection of the position vector 2 5 detection of peak loads the methodology used to detect peak loads on mooring lines is described in harnois et al 2016 the detection of peaks in a load time series is achieved by defining two parameters τ and k τ is a threshold used to identify peak loads with sufficient amplitude while k isolates all of them the parameter τ is defined as a percentage n over the mean value of the load f and the parameter k is compared to the standard maximum score s that relates the dynamic part of the load f f to its dispersion σ f the variable k defines the maximum force threshold using k the formulation of the standard maximum score is given by 9 s m a x max f f σ f the effect of these parameters on the selection of peak loads is shown in fig 6 and fig 8 in fig 6 a load time series is represented as a continuous line together with the load thresholds given by the parameters τ dotted line and k dashed line the peak loads in circles are chosen as a result of this selection this figure reveals the importance of these parameters on the selection of peak loads in addition the parameters depend on the sea state considered and the number of mooring lines of the floating structure for this reason the parameters must be determined through a sensitivity analysis the mooring system of the deepcwind semisubmersible platform has three mooring lines a sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the percentage of peak loads on the most and least loaded mooring line the results presented correspond to the tensions obtained using a dynamic model for a sea state with a significant height of 10 3 m peak period of 17 s and wind speed of 25 69 m s the percentages of the peak loads are shown in table 3 and table 4 the two analysis show that if the k and τ parameters are low the number of peaks increases and vice versa the percentage of peak loads is more dependent on the τ parameter in the least loaded line mooring line 1 than on k for a value of τ the number of peaks is the same regardless of the k parameter however the results show that k parameter is more important in the most loaded line mooring line 2 than τ parameter because for a given k value the number of peaks remains constant regardless of the value of τ load distribution functions for different τ and k values are displayed in fig 7 a first selection is made to set τ to a value that would allow for the construction of a representative distribution function of all mooring line loads a value of τ 1 1 is selected subsequently another selection based on a parametric analysis of k allows for the construction of different distribution functions of extreme peak loads a value of k 3 5 allows for the selection of a sufficient number of peak loads to define a representative extreme function next the selection of peak loads for sea state 3 case 2 is detailed table 3 fig 8 shows the load time series and the selection of peak loads for mooring line 2 the figure is divided into three panels the first represents the load time series highlighting all peaks on the mooring line as points with crosses the second includes a preselection of the peak loads indicated by points applying the τ parameter threshold finally from the k parameter threshold the peak loads generated by the sea state considered are selected as circles represented in the third panel 3 results results are described next including the definition of sea states the validation of the numerical model and the analysis of loads on the mooring system 3 1 definition of sea states in this section the results of the two different methods proposed for the definition of the sea states are presented 1 severe sea state selection based on i form section 3 1 1 and 2 the selection of a set of sea states given by local measurements section 3 1 2 based on these two data sets the importance of wave history and spectral shape will be analysed 3 1 1 severe sea state definition on the importance of wave history assessment of long term metocean conditions is evaluated by means of i form madsen et al 1986 haver and winterstein 2008 dnv rp c205 2014 del jesus et al 2015 the significant wave height hs is used as the marginal variable in this study using a lognormal distribution function the peak period tp is adjusted with a normal distribution function and wind velocity at 90 m over the surface w according to a weibull distribution function finally i form is applied for different return periods the results are presented in fig 9 the selection of the sea states simulated is shown in table 5 according to the offshore standard dnv os j101 2014 the sea states selected for fowt must have a 50 year return period four wind velocities are simulated in response to cases with single generator torque control 7 93 m s single blade pitch control 16 08 m s and 25 69 m s and intermediate situations 11 93 m s the concomitant wave heights with these velocities are obtained from fig 9 which also considers cases with short and long periods for each situation in addition the case involving a higher wave height is also selected a total of seven sea states are analysed twenty cases or iterations for each sea state are generated using a jonswap spectrum with gamma 3 3 to investigate the effect of wave groupiness on the loads on the mooring lines these iterations also contribute to obtain a good definition of the maximum wave height the same wind velocity time series is used in all cases to capture the importance of the wave history the length of the series is 10000 s therefore each sea state is long enough to be statistically representative the wave generation is obtained with an in house code lara et al 2006 developed by ihcantabria and the wind generation is obtained by the turbsim code jonkman and kilcher 2012 the following parameters are analysed to highlight differences between each case generated a statistical parameters mean wave height hm standard deviation wave height hstd root mean square wave height hrms significant wave height hs mean of the fifty highest waves h50 mean of the ten highest waves h10 maximum wave height hmax mean crest value hp m significant crest value hp s maximum crest hpm mean trough value hn m significant trough value hn s minimum trough hnm mean period tm significant period ts and hmax hm0 b spectral parameters significant wave height from zero order moment hm0 peak period tp spectral period with n 1 tm01 and spectral period with n 2 tm02 an analysis of these parameters is presented in fig 10 in particular these parameters correspond to sea state 6 this figure reveals that as expected aggregated parameters have limited variability while other individual indicators such as hmax show significant variability in addition the wave time history analysis and the comparison of the computed spectra of certain cases to sea state 6 is presented in fig 11 it is demonstrated that from an energy point of view all cases show similar characteristics 3 1 2 synthetic versus observed sea spectra on the importance of spectral shape from an instrumental database located in bimep four sea states fig 12 are selected taking into account the shape of the spectrum from the database of the anteia buoy two are swell sea states sea state 1 and sea state 2 one is a wind sea state sea state 3 and the last is a calm sea state sea state 4 it is worth noting that energy is higher in swell seas than in other seas in addition it is important to highlight the difference in the shape of the wind sea spectrum with respect to the theoretical ones due to the presence of two peaks the main objective of this research is to analyse the influence of the spectra definition on the mooring line loads to this end different spectral definitions are proposed in fig 12 the continuous line represents the buoy spectrum and the dashed and dotted lines represent the jonswap with gamma 3 3 and jonswap with the best gamma fit respectively it can be observed that the jonswap spectrum does not adequately represent the measured spectra with more than one peak this effect will be investigated with respect to the loads on the mooring system considering that the anteia buoy only measures waves data provided by the wavescan buoy are used to obtain the wind velocity concomitant with the selected sea states at 90 m over the surface therefore the most realistic representation of local sea states is achieved the characteristics of the selected sea states are presented in table 6 according to the data provided in table 6 different random synthetic wave and wind time series are generated for each database table 7 shows the target parameters and the real parameters obtained for each approach and sea state it should be noted that thanks to the anteia buoy the hmax is known based on hmax and other aggregated parameters a representative sea state has been reconstructed for each wave spectrum method 3 2 validation of floating wind turbine model the numerical model built for the time domain simulation described in section 2 4 of the fowt has been validated against laboratory tests performed by the maritime research institute netherlands marin in 2013 and published in the context of the oc5 project robertson et al 2014 robertson et al 2017 a complete calibration and validation are performed based on results pertaining to static tension decay tests and regular and irregular waves with and without wind the results are validated along the zero degrees direction comparing the movements surge heave and pitch in the platform and the tension on the mooring lines the results of this validation for irregular waves with and without wind are presented in figs 13 16 the agreement between the code and laboratory tests in terms of movements and tensions is very good the linear and non linear damping are calibrated by a superposition of decay tests between the numerical model and laboratory tests the comparison of natural periods show an accuracy close to 100 between the code and the experimental results regular wave tests are predicted in terms of the platform movements and tensions on the mooring lines in the region of 95 similar discrepancies reported in hall and goupee 2015 are obtained with respect to movements with irregular waves these discrepancies are attributed to the influence of the different approaches adopted in the hydrodynamic models the model developed in this study neglects viscous forces and the second order potential for this reason the model does not capture the low frequency energy in surge properly however the load results on the mooring lines are more than acceptable as demonstrated by the comparison of the load time series and the spectra the results obtained support the aims of this article 3 3 analysis of loads on the mooring lines in the present subsection the analysis of mooring performance is discussed three studies are carried out first the importance of dynamic modelling to the mooring line design is discussed in section 3 3 1 second the influence of wave time history on mooring loads analysed by statistical techniques is discussed and safety factors are proposed in section 3 3 2 finally the influence of spectral shape on mooring loads is discussed in section 3 3 3 3 3 1 the importance of dynamic modelling over mooring line performance assessment the influence of wave history on the peak loads is analysed using a dynamic and quasi static model for the seven sea states proposed a comparison between quasi static and dynamic model is presented in fig 17 for the three mooring lines of the semisubmersible platform the results correspond to sea state 6 case 8 this figure shows the loads in terms of time series and power spectra together with the wave power spectrum the behaviour between both analyses is very different not only in force magnitude but also energy in general the quasi static model does not properly capture peak loads and underestimates the spectral energy these results are a consequence of the model limitations by not accounting for inertia wave forces and seabed dynamic friction jonkman and buhl 2007 moreover different parameters are evaluated to corroborate the differences shown in fig 17 the average load time series t the average of all crests tc the significant value among all crests ts the maximum crest tmax and the average of selected crests tlp using the load peak method fig 18 shows all these parameters for sea state 6 and the corresponding 20 iterations comparing quasi static and dynamic tensions it can be concluded that the mean load differences are approximately 5 however by far the highest discrepancies are obtained for the tc and ts parameters in the regions of 30 and 45 respectively extreme loads are underestimated by the quasi static model with respect to the dynamic model according to the tmax and tlp parameters 3 3 2 influence of wave time series on mooring loads safety factors to evaluate the importance of wave time history the 20 iterations of sea state 6 are shown in fig 18 although t tc and ts present low discrepancy rates tmax and tlp which are directly related to mooring line design show large discrepancies differences of up to 57 in tmax and 34 in tlp are detected in the most extreme sea state sea state 7 and the most loaded mooring line this variability justifies the importance of statistical techniques application on mooring line design dnvgl os e301 2015 moreover from wave history analysis it can be concluded that the maximum tension discrepancies are directly related to the distribution of wave groupiness and not to the maximum wave height the left panel of fig 19 shows the instant at which the maximum tension and the height of the maximum wave are produced for all cases of sea state 6 the maximum wave height and the maximum tension do not coincide so the maximum wave does not generate the maximum load on moorings maximum load is generated by the distribution of wave groupiness this conclusion is reinforced by results shown on the right panel where it can be seen that similar wave heights generate significant load differences on the mooring system the maximum tension together with the maximum wave height hmax the maximum crest hpm and the minimum trough hnm are also shown for all cases of sea state 6 on mooring line 2 noticeable differences in maximum tensions are observed between the 20 cases hence it is demonstrated that the evaluation of the maximum tension is a complex process and only possible making use of statistical techniques because the maximum tension does not necessarily have to occur simultaneously with the maximum wave height to understand extreme mooring load performance two methodologies are applied to assess the variability of the peak loads first the extreme events are identified following the procedure described in section 2 5 and second the extreme events are characterised according to the maximum local load for each case the selection of the load peaks reveals significant variability in the determination of the extreme load table 8 summarises the maximum minimum and difference in percentages for all iterations in each sea state and for each mooring line load differences between 6 and 17 are obtained for the least loaded line and between 25 and 40 for the most loaded line discrepancies between 21 and 28 and 79 are obtained for the most extreme sea state loads are fitted using a generalized extreme value gev distribution function for the two studies this fit is shown in fig 20 for the peak load method a and for the maximum local load b to check the quality of fit a quantile quantile plot is generated qq plot the diagnostic quality of this test is very good with points near the diagonal fig 20 shows the qq plot for the most loaded mooring line in sea state 6 the most accurate adjustment is achieved by the peak load method to produce more load data as opposed to the maximum local load in which only 20 data one per case are available nevertheless an acceptable correlation coefficient of 0 9872 is obtained with respect to mooring design the dnv mooring standard dnvgl os e301 2015 proposes the load evaluated by the most likely value based on the extreme distribution the most likely value most probable maximum mpm of tensions for each criterion sea state and mooring line is presented in table 9 higher mpm values are obtained by the maximum local load method in general differences in the region of 5 are obtained for all sea states reaching discrepancies of approximately 8 for the most extreme sea state the distribution function enables us to design mooring lines against extreme loads with a high level of probability however from designers point of view it is more appropriate to employ safety factors taking into account only the mean load on the mooring line to this end table 10 proposes different safety factors obtained for the different sea states and mooring lines in general coefficients between 1 2 1 4 and 2 1 3 2 are obtained for the least and most loaded lines respectively coefficients ranging from 1 5 to 4 1 are obtained for the most severe sea state 3 3 3 influence of spectral shape on mooring loads this section analyses the mooring loads from perspective of spectral shape the wave spectra considered are described in section 3 1 2 and the results are presented in this section load analysis is performed by comparing spectra and percentiles of tensions in fig 21 tension spectra are shown for the most loaded mooring line the figure also shows a comparison among the three wave spectra considered buoy data jonswap γ 3 3 jonswap best γ fit for the four sea states in general the different approaches capture the main frequencies of tensions well however some discrepancies in the distribution of frequency energy are obtained sea states 1 and 2 can be considered swell sea states for this reason similar results in terms of spectral energy for each frequency are obtained between the buoy data and the jonswap formulation however the main frequency according to the buoy data shows a discrepancy with respect to the jonswap spectra in sea state 2 this difference can be explained by the fact that the spectrum measured presents a second peak with an appreciable amount of energy at that frequency as shown in fig 12 the spectra of sea states 3 and 4 are generated by local wind characterised by a lower amount of energy but with considerable frequency dispersion because the jonswap formulation considers a dominant frequency it is expected to yield higher discrepancies in terms of frequency energy in these sea states nevertheless similar results for the load spectrum are provided by the different spectra in sea state 3 generating significant differences in the distribution of energy in sea state 4 after the frequency domain analysis a statistical analysis of the mooring load response is carried out first a gev distribution function is used to fit the tension series to be able to more accurately compare the implications of each approach fig 22 compares the different mooring load distribution functions among the different approaches a suitable adjustment is obtained through the gev distribution with correlation coefficients in the region of 0 99 for each approach and sea state considered according to the qq plot shown in fig 22 in general buoy data overestimate the seaward line tension and underestimate the leeward line tension as opposed to the jonswap approaches the discrepancy of these results suggests differences in the coupling to the platform response fig 23 presents the surge offset for each state considered all buoy sea states generate higher offset than jonswap approaches similar responses are obtained for the different jonswap spectrum definitions these results show the importance of considering real spectra instead of theoretical spectra finally fig 24 shows the percentile differences between the jonswap approaches and the buoy data for all moorings and sea states the percentiles used are 0 5 0 9 0 95 and 0 99 positive values mean that predicted loads by jonswap spectra are higher than predicted loads by buoy data and vice versa in general loads obtained by the jonswap spectrum are overestimated for mooring lines m1 and m3 and underestimated for m2 with respect to the buoy data overestimated differences of less than 2 are observed in the least loaded mooring lines m1 and m3 for jonswap with gamma 3 3 and differences of less than 4 are observed for the best jonswap fit in sea states 1 and 2 the most loaded mooring line shows underestimated differences of less than 2 and 4 for jonswap with gamma 3 3 and jonswap with the best gamma fit respectively however differences of approximately 12 are obtained in the 0 99 percentile in sea state 2 for the two jonswap approaches overestimated differences of less than 1 are observed between the jonswap approaches and the buoy data for the least loaded mooring lines in sea states 3 and 4 whereas those for the most loaded mooring are less than 4 the results show that similar patterns are obtained for the different jonswap approaches with differences between them of less than 3 in the prediction of loads the assumption of a theoretical spectrum instead of a real spectrum can generate uncertainties of up to 12 according to the sea states considered in this work 4 conclusions to survive ultimate limit states a mooring system must be designed to accurately estimate extreme line loads an in house numerical model calibrated by tank testing is used to estimate loads in a catenary mooring system the estimated loads are sensitive to model setting quasi static or dynamic and input wave characteristic wave groupiness or spectra in this article extreme loads are analysed with various model settings and safety factors on the mooring lines are recommended by taking into account different working regimes of the wind turbine the aforementioned parameters are analysed on a fowt located in the north of spain the influence of the mooring numerical model is investigated in the analysis of peak loads dynamic models are more accurate than quasi static models in the evaluation of extreme loads slight differences are found between the two models for mean loads of approximately 5 reaching 70 with respect to the maximum load parameters i form is used to select the long term data of the sea states different sea states are selected by considering the control used in the turbine and the characteristics of the waves the effect of wave time history for each sea state is analysed by proposing several cases with different distribution of wave groupiness the results of simulations show significant load variability for this reason two extreme load studies are performed one considering all peak loads and another considering only the maximum local load the most probable maximum mpm is provided for each methodology as the design load proposed by the standards the influence of the real spectra in contrast to that of the theoretical spectra is analysed in this study in general the assumption of jonswap spectra implied an error below 12 in the evaluation of loads relative to that implied by real spectra to summarise a methodology for evaluating the effect of different parameters related to metocean conditions on a mooring system is presented this approach combines aerodynamic hydrodynamic and mooring models with statistical methods for the selection of sea states and the evaluation of loads the dynamic analysis achieves better approximations in the evaluation of extreme loads than other methods adopting statistical

23044,for installing offshore wind turbines into deep waters use of floating crane vessels is essential one of the major challenges is their sensitivity to wave induced vessel and crane tip motions which can cause the impact of lifted components like blades and nacelle with nearby structures the impact loads on fibre composite wind turbine blades are critical as several complex damage modes capable of affecting the structural integrity are developed planning of such installation tasks therefore requires response based operational limits that consider impact loads on the blade along with their damage quantification the research area considering the impact behaviour of the lifted blade is novel and thus the paper identifies vessel blade and lifting parameters that determine impact contact scenarios furthermore for a case in which a lifted blade with its leading edge impacts the tower a numerical modelling technique is presented in abaqus explicit and a comprehensive damage assessment of the blade and an investigation of the impact dynamics and energy evolution are performed sensitivity studies for two distinct blade designs and two different impact locations are considered the results show that 7 20 of the impact energy is absorbed as damage in the blade whereas the majority dissipates as rigid body motions of the blade after the impact the findings of the study highlight the requirement for advanced installation equipment such as active tugger lines to prevent successive impacts of wind turbine blades during installation keywords offshore wind turbine blade contact impact finite element method marine operation composite structure floating crane vessel 1 introduction one of the most sustainable sources of energy owing to its plentiful existence is wind energy ho et al 2017 li 2016 acero 2016 as a result land based wind turbines have been used to generate cleaner energy for many decades additionally offshore wind turbines are in high demand because they present several advantages relative to land based turbines some of the benefits include availability of higher wind speeds low turbulence intensities the possibility of having larger turbines because they are far from human societies and finally ease of transportation li 2016 nevertheless the assembly and installation phases for offshore turbines are costly with recent studies showing that they constitute approximately 10 20 of the capex cost li 2016 verma et al 2017 kuijken 2015 compared to only 2 for land based turbines li 2016 to reduce the cost of energy and make offshore turbines more economical the offshore wind industry plans to deploy turbines with increased power ratings in deeper water and far from shore ho et al 2017 verma et al 2017 verma et al 2018a verma et al 2018b an increase in the power ratings of turbines enables an offshore farm to satisfy given power capacity requirements with fewer wind turbine units this is expected to reduce the cost of installation as there will be fewer total turbine units to be installed and the project will thus be more profitable however these types of turbines are large in size and pose safety issues during installation the challenge is due to the components of the turbines such as blades and the nacelle gearbox generator that are sensitive and require significant precision while being lifted using offshore crane vessels verma et al 2019a currently offshore wind turbines are installed using jack up crane vessels fig 1 a in water depths up to 30 50 m acero 2016 these vessels provide a stable platform for installation because there is little differential movement of the vessel and the lifted object due to the load bearing jacked up legs li 2016 acero 2016 however to satisfy the industry s demand for installing offshore wind turbines in even deeper waters use of floating crane vessels is essential fig 1 b floating crane vessels unlike jack up vessels are sensitive to wave induced vessel and crane tip motions and in critical cases are vulnerable to movement of ballast or cargo baldock et al 2014 the vessel and the lifted object display combined dynamics and the motions of the vessel especially those excited by rotation about its longitudinal and transverse axis develop significant responses in the lifted object this causes high impact risks of the hoisted object with the nearby structures moreover when performing dynamic lifts using a floating crane vessel the maximum rate at which the object is hoisted which is determined by the winch speed baldock et al 2014 is also a critical element hoisting the lifted object while the level of the deck of the vessel continuously rises and falls due to wave induced loads causes large motion of the lifted object this can cause the lifted object to hit the deck or any equipment on the vessel the shape of the lifted object is also a critical element during lifting for example the wind turbine blade which is a slender object when lifted using the floating crane vessel at high altitude leaves limited space between the crane boom and hook and the blade could hit the boom baldock et al 2014 thus from the above discussion it is clear that the motions arising during lifting operations especially using floating crane vessels could cause impact contact of the lifted component of a turbine with surrounding structures these impact risks are critical for the lifted object from a structural perspective as these structures are not originally designed for resisting impact loads during the temporary phases of installation the effect of impact induced loads on a fibre composite wind turbine blade are more serious compared to steel components such as transition pieces and monopiles verma et al 2017 verma et al 2018b the steel structures are inherently ductile in nature and most of the energy during the impact is dissipated in the plastic phase or work hardening phase before the material fails agrawal et al 2014 again such damage to the steel structures is quite discrete and visually detectable with the possibility of predicting the consequence based on visible dent or cracks a wind turbine blade on the other hand is comprised of composite sandwich materials which provide a high stiffness to weight ratio including excellent in plane structural performance verma et al 2018b agrawal et al 2014 abrate 2005 however these materials are weak in their off axis direction and are sensitive to impact loads abrate 2005 several intricate and interacting damage modes can develop agrawal et al 2014 abrate 2005 mcgugan et al 2035 and they are not always detectable via visual inspection however such damage can grow under operational loads perillo and jørgensen 2016 and can cause global structural failure of the blade in addition damage of varying sizes positions and locations in the blade could affect the residual strength and performance of the blade in a multitude of manners and judging its criticality is thus difficult verma et al 2017 verma et al 2018a verma et al 2018b haselbach et al haselbach et al 2016 found that delamination arising close to the surface of the laminate of the blade at the suction side has a more adverse effect than delamination near the middle layers of the laminate of the blade overall the impact loads on wind turbine blades are critical and therefore planning of such installation tasks requires response based operational limits that consider impact loads on the blade along with their damage quantification verma et al verma et al 2018a proposed a structural response based approach for estimating limiting sea states and operability for a blade lifting task using a floating crane vessel see fig 2 the methodology consists of four interrelated steps 1 global response analysis of the installation system for estimation of the motion of the vessel and lifted blade for various sea states 2 finite element analysis to investigate the impact behaviour of the lifted blade for different impact scenarios 3 assessment of allowable sea states in which characteristic values are compared with strength parameters and finally 4 estimation of the operability of the task for a given offshore site note that one of the sub steps for assessing the allowable impact velocity is to establish a relationship between the damage energy de and impact velocity v i m p in this paper we focus explicitly on the second step addressing the impact behaviour of the blade during installation where emphasis is placed on the investigation of the impact dynamics and damage evaluation using finite element analysis the parameters that determine impact contact scenarios for the lifted blade during installation are identified furthermore for a case in which a lifted blade impacts the tower with its leading edge a numerical modelling technique is implemented in abaqus explicit sensitivity studies for two distinct blade designs and two different impact locations are performed further an attempt is made to understand the motion of blade after the impact which will explicitly indicate the possibility of successive impacts of the blade with surrounding structures finally a relationship between the damage energy de and impact velocity v i m p is established the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows sections 2 and 3 present parameters that determine impact contact scenarios and discuss the material and modelling methods for a case study considered in this work section 4 presents and discusses the results for impact dynamics and damage assessment obtained for blade impact further section 5 concludes the paper followed by section 6 which discusses the limitation and future work 2 contact scenario contact region and numerical modelling method 2 1 parameters determining contact impact scenario damage assessment of a composite structure due to impact loads is not a recent development scientists have been examining this research topic for several years especially in aerospace and defense applications verma et al 2018b mcgugan et al 2035 hayman 2007 however the problem of a lifted offshore wind blade suffering impact during installation tasks because of crane tip and blade motions is a novel research area such a problem would depend on the contact scenario in question as the blade is lifted from the deck during its lifting phase and is finally mated to the hub thus throughout the hoisting phase the blade undergoes various sub phases varying with the height of the lift fig 4 and presents different contact scenarios depending on a few parameters fig 3 lists the parameters that determine the contact impact scenarios during the blade lifting task and the criticality of impact loads these parameters are the a choice of installation vessel b type of assembly method for installing offshore wind components c lifting procedure d pitch and yaw angle of the hoisted blade e lifting phase of the blade and f design details of the blade being installed note that all these identified parameters are applicable to blade installation using both jack up and floating crane vessels further explanation of these parameters can be found in verma et al 2018a in which single blade lifting using offshore crane vessels is discussed among all the parameters the lifting phase and pitch angle of the hoisted blade figs 3 and 4 determine the impact region of the blade for a given contact scenario for example during the full lift off phase of the blade a lifting method with a pitch angle of zero degrees can cause the blade s leading edge to impact the pre assembled turbine tower or crane boom whereas during the mating phase the blade root with guide pin bolts can impact the hub verma et al 2018a b 2019a these are well illustrated in fig 4 one of the most important parameters from a structural point of view that decides the criticality of such impact loads is the design details of the wind turbine blade being installed in practice there are a wide variety of blade designs available of which the conventional and traditional design of blades involves the construction of different subcomponents that are joined together using adhesive connections haselbach 2015 this is referred to as the conventional blade type in this paper fig 5 a another important blade design involves no use of adhesive connections in the blade and the blade is constructed in a single piece this is referred to as the integrated blade type in this paper haselbach 2015 fig 5 b these design details of the blade are an important consideration for impact investigations given that these blades vary structurally and thus exhibit varying impact resistance thus this paper presents the numerical modelling technique and compares damage assessments for the blade based on the above two blade design types this will be explained in more detail later in this section 2 2 description of the chosen contact scenario and contact region considered in the study the present paper considers the impact for one of the most critical stages of blade installation in which the blade is in the full lift off phase and close to the hub height fig 6 a b this sub phase is critical because the blade in this scenario is at its highest position where the largest wind loads and largest floating vessel induced motions are expected moreover it is assumed that the blade is lifted using a horizontal single blade lifting method with zero degree pitch angle and thus the relevant contact scenario to investigate is an impact of the leading edge of the blade with the tower two different blade designs a a conventional blade type with adhesive connections on the leading edge and b an integrated blade type with a sandwich section at the leading edge are considered furthermore the impact investigations are considered at two different regions along the leading edge one close to the area where yoke is attached to the blade 0 44 r r 0 48 a and the other region near the tip of the blade 0 68 r r 0 71 b fig 6 a b the reason for investigating two contact regions along the leading edge is because these regions vary in terms of the composite layup and have non identical thicknesses they thus have varying local strength and stiffness additionally from a dynamic point of view any impact closer to the tip region of the leading edge is a more eccentric impact compared to an impact close to the yoke and thus the impact dynamics are expected to vary for the same impact velocity note that it is the motion analysis of the installation system that determines the impact velocity with which the blade suffers impact see fig 2 however a global analysis of installation systems is beyond the scope of this paper and the impact investigation using finite element analysis is considered for several impact velocities v x ranging from 0 02 to 0 5 m s this range of velocities is reported as predominant while lifting blades using a floating crane vessel verma et al 2018a zhao et al revision submitted 2 3 modelling method in this paper the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 is considered as the base model for impact investigations the reference blade is originally a shell model is 86 4 m long and has a root diameter of 5 4 m the blade is generic in design and consists of composite and sandwich section along with load bearing spar caps and shear webs furthermore the blade has only an adhesive connection modelled partially at the trailing edge and there are no other adhesive connections either at the leading edge or at the spar cap web assembly joint hence the dtu 10 mw reference blade can be assumed to be an integrated blade type with no specific adhesive joints in this section we present a numerical modelling technique based on shell elements for impact investigation of a blade based on the integrated blade type and conventional blade type however first a brief discussion of the characteristics and limitations of the shell element based impact modelling of composites is presented 2 3 1 characteristics and limitations of shell element based impact modelling for composites in this study the impact scenario involves a full length lifted wind turbine blade impacting a tower with its leading edge it is already known that a composite structure at full scale length has large flexibility compared to its coupon representation and thus the structure stores more elastic energy due to impact verma et al 2018b rajbhandari et al 2002 as a result the entire flexibility and inertia of the structure must be considered during the finite element analysis for this problem the shell element based method is an efficient method note that three broad aspects sutherland 2017 are required to characterise the impact investigation of a composite structure 1 impact responses which describe impact forces impact dynamics and energy evolutions 2 impact resistances which describe the nature of damage and failure modes developed due to impact and finally 3 damage tolerances which describe the residual strength of the composite after the impact in this paper the first two aspects are the main focus of investigation for the blade impact and thus the discussion of the shell element based method is focussed on impact responses and impact resistances together termed as impact behaviour shell elements are generally utilised for modelling large composite structures with many degrees of freedom the structure s thickness dimension is considerably less than its width and length dimensions abrate 2005 barbero 2013 reddy 2004 using the shell element based approach the thickness is defined as a section specific parameter this makes the analysis cheaper hibbitt et al 2016 furthermore one of the critical parameters for numerical modelling of composites is the consideration of inter laminar shear stresses this is because for a composite the inter laminar shear moduli are small compared to the in plane modulus and thus the inter laminar shear stresses are critical thus for investigation of blade impacts the present paper considers a general purpose conventional thick shell element s4r hibbitt et al 2016 from the abaqus library for impact modelling of the blade s4r elements are enforced by mindlin reissner theory hibbitt et al 2016 and can estimate the inter laminar shear stresses using correction factors these elements are 4 noded quadrilateral elements with formulation suitable for analysis including large deformation and strain hibbitt et al 2016 abrate 2005 another important characteristic of the modelling method is the possibility of defining different plies and material orientations through the thickness using section integration point definition this helps in analysing the damaged states of a composite at the ply level but at an efficient computational cost the utilised method also has demerits and can influence the results obtained for the impact response and impact resistance in verma et al 2019b it was found that shell element based method overestimates the impact forces and exhibited a relatively stiffer response compared to solid elements additionally impact modelling of composites based on this technique could not discretely model an important failure mode for a composite sandwich structure i e delamination and debonding of layers however it should be noted that a suitable global local modelling technique such as a submodelling method in which advanced material modelling is possible in the region of impact can be utilised however such an analysis would still require transfer of temporal and spatial displacement fields from a coarser global solution based on shell elements to the driving nodes of the submodel thus the present paper considers the shell element based modelling technique sufficient to be performed at the global scale 2 3 2 numerical modelling method for the integrated blade type the parent blade derived from the dtu repository bak et al 2013 is a shell model with no adhesive connection and thus the blade represents an integrated blade type note that the leading edge which is the impact region in the study is a sandwich section further the blade consists of glass fibre reinforced polymer gfrp plies and is added with balsa material as the core the blade has 100 cross sections with each section divided into 11 regions circumferentially each region is assigned with a specific composite layup plan however the stacking sequence is multi directional and has triaxial biaxial and uniaxial plies these multi directional plies are equivalent representations of the individual unidirectional plies and the properties are derived based on the classical micro mechanics equations and classical laminate theory clt bak et al 2013 the reason for incorporating such smeared properties into the blade is because the objective of the reference model was to analyse the structural performance against operational loading conditions and thus this layup provides ease and convenience however the present multi directional based formulation of layup is not suitable for impact investigation because an explicit understanding of specific plies that can be critically damaged due to impact loads is not possible hence for impact investigation a stacking sequence based on unidirectional nomenclature is required thus the original layup for the reference blade in the impact region is derived in the form of 45 45 02 balsa s fig 7 a b an iterative procedure is developed that calculates multi directional plies back into their parent individual ply definitions while considering parameters such as the thickness of the laminate at the contact region mass of the blade and cog of the blade consistent with the parent definitions furthermore to check that this modified layup in terms of individual plies does not influence the blade s global characteristics eigenvalue analyses are performed and the results are compared to the parent dtu 10 mw blade table 1 presents the eigenfrequencies for different modes and it can be seen that the modified layup yields sound results furthermore a base impact analysis is also performed on the parent and modified blades to compare the local stiffness at the contact region for a case in which the leading edge impacts the tower with an impact velocity of 0 1 m s it can be seen from fig 8 a and b that the contact force histories and kinetic energy evolution histories are in close agreement for the parent and modified blades overall these results validate that the modified layup definition is consistent with the original parent blade layup and can thus be utilised for the impact investigation finally each ply in the layup is defined with three section points and thus 27 section points are associated with the contact regions note that section point 1 corresponds to the outermost ply which represent the shell reference surface whereas section points 13 14 and 15 correspond to the balsa material ply 5 see fig 7 a and b 2 3 3 numerical modelling for the conventional blade type here we present a numerical modelling method for the conventional type blade which is still the most widely used blade type in the industry these blade types have adhesive connections at their leading edges where the impact is considered in this study to model an adhesive connection and then simulate impact induced cracks based on a fracture mechanics approach solids and cohesive brick elements are required at the leading edge this approach will be significantly computationally demanding and thus in this paper we investigate impact damage on the adhesive connections of the blade based on a strength based approach this can be achieved by using a stratification technique in which adhesive material is modelled as a part of the composite layup stacking sequence using shell element based modelling the adhesive and top and bottom composite laminates at the leading edge are defined as different layers in the layup and failure in the adhesive layer is predicted based on a yield based criterion such as drucker prager model the modelling of the adhesive joints based on a stratification technique enforces some assumptions and simplification to the problem the first assumption is that the thickness of bond line at the leading edge is uniform and free of imperfection it is further assumed that the top laminate 45 45 02 s on the suction side is single lapped joint with the bottom laminate 45 45 02 s on the pressure side with an adhesive material the overlap length of the joint is uniformly varying throughout the blade length and is assumed equal to 50 of the length of the nose region 20 40 cm to define the adhesive connection at the leading edge of the blade the nose section xx yy is divided into two regions transition region p and overlap region q the overlap region q ww vv fig 9 a b corresponds to the region of the lap joint and consists of composite laminate as adherends along with the adhesive material on the other hand the transition region of the nose p xx ww yy vv aids in the gradual transitioning of the layup including balsa and prevents any stress concentrations owing to ply drops note that the thickness of the balsa gradually declines from 30 mm at the leading panel lp to 10 mm at the end of transition region and there is no core modelled at the overlap region the final layup for the blade at the leading edge is 45 45 02 s adhesive 45 45 02 s and has a total of 17 plies with a thickness of 10 2 mm at the contact region note that the adhesive used in this study is araldite 2015 and is a ductile adhesive used in the blade industry further the adhesive thickness varies from 0 5 mm to 4 mm throughout the length of the blade and the thickness of the adhesive at contact region a is 1 mm the modelling method also considers adhesive joints at the trailing edge for this purpose standard hexahedral continuum solid elements c3d8r are utilised for modelling the adhesive material and is tie constrained with the aerodynamic shells at the trailing edge fig 10 the adhesive joints in the spar cap regions are modelled in a general manner with a simplified edge to edge joint additionally the strength of the modelled blade based on conventional blade type is found to be satisfactory in terms of global characteristics and is therefore suitable for impact analysis 2 3 4 blade tower impact formulation approach a tower with a diameter of 5 m and a height of 120 m is defined as a rigid body in the analysis and is discretised with 4 node bilinear quadrilateral r3d4 elements fig 11 a reference point is allocated to the rigid tower along with an inertial mass of 450 tons and it is fixed in all degrees of freedom furthermore the blade is given an predefined impact velocity in the x direction v x ranging from 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s there was no other impact velocity defined in other directions fig 11 further no other elements used in the lifting of the blade such as the yoke crane hook or tugger lines are modelled the contact between the tower and blade is defined in the analysis based on a general contact formulation available in abaqus and is defined between the shell reference surface and outer surface of the tower the normal behaviour is defined as hard contact where as the tangential behaviour between the surfaces is defined with penalty algorithm and a value of 0 3 is defined as the friction coefficient the entire blade is discretised with 4 noded quadrilateral shell elements s4rs with a reduced integration scheme the elements in the contact region of the blade for both blade types have refined meshes with element dimension of 0 48 0 48 m2 conversely the remaining region of the blade which contributes mainly to the inertia is discretised with relatively coarser meshes with element size varying from 50 mm to 500 mm this is based on a mesh convergence study performed in verma et al 2017 overall there were in total 97 356 elements present for both blade types note that abaqus explicit is the solver environment in this study because of its efficacy in solving highly non linear problems with complex interactions large rotations and large deformations 3 constitutive material damage models implemented this paper considers impact investigation for two distinct blade type impacting the tower with their leading edge suitable damage models are thus required to model failure modes as different material combinations are present at the leading edge these are explained below 3 1 progressive failure model for the composite ply the 2d hashin failure criterion and the energy based damage evolution law camanho and dávila camanho et al 2003 hashin 1980 are utilised for progressive modelling of damages in the composite ply the damage initiation phase is determined by hashin failure criterion and can be used to estimate fibre and matrix damage modes separately it is given by the following 1 fibre tension σ ˆ 11 0 1 f f t σ ˆ 11 x t 2 κ τ ˆ 12 s l 2 1 2 fibre compression σ ˆ 11 0 2 f f c σ ˆ 11 x c 2 1 3 matrix tension σ ˆ 22 0

stress tensor components of σ ˆ and utilised in the model to determine initiation of the different damage modes mentioned above the effective stress tensor σ ˆ is derived from the true stress σ using the following relation 5 σ ˆ m σ where m is the matrix damage operator and is given by 6 m 1 1 d f 0 0 0 1 1 d m 0 0 0 1 1 d s where d f d m and d s are variables that characterise fibre matrix and shear damage and are derived from damage variables established based on the damage evolution laws in the respective failure modes d i and i ft fc mt mc the material parameters in the above equations x t and x c denote the longitudinal tensile and compressive strength respectively y t and y c denote the transverse tensile and compressive strength respectively and finally s l and s t denote the longitudinal and transverse shear strength of the ply respectively these material parameters are taken from haselbach et al 2016 bak et al 2013 and are mentioned in table 2 κ in equation 1 defines the shear stress dependency to fibre tensile failure f f t and is assumed to be zero in this work damage initiation in any respective ply is indicated when for a particular integration point f f t f f c f m t or f m c reach a value of unity once the damage initiation criterion is met the evolution of the degradation of material stiffness and continuous update of damage variable in all 4 modes are determined by the evolution law this evolution formulation is defined by a relation between stress and displacement together with linearised material softening and calculates the current damage state for the matrix and fibre the damage variable will evolve in the manner represented in fig 12 following a linear material softening behaviour the negative slope from a to c will depend on δ f e q which is as follows 7 δ f e q 2 g i c σ 0 e q where g i c is the critical energy release rate corresponding to the area of triangle oac and is defined for each damage mode moreover based on this damage evolution law the stiffness of the damaged element after the damage initiation point is evaluated using 8 σ c d ε and c d is the damaged material stiffness given by 9 c d 1 d 1 d f e 1 1 d f 1 d m ν 21 e 1 0 1 d f 1 d m ν 12 e 2 1 d m e 2 0 0 0 1 d s g d where 10 d 1 d f 1 d m ν 21 ν 12 11 d f d f t if σ ˆ 11 0 d f c if σ ˆ 11 0 12 d m d m t if σ ˆ 22 0 d m c if σ ˆ 22 0 13 d s 1 d f t 1 d f c 1 d m t 1 d m c the parameters d f d m and d s describe the final damage state of the ply in different modes corresponding to fibre and matrix failure in compression tension and shear respectively 3 2 failure criterion considered for the balsa core a sandwich section consists of laminate face sheets and an added core in the middle these sections are used because of the core s low density and aid in the local thickening of the section this significantly improves the buckling resistance of the section without any significant addition of extra weight for estimating impact induced damages on the leading edge of an integrated blade type balsa material in this study is considered as elastic plastic and is defined to have isotropic hardening behaviour the failure criterion is defined by von mises yield stress formulation together with equivalent plastic strain measure this criterion is simple and has been utilised in the literature weijermars 2016 nanami 2014 for modelling the inelastic behaviour of balsa core material during impact on a sandwich section however it should be noted that the balsa is an anisotropic material and a more detailed criterion that includes hydrostatic dependency strain rate effects and anisotropicity must be considered currently there are no built in criteria implemented in abaqus for modelling impact on balsa for shell element based formulations and therefore in this study a simplified criterion based on von mises is used note that the shell element kinematics do not have a constitutive relation for the displacements in the thickness direction and therefore cannot capture crushing and inelastic deformation in the thickness direction of the core however the applied criterion enables the model to capture inelastic deformation at least in the in plane loading directions of the core furthermore the impact velocities in the paper lie within the low velocity impact regime and therefore the chosen failure criterion is considered suitable for modelling impact induced damages the material parameters for the balsa material are taken from previous studies weijermars 2016 nanami 2014 vural and ravichandran and are listed in table 2 3 3 material damage model considered for the adhesive there has been a record of various failure criteria utilised for adhesives in the past but there is no single and unique failure criterion applicable for all cases kadam 2014 xu 2010 yield based failure criteria such as von mises assume yielding to be a pure shear deformation failure and neglect hydrostatic stresses therefore such criteria are not suited to model adhesives xu 2010 given that these materials are sensitive to both hydrostatic stress and shear components the exponential based drucker prager yield criterion which is an extension of the von mises yield criterion kadam 2014 özer and öz 2017 considers the sensitivity of adhesives to hydrostatic stresses and is found to be a sound criterion to model failure in adhesives thus it is utilised in the study the adhesive used in the conventional blade type in the paper is araldite 2015 http www huntsman com 2015 which is a ductile adhesive from huntsman the material data for the adhesive are derived from özer and öz 2017 and are listed in table 3 a very brief explanation of the exponential based drucker prager model is provided below note that the data corresponding to true plastic stress plastic strain under tensile uniaxial directions are used in the model along with tensile type hardening behaviour the yielding in the adhesives is considered with isotropic hardening a general yield function of the exponential based drucker prager model is based on the following fig 13 14 f a q b p p t where p t is defined as the hardening parameters that corresponds to the hydrostatic tension strength of the adhesive and are derived based on different uniaxial tests on adhesives q is the equivalent stress and p is the hydrostatic stress here b is called the exponent parameter and was taken to have a standard value of 2 based on weijermars 2016 additionally a is a material parameter constant with respect to stress considering isotropic hardening and independent of plastic deformations that is given by 15 a 1 3 σ yc σ yt 1 3 m 1 σ yt m σ yc σ yt where m is the hydrostatic sensitive parameter of the adhesive and σ yt and σ yc are the tensile yield stress and compressive yield stress of the adhesive 4 results and discussion the results regarding the impact dynamics energy evolution history and damage assessment for the case in which the wind turbine blade impacts the tower with its leading edge are presented here the impact investigations are performed for two distinct blade types integrated blade type and conventional blade type two impact locations contact regions a and b and different impact velocities in the range of 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s an individual explanation for all the cases is not possible and thus the results are presented for important cases table 4 presents a summary of various cases considered in this section for discussion along with major results case i compares the results regarding impact dynamics for varying impact location contact regions a and b and the discussion is restricted to the integrated blade type and impact velocity of 0 08 m s for the purpose of discussing the energy evolution and damage assessment results both the conventional blade type and integrated blade type are utilised however only impacts at contact region a are considered these are discussed through case ii case iii and case v finally case iv and case vi present the results for all cases of impact velocities and an analytical relation between the damage energy d e and velocity of impact v x is established for both blade types 4 1 description of impact dynamics case i velocity of impact v x 0 08 m s contact regions a and b the impact dynamics including the energy evolution history and motion of the blade after the impact will be discussed here for the case in which the blade impacts the tower with its leading edge two different contact regions i e regions a and b are considered here an impact velocity of 0 08 m s is used for the discussion because no damages developed in the blade for this case and it was thus suitable to explain and compare the impact dynamics 4 1 1 energy evolution history one of the important results for impact dynamics based on an explicit solver based analysis is the validation of the energy conservation principle fig 14 a and 14 b present the evolution of kinetic energy internal energy and total energy for the case of a blade impacting the tower with contact region a and b respectively it can be observed that the total energy etotal of the system in the simulation is constant also at any time step of the simulation the total energy etotal corresponds to the sum of internal energy allie and kinetic energy allke this confirms the theory of energy conservation balance in the system for both the contact regions further it is also checked that the artificial energy developed during the simulation corresponds to less than 2 of the total energy therefore the numerical model is considered suitable and gives stable results from fig 14 a and b it can also be seen that for both the cases the blade comes into contact with the tower at a simulation time of approximately 0 2 s additionally as the impact occurs the internal energy allie is developed in the blade with corresponding decline in the level of kinetic energy allke note that the allie developed due to impact is utilised in general as recoverable strain energy allse damage dissipation energy alldmd and energy dissipated due to plastic deformation allpd in the system fig 14 c and 14 d present the evolution of total internal energy allie and its dissipation into allse allpd and alldmd for both the contact regions a and b respectively it can be seen that allie and allse are similar through out the simulation time and thus completely overlap each other further there is no development of alldmd and allpd in the blade this implies that for both the case of impact with contact region a and b there is no damage developed in the blade at an impact velocity of 0 08 m s hence all the developed internal energy allie dissipates as recoverable elastic strain energy allse note that this a qualitative indication of having no damage in the blade based on energy results a quantitative description is also discussed later where the damage assessment results are presented 4 1 2 kinematics of the lifted blade after the impact the energy evolution histories for the case in which the blade impacts the tower at contact regions a and b for v x 0 08 m s were discussed based on fig 14 a and b it is seen that the etotal 135 j for both the cases are identical given that they correspond to same impact speed 0 08 m s however there is a significant difference in the natures of the evolution of allke and allie for contact regions a and b see fig 14 a and 14 b for the case in which the blade impacts the tower at contact region b there is less dissipation of allke and allie compared to impact of the blade at contact region a further for contact region b the impact of the blade with the tower persists for a small contact duration 0 2 s 0 39 s compared to the contact duration of 0 2 s 0 59 s for impact at contact region a the argument is also confirmed from fig 15 where the contact force time histories are compared for contact regions a and b it is seen that for contact region b the contact duration and contact forces are less compared to the blade impacting the tower at contact region a the reason for the difference in the impact dynamics for the two cases is the eccentricity at the location of impact the impact at contact region b represents a highly eccentric impact e 34 m compared to contact region a which is close to the cog e 11 m see figs 16 and 17 moreover the section of the blade at contact region b is lighter in mass is narrower and has a relatively smaller chord length of approximately 3 46 m therefore once the blade impacts the tower at contact region b as a result of the eccentricity and difference in mass distributions an unbalanced moment is created at the blade root side thus the blade starts to deflect and rebound even before the whole contact impact with the tower completes as a result not much kinetic energy allke is transformed into internal energy allie and a small contact duration is seen a significant difference in the motion of the blade after the impact for the two cases can also be observed from figs 16 and 17 for contact region b the velocity is dominant both at blade root and in the tip region fig 17 and thus a significant rotation of the blade after the impact is observed however for the impact of blade at contact region a the velocity and the motion of the blade is concentrated explicitly at the tip region fig 16 it is also worth mentioning that for the case of blade impacting the tower at contact region a there are vibrations present in the blade after the impact however for the case of blade impacting the tower at contact region b there are more rigid body rotational motions of the blade and less vibrations this is an important observation because the control forces for active tugger lines would be required to dampen these vibrations in the blade if the impact occurs closer to the yoke 4 1 3 quantified description of damage based on the damage model in the current discussion based on energy evolution it is qualitatively argued that there are no damages developed in the blade due to impact a quantified description based on the damage model is presented here fig 18 a and 18 b present the ply wise hashin failure initiation criterion state for impact regions a and b and impact velocity of 0 08 m s it can be observed that none of the plies at these regions had hashin failure initiation criteria equal to one this implies that no damage is initiated in the blade at v x 0 08 m s further the von mises stresses in the balsa layer are below the yield stresses and this result confirms that no plastic strain are induced in the blade either these results also confirms the energy evolution results in which no alldmd or allpd are reported see fig 14 b overall no damage develops in the blade for this case and thus v x 0 08 m s lies below the threshold velocity at which damage initiates 4 2 impact induced damage assessment for integrated and conventional blade types in this section damage assessment results in the blade for higher impact velocities are presented the focus of the discussion is explicitly on the nature of damages obtained for both the blade types hence the results are restricted for the case of blade impacting the tower at contact region a the paper first discusses the damage assessment results for integrated blade type through case ii iii and iv followed by a discussion of the conventional blade type through case v and vi in the next section 4 2 1 integrated blade type case ii velocity of impact v x 0 15 m s in the previous section for the case of a blade impacting the tower with v x 0 08 m s it is found that there are no impact induced damage developed in the blade all the internal energy allie developed due to impact dissipates as recoverable elastic strain energy allse here the damage assessment result is presented for v x 0 15 m s which corresponds to approximately 450 j of impact energy note that the impact energy considered is about 3 2 times compared to the case of v x 0 08 m s fig 19 a presents the energy evolution history for allie allke and etotal it is observed that the total energy of the system remains steady throughout the simulation time and allke and allie correspond to etotal this confirms the theory of energy conservation principle also seen from the figures the blade impacts the tower at a simulation time of approximately 0 16 s and at this moment the internal energy in the blade originates with a corresponding decrease in the kinetic energy allke however unlike for the case of v x 0 08 m s allie and allse are no longer similar throughout the simulation time and do not overlap it is seen from fig 19 b that allie and allse only overlap until a simulation time of 0 18s followed by a small difference in the level of allie and allse afterwards this result can be further confirmed from fig 19 c where the evolution of allie and allse for 0 2 s 0 35 s is magnified and presented note that this difference between allie and allse is utilised in the blade as the damage energy alldmd which is also seen in fig 19 b this result implies that for the case of the blade impacting the tower with v x 0 15 m s not all the internal energy allie developed in the blade is dissipated as recoverable elastic strain energy allse and this indicates damage development in the blade given by alldmd fig 19 d presents a comparison of contact force history with the damage energy developed in the blade it can be seen that the damage energy alldmd follows the curve of the contact force history with maximum damage energy accumulated at the point at which there is the largest contact force note that at the point at which alldmd appears the contact force curve at the first peak exhibits an oscillating nature with a change in the slope this indicates a change in the material stiffness and damage progression in the blade a quantified description of damage assessment is presented in fig 20 in which the damage state of the blade based on hashin s failure initiation criterion is illustrated it can be observed that the status hsnmccrt has reached a value 1 which means that the damage initiation criterion has been met and the laminate has initiated damage in matrix compression the damage status hsnmtcrt hsnfccrt hsnftcrt are less than 1 indicating no damage in other failure modes this discussion is in line with the small damage energy alldmd dissipated due to impact and thus indicates a minor damage in the blade it is also found that the von mises stresses in the core are less than the yield stresses and thus no damage initiation or inelastic deformation is developed in the core this compliments the energy results where no allpd are reported due to impact see fig 19 b overall minor damages are developed in the laminates for this case and thus v x 0 15 m s lies just above the threshold velocity at which damage starts to initiate fig 21 presents the maximum damage energy obtained in the blade due to impact for various impact velocities upto v x 0 16 m s it is seen that until v x 0 14 m s there is no development of damage energy the development of damage energy initiates at 0 14 m s this implies that v x 0 14 m s is the threshold velocity of impact at which damage initiates in the blade note that these values are sensitive to the layup plan and would vary with the specifics of the blade utilised in actual practice here the paper presents these results for impact investigations based on the reference dtu blade and considers the integrated type of blade design note that these parameters aid in deriving response based operational limits and is well captured through shell element based method case iii velocity of impact v x 0 5 m s in the previous cases ply level description of the damage in the blade was not mentioned because the damage obtained was minor here the damage assessment result is presented for v x 0 5 m s which corresponds to an impact energy of greater than 5000 j and the final damage states in the blade is presented at the ply level fig 22 shows the energy evolution history due to blade impact with the tower for v x 0 5 m s the blade contacts the tower at a simulation time of approximately 0 05 s and at this point the internal energy allie is developed in the blade and allke decreases furthermore the energy conservation principle can also be confirmed because the etotal in the system is constant throughout the analysis and allke and allie correspond to etotal at every time step fig 22 also presents the dissipation of developed allie into corresponding allse alldmd and allpd it can be seen that there is a large difference in the curves of allie and allse and a significant development of damage dissipation energy alldmd and plastic deformation energy allpd this indicates large damages and degradation of material stiffness at the contact region the development of allpd in the energy curves also qualitatively indicates the development of inelastic deformation in the core a quantitative description of the damage states of the blade s leading edge due to impact for this case is presented below fig 23 shows the final damage state of the blade due to impact with the tower at the simulation time t 1 s fig 23 a illustrates the envelope view of the damage states it can be clearly seen that the blade has developed damage in matrix compression damagemc matrix tension damagemt and shear damageshr this result implies that the blade damage due to impact are matrix dominated furthermore the von mises stresses in the core 5 99 mpa exceed the yield strength 5 4 mpa which indicates the development of plastic strain and inelastic deformation the discussion is also elaborated at the ply scale in fig 23 b in which the damage states for various plies in the contact region are presented note that the results are presented for the middlemost section point of each ply it can be observed from the figure that most of the plies exhibited damage near the impact side of the laminate i e between plies 1 and 4 with damage further developing in the plies below the core moreover different plies had different regions being damaged which is due to the plies varying orientations and the presence of curvature in the impact region ply 5 corresponds to the balsa material and the plastic strain peeq is also shown in fig 23 b the discussion is in line with the energy evolution history in which the development of allpd was reported see fig 22 overall it is seen that the intralaminar failure modes for the ply and damage state of the balsa is modelled at a ply level based on the modelling technique presented in this paper however one of the most important failure modes which is delamination developing at the ply interfaces are not modelled the research task of modelling delamination in the blade due to impact can be achieved using a suitable global local methods and will be considered in future work however the results obtained for the blade based on shell elements are important and will be utilised case iv dependence of the damage energy de on the impact velocity v x in the previous section the damage assessment results for the integrated blade type were presented for two impact velocities 0 15 m s and 0 5 m s note that the impact investigations are performed for different velocities ranging from 0 02 m s 0 5 m s it was mentioned in section 1 that a dependency of damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x is required to derive structural response based operational limits fig 24 a presents the maximum damage energies alldmd obtained in the blade for different impact velocities ranging from 0 14 m s to 0 5 m s post threshold range which are represented by black dots to establish an analytical relation between damage energies and different impact velocities these points were fitted using first order and second order polynomial fits which are represented by green and red lines respectively see fig 24 a it can be observed that these points are represented better by the second degree polynomial fit red line r square 0 995 and thus the relation d e 735 72 v x 2 107 v x is found to be suitable to describe the dependence of the damage energy de on the impact velocity v x furthermore this dependence of the damage energy d e 735 72 v x 2 107 v x is plotted and compared with the line representing the total energy of impact for all the cases k e 0 5 x mass of the blade x v x 2 see fig 24 b it can be seen that the area under the curve i for the damage energy line is considerably smaller than the total energy of impact this result implies that a very small amount of impact energy approximately 2 5 is dissipated in the blade as damage and most of the energy is dissipated as recoverable elastic strain energy by means of rigid body motions and rotation of the blade after the impact thus it is important to realise that the blade when it impacts the tower while being lifted dissipates only a small fraction of energy as damage and the majority dissipates as recoverable elastic energy 4 2 2 conventional blade type the previous section described the damage assessment results for the case in which the blade modelled based on integrated blade type impacts the tower with its leading edge in this section the results for damage assessment for conventional blade type will be discussed the focus is on the comparing the results with the integrated blade type and thus impact velocity of 0 5 m s case v is explicitly considered this is because for v x 0 5 m s significant damages are obtained in the previous discussions and is thus suitable for comparison finally dependence of damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x is presented for conventional blade type case vi and is compared with integrated blade type case v velocity of impact v x 0 5 m s fig 25 a presents the energy evolution history for allke allie and etotal for the case in which a conventional blade type impacts the tower with v x 0 5 m s the total energy of the system is constant throughout the analysis and allie and allke corresponds to etotal at each time step of the simulation thus the energy conservation principle is satisfied and the model is suitable for impact investigation it can also be seen from the figure that the blade impacts the tower at around 0 05 s of the simulation time and the internal energy allie is developed at this point the contact with the tower persists till 0 6 s and the blade rebounds fig 25 b presents the dissipation of internal energy into allse alldmd and allpd it can be seen that there is large difference between allie and allse which is about 5 times compared to integrated blade type similarly large damage energy alldmd in the blade is developed this observation indicates that the there will be greater damage to a conventional type blade than to an integrated type blade a quantitative description is also presented in fig 26 where an envelope view of the damage state is shown the conventional blade type at the impact region has greater damages over large area based on damagemc damagemt and damageshr status compared to integrated blade type for the same impact velocity the damage state through the thickness in corresponding damagemc damagemt and damageshr is also presented in fig 27 it can be clearly observed that all the plies through the thickness developed a significant damage state this observation is contradictory to what was obtained for integrated blade type where most of the damages were concentrated at the topmost plies and near the impact side fig 25 b also presents the development of allpd which indicates the development of plastic strain in the blade at the contact region this is confirmed quantitatively in fig 26 in which the plastic strain developed in the adhesive region due to the impact is shown note that the level of plastic strain developed is comparatively less than what was obtained for the layer of balsa for the integrated blade type the reason for the difference in the damage resistance for both the blade type is the nature and the thickness of the material present in the impact region the integrated blade type is fused with balsa material at the leading edge and has a thicker section 34 mm therefore due to impact with the tower much of the internal energy developed in the blade was absorbed by the thicker balsa layer and not much damage developed below the core as a result most of the damages was focused around the impact side of the blade along the top plies and less alldmd and a small damage area developed on the other hand the conventional blade type was modelled with adhesive joint at the leading edge the impact region for this blade was relatively thinner 10 2 mm and therefore for the same impact speed most of the energy progressed to all the layers with damage spreading over larger area in the plies case vi dependence of damage energy de on the impact velocity v x previously the dependence of damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x was established and presented for integrated blade type here this dependency is compared with the results based on conventional blade type fig 28 presents the dependence of damage energy for the conventional blade type on the impact velocity as expected the damage energy curve exhibits a stronger trend for conventional blade type compared to the integrated blade type this is due to the large damage energy alldmd developed in the case of conventional blade type furthermore the line representing the total energy of impact is plotted and compared with damage energy curve obtained for both the blade types it can be observed that overall only 7 20 of the impact energy is absorbed as damage in the blade this is in line with the discussion presented before where it was mentioned that most of the energy due to impact dissipated as elastic strain energy by means of rigid body motions as well as rotations of the blade with less energy being dissipated as damage in the blade nevertheless the dissipated energy is sufficient to cause damage in the blade which is mostly concentrated in the impact region locally furthermore these results where majority of impact energy dissipates as rigid body motions highlights the requirement of advanced installation equipments like active tugger lines and guide wires to prevent the risk of successive impact of the blade with nearby structures 5 concluding remarks 1 the current study comprehensively investigated the impact behaviour of an offshore wind turbine blade due to the impact with tower during lifting operation it was mentioned that the lifting operations using floating crane vessels is critical and can cause impact of the lifted blade with surrounding structures this can develop complex damage modes in the blades capable of affecting their structural integrity 2 for planning blade lifting task structural response based operational limits are necessary the methodology from verma et al 2018a includes a step which deals with the finite element analysis of the blade to investigate its impact behaviour for different contact scenarios several parameters which determine impact contact scenario for the lifted blade during installation were identified one of the identified parameters was the design details of the blade being installed and was considered critical from structural perspective 3 an impact scenario was chosen for impact investigation in which the blade during the lift off phase impacts the tower with its leading edge the capability of shell element based numerical modelling technique was explored in abaqus explicit the discussion with respect to the impact dynamics energy evolutions and damage assessment in the blade was made two distinct blade types integrated blade type and conventional blade type two impact locations contact region a and b and different impact velocities in the range of 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s were considered contact region a corresponds to the region of the leading edge close to the yoke 0 44 r r 0 48 whereas the contact region b corresponds to the area near the tip of the blade 0 68 r r 0 71 4 the results for the impact dynamics and motion of the blade after the impact were compared for contact regions a and b it was found that for the case in which the blade impacts the tower at contact region a there was significant development of internal energy along with large contact forces developed in the blade compared to contact region b furthermore the motion of the blade after impact varied for the two different regions rotation of the blade after the impact was dominant for contact region b in contrast to vibration in the blade for contact region a 5 damage assessment results were presented for different impact velocities ranging from 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s for both blade types for the case of an integrated blade type most of the damage was concentrated at the plies lying at the impact side furthermore there was a smaller damage area with most of the energy absorbed by the core of the section on the other hand for the case of the conventional blade type significant damage occurred for all the plies through the thickness with damage spreading over a larger area in the composite plies thus there was significantly greater damage for the same impact energy for the case of the conventional blade type compared to the integrated blade type 6 the dependences of the damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x for both blade types were established and compared with the total energy of impact most of the energy due to impact dissipated as recoverable elastic strain energy by means of rigid body motions and rotation of the blade with only 7 20 being dissipated as damage energy thus designing advanced installation equipment such as active tugger lines and guide wires is necessary to prevent the risk of successive impacts during blade installation 6 limitation and future work in the current work shell element based modelling method is utilised to investigate the impact behaviour of an offshore wind turbine blade due to impact loads during installation the modelling method is found efficient in predicting impact responses and impact dynamics in addition the energy evolution results complimented the discussions for damage assessment quite closely however as mentioned the shell element based method could not capture delaminations in the composite plies and is limited when it comes to predicting the crushing and inelastic deformations of the core in the thickness directions these limitations can affect the damage tolerance aspect of impact investigations in which the residual strength analysis of the damaged blade is investigated therefore global local modelling methods need to be investigated to model delamination and core crushing at the leading edge which have not been captured in this study further the analytical relationship between the damage energy and impact velocity needs to be updated once the energy dissipated due to delamination of the plies is analysed again it will be ideal to perform experiments with impact loads on a real wind turbine blade this will help in the validation of numerical results and in a more explicit understanding of the impact induced failure modes in the blade

23044,for installing offshore wind turbines into deep waters use of floating crane vessels is essential one of the major challenges is their sensitivity to wave induced vessel and crane tip motions which can cause the impact of lifted components like blades and nacelle with nearby structures the impact loads on fibre composite wind turbine blades are critical as several complex damage modes capable of affecting the structural integrity are developed planning of such installation tasks therefore requires response based operational limits that consider impact loads on the blade along with their damage quantification the research area considering the impact behaviour of the lifted blade is novel and thus the paper identifies vessel blade and lifting parameters that determine impact contact scenarios furthermore for a case in which a lifted blade with its leading edge impacts the tower a numerical modelling technique is presented in abaqus explicit and a comprehensive damage assessment of the blade and an investigation of the impact dynamics and energy evolution are performed sensitivity studies for two distinct blade designs and two different impact locations are considered the results show that 7 20 of the impact energy is absorbed as damage in the blade whereas the majority dissipates as rigid body motions of the blade after the impact the findings of the study highlight the requirement for advanced installation equipment such as active tugger lines to prevent successive impacts of wind turbine blades during installation keywords offshore wind turbine blade contact impact finite element method marine operation composite structure floating crane vessel 1 introduction one of the most sustainable sources of energy owing to its plentiful existence is wind energy ho et al 2017 li 2016 acero 2016 as a result land based wind turbines have been used to generate cleaner energy for many decades additionally offshore wind turbines are in high demand because they present several advantages relative to land based turbines some of the benefits include availability of higher wind speeds low turbulence intensities the possibility of having larger turbines because they are far from human societies and finally ease of transportation li 2016 nevertheless the assembly and installation phases for offshore turbines are costly with recent studies showing that they constitute approximately 10 20 of the capex cost li 2016 verma et al 2017 kuijken 2015 compared to only 2 for land based turbines li 2016 to reduce the cost of energy and make offshore turbines more economical the offshore wind industry plans to deploy turbines with increased power ratings in deeper water and far from shore ho et al 2017 verma et al 2017 verma et al 2018a verma et al 2018b an increase in the power ratings of turbines enables an offshore farm to satisfy given power capacity requirements with fewer wind turbine units this is expected to reduce the cost of installation as there will be fewer total turbine units to be installed and the project will thus be more profitable however these types of turbines are large in size and pose safety issues during installation the challenge is due to the components of the turbines such as blades and the nacelle gearbox generator that are sensitive and require significant precision while being lifted using offshore crane vessels verma et al 2019a currently offshore wind turbines are installed using jack up crane vessels fig 1 a in water depths up to 30 50 m acero 2016 these vessels provide a stable platform for installation because there is little differential movement of the vessel and the lifted object due to the load bearing jacked up legs li 2016 acero 2016 however to satisfy the industry s demand for installing offshore wind turbines in even deeper waters use of floating crane vessels is essential fig 1 b floating crane vessels unlike jack up vessels are sensitive to wave induced vessel and crane tip motions and in critical cases are vulnerable to movement of ballast or cargo baldock et al 2014 the vessel and the lifted object display combined dynamics and the motions of the vessel especially those excited by rotation about its longitudinal and transverse axis develop significant responses in the lifted object this causes high impact risks of the hoisted object with the nearby structures moreover when performing dynamic lifts using a floating crane vessel the maximum rate at which the object is hoisted which is determined by the winch speed baldock et al 2014 is also a critical element hoisting the lifted object while the level of the deck of the vessel continuously rises and falls due to wave induced loads causes large motion of the lifted object this can cause the lifted object to hit the deck or any equipment on the vessel the shape of the lifted object is also a critical element during lifting for example the wind turbine blade which is a slender object when lifted using the floating crane vessel at high altitude leaves limited space between the crane boom and hook and the blade could hit the boom baldock et al 2014 thus from the above discussion it is clear that the motions arising during lifting operations especially using floating crane vessels could cause impact contact of the lifted component of a turbine with surrounding structures these impact risks are critical for the lifted object from a structural perspective as these structures are not originally designed for resisting impact loads during the temporary phases of installation the effect of impact induced loads on a fibre composite wind turbine blade are more serious compared to steel components such as transition pieces and monopiles verma et al 2017 verma et al 2018b the steel structures are inherently ductile in nature and most of the energy during the impact is dissipated in the plastic phase or work hardening phase before the material fails agrawal et al 2014 again such damage to the steel structures is quite discrete and visually detectable with the possibility of predicting the consequence based on visible dent or cracks a wind turbine blade on the other hand is comprised of composite sandwich materials which provide a high stiffness to weight ratio including excellent in plane structural performance verma et al 2018b agrawal et al 2014 abrate 2005 however these materials are weak in their off axis direction and are sensitive to impact loads abrate 2005 several intricate and interacting damage modes can develop agrawal et al 2014 abrate 2005 mcgugan et al 2035 and they are not always detectable via visual inspection however such damage can grow under operational loads perillo and jørgensen 2016 and can cause global structural failure of the blade in addition damage of varying sizes positions and locations in the blade could affect the residual strength and performance of the blade in a multitude of manners and judging its criticality is thus difficult verma et al 2017 verma et al 2018a verma et al 2018b haselbach et al haselbach et al 2016 found that delamination arising close to the surface of the laminate of the blade at the suction side has a more adverse effect than delamination near the middle layers of the laminate of the blade overall the impact loads on wind turbine blades are critical and therefore planning of such installation tasks requires response based operational limits that consider impact loads on the blade along with their damage quantification verma et al verma et al 2018a proposed a structural response based approach for estimating limiting sea states and operability for a blade lifting task using a floating crane vessel see fig 2 the methodology consists of four interrelated steps 1 global response analysis of the installation system for estimation of the motion of the vessel and lifted blade for various sea states 2 finite element analysis to investigate the impact behaviour of the lifted blade for different impact scenarios 3 assessment of allowable sea states in which characteristic values are compared with strength parameters and finally 4 estimation of the operability of the task for a given offshore site note that one of the sub steps for assessing the allowable impact velocity is to establish a relationship between the damage energy de and impact velocity v i m p in this paper we focus explicitly on the second step addressing the impact behaviour of the blade during installation where emphasis is placed on the investigation of the impact dynamics and damage evaluation using finite element analysis the parameters that determine impact contact scenarios for the lifted blade during installation are identified furthermore for a case in which a lifted blade impacts the tower with its leading edge a numerical modelling technique is implemented in abaqus explicit sensitivity studies for two distinct blade designs and two different impact locations are performed further an attempt is made to understand the motion of blade after the impact which will explicitly indicate the possibility of successive impacts of the blade with surrounding structures finally a relationship between the damage energy de and impact velocity v i m p is established the remainder of the paper proceeds as follows sections 2 and 3 present parameters that determine impact contact scenarios and discuss the material and modelling methods for a case study considered in this work section 4 presents and discusses the results for impact dynamics and damage assessment obtained for blade impact further section 5 concludes the paper followed by section 6 which discusses the limitation and future work 2 contact scenario contact region and numerical modelling method 2 1 parameters determining contact impact scenario damage assessment of a composite structure due to impact loads is not a recent development scientists have been examining this research topic for several years especially in aerospace and defense applications verma et al 2018b mcgugan et al 2035 hayman 2007 however the problem of a lifted offshore wind blade suffering impact during installation tasks because of crane tip and blade motions is a novel research area such a problem would depend on the contact scenario in question as the blade is lifted from the deck during its lifting phase and is finally mated to the hub thus throughout the hoisting phase the blade undergoes various sub phases varying with the height of the lift fig 4 and presents different contact scenarios depending on a few parameters fig 3 lists the parameters that determine the contact impact scenarios during the blade lifting task and the criticality of impact loads these parameters are the a choice of installation vessel b type of assembly method for installing offshore wind components c lifting procedure d pitch and yaw angle of the hoisted blade e lifting phase of the blade and f design details of the blade being installed note that all these identified parameters are applicable to blade installation using both jack up and floating crane vessels further explanation of these parameters can be found in verma et al 2018a in which single blade lifting using offshore crane vessels is discussed among all the parameters the lifting phase and pitch angle of the hoisted blade figs 3 and 4 determine the impact region of the blade for a given contact scenario for example during the full lift off phase of the blade a lifting method with a pitch angle of zero degrees can cause the blade s leading edge to impact the pre assembled turbine tower or crane boom whereas during the mating phase the blade root with guide pin bolts can impact the hub verma et al 2018a b 2019a these are well illustrated in fig 4 one of the most important parameters from a structural point of view that decides the criticality of such impact loads is the design details of the wind turbine blade being installed in practice there are a wide variety of blade designs available of which the conventional and traditional design of blades involves the construction of different subcomponents that are joined together using adhesive connections haselbach 2015 this is referred to as the conventional blade type in this paper fig 5 a another important blade design involves no use of adhesive connections in the blade and the blade is constructed in a single piece this is referred to as the integrated blade type in this paper haselbach 2015 fig 5 b these design details of the blade are an important consideration for impact investigations given that these blades vary structurally and thus exhibit varying impact resistance thus this paper presents the numerical modelling technique and compares damage assessments for the blade based on the above two blade design types this will be explained in more detail later in this section 2 2 description of the chosen contact scenario and contact region considered in the study the present paper considers the impact for one of the most critical stages of blade installation in which the blade is in the full lift off phase and close to the hub height fig 6 a b this sub phase is critical because the blade in this scenario is at its highest position where the largest wind loads and largest floating vessel induced motions are expected moreover it is assumed that the blade is lifted using a horizontal single blade lifting method with zero degree pitch angle and thus the relevant contact scenario to investigate is an impact of the leading edge of the blade with the tower two different blade designs a a conventional blade type with adhesive connections on the leading edge and b an integrated blade type with a sandwich section at the leading edge are considered furthermore the impact investigations are considered at two different regions along the leading edge one close to the area where yoke is attached to the blade 0 44 r r 0 48 a and the other region near the tip of the blade 0 68 r r 0 71 b fig 6 a b the reason for investigating two contact regions along the leading edge is because these regions vary in terms of the composite layup and have non identical thicknesses they thus have varying local strength and stiffness additionally from a dynamic point of view any impact closer to the tip region of the leading edge is a more eccentric impact compared to an impact close to the yoke and thus the impact dynamics are expected to vary for the same impact velocity note that it is the motion analysis of the installation system that determines the impact velocity with which the blade suffers impact see fig 2 however a global analysis of installation systems is beyond the scope of this paper and the impact investigation using finite element analysis is considered for several impact velocities v x ranging from 0 02 to 0 5 m s this range of velocities is reported as predominant while lifting blades using a floating crane vessel verma et al 2018a zhao et al revision submitted 2 3 modelling method in this paper the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine blade bak et al 2013 is considered as the base model for impact investigations the reference blade is originally a shell model is 86 4 m long and has a root diameter of 5 4 m the blade is generic in design and consists of composite and sandwich section along with load bearing spar caps and shear webs furthermore the blade has only an adhesive connection modelled partially at the trailing edge and there are no other adhesive connections either at the leading edge or at the spar cap web assembly joint hence the dtu 10 mw reference blade can be assumed to be an integrated blade type with no specific adhesive joints in this section we present a numerical modelling technique based on shell elements for impact investigation of a blade based on the integrated blade type and conventional blade type however first a brief discussion of the characteristics and limitations of the shell element based impact modelling of composites is presented 2 3 1 characteristics and limitations of shell element based impact modelling for composites in this study the impact scenario involves a full length lifted wind turbine blade impacting a tower with its leading edge it is already known that a composite structure at full scale length has large flexibility compared to its coupon representation and thus the structure stores more elastic energy due to impact verma et al 2018b rajbhandari et al 2002 as a result the entire flexibility and inertia of the structure must be considered during the finite element analysis for this problem the shell element based method is an efficient method note that three broad aspects sutherland 2017 are required to characterise the impact investigation of a composite structure 1 impact responses which describe impact forces impact dynamics and energy evolutions 2 impact resistances which describe the nature of damage and failure modes developed due to impact and finally 3 damage tolerances which describe the residual strength of the composite after the impact in this paper the first two aspects are the main focus of investigation for the blade impact and thus the discussion of the shell element based method is focussed on impact responses and impact resistances together termed as impact behaviour shell elements are generally utilised for modelling large composite structures with many degrees of freedom the structure s thickness dimension is considerably less than its width and length dimensions abrate 2005 barbero 2013 reddy 2004 using the shell element based approach the thickness is defined as a section specific parameter this makes the analysis cheaper hibbitt et al 2016 furthermore one of the critical parameters for numerical modelling of composites is the consideration of inter laminar shear stresses this is because for a composite the inter laminar shear moduli are small compared to the in plane modulus and thus the inter laminar shear stresses are critical thus for investigation of blade impacts the present paper considers a general purpose conventional thick shell element s4r hibbitt et al 2016 from the abaqus library for impact modelling of the blade s4r elements are enforced by mindlin reissner theory hibbitt et al 2016 and can estimate the inter laminar shear stresses using correction factors these elements are 4 noded quadrilateral elements with formulation suitable for analysis including large deformation and strain hibbitt et al 2016 abrate 2005 another important characteristic of the modelling method is the possibility of defining different plies and material orientations through the thickness using section integration point definition this helps in analysing the damaged states of a composite at the ply level but at an efficient computational cost the utilised method also has demerits and can influence the results obtained for the impact response and impact resistance in verma et al 2019b it was found that shell element based method overestimates the impact forces and exhibited a relatively stiffer response compared to solid elements additionally impact modelling of composites based on this technique could not discretely model an important failure mode for a composite sandwich structure i e delamination and debonding of layers however it should be noted that a suitable global local modelling technique such as a submodelling method in which advanced material modelling is possible in the region of impact can be utilised however such an analysis would still require transfer of temporal and spatial displacement fields from a coarser global solution based on shell elements to the driving nodes of the submodel thus the present paper considers the shell element based modelling technique sufficient to be performed at the global scale 2 3 2 numerical modelling method for the integrated blade type the parent blade derived from the dtu repository bak et al 2013 is a shell model with no adhesive connection and thus the blade represents an integrated blade type note that the leading edge which is the impact region in the study is a sandwich section further the blade consists of glass fibre reinforced polymer gfrp plies and is added with balsa material as the core the blade has 100 cross sections with each section divided into 11 regions circumferentially each region is assigned with a specific composite layup plan however the stacking sequence is multi directional and has triaxial biaxial and uniaxial plies these multi directional plies are equivalent representations of the individual unidirectional plies and the properties are derived based on the classical micro mechanics equations and classical laminate theory clt bak et al 2013 the reason for incorporating such smeared properties into the blade is because the objective of the reference model was to analyse the structural performance against operational loading conditions and thus this layup provides ease and convenience however the present multi directional based formulation of layup is not suitable for impact investigation because an explicit understanding of specific plies that can be critically damaged due to impact loads is not possible hence for impact investigation a stacking sequence based on unidirectional nomenclature is required thus the original layup for the reference blade in the impact region is derived in the form of 45 45 02 balsa s fig 7 a b an iterative procedure is developed that calculates multi directional plies back into their parent individual ply definitions while considering parameters such as the thickness of the laminate at the contact region mass of the blade and cog of the blade consistent with the parent definitions furthermore to check that this modified layup in terms of individual plies does not influence the blade s global characteristics eigenvalue analyses are performed and the results are compared to the parent dtu 10 mw blade table 1 presents the eigenfrequencies for different modes and it can be seen that the modified layup yields sound results furthermore a base impact analysis is also performed on the parent and modified blades to compare the local stiffness at the contact region for a case in which the leading edge impacts the tower with an impact velocity of 0 1 m s it can be seen from fig 8 a and b that the contact force histories and kinetic energy evolution histories are in close agreement for the parent and modified blades overall these results validate that the modified layup definition is consistent with the original parent blade layup and can thus be utilised for the impact investigation finally each ply in the layup is defined with three section points and thus 27 section points are associated with the contact regions note that section point 1 corresponds to the outermost ply which represent the shell reference surface whereas section points 13 14 and 15 correspond to the balsa material ply 5 see fig 7 a and b 2 3 3 numerical modelling for the conventional blade type here we present a numerical modelling method for the conventional type blade which is still the most widely used blade type in the industry these blade types have adhesive connections at their leading edges where the impact is considered in this study to model an adhesive connection and then simulate impact induced cracks based on a fracture mechanics approach solids and cohesive brick elements are required at the leading edge this approach will be significantly computationally demanding and thus in this paper we investigate impact damage on the adhesive connections of the blade based on a strength based approach this can be achieved by using a stratification technique in which adhesive material is modelled as a part of the composite layup stacking sequence using shell element based modelling the adhesive and top and bottom composite laminates at the leading edge are defined as different layers in the layup and failure in the adhesive layer is predicted based on a yield based criterion such as drucker prager model the modelling of the adhesive joints based on a stratification technique enforces some assumptions and simplification to the problem the first assumption is that the thickness of bond line at the leading edge is uniform and free of imperfection it is further assumed that the top laminate 45 45 02 s on the suction side is single lapped joint with the bottom laminate 45 45 02 s on the pressure side with an adhesive material the overlap length of the joint is uniformly varying throughout the blade length and is assumed equal to 50 of the length of the nose region 20 40 cm to define the adhesive connection at the leading edge of the blade the nose section xx yy is divided into two regions transition region p and overlap region q the overlap region q ww vv fig 9 a b corresponds to the region of the lap joint and consists of composite laminate as adherends along with the adhesive material on the other hand the transition region of the nose p xx ww yy vv aids in the gradual transitioning of the layup including balsa and prevents any stress concentrations owing to ply drops note that the thickness of the balsa gradually declines from 30 mm at the leading panel lp to 10 mm at the end of transition region and there is no core modelled at the overlap region the final layup for the blade at the leading edge is 45 45 02 s adhesive 45 45 02 s and has a total of 17 plies with a thickness of 10 2 mm at the contact region note that the adhesive used in this study is araldite 2015 and is a ductile adhesive used in the blade industry further the adhesive thickness varies from 0 5 mm to 4 mm throughout the length of the blade and the thickness of the adhesive at contact region a is 1 mm the modelling method also considers adhesive joints at the trailing edge for this purpose standard hexahedral continuum solid elements c3d8r are utilised for modelling the adhesive material and is tie constrained with the aerodynamic shells at the trailing edge fig 10 the adhesive joints in the spar cap regions are modelled in a general manner with a simplified edge to edge joint additionally the strength of the modelled blade based on conventional blade type is found to be satisfactory in terms of global characteristics and is therefore suitable for impact analysis 2 3 4 blade tower impact formulation approach a tower with a diameter of 5 m and a height of 120 m is defined as a rigid body in the analysis and is discretised with 4 node bilinear quadrilateral r3d4 elements fig 11 a reference point is allocated to the rigid tower along with an inertial mass of 450 tons and it is fixed in all degrees of freedom furthermore the blade is given an predefined impact velocity in the x direction v x ranging from 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s there was no other impact velocity defined in other directions fig 11 further no other elements used in the lifting of the blade such as the yoke crane hook or tugger lines are modelled the contact between the tower and blade is defined in the analysis based on a general contact formulation available in abaqus and is defined between the shell reference surface and outer surface of the tower the normal behaviour is defined as hard contact where as the tangential behaviour between the surfaces is defined with penalty algorithm and a value of 0 3 is defined as the friction coefficient the entire blade is discretised with 4 noded quadrilateral shell elements s4rs with a reduced integration scheme the elements in the contact region of the blade for both blade types have refined meshes with element dimension of 0 48 0 48 m2 conversely the remaining region of the blade which contributes mainly to the inertia is discretised with relatively coarser meshes with element size varying from 50 mm to 500 mm this is based on a mesh convergence study performed in verma et al 2017 overall there were in total 97 356 elements present for both blade types note that abaqus explicit is the solver environment in this study because of its efficacy in solving highly non linear problems with complex interactions large rotations and large deformations 3 constitutive material damage models implemented this paper considers impact investigation for two distinct blade type impacting the tower with their leading edge suitable damage models are thus required to model failure modes as different material combinations are present at the leading edge these are explained below 3 1 progressive failure model for the composite ply the 2d hashin failure criterion and the energy based damage evolution law camanho and dávila camanho et al 2003 hashin 1980 are utilised for progressive modelling of damages in the composite ply the damage initiation phase is determined by hashin failure criterion and can be used to estimate fibre and matrix damage modes separately it is given by the following 1 fibre tension σ ˆ 11 0 1 f f t σ ˆ 11 x t 2 κ τ ˆ 12 s l 2 1 2 fibre compression σ ˆ 11 0 2 f f c σ ˆ 11 x c 2 1 3 matrix tension σ ˆ 22 0 3 f m t σ ˆ 22 y t 2 τ ˆ 12 s l 2 1 4 matrix compression σ ˆ 22 0 4 f m c σ ˆ 22 2 s t 2 y c 2 s t 2 1 σ ˆ 22 y c τ ˆ 12 s l 2 1 where in the above equations σ ˆ 11 σ ˆ 22 and τ ˆ 12 are effective stress tensor components of σ ˆ and utilised in the model to determine initiation of the different damage modes mentioned above the effective stress tensor σ ˆ is derived from the true stress σ using the following relation 5 σ ˆ m σ where m is the matrix damage operator and is given by 6 m 1 1 d f 0 0 0 1 1 d m 0 0 0 1 1 d s where d f d m and d s are variables that characterise fibre matrix and shear damage and are derived from damage variables established based on the damage evolution laws in the respective failure modes d i and i ft fc mt mc the material parameters in the above equations x t and x c denote the longitudinal tensile and compressive strength respectively y t and y c denote the transverse tensile and compressive strength respectively and finally s l and s t denote the longitudinal and transverse shear strength of the ply respectively these material parameters are taken from haselbach et al 2016 bak et al 2013 and are mentioned in table 2 κ in equation 1 defines the shear stress dependency to fibre tensile failure f f t and is assumed to be zero in this work damage initiation in any respective ply is indicated when for a particular integration point f f t f f c f m t or f m c reach a value of unity once the damage initiation criterion is met the evolution of the degradation of material stiffness and continuous update of damage variable in all 4 modes are determined by the evolution law this evolution formulation is defined by a relation between stress and displacement together with linearised material softening and calculates the current damage state for the matrix and fibre the damage variable will evolve in the manner represented in fig 12 following a linear material softening behaviour the negative slope from a to c will depend on δ f e q which is as follows 7 δ f e q 2 g i c σ 0 e q where g i c is the critical energy release rate corresponding to the area of triangle oac and is defined for each damage mode moreover based on this damage evolution law the stiffness of the damaged element after the damage initiation point is evaluated using 8 σ c d ε and c d is the damaged material stiffness given by 9 c d 1 d 1 d f e 1 1 d f 1 d m ν

failure criterion considered for the balsa core a sandwich section consists of laminate face sheets and an added core in the middle these sections are used because of the core s low density and aid in the local thickening of the section this significantly improves the buckling resistance of the section without any significant addition of extra weight for estimating impact induced damages on the leading edge of an integrated blade type balsa material in this study is considered as elastic plastic and is defined to have isotropic hardening behaviour the failure criterion is defined by von mises yield stress formulation together with equivalent plastic strain measure this criterion is simple and has been utilised in the literature weijermars 2016 nanami 2014 for modelling the inelastic behaviour of balsa core material during impact on a sandwich section however it should be noted that the balsa is an anisotropic material and a more detailed criterion that includes hydrostatic dependency strain rate effects and anisotropicity must be considered currently there are no built in criteria implemented in abaqus for modelling impact on balsa for shell element based formulations and therefore in this study a simplified criterion based on von mises is used note that the shell element kinematics do not have a constitutive relation for the displacements in the thickness direction and therefore cannot capture crushing and inelastic deformation in the thickness direction of the core however the applied criterion enables the model to capture inelastic deformation at least in the in plane loading directions of the core furthermore the impact velocities in the paper lie within the low velocity impact regime and therefore the chosen failure criterion is considered suitable for modelling impact induced damages the material parameters for the balsa material are taken from previous studies weijermars 2016 nanami 2014 vural and ravichandran and are listed in table 2 3 3 material damage model considered for the adhesive there has been a record of various failure criteria utilised for adhesives in the past but there is no single and unique failure criterion applicable for all cases kadam 2014 xu 2010 yield based failure criteria such as von mises assume yielding to be a pure shear deformation failure and neglect hydrostatic stresses therefore such criteria are not suited to model adhesives xu 2010 given that these materials are sensitive to both hydrostatic stress and shear components the exponential based drucker prager yield criterion which is an extension of the von mises yield criterion kadam 2014 özer and öz 2017 considers the sensitivity of adhesives to hydrostatic stresses and is found to be a sound criterion to model failure in adhesives thus it is utilised in the study the adhesive used in the conventional blade type in the paper is araldite 2015 http www huntsman com 2015 which is a ductile adhesive from huntsman the material data for the adhesive are derived from özer and öz 2017 and are listed in table 3 a very brief explanation of the exponential based drucker prager model is provided below note that the data corresponding to true plastic stress plastic strain under tensile uniaxial directions are used in the model along with tensile type hardening behaviour the yielding in the adhesives is considered with isotropic hardening a general yield function of the exponential based drucker prager model is based on the following fig 13 14 f a q b p p t where p t is defined as the hardening parameters that corresponds to the hydrostatic tension strength of the adhesive and are derived based on different uniaxial tests on adhesives q is the equivalent stress and p is the hydrostatic stress here b is called the exponent parameter and was taken to have a standard value of 2 based on weijermars 2016 additionally a is a material parameter constant with respect to stress considering isotropic hardening and independent of plastic deformations that is given by 15 a 1 3 σ yc σ yt 1 3 m 1 σ yt m σ yc σ yt where m is the hydrostatic sensitive parameter of the adhesive and σ yt and σ yc are the tensile yield stress and compressive yield stress of the adhesive 4 results and discussion the results regarding the impact dynamics energy evolution history and damage assessment for the case in which the wind turbine blade impacts the tower with its leading edge are presented here the impact investigations are performed for two distinct blade types integrated blade type and conventional blade type two impact locations contact regions a and b and different impact velocities in the range of 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s an individual explanation for all the cases is not possible and thus the results are presented for important cases table 4 presents a summary of various cases considered in this section for discussion along with major results case i compares the results regarding impact dynamics for varying impact location contact regions a and b and the discussion is restricted to the integrated blade type and impact velocity of 0 08 m s for the purpose of discussing the energy evolution and damage assessment results both the conventional blade type and integrated blade type are utilised however only impacts at contact region a are considered these are discussed through case ii case iii and case v finally case iv and case vi present the results for all cases of impact velocities and an analytical relation between the damage energy d e and velocity of impact v x is established for both blade types 4 1 description of impact dynamics case i velocity of impact v x 0 08 m s contact regions a and b the impact dynamics including the energy evolution history and motion of the blade after the impact will be discussed here for the case in which the blade impacts the tower with its leading edge two different contact regions i e regions a and b are considered here an impact velocity of 0 08 m s is used for the discussion because no damages developed in the blade for this case and it was thus suitable to explain and compare the impact dynamics 4 1 1 energy evolution history one of the important results for impact dynamics based on an explicit solver based analysis is the validation of the energy conservation principle fig 14 a and 14 b present the evolution of kinetic energy internal energy and total energy for the case of a blade impacting the tower with contact region a and b respectively it can be observed that the total energy etotal of the system in the simulation is constant also at any time step of the simulation the total energy etotal corresponds to the sum of internal energy allie and kinetic energy allke this confirms the theory of energy conservation balance in the system for both the contact regions further it is also checked that the artificial energy developed during the simulation corresponds to less than 2 of the total energy therefore the numerical model is considered suitable and gives stable results from fig 14 a and b it can also be seen that for both the cases the blade comes into contact with the tower at a simulation time of approximately 0 2 s additionally as the impact occurs the internal energy allie is developed in the blade with corresponding decline in the level of kinetic energy allke note that the allie developed due to impact is utilised in general as recoverable strain energy allse damage dissipation energy alldmd and energy dissipated due to plastic deformation allpd in the system fig 14 c and 14 d present the evolution of total internal energy allie and its dissipation into allse allpd and alldmd for both the contact regions a and b respectively it can be seen that allie and allse are similar through out the simulation time and thus completely overlap each other further there is no development of alldmd and allpd in the blade this implies that for both the case of impact with contact region a and b there is no damage developed in the blade at an impact velocity of 0 08 m s hence all the developed internal energy allie dissipates as recoverable elastic strain energy allse note that this a qualitative indication of having no damage in the blade based on energy results a quantitative description is also discussed later where the damage assessment results are presented 4 1 2 kinematics of the lifted blade after the impact the energy evolution histories for the case in which the blade impacts the tower at contact regions a and b for v x 0 08 m s were discussed based on fig 14 a and b it is seen that the etotal 135 j for both the cases are identical given that they correspond to same impact speed 0 08 m s however there is a significant difference in the natures of the evolution of allke and allie for contact regions a and b see fig 14 a and 14 b for the case in which the blade impacts the tower at contact region b there is less dissipation of allke and allie compared to impact of the blade at contact region a further for contact region b the impact of the blade with the tower persists for a small contact duration 0 2 s 0 39 s compared to the contact duration of 0 2 s 0 59 s for impact at contact region a the argument is also confirmed from fig 15 where the contact force time histories are compared for contact regions a and b it is seen that for contact region b the contact duration and contact forces are less compared to the blade impacting the tower at contact region a the reason for the difference in the impact dynamics for the two cases is the eccentricity at the location of impact the impact at contact region b represents a highly eccentric impact e 34 m compared to contact region a which is close to the cog e 11 m see figs 16 and 17 moreover the section of the blade at contact region b is lighter in mass is narrower and has a relatively smaller chord length of approximately 3 46 m therefore once the blade impacts the tower at contact region b as a result of the eccentricity and difference in mass distributions an unbalanced moment is created at the blade root side thus the blade starts to deflect and rebound even before the whole contact impact with the tower completes as a result not much kinetic energy allke is transformed into internal energy allie and a small contact duration is seen a significant difference in the motion of the blade after the impact for the two cases can also be observed from figs 16 and 17 for contact region b the velocity is dominant both at blade root and in the tip region fig 17 and thus a significant rotation of the blade after the impact is observed however for the impact of blade at contact region a the velocity and the motion of the blade is concentrated explicitly at the tip region fig 16 it is also worth mentioning that for the case of blade impacting the tower at contact region a there are vibrations present in the blade after the impact however for the case of blade impacting the tower at contact region b there are more rigid body rotational motions of the blade and less vibrations this is an important observation because the control forces for active tugger lines would be required to dampen these vibrations in the blade if the impact occurs closer to the yoke 4 1 3 quantified description of damage based on the damage model in the current discussion based on energy evolution it is qualitatively argued that there are no damages developed in the blade due to impact a quantified description based on the damage model is presented here fig 18 a and 18 b present the ply wise hashin failure initiation criterion state for impact regions a and b and impact velocity of 0 08 m s it can be observed that none of the plies at these regions had hashin failure initiation criteria equal to one this implies that no damage is initiated in the blade at v x 0 08 m s further the von mises stresses in the balsa layer are below the yield stresses and this result confirms that no plastic strain are induced in the blade either these results also confirms the energy evolution results in which no alldmd or allpd are reported see fig 14 b overall no damage develops in the blade for this case and thus v x 0 08 m s lies below the threshold velocity at which damage initiates 4 2 impact induced damage assessment for integrated and conventional blade types in this section damage assessment results in the blade for higher impact velocities are presented the focus of the discussion is explicitly on the nature of damages obtained for both the blade types hence the results are restricted for the case of blade impacting the tower at contact region a the paper first discusses the damage assessment results for integrated blade type through case ii iii and iv followed by a discussion of the conventional blade type through case v and vi in the next section 4 2 1 integrated blade type case ii velocity of impact v x 0 15 m s in the previous section for the case of a blade impacting the tower with v x 0 08 m s it is found that there are no impact induced damage developed in the blade all the internal energy allie developed due to impact dissipates as recoverable elastic strain energy allse here the damage assessment result is presented for v x 0 15 m s which corresponds to approximately 450 j of impact energy note that the impact energy considered is about 3 2 times compared to the case of v x 0 08 m s fig 19 a presents the energy evolution history for allie allke and etotal it is observed that the total energy of the system remains steady throughout the simulation time and allke and allie correspond to etotal this confirms the theory of energy conservation principle also seen from the figures the blade impacts the tower at a simulation time of approximately 0 16 s and at this moment the internal energy in the blade originates with a corresponding decrease in the kinetic energy allke however unlike for the case of v x 0 08 m s allie and allse are no longer similar throughout the simulation time and do not overlap it is seen from fig 19 b that allie and allse only overlap until a simulation time of 0 18s followed by a small difference in the level of allie and allse afterwards this result can be further confirmed from fig 19 c where the evolution of allie and allse for 0 2 s 0 35 s is magnified and presented note that this difference between allie and allse is utilised in the blade as the damage energy alldmd which is also seen in fig 19 b this result implies that for the case of the blade impacting the tower with v x 0 15 m s not all the internal energy allie developed in the blade is dissipated as recoverable elastic strain energy allse and this indicates damage development in the blade given by alldmd fig 19 d presents a comparison of contact force history with the damage energy developed in the blade it can be seen that the damage energy alldmd follows the curve of the contact force history with maximum damage energy accumulated at the point at which there is the largest contact force note that at the point at which alldmd appears the contact force curve at the first peak exhibits an oscillating nature with a change in the slope this indicates a change in the material stiffness and damage progression in the blade a quantified description of damage assessment is presented in fig 20 in which the damage state of the blade based on hashin s failure initiation criterion is illustrated it can be observed that the status hsnmccrt has reached a value 1 which means that the damage initiation criterion has been met and the laminate has initiated damage in matrix compression the damage status hsnmtcrt hsnfccrt hsnftcrt are less than 1 indicating no damage in other failure modes this discussion is in line with the small damage energy alldmd dissipated due to impact and thus indicates a minor damage in the blade it is also found that the von mises stresses in the core are less than the yield stresses and thus no damage initiation or inelastic deformation is developed in the core this compliments the energy results where no allpd are reported due to impact see fig 19 b overall minor damages are developed in the laminates for this case and thus v x 0 15 m s lies just above the threshold velocity at which damage starts to initiate fig 21 presents the maximum damage energy obtained in the blade due to impact for various impact velocities upto v x 0 16 m s it is seen that until v x 0 14 m s there is no development of damage energy the development of damage energy initiates at 0 14 m s this implies that v x 0 14 m s is the threshold velocity of impact at which damage initiates in the blade note that these values are sensitive to the layup plan and would vary with the specifics of the blade utilised in actual practice here the paper presents these results for impact investigations based on the reference dtu blade and considers the integrated type of blade design note that these parameters aid in deriving response based operational limits and is well captured through shell element based method case iii velocity of impact v x 0 5 m s in the previous cases ply level description of the damage in the blade was not mentioned because the damage obtained was minor here the damage assessment result is presented for v x 0 5 m s which corresponds to an impact energy of greater than 5000 j and the final damage states in the blade is presented at the ply level fig 22 shows the energy evolution history due to blade impact with the tower for v x 0 5 m s the blade contacts the tower at a simulation time of approximately 0 05 s and at this point the internal energy allie is developed in the blade and allke decreases furthermore the energy conservation principle can also be confirmed because the etotal in the system is constant throughout the analysis and allke and allie correspond to etotal at every time step fig 22 also presents the dissipation of developed allie into corresponding allse alldmd and allpd it can be seen that there is a large difference in the curves of allie and allse and a significant development of damage dissipation energy alldmd and plastic deformation energy allpd this indicates large damages and degradation of material stiffness at the contact region the development of allpd in the energy curves also qualitatively indicates the development of inelastic deformation in the core a quantitative description of the damage states of the blade s leading edge due to impact for this case is presented below fig 23 shows the final damage state of the blade due to impact with the tower at the simulation time t 1 s fig 23 a illustrates the envelope view of the damage states it can be clearly seen that the blade has developed damage in matrix compression damagemc matrix tension damagemt and shear damageshr this result implies that the blade damage due to impact are matrix dominated furthermore the von mises stresses in the core 5 99 mpa exceed the yield strength 5 4 mpa which indicates the development of plastic strain and inelastic deformation the discussion is also elaborated at the ply scale in fig 23 b in which the damage states for various plies in the contact region are presented note that the results are presented for the middlemost section point of each ply it can be observed from the figure that most of the plies exhibited damage near the impact side of the laminate i e between plies 1 and 4 with damage further developing in the plies below the core moreover different plies had different regions being damaged which is due to the plies varying orientations and the presence of curvature in the impact region ply 5 corresponds to the balsa material and the plastic strain peeq is also shown in fig 23 b the discussion is in line with the energy evolution history in which the development of allpd was reported see fig 22 overall it is seen that the intralaminar failure modes for the ply and damage state of the balsa is modelled at a ply level based on the modelling technique presented in this paper however one of the most important failure modes which is delamination developing at the ply interfaces are not modelled the research task of modelling delamination in the blade due to impact can be achieved using a suitable global local methods and will be considered in future work however the results obtained for the blade based on shell elements are important and will be utilised case iv dependence of the damage energy de on the impact velocity v x in the previous section the damage assessment results for the integrated blade type were presented for two impact velocities 0 15 m s and 0 5 m s note that the impact investigations are performed for different velocities ranging from 0 02 m s 0 5 m s it was mentioned in section 1 that a dependency of damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x is required to derive structural response based operational limits fig 24 a presents the maximum damage energies alldmd obtained in the blade for different impact velocities ranging from 0 14 m s to 0 5 m s post threshold range which are represented by black dots to establish an analytical relation between damage energies and different impact velocities these points were fitted using first order and second order polynomial fits which are represented by green and red lines respectively see fig 24 a it can be observed that these points are represented better by the second degree polynomial fit red line r square 0 995 and thus the relation d e 735 72 v x 2 107 v x is found to be suitable to describe the dependence of the damage energy de on the impact velocity v x furthermore this dependence of the damage energy d e 735 72 v x 2 107 v x is plotted and compared with the line representing the total energy of impact for all the cases k e 0 5 x mass of the blade x v x 2 see fig 24 b it can be seen that the area under the curve i for the damage energy line is considerably smaller than the total energy of impact this result implies that a very small amount of impact energy approximately 2 5 is dissipated in the blade as damage and most of the energy is dissipated as recoverable elastic strain energy by means of rigid body motions and rotation of the blade after the impact thus it is important to realise that the blade when it impacts the tower while being lifted dissipates only a small fraction of energy as damage and the majority dissipates as recoverable elastic energy 4 2 2 conventional blade type the previous section described the damage assessment results for the case in which the blade modelled based on integrated blade type impacts the tower with its leading edge in this section the results for damage assessment for conventional blade type will be discussed the focus is on the comparing the results with the integrated blade type and thus impact velocity of 0 5 m s case v is explicitly considered this is because for v x 0 5 m s significant damages are obtained in the previous discussions and is thus suitable for comparison finally dependence of damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x is presented for conventional blade type case vi and is compared with integrated blade type case v velocity of impact v x 0 5 m s fig 25 a presents the energy evolution history for allke allie and etotal for the case in which a conventional blade type impacts the tower with v x 0 5 m s the total energy of the system is constant throughout the analysis and allie and allke corresponds to etotal at each time step of the simulation thus the energy conservation principle is satisfied and the model is suitable for impact investigation it can also be seen from the figure that the blade impacts the tower at around 0 05 s of the simulation time and the internal energy allie is developed at this point the contact with the tower persists till 0 6 s and the blade rebounds fig 25 b presents the dissipation of internal energy into allse alldmd and allpd it can be seen that there is large difference between allie and allse which is about 5 times compared to integrated blade type similarly large damage energy alldmd in the blade is developed this observation indicates that the there will be greater damage to a conventional type blade than to an integrated type blade a quantitative description is also presented in fig 26 where an envelope view of the damage state is shown the conventional blade type at the impact region has greater damages over large area based on damagemc damagemt and damageshr status compared to integrated blade type for the same impact velocity the damage state through the thickness in corresponding damagemc damagemt and damageshr is also presented in fig 27 it can be clearly observed that all the plies through the thickness developed a significant damage state this observation is contradictory to what was obtained for integrated blade type where most of the damages were concentrated at the topmost plies and near the impact side fig 25 b also presents the development of allpd which indicates the development of plastic strain in the blade at the contact region this is confirmed quantitatively in fig 26 in which the plastic strain developed in the adhesive region due to the impact is shown note that the level of plastic strain developed is comparatively less than what was obtained for the layer of balsa for the integrated blade type the reason for the difference in the damage resistance for both the blade type is the nature and the thickness of the material present in the impact region the integrated blade type is fused with balsa material at the leading edge and has a thicker section 34 mm therefore due to impact with the tower much of the internal energy developed in the blade was absorbed by the thicker balsa layer and not much damage developed below the core as a result most of the damages was focused around the impact side of the blade along the top plies and less alldmd and a small damage area developed on the other hand the conventional blade type was modelled with adhesive joint at the leading edge the impact region for this blade was relatively thinner 10 2 mm and therefore for the same impact speed most of the energy progressed to all the layers with damage spreading over larger area in the plies case vi dependence of damage energy de on the impact velocity v x previously the dependence of damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x was established and presented for integrated blade type here this dependency is compared with the results based on conventional blade type fig 28 presents the dependence of damage energy for the conventional blade type on the impact velocity as expected the damage energy curve exhibits a stronger trend for conventional blade type compared to the integrated blade type this is due to the large damage energy alldmd developed in the case of conventional blade type furthermore the line representing the total energy of impact is plotted and compared with damage energy curve obtained for both the blade types it can be observed that overall only 7 20 of the impact energy is absorbed as damage in the blade this is in line with the discussion presented before where it was mentioned that most of the energy due to impact dissipated as elastic strain energy by means of rigid body motions as well as rotations of the blade with less energy being dissipated as damage in the blade nevertheless the dissipated energy is sufficient to cause damage in the blade which is mostly concentrated in the impact region locally furthermore these results where majority of impact energy dissipates as rigid body motions highlights the requirement of advanced installation equipments like active tugger lines and guide wires to prevent the risk of successive impact of the blade with nearby structures 5 concluding remarks 1 the current study comprehensively investigated the impact behaviour of an offshore wind turbine blade due to the impact with tower during lifting operation it was mentioned that the lifting operations using floating crane vessels is critical and can cause impact of the lifted blade with surrounding structures this can develop complex damage modes in the blades capable of affecting their structural integrity 2 for planning blade lifting task structural response based operational limits are necessary the methodology from verma et al 2018a includes a step which deals with the finite element analysis of the blade to investigate its impact behaviour for different contact scenarios several parameters which determine impact contact scenario for the lifted blade during installation were identified one of the identified parameters was the design details of the blade being installed and was considered critical from structural perspective 3 an impact scenario was chosen for impact investigation in which the blade during the lift off phase impacts the tower with its leading edge the capability of shell element based numerical modelling technique was explored in abaqus explicit the discussion with respect to the impact dynamics energy evolutions and damage assessment in the blade was made two distinct blade types integrated blade type and conventional blade type two impact locations contact region a and b and different impact velocities in the range of 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s were considered contact region a corresponds to the region of the leading edge close to the yoke 0 44 r r 0 48 whereas the contact region b corresponds to the area near the tip of the blade 0 68 r r 0 71 4 the results for the impact dynamics and motion of the blade after the impact were compared for contact regions a and b it was found that for the case in which the blade impacts the tower at contact region a there was significant development of internal energy along with large contact forces developed in the blade compared to contact region b furthermore the motion of the blade after impact varied for the two different regions rotation of the blade after the impact was dominant for contact region b in contrast to vibration in the blade for contact region a 5 damage assessment results were presented for different impact velocities ranging from 0 02 m s to 0 5 m s for both blade types for the case of an integrated blade type most of the damage was concentrated at the plies lying at the impact side furthermore there was a smaller damage area with most of the energy absorbed by the core of the section on the other hand for the case of the conventional blade type significant damage occurred for all the plies through the thickness with damage spreading over a larger area in the composite plies thus there was significantly greater damage for the same impact energy for the case of the conventional blade type compared to the integrated blade type 6 the dependences of the damage energy d e on the impact velocity v x for both blade types were established and compared with the total energy of impact most of the energy due to impact dissipated as recoverable elastic strain energy by means of rigid body motions and rotation of the blade with only 7 20 being dissipated as damage energy thus designing advanced installation equipment such as active tugger lines and guide wires is necessary to prevent the risk of successive impacts during blade installation 6 limitation and future work in the current work shell element based modelling method is utilised to investigate the impact behaviour of an offshore wind turbine blade due to impact loads during installation the modelling method is found efficient in predicting impact responses and impact dynamics in addition the energy evolution results complimented the discussions for damage assessment quite closely however as mentioned the shell element based method could not capture delaminations in the composite plies and is limited when it comes to predicting the crushing and inelastic deformations of the core in the thickness directions these limitations can affect the damage tolerance aspect of impact investigations in which the residual strength analysis of the damaged blade is investigated therefore global local modelling methods need to be investigated to model delamination and core crushing at the leading edge which have not been captured in this study further the analytical relationship between the damage energy and impact velocity needs to be updated once the energy dissipated due to delamination of the plies is analysed again it will be ideal to perform experiments with impact loads on a real wind turbine blade this will help in the validation of numerical results and in a more explicit understanding of the impact induced failure modes in the blade
