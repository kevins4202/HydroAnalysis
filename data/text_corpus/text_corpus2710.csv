13550,antimony sb is a regulated pollutant that is frequently present at elevated concentrations in natural bodies of water due to natural sources and human activities therefore its purification from fresh water streams is of ultimate importance this study focused on the iron hydroxide fho formation and removal of sb ions from water via ferric chloride fc coagulation the effects of ph contact time concentration temperature and ionic strength is were studied to explore the mechanistic insights into the removal behavior of both sb ions during potable water purification results indicated that the solubility of fho decrease by increasing the ph thus repulsing the oxyanions at alkaline ph decreasing in turn the adsorption capacity of sb v species the influence of contact time and equilibrium sb concentration on fho formation was found to be insignificant the adsorption of sb on fho was well fitted with pseudo first order and langmuir freundlich l f models physical adsorption of sb ions onto fho was identified to be the major mechanism using the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm model thermodynamic parameters δg δh and δs suggested that the sb adsorption process was spontaneously exothermic with increased randomness a more pronounced effect of is on high sb feed was observed with increasing sorption affinities upon enhancing electrolyte concentration the mechanism was further supported by x ray diffraction spectroscopy which revealed the likelihood of inner sphere complexation and physisorption of sb onto fho moreover an involvement of coprecipitation phenomena during growing fho was observed as key phenomena for greater sb iii removal in general the results of current research may provide detailed insights into the adsorption ability of fho and the potential mechanisms responsible for the removal of sb ions during potable water treatment keywords antimony iii v coagulation complexation iron hydroxide adsorption 1 introduction antimony sb is the fourth element of group 5a in the periodic table with outer electron configuration s2p3 pentavalent species sb v in aerobic surface waters and trivalent ions sb iii in underground anoxic conditions are the two most prevalent inorganic forms of sb 1 under natural water ph conditions the sb iii species is stable as sb oh 3 while sb v exists as sb oh 6 at ph 2 72 2 3 the trivalent form of sb is ten fold toxic than its pentavalent species 4 therefore sb compounds and their derivatives are placed on the priority list of the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european union eu 5 in addition korea has presently added sb to the water monitoring list 6 the eu and usepa have established regulatory levels of sb to be 6 μg l and 10 μg l respectively for potable water 7 in pakistan and china the permitted sb level in drinking water is 5 μg l or less 8 9 to reduce potential associated risks it is therefore important to eliminate sb from drinking water supplies while sb levels in unpolluted waters should be as low as 1 0 μg l higher sb contamination has been recorded in water streams near mining and smelting areas 1 10 several methods i e nano filtration 11 adsorption 2 7 and coagulation 3 6 12 15 for sb removal have been well documented owing to unique properties of iron oxide based sorbents their usage is usually preferred by drinking water industry among them hematite magnetite and maghemite are the most commonly used due to exceptional surface charge and redox behavior polymorphism with temperature induced phase transitions and unique magnetism 16 however the drinking water industry still prefers a chemical coagulation method as it is an efficient and economical removal method for several heavy metals ions including sb from aquatic environment 17 compared to aluminum sulphate coagulant ferric chloride fc coagulant has been shown to be effective in remediating sb from drinking water 5 18 it has been demonstrated that the formation of iron hydroxide fho can enhance sb removal efficiencies during fc coagulation 3 6 18 19 our previous studies 3 6 12 15 have also suggested that the influence of coagulation conditions is the determining factor for sb removal from various aquatic environments for example an alkaline ph condition can significantly reduce the formation of fho in sb v suspensions thereby affecting the efficacy of a system 3 6 12 15 moreover remarkable inhibitory effects of anions such as phosphate sulphate and organic matter on sb species sorption affinity for fho have previously been reported 14 15 18 19 in the presence of interfering species a more prominent impact on sb v species than sb iii has been observed during fc coagulation 19 an earlier study has also reported a higher sb adsorption potential of sb species towards hydrous ferric oxide than other iron oxide minerals 20 although previous studies have provided a wide understanding on removal characteristics of sb from water studies on the interactive behavior of fho and sb in different aqueous environments are minimal thus understanding the sorption behavior of sb on fho is critical for water treatment applications previous studies have revealed that adsorption is the primary removal mechanism for sb species during a chemical coagulation process 15 18 19 physical and chemical characteristics of water play an essential role in determining sorption characteristics of sb species onto fho surface for instance the presence of monovalent and divalent cations k mg2 can affect the adsorption potential of sb species onto fho surface 15 it has been demonstrated that cations can effectively compress the electrical double layer of fho in solution thereby destabilizing the formed fho and exposing more surface sites to enhance sb sorption in a solution 21 temperature is also considered as one of influential parameters that can affect the fate mobility and transport mechanisms of contaminants in water 22 however little is known about how the adsorption of sb species differs at certain temperatures in traditional water treatment processes therefore it is imperative to examine isothermal and thermodynamic features of sb sorption onto fho surface it has been demonstrated that sb iii and sb v are mostly removed by hydrophobic and ionic bonding respectively during a conventional water treatment 5 previous studies 15 19 have shown that coprecipitation and adsorption mechanisms can explain the removal of sb iii species under various suboptimal conditions it has been demonstrated that both surface and internal adsorption of sb v onto fho can adequately explain the elimination of pentavalent sb with high sensitivity under the influence of competing ions 19 specifically electrostatic interactions might be involved in the elimination process of sb during a chemical coagulation 9 however there is a lack of research on how the adsorption activity of fho would vary for different types of sb contamination thus it is essential to comprehend the potential adsorption mechanisms of sb ions onto fho under a natural aquatic environment therefore the objective of the current study was to investigate the sorption affinity of sb species on fho during an fc coagulation process effects of various operating conditions i e ph time sb concentrations temperature and ionic strength is were examined fho formation was also monitored under similar experimental conditions the present study also addressed the possible elimination mechanism of sb iii v ions at various matrices depending on reaction conditions finally x ray diffraction xrd spectrum of pristine compounds and sb loaded fho were acquired to elucidate the mechanism involved in sb removal during fc coagulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and stock solution preparation chemical reagents including potassium hexahydro antimonate ksb oh 6 and antimony iii oxide sb2o3 were procured from sigma aldrich usa other chemicals such as iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium nitrate nano3 hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 and sodium hydroxide were purchased from samchun pyeongteak si korea pure water used for sample preparation was obtained via millipore water purification system the coagulant stock solution 100 mm fc was prepared by solubilizing fecl3 6h2o in pure water trivalent and pentavalent sb stock solutions 100 mg l each were prepared by completely solubilizing sb2o3 in 2 m hcl solution and ksb oh 6 in pure water respectively synthetic test samples of sb iii and sb v were then prepared by diluting stock solutions to the desired quantity for each experimental phase by dissolving nano3 in di water a 10 m nano3 stock solution was prepared and its desired volume was spiked in selected sb test samples to acquire adequate ionic strength all stock solutions were freshly prepared and stored in a refrigerator 2 2 experimental conditions and procedure batch coagulation experiments were employed to explore sb iii v sorption differences and fho formation at different ph values 4 10 using fc coagulant 0 1 mm in sb 1 mg l test samples the agitation time was considered 23 min for ph experiments to achieve equilibrium coagulation conditions were selected as fc dose 0 1 mm and ph 7 fho formation and sb sorption affinities were monitored for subsequent experiments kinetic experiments were conducted at temperature of 298 k for sb solutions 1 mg l aliquots were sampled at 3 5 8 13 18 23 28 and 33 min of the reaction adsorption isotherms were determined at room temperature to assess the adsorption affinity of fho for different sb solutions 0 1 10 mg l under equilibrium time in water thermodynamics study was conducted with sb solution 1 mg l at various temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k respectively the impact of is was also analyzed using three different concentrations 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m nano3 for suspensions containing 1 mg l and 15 mg l of sb ions after reacting samples were filtered with 0 45 micron glass filters and sb and fe concentrations were measured the removal and adsorption capacity qe g mol of both sb ions by the fho were calculated as follows 1 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q e c o c e c s 2 r e m o v a l r c o c e c o 100 where co mg l was the initial sb concentration ce mg l was the residual sb concentration of the supernatant and cs mol l as fe was the concentration of fho formed in sb suspension under various aquatic conditions jar test apparatus containing six paddles hana tech south korea was used to perform all experiments these paddles were connected to each other by a gear mechanism they rotated simultaneously at a controlled speed time and room temperature the predetermined quantity of fc coagulant 0 1 mm was added into 100 ml sb test solution followed by fast agitation at 140 rpm for 3 min a small quantity of 100 mm hcl and naoh were spiked to alter the ph of synthetic test solutions using a calibrated ph meter hach usa afterwards slow agitation at 40 rpm was proceeded to reach equilibrium finally quiescent settling for 30 min was done and 50 ml aliquot was obtained through 0 45 μm filter 3 6 12 after the jar test was completed an aliquot was collected into 50 ml sampling vessels and stored in the dark at 277 k for further analysis a jar test procedure was also employed at different temperature range 288 318 k for thermodynamic investigations the temperature 288 k was achieved using 250 ml glass beakers mounted in custom made plexiglass water baths connected to a rte 110 neslab usa refrigerated recirculation chiller other operating temperatures 308 and 318 k were achieved by placing glass beakers onto a hot plate and adjusting the temperature controller to the set temperature the digital thermometer was used to verify temperatures of various solutions after following such procedure experiments were carried out for sb iii v test samples 2 3 modeling of sorption kinetic and isotherm to understand the kinetics of the sorption phenomenon the 0 1 mm fc coagulant was spiked into sb iii v suspensions followed by fast agitation at 140 rpm for 3 min afterwards slow agitation was conducted for 30 min concentrations of fho formed and residual sb iii v were examined at different time intervals the lagergren pseudo first order pfo eq 3 pseudo second order pso eq 4 and elovich eq 5 were applied to model experimental sorption data 7 23 24 non linear forms of these kinetic models are shown below 3 p f o e q u a t i o n q t q e e ln q e k 1 t 4 p s o e q u a t i o n q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 5 e

respectively a g mol was the elovich exponent related to initial adsorption affinity of sb ions k1 1 min k2 mol g min and k3 g mol min were pfo pso rate constant and elovich parameter respectively to further explore mechanistic insights into the adsorption behavior of sb species adsorption isotherm study was conducted using 0 1 mm fc coagulant under neutral ph and sb solutions at different concentrations 0 1 10 mg l the formed fho was considered as the available solid surface for adsorption of sb species during experiments achieved sorption data were used to analyze commonly used models such as the langmuir eq 6 freundlich eq 7 and modified langmuir freundlich l f eq 8 isotherms 25 26 the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm eq 9 model was also fitted to experimental data to explain adsorption characteristics of sb species onto fho during a coagulation process 27 6 l a n g m u i r e q u a t i o n q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 7 f r e u n d l i c h e q u a t i o n q e k f c e 1 n 8 l

in eq 10 10 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where r j mol k is a gas constant and t k represents an absolute temperature another advantage of d r isotherm is that it can determine the mean energy e j mol of the sorption process using eq 11 11 e 1 2 β 2 4 batch adsorption and thermodynamic studies for predicting the viability and efficacy of the sorption process thermodynamics can be useful accordingly change in gibbs free energy δg standard enthalpy change δh and change in entropy δs of the system are useful thermodynamic indicators to explain adsorption processes under various temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k the van t hoff method eqs 12 14 was used to calculated these parameters as shown below 26 28 12 d i s t r i b u t i o n c o e f f i c i e n t k d c o c e c e 1 c s 13 g i b b s f r e e e n e

versus t plot provides δh intercept and δs slope values using eq 14 2 5 analytical methods retained quantity of sb and fe ions were determined via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes usa structural characteristics of pristine compounds as well as composite flocs were analyzed using an x ray diffractometer rigaku d max c iii japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ph on sb sorption the sorption of metals from fresh water stream is strongly influenced by the suspension ph because of variation in characteristics of metal ion accordingly the effect of ph on fho formation and sb sorption was monitored for a wide ph range during fc coagulation results are shown in fig 1 it was observed that around 90 sorption of both sb ions was found between ph 6 8 showing good sorption affinity towards fho under these conditions the fho formation in sb v suspension was significantly inhibited under acidic and alkaline aqueous environments this might be ascribed to the complexation of anionic sb v species sb oh 6 to fho via chemical bond and the role of surface interaction energy in breaking the crystal lattice of fho thus diffusing fe species into the solution 9 20 29 in such a view sb v sorption onto fho was seriously interrupted at lower 4 0 and higher 9 10 ph values these findings might be due to the inhibitory competitive behavior of h with sb at acidic environments and the role of fho dissolution and electrostatic repulsion between sb oh 6 and fe oh 4 at alkaline state in suspensions 6 12 considering the higher efficacy of fc coagulation for fho formation and sb sorption subsequent experimentation only focused on neutral suspension ph 3 2 influence of reaction time and sorption kinetics the sorption rate is significant for the rational design of an adsorption process to examine the influence of reaction time on sb elimination the sorption affinity and the kinetic model s applicability were assessed for both sb species results are presented in fig 2 the presence of both sb species had insignificant impact on fho formation under different kinetic environment see supplementary information si fig s1 as presented in fig 2 higher sb iii sorption affinity was observed which might be ascribed to higher intrinsic surface complexation constant of log k at 5 7 for sb iii fho complex compared to 3 1 for sb v fho complex 18 our previous studies 3 6 have also indicated an enhanced sb iii elimination as compared to sb v by fc with a neutral water media in addition the adsorption of both sb ions onto fho surface was found to be a rapid process the maximum sb iii v sorption affinity was achieved within the first 18 min 3 min coagulation followed by 15 min flocculation rapid agitation at the initial phase might have contributed to the anomalous incorporation or internal adsorption of sb ions into the growing fho 19 a slow agitation allows the sb species to interact with potential fho active sites to enhance the surface adsorption phenomena 9 such observations are correlated with a recent research 15 revealing that the size of fho flocs is increased four fold during flocculation at an equilibrium condition overall sb iii and sb v sorption affinities of 9 249 and 8 984 g mol respectively were reached the adsorption kinetics demonstrate the rate of sb attachment on the fho surface under equilibrium conditions it plays a fundamental role in determining the suitable operating parameters for commercially viable adsorption process these kinetic features are critical in understanding the adsorption mechanisms involved in sequestration of metal ions by fho from water 7 kinetic specifications and the fitting of sb sorption by pfo pso and elovich models are shown in table 1 and fig 2 as indicated by regression determination coefficient r2 values the pfo model showed the best fitting for both sb iii r2 0 9991 and sb v r2 0 9877 indicating the involvement of a physisorption mechanism on the contrary r2 values of pso and elovich models also showed possibility of chemisorption and heterosphere diffusion reactions between sb species and fho surface 7 noteworthy the k3 value in the elovich equation indicating the sorption rate of sb was relative to the dispersion rate 30 with a greater value for sb v as compared to sb iii ions onto fho surface however the a value in elovich equation suggested a 2 fold greater initial adsorption affinity of sb iii onto fho supporting the preferential removal of sb iii from solution during sweep coagulation phase in general kinetic models were helpful in predicting the adsorption behavior of sb species on fho during coagulation 3 3 influence of initial solution concentration and sorption isotherms the sorption isotherm indicates the quantity of adsorbate molecules in water and the amount of adsorbent medium at equilibrium environments an insignificant effect on fho formation was found in various sb iii v suspensions see si fig s2 to further explore the extent of adsorption affinity and mechanistic insights into sb removal by fc coagulation sorption isotherm experiments were conducted under equilibrium conditions and room temperature as presented in fig 3 several well known models langmuir freundlich l f and d r were used to evaluate the sorption process table 2 shows the obtained isotherm model parameters as per langmuir the trivalent and pentavalent sb species presented r2 values of 0 983 and 0 994 respectively confirming the validity of the langmuir model for sb uptake by fho during coagulation sb iii ions showed greater sorption ability 110 966 g mol than sb v species 32 754 g mol similarly an earlier study 31 has also indicated a high sb iii sorption capacity by ferrihydrite as an adsorbent the separation factor rl is an indicator of favorability of reaction in langmuir model rl unitless parameter can be expressed as below 15 s e p a r a t i o n f a c t o r r l 1 1 k l c o where kl l mg is the langmuir constant and co mg l is the maximum initial sb iii v ions concentration the sorption process might be linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 depending on the rl value 26 values of rl for trivalent and pentavalent sb were 0 136 and 0 025 respectively further confirming the favorability of the langmuir sorption the langmuir isotherm model ensures the uniformity of the fho it also ensures the formation of a homogeneous layer of toxicants for experimental data during the sorption process 32 for the freundlich isotherm r2 values for trivalent and pentavalent sb species were 0 990 and 0 852 respectively indicating the potential of sb iii v sorption by fho in addition the higher n value for sb v uptake 3 402 showed its less sorption ability than sb iii ions 1 581 on heterogeneous fho surface sites since these n values were in the range of 1 10 reflecting that both pollutants had good sorption properties 26 to further examine adsorption characteristics of sb species l f isotherms were also drawn using experimental data r2 values for sb iii and sb v ions were 0 990 and 0 995 respectively showing a promising analytical approach for simulating both langmuir and freundlich type adsorption effects as per model equation when kl f reached a low value the denominator in eq 8 approached unity and the l f isotherm equation reduced to a freundlich type function 25 as shown in table 2 the low kl f value calculated for sb iii ions confirmed multilayer formation onto heterogeneous active sites of fho during a coagulation process 7 in contrast higher kl f values for sb v ions at 5 026 l mg indicated homogeneous adsorption characteristics of these species on fho considering r2 values and the closeness between experimental and modeled qe the l f model well summarized the sorption activity of sb iii v ions for the d r isotherm model r2 values for trivalent and pentavalent sb ions were 0 946 and 0 985 respectively indicating good sorption characteristics therefore d r isotherm was appropriate to explain the adsorption nature of both sb species on fho 33 in the d r model the magnitude of e is helpful in distinguishing between physical 8 kj mol and chemical 8 16 kj mol sorption processes 34 as shown in table 2 calculated values of e for trivalent and pentavalent sb were 3 684 and 4 298 kj mol respectively therefore the sorption of both sb ions by fho appears to be dominated by the physisorption mechanism 3 4 effect of solution temperature and thermodynamic properties the solution temperature plays vital role in the bonding and sorption phenomenon fig 4 a presented the influence of water temperature on fho formation and removal of both sb ions by fc coagulation the decrease in sb iii removal efficiency at higher temperature is likely to be due to less fho formation in suspension containing sb iii species such observation may be ascribed to the increase in solubility of fe ions and less adsorption affinity of sb iii species on fho at higher temperatures 35 moreover heating sb suspensions might have decreased the bond strength between the sb and fe species due to increased thermal energy to further elucidate the characteristic of the sorption phenomenon and the δe during heterogeneous environment δg δh and δs were calculated fig 4b and table 3 shows the determined van t hoff s plot and thermodynamic parameters negative δg values at temperature 288 308 k indicated that the sorption of both sb species on fho was a spontaneous process the gradual increase in δg value with the temperature suggests that the rise in temperature has a detrimental effect on the sorption affinity of sb on fho 36 negative values of δh also illustrated that the sorption process was an exothermic reaction 37 a previous study 38 has indicated that absolute δh values in the range of 0 8 kj mol 8 60 kj mol and 60 kj mol indicate physical adsorption physical adsorption and complexation and chemical adsorption respectively in this study absolute δh values for trivalent and pentavalent sb were 35 09 and 22 171 kj mol respectively indicating multiple binding mechanisms including physisorption and complexation of sb on fho surface moreover the positive δs value showed that the randomness of the heterogeneous system increased during the sorption process in general thermodynamic parameters could help us understand the adsorption reactions of fho with both sb species during the coagulation process 3 5 influence of is on sb sorption fig 5 indicates fho formation and sorption of sb iii and sb v as a function of is in various suspensions as shown in fig 5a suspensions containing less sb concentrations had insignificant influence on fho formation showing better sb removal with increasing of is such behavior suggested the existence of inner sphere surface complexes between fho and both sb iii v species 39 the explanation why the sb showed higher adsorption on fho under high is was most likely to be due to high counter ions activity that could compensate surface charges developed due to the deposition of ions on the solid surface 40 to further evaluate the influence of is similar experiments were conducted with suspensions containing higher sb iii v concentration i e 15 mg l as shown in fig 5b increasing the concentration of is from 0 001 m to 0 1 m had a negligible impact on fho formation and sb iii removal process indicating the formation of inner sphere complexes of these ions on the fho surface 39 however the 4 15 fho formation was significantly inhibited in the presence of higher concentration of sb v with low is 0 001 m upon increasing is to 0 01 m and 0 1 m the fho formation enhanced to 64 18 and 100 respectively the main reason why pentavalent sb elimination was also enhanced under high is might be attributable to enhanced fho formation and increased ion pair formation with na on fho surface in solution 41 42 it may be inferred from these findings that sorption of both sb ions on fho might be more probable at high is conditions suggesting the possibility of inner sphere complexes 3 6 relationship between sb iii v uptake index and fc dose in order to evaluate the potential of fho for lowering sb within maximum permissible contamination level mcl further experiments were conducted by increasing fc dose from 0 1 mm to 0 3 mm with 1 mg l initial sb iii v concentration and neutral ph condition fig 6 therefore the added fc dose and the main influencing parameters responsible for sb removal was evaluated according to their potential to decrease residual sb concentration below mcl i e 5 μg l along with their adsorption capacity i e qmcl or q5 g mol referred as uptake index henceforth the obtained sorption data were fitted with langmuir freundlich isotherm model and showed that fho can achieve mcl with adsorption capacities i e qmcl sb iii 2 972 g mol sb v 3 806 g mol and required fc dose can be calculated as follows fc dose mm 1000 5 μg l 1 103 2 972 g sb iii mol fe iii 0 335 mm fc dose mm 1000 5 μg l 1 103 3 806 g sb v mol fe iii 0 261 mm these results indicated that 0 335 mm fc dose will be required to decrease the concentration of 1 mg l sb iii to permissible level in comparison a relatively lower fc dose i e 0 261 mm will be needed to achieve regulation limit in water bodies containing 1 mg l sb v concentration in general these results indicated that the fc doses within these range will be effective for remediation of sb iii v species 1 mg l with treatment system capable to lower sb levels within mcl limits similar to these results previous research 43 44 also indicated the relative importance of uptake index for sb iii and sb v species for lowering their concentration within the regulation limits in addition the fho formation was also monitored for relevant bench scale experiments with results indicating increase in fho production upon increasing fc dose during coagulation process see si fig s3 3 7 removal mechanism of sb by fho to obtain mechanistic insights into sb removal behavior on fho xrd patterns of pristine compounds i e ksb oh 6 sb2o3 and fecl3 6h2o and sb iii sb v loaded fho were determined as shown in fig s4 fridge patterns can be indexed to 111 222 400 331 622 and 444 planes of pure cubic crystalline phase of sb2o3 45 diffraction peaks at 111 311 222 400 511 440 and 531 planes indicated a conventional hexahedron evenly distributed structure of ksb oh 6 46 moreover characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 15 17 19 30 and 33 were attributed to pristine fecl3 6h2o powder 47 it was noteworthy that no impurities were detected from the xrd pattern of pristine compounds used in this study precipitation coprecipitation and adsorption are recognized as governing removal mechanisms during a coagulation process as presented in fig 7 the precipitation phenomenon could be ignored as xrd analysis of composite flocs did not show any diffraction peak for such phase after fc coagulation in this study as evidenced by various solution chemistries below above optimal ph high temperature low is water quality varied markedly with higher sb iii v remaining at higher initial loadings therefore both water characteristics and xrd patterns indicated the insignificant role of precipitation mechanism in sb removal using fc coagulant after eliminating the possibility of precipitation our previous study 15 and xrd patterns observed in the current study showed the involvement of coprecipitation and adsorption mechanisms in sb removal the diffraction peak observed at 2θ 30 in sb iii loaded fho indicated an anomalous replacement of sb iii species in growing fho having nano crystalline structure containing 80 octahedral and 20 tetrahedral coordinated iron during fc coagulation process 48 such coprecipitation phenomena may be attributable to the relatively large ionic radius of sb iii than fe iii species resulting in inner crystal structure distortion responsible for higher sb iii removal than sb v species 19 it was noteworthy that no such peak was observed in sb v loaded fho diffraction pattern while fridge pattern at 2θ 34 was observed after interaction of both sb species with fho such observation was helpful in elucidating the role of internal and surface adsorption of sb iii v by fho in the water treatment process variations in solution chemistry parameters were mainly responsible for determining such adsorption features of both sb species by fho the internal adsorption refers to the incorporation of sb species into the inner surface of fho via crystal disruptions and inner surface complexation followed by surface adsorption 49 thus adsorption mechanisms may also explain the decreased sb v uptake under unfavorable aquatic conditions and coprecipitation pathway for efficient remediation of sb iii ions under similar water environments in general xrd analysis revealed the formation of inner sphere complexes and surface adsorption of both sb iii v species by fho during fc coagulation process based on experimental results modeling approach and xrd analysis it may be inferred that combination of coprecipitation multilayer physisorption and inner sphere complexation play an important role in sb iii removal in contrast monolayer physisorption and inner sphere complexation of sb v with fho might have resulted in removal of these ions from the solution 3 8 implications of sb mobility and remediation knowledge about the removal behavior of sb from liquid streams where aquatic conditions determine the availability of active sorption sites of adsorbent is vital to predict their mobilization in an aquatic system present research may provide some understanding about the stability of fho and corresponding adsorptive removal of sb iii v species under different aquatic conditions which could limit the release of contaminants and reduce the associated potential risk our findings suggest that sb iii is less likely to be present in water due to stronger affinity of fho under reducing conditions the sb v species may be easily retained in liquid streams due to its lower affinity specifically under a basic environment however the optimum sb v sorption can be achieved at neutral ph conditions in addition temperature has a significant influence on the efficiency of sb removal with low temperatures functioning better than high temperatures thus increasing ph at low temperatures in an environmental water system has the benefit of eliminating trivalent species from water additionally given that trivalent sb species are more toxic than pentavalent ones this treatment strategy could minimize possible toxicological risks to humans current study emphasizes the significant influence of redox sb species on the stability of fho and their adsorption behavior in water treatment processes 4 conclusions in this study fho formation and sb iii v removal from fresh water bodies were investigated and sorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics were discussed extensively rapid sb sorption reaction by fho depends on solution ph an alkaline ph condition has inhibitory effect on fho formation thereby increasing sb v mobility an insignificant impact on fho formation was observed under other experimental conditions i e contact time sb loading and temperature the sorption of sb by fho strongly followed the pseudo first order kinetic model in which physical reaction dominated at the initial step followed by pore diffusion and deposition in the final phase the determined model parameters were well fitted with langmuir for pentavalent sb species and freundlich for trivalent sb ions as indicated by the langmuir freundlich isotherm model furthermore the d r isotherm was useful in determining the physical adsorption nature of both sb ions on fho surface thermodynamic values of the adsorption phenomenon suggest that the reaction may be spontaneously exothermic with increased randomness at higher operating temperatures greater sb iii v removal was observed at higher ionic strength conditions particularly due to enhanced fho formation in solution in order to identify mechanisms involved in sb removal xrd analysis was conducted which confirmed the combination of inner sphere complexation and physical sorption of both sb iii v species by fho during fc coagulation besides the coprecipitation phenomenon was identified as an additional mechanism responsible for efficient sb iii removal from the solution in general it was confirmed that main removal mechanisms responsible for the absorption of sb into iron sorbents

supported by x ray diffraction spectroscopy which revealed the likelihood of inner sphere complexation and physisorption of sb onto fho moreover an involvement of coprecipitation phenomena during growing fho was observed as key phenomena for greater sb iii removal in general the results of current research may provide detailed insights into the adsorption ability of fho and the potential mechanisms responsible for the removal of sb ions during potable water treatment keywords antimony iii v coagulation complexation iron hydroxide adsorption 1 introduction antimony sb is the fourth element of group 5a in the periodic table with outer electron configuration s2p3 pentavalent species sb v in aerobic surface waters and trivalent ions sb iii in underground anoxic conditions are the two most prevalent inorganic forms of sb 1 under natural water ph conditions the sb iii species is stable as sb oh 3 while sb v exists as sb oh 6 at ph 2 72 2 3 the trivalent form of sb is ten fold toxic than its pentavalent species 4 therefore sb compounds and their derivatives are placed on the priority list of the united states environmental protection agency usepa and the european union eu 5 in addition korea has presently added sb to the water monitoring list 6 the eu and usepa have established regulatory levels of sb to be 6 μg l and 10 μg l respectively for potable water 7 in pakistan and china the permitted sb level in drinking water is 5 μg l or less 8 9 to reduce potential associated risks it is therefore important to eliminate sb from drinking water supplies while sb levels in unpolluted waters should be as low as 1 0 μg l higher sb contamination has been recorded in water streams near mining and smelting areas 1 10 several methods i e nano filtration 11 adsorption 2 7 and coagulation 3 6 12 15 for sb removal have been well documented owing to unique properties of iron oxide based sorbents their usage is usually preferred by drinking water industry among them hematite magnetite and maghemite are the most commonly used due to exceptional surface charge and redox behavior polymorphism with temperature induced phase transitions and unique magnetism 16 however the drinking water industry still prefers a chemical coagulation method as it is an efficient and economical removal method for several heavy metals ions including sb from aquatic environment 17 compared to aluminum sulphate coagulant ferric chloride fc coagulant has been shown to be effective in remediating sb from drinking water 5 18 it has been demonstrated that the formation of iron hydroxide fho can enhance sb removal efficiencies during fc coagulation 3 6 18 19 our previous studies 3 6 12 15 have also suggested that the influence of coagulation conditions is the determining factor for sb removal from various aquatic environments for example an alkaline ph condition can significantly reduce the formation of fho in sb v suspensions thereby affecting the efficacy of a system 3 6 12 15 moreover remarkable inhibitory effects of anions such as phosphate sulphate and organic matter on sb species sorption affinity for fho have previously been reported 14 15 18 19 in the presence of interfering species a more prominent impact on sb v species than sb iii has been observed during fc coagulation 19 an earlier study has also reported a higher sb adsorption potential of sb species towards hydrous ferric oxide than other iron oxide minerals 20 although previous studies have provided a wide understanding on removal characteristics of sb from water studies on the interactive behavior of fho and sb in different aqueous environments are minimal thus understanding the sorption behavior of sb on fho is critical for water treatment applications previous studies have revealed that adsorption is the primary removal mechanism for sb species during a chemical coagulation process 15 18 19 physical and chemical characteristics of water play an essential role in determining sorption characteristics of sb species onto fho surface for instance the presence of monovalent and divalent cations k mg2 can affect the adsorption potential of sb species onto fho surface 15 it has been demonstrated that cations can effectively compress the electrical double layer of fho in solution thereby destabilizing the formed fho and exposing more surface sites to enhance sb sorption in a solution 21 temperature is also considered as one of influential parameters that can affect the fate mobility and transport mechanisms of contaminants in water 22 however little is known about how the adsorption of sb species differs at certain temperatures in traditional water treatment processes therefore it is imperative to examine isothermal and thermodynamic features of sb sorption onto fho surface it has been demonstrated that sb iii and sb v are mostly removed by hydrophobic and ionic bonding respectively during a conventional water treatment 5 previous studies 15 19 have shown that coprecipitation and adsorption mechanisms can explain the removal of sb iii species under various suboptimal conditions it has been demonstrated that both surface and internal adsorption of sb v onto fho can adequately explain the elimination of pentavalent sb with high sensitivity under the influence of competing ions 19 specifically electrostatic interactions might be involved in the elimination process of sb during a chemical coagulation 9 however there is a lack of research on how the adsorption activity of fho would vary for different types of sb contamination thus it is essential to comprehend the potential adsorption mechanisms of sb ions onto fho under a natural aquatic environment therefore the objective of the current study was to investigate the sorption affinity of sb species on fho during an fc coagulation process effects of various operating conditions i e ph time sb concentrations temperature and ionic strength is were examined fho formation was also monitored under similar experimental conditions the present study also addressed the possible elimination mechanism of sb iii v ions at various matrices depending on reaction conditions finally x ray diffraction xrd spectrum of pristine compounds and sb loaded fho were acquired to elucidate the mechanism involved in sb removal during fc coagulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and stock solution preparation chemical reagents including potassium hexahydro antimonate ksb oh 6 and antimony iii oxide sb2o3 were procured from sigma aldrich usa other chemicals such as iron iii chloride hexahydrate fecl3 6h2o sodium nitrate nano3 hydrochloric acid hcl nitric acid hno3 and sodium hydroxide were purchased from samchun pyeongteak si korea pure water used for sample preparation was obtained via millipore water purification system the coagulant stock solution 100 mm fc was prepared by solubilizing fecl3 6h2o in pure water trivalent and pentavalent sb stock solutions 100 mg l each were prepared by completely solubilizing sb2o3 in 2 m hcl solution and ksb oh 6 in pure water respectively synthetic test samples of sb iii and sb v were then prepared by diluting stock solutions to the desired quantity for each experimental phase by dissolving nano3 in di water a 10 m nano3 stock solution was prepared and its desired volume was spiked in selected sb test samples to acquire adequate ionic strength all stock solutions were freshly prepared and stored in a refrigerator 2 2 experimental conditions and procedure batch coagulation experiments were employed to explore sb iii v sorption differences and fho formation at different ph values 4 10 using fc coagulant 0 1 mm in sb 1 mg l test samples the agitation time was considered 23 min for ph experiments to achieve equilibrium coagulation conditions were selected as fc dose 0 1 mm and ph 7 fho formation and sb sorption affinities were monitored for subsequent experiments kinetic experiments were conducted at temperature of 298 k for sb solutions 1 mg l aliquots were sampled at 3 5 8 13 18 23 28 and 33 min of the reaction adsorption isotherms were determined at room temperature to assess the adsorption affinity of fho for different sb solutions 0 1 10 mg l under equilibrium time in water thermodynamics study was conducted with sb solution 1 mg l at various temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k respectively the impact of is was also analyzed using three different concentrations 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 m nano3 for suspensions containing 1 mg l and 15 mg l of sb ions after reacting samples were filtered with 0 45 micron glass filters and sb and fe concentrations were measured the removal and adsorption capacity qe g mol of both sb ions by the fho were calculated as follows 1 a d s o r p t i o n c a p a c i t y q e c o c e c s 2 r e m o v a l r c o c e c o 100 where co mg l was the initial sb concentration ce mg l was the residual sb concentration of the supernatant and cs mol l as fe was the concentration of fho formed in sb suspension under various aquatic conditions jar test apparatus containing six paddles hana tech south korea was used to perform all experiments these paddles were connected to each other by a gear mechanism they rotated simultaneously at a controlled speed time and room temperature the predetermined quantity of fc coagulant 0 1 mm was added into 100 ml sb test solution followed by fast agitation at 140 rpm for 3 min a small quantity of 100 mm hcl and naoh were spiked to alter the ph of synthetic test solutions using a calibrated ph meter hach usa afterwards slow agitation at 40 rpm was proceeded to reach equilibrium finally quiescent settling for 30 min was done and 50 ml aliquot was obtained through 0 45 μm filter 3 6 12 after the jar test was completed an aliquot was collected into 50 ml sampling vessels and stored in the dark at 277 k for further analysis a jar test procedure was also employed at different temperature range 288 318 k for thermodynamic investigations the temperature 288 k was achieved using 250 ml glass beakers mounted in custom made plexiglass water baths connected to a rte 110 neslab usa refrigerated recirculation chiller other operating temperatures 308 and 318 k were achieved by placing glass beakers onto a hot plate and adjusting the temperature controller to the set temperature the digital thermometer was used to verify temperatures of various solutions after following such procedure experiments were carried out for sb iii v test samples 2 3 modeling of sorption kinetic and isotherm to understand the kinetics of the sorption phenomenon the 0 1 mm fc coagulant was spiked into sb iii v suspensions followed by fast agitation at 140 rpm for 3 min afterwards slow agitation was conducted for 30 min concentrations of fho formed and residual sb iii v were examined at different time intervals the lagergren pseudo first order pfo eq 3 pseudo second order pso eq 4 and elovich eq 5 were applied to model experimental sorption data 7 23 24 non linear forms of these kinetic models are shown below 3 p f o e q u a t i o n q t q e e ln q e k 1 t 4 p s o e q u a t i o n q t k 2 q e 2 t 1 k 2 q e t 5 e

respectively a g mol was the elovich exponent related to initial adsorption affinity of sb ions k1 1 min k2 mol g min and k3 g mol min were pfo pso rate constant and elovich parameter respectively to further explore mechanistic insights into the adsorption behavior of sb species adsorption isotherm study was conducted using 0 1 mm fc coagulant under neutral ph and sb solutions at different concentrations 0 1 10 mg l the formed fho was considered as the available solid surface for adsorption of sb species during experiments achieved sorption data were used to analyze commonly used models such as the langmuir eq 6 freundlich eq 7 and modified langmuir freundlich l f eq 8 isotherms 25 26 the dubinin radushkevich d r isotherm eq 9 model was also fitted to experimental data to explain adsorption characteristics of sb species onto fho during a coagulation process 27 6 l a n g m u i r e q u a t i o n q e q m k l c e 1 k l c e 7 f r e u n d l i c h e q u a t i o n q e k f c e 1 n 8 l

in eq 10 10 ε r t l n 1 1 c e where r j mol k is a gas constant and t k represents an absolute temperature another advantage of d r isotherm is that it can determine the mean energy e j mol of the sorption process using eq 11 11 e 1 2 β 2 4 batch adsorption and thermodynamic studies for predicting the viability and efficacy of the sorption process thermodynamics can be useful accordingly change in gibbs free energy δg standard enthalpy change δh and change in entropy δs of the system are useful thermodynamic indicators to explain adsorption processes under various temperatures 288 298 308

versus t plot provides δh intercept and δs slope values using eq 14 2 5 analytical methods retained quantity of sb and fe ions were determined via inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes usa structural characteristics of pristine compounds as well as composite flocs were analyzed using an x ray diffractometer rigaku d max c iii japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of ph on sb sorption the sorption of metals from fresh water stream is strongly influenced by the suspension ph because of variation in characteristics of metal ion accordingly the effect of ph on fho formation and sb sorption was monitored for a wide ph range during fc coagulation results are shown in fig 1 it was observed that around 90 sorption of both sb ions was found between ph 6 8 showing good sorption affinity towards fho under these conditions the fho formation in sb v suspension was significantly inhibited under acidic and alkaline aqueous environments this might be ascribed to the complexation of anionic sb v species sb oh 6 to fho via chemical bond and the role of surface interaction energy in breaking the crystal lattice of fho thus diffusing fe species into the solution 9 20 29 in such a view sb v sorption onto fho was seriously interrupted at lower 4 0 and higher 9 10 ph values these findings might be due to the inhibitory competitive behavior of h with sb at acidic environments and the role of fho dissolution and electrostatic repulsion between sb oh 6 and fe oh 4 at alkaline state in suspensions 6 12 considering the higher efficacy of fc coagulation for fho formation and sb sorption subsequent experimentation only focused on neutral suspension ph 3 2 influence of reaction time and sorption kinetics the sorption rate is significant for the rational design of an adsorption process to examine the influence of reaction time on sb elimination the sorption affinity and the kinetic model s applicability were assessed for both sb species results are presented in fig 2 the presence of both sb species had insignificant impact on fho formation under different kinetic environment see supplementary information si fig s1 as presented in fig 2 higher sb iii sorption affinity was observed which might be ascribed to higher intrinsic surface complexation constant of log k at 5 7 for sb iii fho complex compared to 3 1 for sb v fho complex 18 our previous studies 3 6 have also indicated an enhanced sb iii elimination as compared to sb v by fc with a neutral water media in addition the adsorption of both sb ions onto fho surface was found to be a rapid process the maximum sb iii v sorption affinity was achieved within the first 18 min 3 min coagulation followed by 15 min flocculation rapid agitation at the initial phase might have contributed to the anomalous incorporation or internal adsorption of sb ions into the growing fho 19 a slow agitation allows the sb species to interact with potential fho active sites to enhance the surface adsorption phenomena 9 such observations are correlated with a recent research 15 revealing that the size of fho flocs is increased four fold during flocculation at an equilibrium condition overall sb iii and sb v sorption affinities of 9 249 and 8 984 g mol respectively were reached the adsorption kinetics demonstrate the rate of sb attachment on the fho surface under equilibrium conditions it plays a fundamental role in determining the suitable operating parameters for commercially viable adsorption process these kinetic features are critical in understanding the adsorption mechanisms involved in sequestration of metal ions by fho from water 7 kinetic specifications and the fitting of sb sorption by pfo pso and elovich models are shown in table 1 and fig 2 as indicated by regression determination coefficient r2 values the pfo model showed the best fitting for both sb iii r2 0 9991 and sb v r2 0 9877 indicating the involvement of a physisorption mechanism on the contrary r2 values of pso and elovich models also showed possibility of chemisorption and heterosphere diffusion reactions between sb species and fho surface 7 noteworthy the k3 value in the elovich equation indicating the sorption rate of sb was relative to the dispersion rate 30 with a greater value for sb v as compared to sb iii ions onto fho surface however the a value in elovich equation suggested a 2 fold greater initial adsorption affinity of sb iii onto fho supporting the preferential removal of sb iii from solution during sweep coagulation phase in general kinetic models were helpful in predicting the adsorption behavior of sb species on fho during coagulation 3 3 influence of initial solution concentration and sorption isotherms the sorption isotherm indicates the quantity of adsorbate molecules in water and the amount of adsorbent medium at equilibrium environments an insignificant effect on fho formation was found in various sb iii v suspensions see si fig s2 to further explore the extent of adsorption affinity and mechanistic insights into sb removal by fc coagulation sorption isotherm experiments were conducted under equilibrium conditions and room temperature as presented in fig 3 several well known models langmuir freundlich l f and d r were used to evaluate the sorption process table 2 shows the obtained isotherm model parameters as per langmuir the trivalent and pentavalent sb species presented r2 values of 0 983 and 0 994 respectively confirming the validity of the langmuir model for sb uptake by fho during coagulation sb iii ions showed greater sorption ability 110 966 g mol than sb v species 32 754 g mol similarly an earlier study 31 has also indicated a high sb iii sorption capacity by ferrihydrite as an adsorbent the separation factor rl is an indicator of favorability of reaction in langmuir model rl unitless parameter can be expressed as below 15 s e p a r a t i o n f a c t o r r l 1 1 k l c o where kl l mg is the langmuir constant and co mg l is the maximum initial sb iii v ions concentration the sorption process might be linear rl 1 favorable 0 rl 1 or unfavorable rl 1 depending on the rl value 26 values of rl for trivalent and pentavalent sb were 0 136 and 0 025 respectively further confirming the favorability of the langmuir sorption the langmuir isotherm model ensures the uniformity of the fho it also ensures the formation of a homogeneous layer of toxicants for experimental data during the sorption process 32 for the freundlich isotherm r2 values for trivalent and pentavalent sb species were 0 990 and 0 852 respectively indicating the potential of sb iii v sorption by fho in addition the higher n value for sb v uptake 3 402 showed its less sorption ability than sb iii ions 1 581 on heterogeneous fho surface sites since these n values were in the range of 1 10 reflecting that both pollutants had good sorption properties 26 to further examine adsorption characteristics of sb species l f isotherms were also drawn using experimental data r2 values for sb iii and sb v ions were 0 990 and 0 995 respectively showing a promising analytical approach for simulating both langmuir and freundlich type adsorption effects as per model equation when kl f reached a low value the denominator in eq 8 approached unity and the l f isotherm equation reduced to a freundlich type function 25 as shown in table 2 the low kl f value calculated for sb iii ions confirmed multilayer formation onto heterogeneous active sites of fho during a coagulation process 7 in contrast higher kl f values for sb v ions at 5 026 l mg indicated homogeneous adsorption characteristics of these species on fho considering r2 values and the closeness between experimental and modeled qe the l f model well summarized the sorption activity of sb iii v ions for the d r isotherm model r2 values for trivalent and pentavalent sb ions were 0 946 and 0 985 respectively indicating good sorption characteristics therefore d r isotherm was appropriate to explain the adsorption nature of both sb species on fho 33 in the d r model the magnitude of e is helpful in distinguishing between physical 8 kj mol and chemical 8 16 kj mol sorption processes 34 as shown in table 2 calculated values of e for trivalent and pentavalent sb were 3 684 and 4 298 kj mol respectively therefore the sorption of both sb ions by fho appears to be dominated by the physisorption mechanism 3 4 effect of solution temperature and thermodynamic properties the solution temperature plays vital role in the bonding and sorption phenomenon fig 4 a presented the influence of water temperature on fho formation and removal of both sb ions by fc coagulation the decrease in sb iii removal efficiency at higher temperature is likely to be due to less fho formation in suspension containing sb iii species such observation may be ascribed to the increase in solubility of fe ions and less adsorption affinity of sb iii species on fho at higher temperatures 35 moreover heating sb suspensions might have decreased the bond strength between the sb and fe species due to increased thermal energy to further elucidate the characteristic of the sorption phenomenon and the δe during heterogeneous environment δg δh and δs were calculated fig 4b and table 3 shows the determined van t hoff s plot and thermodynamic parameters negative δg values at temperature 288 308 k indicated that the sorption of both sb species on fho was a spontaneous process the gradual increase in δg value with the temperature suggests that the rise in temperature has a detrimental effect on the sorption affinity of sb on fho 36 negative values of δh also illustrated that the sorption process was an exothermic reaction 37 a previous study 38 has indicated that absolute δh values in the range of 0 8 kj mol 8 60 kj mol and 60 kj mol indicate physical adsorption physical adsorption and complexation and chemical adsorption respectively in this study absolute δh values for trivalent and pentavalent sb were 35 09 and 22 171 kj mol respectively indicating multiple binding mechanisms including physisorption and complexation of sb on fho surface moreover the positive δs value showed that the randomness of the heterogeneous system increased during the sorption process in general thermodynamic parameters could help us understand the adsorption reactions of fho with both sb species during the coagulation process 3 5 influence of is on sb sorption fig 5 indicates fho formation and sorption of sb iii and sb v as a function of is in various suspensions as shown in fig 5a suspensions containing less sb concentrations had insignificant influence on fho formation showing better sb removal with increasing of is such behavior suggested the existence of inner sphere surface complexes between fho and both sb iii v species 39 the explanation why the sb showed higher adsorption on fho under high is was most likely to be due to high counter ions activity that could compensate surface charges developed due to the deposition of ions on the solid surface 40 to further evaluate the influence of is similar experiments were conducted with suspensions containing higher sb iii v concentration i e 15 mg l as shown in fig 5b increasing the concentration of is from 0 001 m to 0 1 m had a negligible impact on fho formation and sb iii removal process indicating the formation of inner sphere complexes of these ions on the fho surface 39 however the 4 15 fho formation was significantly inhibited in the presence of higher concentration of sb v with low is 0 001 m upon increasing is to 0 01 m and 0 1 m the fho formation enhanced to 64 18 and 100 respectively the main reason why pentavalent sb elimination was also enhanced under high is might be attributable to enhanced fho formation and increased ion pair formation with na on fho surface in solution 41 42 it may be inferred from these findings that sorption of both sb ions on fho might be more probable at high is conditions suggesting the possibility of inner sphere complexes 3 6 relationship between sb iii v uptake index and fc dose in order to evaluate the potential of fho for lowering sb within maximum permissible contamination level mcl further experiments were conducted by increasing fc dose from 0 1 mm to 0 3 mm with 1 mg l initial sb iii v concentration and neutral ph condition fig 6 therefore the added fc dose and the main influencing parameters responsible for sb removal was evaluated according to their potential to decrease residual sb concentration below mcl i e 5 μg l along with their adsorption capacity i e qmcl or q5 g mol referred as uptake index henceforth the obtained sorption data were fitted with langmuir freundlich isotherm model and showed that fho can achieve mcl with adsorption capacities i e qmcl sb iii 2 972 g mol sb v 3 806 g mol and required fc dose can be calculated as follows fc dose mm 1000 5 μg l 1 103 2 972 g sb iii mol fe iii 0 335 mm fc dose mm 1000 5 μg l 1 103 3 806 g sb v mol fe iii 0 261 mm these results indicated that 0 335 mm fc dose will be required to decrease the concentration of 1 mg l sb iii to permissible level in comparison a relatively lower fc dose i e 0 261 mm will be needed to achieve regulation limit in water bodies containing 1 mg l sb v concentration in general these results indicated that the fc doses within these range will be effective for remediation of sb iii v species 1 mg l with treatment system capable to lower sb levels within mcl limits similar to these results previous research 43 44 also indicated the relative importance of uptake index for sb iii and sb v species for lowering their concentration within the regulation limits in addition the fho formation was also monitored for relevant bench scale experiments with results indicating increase in fho production upon increasing fc dose during coagulation process see si fig s3 3 7 removal mechanism of sb by fho to obtain mechanistic insights into sb removal behavior on fho xrd patterns of pristine compounds i e ksb oh 6 sb2o3 and fecl3 6h2o and sb iii sb v loaded fho were determined as shown in fig s4 fridge patterns can be indexed to 111 222 400 331 622 and 444 planes of pure cubic crystalline phase of sb2o3 45 diffraction peaks at 111 311 222 400 511 440 and 531 planes indicated a conventional hexahedron evenly distributed structure of ksb oh 6 46 moreover characteristic diffraction peaks at 2θ 15 17 19 30 and 33 were attributed to pristine fecl3 6h2o powder 47 it was noteworthy that no impurities were detected from the xrd pattern of pristine compounds used in this study precipitation coprecipitation and adsorption are recognized as governing removal mechanisms during a coagulation process as presented in fig 7 the precipitation phenomenon could be ignored as xrd analysis of composite flocs did not show any diffraction peak for such phase after fc coagulation in this study as evidenced by various solution chemistries below above optimal ph high temperature low is water quality varied markedly with higher sb iii v remaining at higher initial loadings therefore both water characteristics and xrd patterns indicated the insignificant role of precipitation mechanism in sb removal using fc coagulant after eliminating the possibility of precipitation our previous study 15 and xrd patterns observed in the current study showed the involvement of coprecipitation and adsorption mechanisms in sb removal the diffraction peak observed at 2θ 30 in sb iii loaded fho indicated an anomalous replacement of sb iii species in growing fho having nano crystalline structure containing 80 octahedral and 20 tetrahedral coordinated iron during fc coagulation process 48 such coprecipitation phenomena may be attributable to the relatively large ionic radius of sb iii than fe iii species resulting in inner crystal structure distortion responsible for higher sb iii removal than sb v species 19 it was noteworthy that no such peak was observed in sb v loaded fho diffraction pattern while fridge pattern at 2θ 34 was observed after interaction of both sb species with fho such observation was helpful in elucidating the role of internal and surface adsorption of sb iii v by fho in the water treatment process variations in solution chemistry parameters were mainly responsible for determining such adsorption features of both sb species by fho the internal adsorption refers to the incorporation of sb species into the inner surface of fho via crystal disruptions and inner surface complexation followed by surface adsorption 49 thus adsorption mechanisms may also explain the decreased sb v uptake under unfavorable aquatic conditions and coprecipitation pathway for efficient remediation of sb iii ions under similar water environments in general xrd analysis revealed the formation of inner sphere complexes and surface adsorption of both sb iii v species by fho during fc coagulation process based on experimental results modeling approach and xrd analysis it may be inferred that combination of coprecipitation multilayer physisorption and inner sphere complexation play an important role in sb iii removal in contrast monolayer physisorption and inner sphere complexation of sb v with fho might have resulted in removal of these ions from the solution 3 8 implications of sb mobility and remediation knowledge about the removal behavior of sb from liquid streams where aquatic conditions determine the availability of active sorption sites of adsorbent is vital to predict their mobilization in an aquatic system present research may provide some understanding about the stability of fho and corresponding adsorptive removal of sb iii v species under different aquatic conditions which could limit the release of contaminants and reduce the associated potential risk our findings suggest that sb iii is less likely to be present in water due to stronger affinity of fho under reducing conditions the sb v species may be easily retained in liquid streams due to its lower affinity specifically under a basic environment however the optimum sb v sorption can be achieved at neutral ph conditions in addition temperature has a significant influence on the efficiency of sb removal with low temperatures functioning better than high temperatures thus increasing ph at low temperatures in an environmental water system has the benefit of eliminating trivalent species from water additionally given that trivalent sb species are more toxic than pentavalent ones this treatment strategy could minimize possible toxicological risks to humans current study emphasizes the significant influence of redox sb species on the stability of fho and their adsorption behavior in water treatment processes 4 conclusions in this study fho formation and sb iii v removal from fresh water bodies were investigated and sorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics were discussed extensively rapid sb sorption reaction by fho depends on solution ph an alkaline ph condition has inhibitory effect on fho formation thereby increasing sb v mobility an insignificant impact on fho formation was observed under other experimental conditions i e contact time sb loading and temperature the sorption of sb by fho strongly followed the pseudo first order kinetic model in which physical reaction dominated at the initial step followed by pore diffusion and deposition in the final phase the determined model parameters were well fitted with langmuir for pentavalent sb species and freundlich for trivalent sb ions as indicated by the langmuir freundlich isotherm model furthermore the d r isotherm was useful in determining the physical adsorption nature of both sb ions on fho surface thermodynamic values of the adsorption phenomenon suggest that the reaction may be spontaneously exothermic with increased randomness at higher operating temperatures greater sb iii v removal was observed at higher ionic strength conditions particularly due to enhanced fho formation in solution in order to identify mechanisms involved in sb removal xrd analysis was conducted which confirmed the combination of inner sphere complexation and physical sorption of both sb iii v species by fho during fc coagulation besides the coprecipitation phenomenon was identified as an additional mechanism responsible for efficient sb iii removal from the solution in general it was confirmed that main removal mechanisms responsible for the absorption of sb into iron sorbents

13551,sludge foaming has been a persistent ailment in worldwide municipal sewage treatment plants mstps in particular this problem frequently occurs and lasts throughout the winter and spring season in the sub plateau mstps aims to explore the causes of sludge foaming under sub plateau circumstance the correlation between the structural and functional changes in bacterial communities and sewage properties was conducted using illumina high throughput sequencing technology the results from 16s rrna gene sequencing shown that the relative abundances of actinobacteria 39 5 4 8 and firmicutes 10 5 1 0 in the foaming sludge were remarkably higher than that in the non foaming sludge the abundances of candidatus microthrix parvicella 29 8 6 9 trichococcus 6 5 1 0 and ornithinibacter 3 5 0 6 were increased after sludge foaming and which are considered as the dominated foaming causative bacterial assemblages by the linear discriminant analysis lda spearman s correlation analysis and redundancy analysis rda also agreed that lower temperature and dissolved oxygen do levels higher lipid and protein contents were significantly correlated with sludge foaming in addition the predictive functional profiling indicated that the enzymes and their coding genes of the bacterial communities are mainly involved in the fast proliferation and lipid metabolism and which abundance are highly upregulated during foaming period these results suggested that the sludge foaming was strongly linked to the actinobacteria and firmicutes communities and higher lipid and protein content in the sewage under sub

the tropical regions sludge foaming events are more severely in the sub plateau mstps 1 2 which impairs the activated sludge as settlement lowers the effluent quality brings about potential public health danger and hinders mstps operation 3 4 a comprehensive understanding of the microbial community structure associated with sludge foaming will be conductive to exploring the causes for the sludge foaming and guiding to find the appropriate strategies for foaming control the sludge foaming can be defined as a viscous deep brown and stable foam layer that floating on the surfaces of the anoxic zone and be attributed to bubbles surfactant and high abundance of filamentous bacteria 1 5 6 the identified filamentous bacteria in foaming sludge are affiliated to the five phyla including proteobacteria actinobacteria bacterioidetes firmicutes and choloroflexi the most abundant bacterial genera related to foaming are all belong to actinobacteria such as mycolata branched mycolic acid containing filamentous bacteria candidatus microthrix parvicella and nostocoida limicola ii tetrasphaera among mycolata and m parvicella are considered as the two most important sludge foaming causative groups 7 8 mycolata includes the genera nocardia gordonia mycobacterium rhodococcus corynebacterium dietzia skermania tsukamurella and williamsia 9 10 among them nocardia and gordonia are frequently reported to be the predominant genera associated with foaming which exhibit metabolic diversity 3 the cell wall of these genera is rich in lipid content mycolic acid and highly hydrophobic 9 11 most of them could utilize various carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources particularly prefer to hydrophobic substrate such as oil and ester although mycolata was able to gear to foaming sludge niches and outcompete it was only found in higher temperature sewage cases 8 9 m parvicella is characterized by a hydrophobic cell surface high storage capacity and low energy requirement 12 15 in most cases m parvicella could assimilate long or short chain fatty acids lcfas and store lipids under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions 12 15 16 recent genomic profiling of m parvicella rn1 revealed that the putative genes involved in glycerol transportation β oxidation of lcfas and triacylglycerol lipases play important roles in assimilating and storing lcfas 17 similarly m parvicella bio17 1 could accumulate fatty acids which was validated by its putative genes encoding 28 homologs of lcfa acyl coa ligase and 17 homologs of enoyl coa hydratase 18 m parvicella also is a typical representative of low temperature bacteria 19 20 the genome based enrichment analysis of kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genome orthologous groups kegg indicated that the pathways related to glycerolipid metabolism were enriched and highly upregulated in m parvicella under low temperature 16 21 additionally temperature and oxygen level affect the lcfa assimilation process the temperature dependent metabolic model could be attributed to the dynamics of acyl coa ligases involved in oleic acid assimilation along with fluctuating temperature 14 22 although a recent study showed that the relative abundance of filaments reached up to 30 of the total bacteria neither bulking nor foaming was observed in the surveyed wastewater treatment plants wwtps 23 the relative abundance of m parvicella was the highest proportion ranged 3 4 8 9 of total bacteria in absence of bulking foaming episodes and was positively correlated with efficiency of nutriment removal suggesting its positive roles in wwtps therefore it may be inferred that the filaments are not the sole causes for sludge foaming on the basis of continental geographical separation and the distance decay relationship in ecology 24 27 it could be supposed that the microbial communities associated with sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps are likely different from the mstps located in other geographical regions in this study the foaming and non foaming sludge samples were collected from four full scale sub plateau mstps over two years the 16s rrna gene sequencing was conducted to evaluate the changes in bacterial community diversity abundance and function between the foaming and non foaming samples and the correlation between the bacterial community structure and sewage properties i e temperature dissolved oxygen protein polysaccharide and lipid contents were established to discern which physicochemical factors and bacteria community patterns that are associated with sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps this study might be a new addition to the causative bacterial communities for sludge foaming and guide to develop the effective strategy for foaming control in the sub plateau mstps 2 materials and methods 2 1 characteristics of mstps and sampling the surveyed 4 full scale mstps were located in sub plateau regions in northwest china which information is listed in table s1 the domestic sewage was collected and treated by conventional activated sludge process the sludge foaming frequently occurred in winter and spring in the anoxic zone the foaming sludge samples were collected more than three times during the massive foams accumulated and the corresponding non foaming sludge samples were collected when foams disappeared practically from january 2016 to january 2018 each sample was collected in triplicate into sterile bottles and kept in an icebox before arriving laboratory after centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min the sediments were stored at 80 until dna extraction the temperature and dissolved oxygen do of wastewater were determined using a portable water quality analyzer dr3900 hach usa all measured data are shown in table 1 2 2 assessment of the foaming degree the foaming degree was assessed by foam thickness and foaming scum index fsi during foaming period the foam thickness and occupying area of total surface of the anoxic zone were recorded when the foam floated stably on the system surface meanwhile the bubbles were described in color and size the fsi values were calculated by the formula y 0 7427x 4 3701 r2 0 7834 y refers to foam thickness mm x refers to fsi for completely mixed configuration 28 the rating results of foaming degree are shown in table 2 2 3 measurement of polysaccharide protein and lipid contents in sewage the samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 15 min and then the supernatant was filtered through 0 45 μm membranes the concentrations of polysaccharides and proteins in sewage were measured by the anthrone reagent and folin reagent method respectively described by bella 2011 using a uv759s spectrophotometer shanghai precision scientific instrument co ltd china at wavelength of 500 nm and 600 nm with bovine serum albumin bsa and glucose as the standard respectively total lipid content in sewage was determined by the soxhlet method 29 10 ml supernatant was placed in an evaporating dish with 20 g quartz sand and dried in an oven at 100 5 for 30 min and then moved into cellulose thimble which was then put into the soxhlet extractor filled with petroleum ether reflux extraction the extract was dried at 100 5 to constant weight the result was expressed as weight of total free lipid per unit volume sewage the measured data are listed in table 1 2 4 dna extraction and illumina miseq sequencing about 5 g sludge sample was used to extract genomic dna using the fast dna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals ca usa the detailed methods of 16s rrna gene amplification and amplicon sequencing were described in the previous study 30 raw sequences have been deposited into the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under accession number prjna357044 and prjna551365 2 5 16s rrna gene sequence

taxonomic lineage of prokaryotes in kegg using tax4fun software 2 6 statistical analyses statistical analyses were performed on spss 23 0 spss inc chicago usa all data are presented as the means of

assess the relationship between core bacterial community richness diversity and environmental variables the relevant column charts reflecting community structures were drawn by microsoft excel 2019 3 results and discussion 3 1 bacterial community structure in foaming sludge in the sludge foaming samples the most abundant phylum was actinobacteria 39 5 4 8 followed by proteobacteria 19 3 4 1 bacteroidetes 17 8 4 8 firmicutes 10 5 1 0 chloroflexi 5 8 1 5 and saccharibacteria 3 5 0 6 while proteobacteria 31 5 4 0 was the most abundant phylum in the corresponding non foaming sludge samples followed by actinobacteria 20 5 6 0 bacteroidetes 20 0 0 8 chloroflexi 12 0 4 8 firmicutes 5 8 1 5 and saccharibacteria 3 0 2 0 as shown in fig 1 a the relative abundances of actinobacteria and firmicutes in the foaming samples were significantly higher than those in the non foaming samples in contrast the abundances of proteobacteria and chloroflexi were remarkably decreased during foaming process nonsignificant changes in the abundances of bacteroidetes and saccharibacteria were observed these results indicated that the abundances of the dominant bacterial phyla changed a lot when foams are accumulating it is in agreement with the previous study that the principal bacterial communities associated with sludge foaming were affiliated to the actinobacteria phylum 7 8 at the genus level the abundances of m parvicella 29 8 6 9 trichococcus 6 5 1 0 and ornithinibacter 3 5 0 6 were remarkably increased in the foaming sludge samples fig 1 b suggesting that these genera have contributed to the sludge foaming but nocardia and gordonia were not detected in the foaming sludge samples and they have been proved as the most frequently associated with foaming episodes in other geographical mstps 32 the bacterial diversity and species richness were revealed by simpson and chao indices respectively the mean value of simpson index in the foaming samples 0 10 0 04 was significantly higher than that of the non foaming samples 0 013 0 007 fig 1d suggesting the bacterial community diversity reduced distinctly after sludge foaming occurred while the total number of bacterial species in the non foaming samples 1747 305 was higher than that of the foaming samples 1609 136 fig 1c these results indicated that sludge foaming caused a great decrease in the total number of bacterial species and community diversity at the threshold of 1 relative abundance it can be explained by the bioconcentration and selection of organic pollutants in sewage and the changes are probably the primary reason why the efficiency of nutrient removal declined during the foaming period 30 33 34 furthermore the lefse results shown the difference in bacterial communities between the sample pair fig 2 consequently more bacterial taxa 12 bacterial clades were enriched in the foaming samples in comparison to 8 clades in the non foaming samples the members classified to the actinobacteria and firmicutes such as acidimicrobiales incertae sedis family m parvicella genus acidimicrobiales order actinobacteria class carnobacteriaceae family trichococcus genus and bacilli class were enriched in the foaming sludge notably acidimicrobiales incertae sedis presented the most significant difference in abundance in the sample pair which greatly affected the community structure the genome analysis revealed that these bacterial members are important to assimilating c2 compounds through ethylmalonyl coa pathway 35 and m parvicella has been clarified to survive under hypoxic cold and alternating anoxic oxic conditions and outcompete under unbalanced growth conditions by utilizing various carbon substrates 12 16 19 the bacilli bacteria may be an important contributor to stable foam formation in foaming sludge 4 additionally the proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes members were also enriched in the non foaming samples among them proteobacteria significantly affected the community structure fig 2 moreover the pls da analysis clustered the bacterial communities in all samples into two distinct groups that was the foaming and non foaming groups fig 3 c this result further validated the significant dissimilarity in the diversity abundance and assembly pattern of bacterial communities between the foaming and non foaming groups the bacterial community pattern among the foaming samples was more similar and shown that specific bacterial populations were selected and enriched under foaming sewage properties co occurrence network analysis visualized the co existence and exclusive species between the foaming and non foaming samples at the phylum and genus level respectively fig 3a b the result revealed that the frequently dominated bacterial community were co existed in the foaming and non foaming samples while a few phyla and genera were not detected after foams occurring suggesting that the sludge foaming probably links to the excessive growth of the filamentous bacteria members affiliated to actinobacteria and firmicutes and the loss of interaction among the populations 36 37 hence the dynamic changes of bacterial community assembly pattern might be jointly affected by the biotic interaction and environmental factors 3 2 the environmental factors related to sludge foaming rda analysis revealed which physicochemical properties of sewage are more closely related to the sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps fig 4 among them temperature and do level were significantly positively correlated with the bacterial communities in the non foaming sludge whereas negatively with the bacterial communities in the foaming sludge the contents of protein polysaccharide and lipid were positively correlated with bacterial communities in the foaming samples whereas negatively with bacterial communities in the non foaming samples temperature do lipid and protein contents presented more significant impact on bacterial communities suggesting that lower temperature and do level higher lipid and protein contents are the principal environmental factors caused foaming in sub plateau mstps spearman correlation analysis spearman coefficient 0 6 p value 0 01 revealed the correlation between the sewage properties and bacterial groups fig 5 the relative abundance of anaerolineaceae caldilineaceae run sp154 tk10 iamia comamonadaceae members were significantly positively correlated with temperature and do levels but negatively with the contents of lipid protein and polysaccharide the relative abundance of ferribacterium terrimonas m parvicella ns9 marine group trichococcus simplicispira and flavobacterium were positively correlated with the contents of lipid protein and polysaccharide but negatively with temperature and do levels it implies that different bacterial populations are enriched in different sewage properties and these bacterial assemblages are considered as the dominant communities associated with sludge foaming this result is consistent with the previous reports by fan et al 2017 and chen et al 2017 who reported that the most filamentous bacterial species belonging to actinobacteria could be outcompeted and proliferated rapidly at lower temperature 13 15 12 38 39 and that a great deal of filaments had been reported to survive under limiting oxygen supply in sludge such as m parvicella which are microaerophil microbes and grow well at low temperature and do levels with high uptake rate of lcfas but could not dominate at high temperature and do levels 17 meanwhile lower do levels could enhance the surface adhesion force and roughness of activated sludge lower temperature would reduce the solubility of lipids and fats both of them could result in lipids and fats accumulating on the sewage surface which was regarded as the favorite substrates for m parvicella 15 40 these substrates are mainly from the extracellular polymeric substances sum of lipid and protein excreted by microbes and lysates during the foaming period which are highly correlated with the foam formation 32 41 44 therefore raising the temperature and do levels deoiling methods and the novel microbial electrochemical system may be recommended to control sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps 45 49 3 3 functional profiling of bacterial communities during sludge foaming exploring the relationship between community structure and function is a crucial topic in microbial ecology as a well controlled engineering ecosystem there would be a strong links between community structure and function in active sludge 24 in the present study the functional changes in the bacterial communities were compared after sludge foaming and before using the tax4fun software the relative abundance of kegg orthology ko metabolic pathways and enzymes are achieved by kegg functional annotation based on 16s rrna marker gene families several genera with functions well known are selected and classified according to the midas database 50 51 the nitrosomonas is screened out as the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob its otu number is less than the other functional genus the nitrotoga and nitrospira are considered to be the major nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the accumulibacter tetrasphaera and accumulimons are the prominent phosphate accumulating organisms pao and defluviicoccus competibacter accumulibacter are the main glycogen accumulating organisms gao the otu number of aob nob pao and gao in the foaming sludge are significantly less than that in the non foaming sludge fig 6 a these results indicate that the relative abundance of functional populations related to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus are markedly decreased during foaming period however the otu number of denitrifying bacteria dnb in the foaming sludge including comamonas dnb enrichment culture and thauera are significantly higher than that in the non foaming sludge fig 6a suggesting that dnb populations proliferate rapidly during foaming period additionally an average of 11387 otus corresponding to m parvicella and trichococcus are identified in the foaming sludge which are dramatically higher than that in the non foaming samples 3016 otu on average these bacterial populations are shown to be positively correlated with the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and phosphorus 12 15 23 hinting that their versatile roles in the performance of mstps that is the reason why a large proportion of nutriments could be removed during the foaming period even though the removal efficiency has declined a lot 30 33 furthermore the profiling of kegg pathways enzymes and kos of the bacterial communities were analyzed by mapping 16s rrna sequences to the taxonomic lineage of prokaryotes in the databank fig 6c the results have shown that the vast majority of metabolic activity are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrate amino acid energy and nucleotide which correspond to the basic metabolism of microbes the xenobiotics biodegradation lipid metabolism terpenoids and polyketides metabolism and glycan biosynthesis present higher portion of metabolic activity as well however there are no significant differences in the ratio of metabolic pathways between the foaming and non foaming sludges the relative abundance of the key enzymes top ten in the foaming sludge was higher than that in the non foaming sludge fig 6b the most abundant enzymes are involved in energy and nucleotide metabolism such as dna directed dna polymerase ec 2 7 7 7 dna helicase ec 3 6 4 12 and nadh ubiquinone reductase ec 1 6 5 3 in addition the enzymes involved in lipid metabolism are higher abundance in the foaming sludge such as acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 and lcfa coa ligase ec 6 2 1 3 it is verified by several studies reported that the excessive proliferation of m parvicella is attributed to its ability to assimilate and store lipids 12 17 moreover the relative abundance of fundamental enzymes in the foaming sludge are almost higher than all that in the non foaming sludge table s2 while a total of 7235 genes are affiliated to the kos associated with replication repair and energy storage table s3 among them the kos encoding enzymes related to the filamentous bacteria and the kos involving in triglyceride metabolism present a high abundance fig 6d including k00626 acetyl coa c acetyltransferase k00059 3 oxoacyl reductase and k01897 long chain acyl coa synthetase etc it is in agreement with the annotated genes involved in lipid metabolism in m parvicella 12 18 and the number of predicted genes in the foaming sludge are markedly more than that in the non foaming sludge which is similar to the changes in the enzyme richness these results suggested that the relative abundance of enzymes and their coding genes are upregulated during the foaming period the enzymes are primarily involved in the fast proliferation and lipid metabolism of the bacterial communities consequently the active bacterial populations associated with the sludge foaming could be dominated under the sub plateau circumstance which might be due to its specific metabolic pathway and sufficient substrate supply 4 conclusions the present study revealed the structural and functional changes in bacterial communities before and after sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps in northwest china the relative abundance of bacterial communities and diversity were dramatically decreased during foaming period the bacterial community assemblages associated with sludge foaming are all affiliated to actinobacteria and firmicutes members including acidimicrobiales incertae sedis family m parvicella genus acidimicrobiales order actinobacteria class carnobacteriaceae family trichococcus genus and bacilli class which is the unique community structure presenting in the foaming sludge from the sub plateau mstps and lower temperature and do levels higher lipid and protein contents are the primary factors that caused overgrowth of them therefore it might be effective to control foaming by raising temperature and do levels and degreasing in the sub plateau mstps in addition the abundance of enzymes and their coding genes are upregulated during sludge foaming period which are mainly involved in fast proliferating and lipid metabolizing this is maybe the molecular mechanism that the filaments are able to proliferate rapidly and be dominated under the sub plateau circumstance although this study provides a comprehensive insight into the structural and functional changes in bacterial communities during sludge foaming further research should pay more attention to the microorganisms morphologies sludge properties and confirm them

13551,sludge foaming has been a persistent ailment in worldwide municipal sewage treatment plants mstps in particular this problem frequently occurs and lasts throughout the winter and spring season in the sub plateau mstps aims to explore the causes of sludge foaming under sub plateau circumstance the correlation between the structural and functional changes in bacterial communities and sewage properties was conducted using illumina high throughput sequencing technology the results from 16s rrna gene sequencing shown that the relative abundances of actinobacteria 39 5 4 8 and firmicutes 10 5 1 0 in the foaming sludge were remarkably higher than that in the non foaming sludge the abundances of candidatus microthrix parvicella 29 8 6 9 trichococcus 6 5 1 0 and ornithinibacter 3 5 0 6 were increased after sludge foaming and which are considered as the dominated foaming causative bacterial assemblages by the linear discriminant analysis lda spearman s correlation analysis and redundancy analysis rda also agreed that lower temperature and dissolved oxygen do levels higher lipid and protein contents were significantly correlated with sludge foaming in addition the predictive functional profiling indicated that the enzymes and their coding genes of the bacterial communities are mainly involved in the fast proliferation and lipid metabolism and which abundance are highly upregulated during foaming period these results suggested that the sludge foaming was strongly linked to the actinobacteria and firmicutes communities and higher lipid and protein content in the sewage under sub

the sample pair fig 2 consequently more bacterial taxa 12 bacterial clades were enriched in the foaming samples in comparison to 8 clades in the non foaming samples the members classified to the actinobacteria and firmicutes such as acidimicrobiales incertae sedis family m parvicella genus acidimicrobiales order actinobacteria class carnobacteriaceae family trichococcus genus and bacilli class were enriched in the foaming sludge notably acidimicrobiales incertae sedis presented the most significant difference in abundance in the sample pair which greatly affected the community structure the genome analysis revealed that these bacterial members are important to assimilating c2 compounds through ethylmalonyl coa pathway 35 and m parvicella has been clarified to survive under hypoxic cold and alternating anoxic oxic conditions and outcompete under unbalanced growth conditions by utilizing various carbon substrates 12 16 19 the bacilli bacteria may be an important contributor to stable foam formation in foaming sludge 4 additionally the proteobacteria chloroflexi and bacteroidetes members were also enriched in the non foaming samples among them proteobacteria significantly affected the community structure fig 2 moreover the pls da analysis clustered the bacterial communities in all samples into two distinct groups that was the foaming and non foaming groups fig 3 c this result further validated the significant dissimilarity in the diversity abundance and assembly pattern of bacterial communities between the foaming and non foaming groups the bacterial community pattern among the foaming samples was more similar and shown that specific bacterial populations were selected and enriched under foaming sewage properties co occurrence network analysis visualized the co existence and exclusive species between the foaming and non foaming samples at the phylum and genus level respectively fig 3a b the result revealed that the frequently dominated bacterial community were co existed in the foaming and non foaming samples while a few phyla and genera were not detected after foams occurring suggesting that the sludge foaming probably links to the excessive growth of the filamentous bacteria members affiliated to actinobacteria and firmicutes and the loss of interaction among the populations 36 37 hence the dynamic changes of bacterial community assembly pattern might be jointly affected by the biotic interaction and environmental factors 3 2 the environmental factors related to sludge foaming rda analysis revealed which physicochemical properties of sewage are more closely related to the sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps fig 4 among them temperature and do level were significantly positively correlated with the bacterial communities in the non foaming sludge whereas negatively with the bacterial communities in the foaming sludge the contents of protein polysaccharide and lipid were positively correlated with bacterial communities in the foaming samples whereas negatively with bacterial communities in the non foaming samples temperature do lipid and protein contents presented more significant impact on bacterial communities suggesting that lower temperature and do level higher lipid and protein contents are the principal environmental factors caused foaming in sub plateau mstps spearman correlation analysis spearman coefficient 0 6 p value 0 01 revealed the correlation between the sewage properties and bacterial groups fig 5 the relative abundance of anaerolineaceae caldilineaceae run sp154 tk10 iamia comamonadaceae members were significantly positively correlated with temperature and do levels but negatively with the contents of lipid protein and polysaccharide the relative abundance of ferribacterium terrimonas m parvicella ns9 marine group trichococcus simplicispira and flavobacterium were positively correlated with the contents of lipid protein and polysaccharide but negatively with temperature and do levels it implies that different bacterial populations are enriched in different sewage properties and these bacterial assemblages are considered as the dominant communities associated with sludge foaming this result is consistent with the previous reports by fan et al 2017 and chen et al 2017 who reported that the most filamentous bacterial species belonging to actinobacteria could be outcompeted and proliferated rapidly at lower temperature 13 15 12 38 39 and that a great deal of filaments had been reported to survive under limiting oxygen supply in sludge such as m parvicella which are microaerophil microbes and grow well at low temperature and do levels with high uptake rate of lcfas but could not dominate at high temperature and do levels 17 meanwhile lower do levels could enhance the surface adhesion force and roughness of activated sludge lower temperature would reduce the solubility of lipids and fats both of them could result in lipids and fats accumulating on the sewage surface which was regarded as the favorite substrates for m parvicella 15 40 these substrates are mainly from the extracellular polymeric substances sum of lipid and protein excreted by microbes and lysates during the foaming period which are highly correlated with the foam formation 32 41 44 therefore raising the temperature and do levels deoiling methods and the novel microbial electrochemical system may be recommended to control sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps 45 49 3 3 functional profiling of bacterial communities during sludge foaming exploring the relationship between community structure and function is a crucial topic in microbial ecology as a well controlled engineering ecosystem there would be a strong links between community structure and function in active sludge 24 in the present study the functional changes in the bacterial communities were compared after sludge foaming and before using the tax4fun software the relative abundance of kegg orthology ko metabolic pathways and enzymes are achieved by kegg functional annotation based on 16s rrna marker gene families several genera with functions well known are selected and classified according to the midas database 50 51 the nitrosomonas is screened out as the major ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob its otu number is less than the other functional genus the nitrotoga and nitrospira are considered to be the major nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob the accumulibacter tetrasphaera and accumulimons are the prominent phosphate accumulating organisms pao and defluviicoccus competibacter accumulibacter are the main glycogen accumulating organisms gao the otu number of aob nob pao and gao in the foaming sludge are significantly less than that in the non foaming sludge fig 6 a these results indicate that the relative abundance of functional populations related to the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus are markedly decreased during foaming period however the otu number of denitrifying bacteria dnb in the foaming sludge including comamonas dnb enrichment culture and thauera are significantly higher than that in the non foaming sludge fig 6a suggesting that dnb populations proliferate rapidly during foaming period additionally an average of 11387 otus corresponding to m parvicella and trichococcus are identified in the foaming sludge which are dramatically higher than that in the non foaming samples 3016 otu on average these bacterial populations are shown to be positively correlated with the removal efficiency of total nitrogen and phosphorus 12 15 23 hinting that their versatile roles in the performance of mstps that is the reason why a large proportion of nutriments could be removed during the foaming period even though the removal efficiency has declined a lot 30 33 furthermore the profiling of kegg pathways enzymes and kos of the bacterial communities were analyzed by mapping 16s rrna sequences to the taxonomic lineage of prokaryotes in the databank fig 6c the results have shown that the vast majority of metabolic activity are involved in the metabolism of carbohydrate amino acid energy and nucleotide which correspond to the basic metabolism of microbes the xenobiotics biodegradation lipid metabolism terpenoids and polyketides metabolism and glycan biosynthesis present higher portion of metabolic activity as well however there are no significant differences in the ratio of metabolic pathways between the foaming and non foaming sludges the relative abundance of the key enzymes top ten in the foaming sludge was higher than that in the non foaming sludge fig 6b the most abundant enzymes are involved in energy and nucleotide metabolism such as dna directed dna polymerase ec 2 7 7 7 dna helicase ec 3 6 4 12 and nadh ubiquinone reductase ec 1 6 5 3 in addition the enzymes involved in lipid metabolism are higher abundance in the foaming sludge such as acetyl coa c acetyltransferase ec 2 3 1 9 and lcfa coa ligase ec 6 2 1 3 it is verified by several studies reported that the excessive proliferation of m parvicella is attributed to its ability to assimilate and store lipids 12 17 moreover the relative abundance of fundamental enzymes in the foaming sludge are almost higher than all that in the non foaming sludge table s2 while a total of 7235 genes are affiliated to the kos associated with replication repair and energy storage table s3 among them the kos encoding enzymes related to the filamentous bacteria and the kos involving in triglyceride metabolism present a high abundance fig 6d including k00626 acetyl coa c acetyltransferase k00059 3 oxoacyl reductase and k01897 long chain acyl coa synthetase etc it is in agreement with the annotated genes involved in lipid metabolism in m parvicella 12 18 and the number of predicted genes in the foaming sludge are markedly more than that in the non foaming sludge which is similar to the changes in the enzyme richness these results suggested that the relative abundance of enzymes and their coding genes are upregulated during the foaming period the enzymes are primarily involved in the fast proliferation and lipid metabolism of the bacterial communities consequently the active bacterial populations associated with the sludge foaming could be dominated under the sub plateau circumstance which might be due to its specific metabolic pathway and sufficient substrate supply 4 conclusions the present study revealed the structural and functional changes in bacterial communities before and after sludge foaming in the sub plateau mstps in northwest china the relative abundance of bacterial communities and diversity were dramatically decreased during foaming period the bacterial community assemblages associated with sludge foaming are all affiliated to actinobacteria and firmicutes members including acidimicrobiales incertae sedis family m parvicella genus acidimicrobiales order actinobacteria class carnobacteriaceae family trichococcus genus and bacilli class which is the unique community structure presenting in the foaming sludge from the sub plateau mstps and lower temperature and do levels higher lipid and protein contents are the primary factors that caused overgrowth of them therefore it might be effective to control foaming by raising temperature and do levels and degreasing in the sub plateau mstps in addition the abundance of enzymes and their coding genes are upregulated during sludge foaming period which are mainly involved in fast proliferating and lipid metabolizing this is maybe the molecular mechanism that the filaments are able to proliferate rapidly and be dominated under the sub plateau circumstance although this study provides a comprehensive insight into the structural and functional changes in bacterial communities during sludge foaming further research should pay more attention to the microorganisms morphologies sludge properties and confirm them

13552,flocculation filtration treatment with cationic polymers and a rotary drum filter is an effective method to control microcystis bloom by separating microcystis from water however flocculation and corresponding removal are significantly affected by dissolved organic matters of which extracellular organic matter eom of microcystis is the main source during microcystis blooms hence this study investigated the effect of eom on the removal of microcystis by using flocculation with cationic polyacrylamide cpam and filtration with 100 μm filter results showed that the removal efficiency increased with the growth of microcystis and was attributed to the accumulated eom with eom 2 5 mg l extracted from stationary growth period the cells could form large flocs with cpam over 90 of which could be detained by a 100 μm sieve scanning electron microscope images showed that eom interacted with cpam and formed complexes which bridged between the cells more strongly meanwhile the removal was affected by eom characteristics and had a positive correlation with the proportion of protein and polysaccharide in the eom which were usually regarded as polymers the high molecular weight mw 30 kda fraction was thus identified as an effective component in eom to facilitate the formation of large and compact flocs especially the fraction with mw 100 kda this study partly revealed the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis from the perspective of the concentration and characteristic of eom and aid the understanding of the interaction between cpam and high mw eom fraction for the formation of large and compact flocs keywords microcystis extracellular organic matter polyacrylamide flocculation filtration molecular weight 1 introduction the outbreak of microcystis blooms in eutrophic freshwater bodies is becoming a global issue that conduct a serious threats to aquatic ecosystems 1 3 in situ harvesting accumulated microcystis cells from water is a direct and ecological friendly method for the control of cyanobacterial blooms through harvesting the biomass of microcystis and nutrient loading in water are both reduced to protect aquatic ecosystems and the collected microcystis can be further used as biological resources 4 5 sedimentation and filtration processes are often applied to achieve the desired higher removal efficiency of microalgae however sedimentation through centrifugation has a high cost and the high centrifugal force that may adversely affect cell integrity 6 gravity sedimentation has to occupy a large area of land and consume a long time for the settlement of the microalgae and is further limited by the stable suspension of these particles membrane micro ultra filtration processes also attain high biomass concentrations but are easily inhibited by membrane fouling 7 the use of magnetic nanoparticles and ultrasound are being investigated but are yet to be scaled on pilot and commercial scales 8 9 an in situ rotary drum filter covered with 35 μm pore size sieves was used to continuously treat microcystis laden water in lake dianchi which could automatically separate the cyanobacterium from water and remove them with an auto backwashing facility returning relatively cleaner effluent to the lake 4 however microcystis have a wide range of size distribution from single cell to colonies of which the small particles could hardly be detained and result in high residual biomass in the effluent 10 hence flocculation was used as pretreatment to enlarge the sizes of microcystis for higher removal efficiency of rotary drum filter inorganic flocculants e g ferric and aluminum are commonly used for the flocculation of microcystis 11 12 however they require a relatively long time for aggregating microcystis and the flocs are loose and easily broken up 13 considering the short hydraulic retention time within 1 min and fierce hydraulic shear in the rotary drum flocculation by inorganic flocculants is inapplicable as pretreatment in previous study the microcystis could be flocculated into large and compact flocs with a diameter of over 500 μm by cationic polyacrylamide cpam within 30 s and effectively removed by consequent filtration 4 meanwhile the consumption of cpam dosage was only 1 mg l which is far less than that of inorganic flocculants however when the practical operation lasted for 1 year differences were found in the removal efficiency of microcystis with cpam in various seasons for the in situ harvesting in lake dianchi but the cause remained unclear this was probably attributed to the variety of the biomass or the release of extracellular organic matters eom the effect of microcystis biomass has been taken into account in our previous study but the effect of eom has not been systematical studied 4 which usually increases as the biomass increases 14 eom has been considered to promote or inhibit the flocculation of cyanobacterial cells in various studies 13 16 18 for example it has been reported that the eom competed for flocculants 19 20 while hanumanth found that eom could increase the removal efficiency of microcystis 16 the inconsistent results might be attributable to the varied concentration and characteristic of the eom 14 21 cyanobacterial proteins were separated as possible inhibitory organic matter for aluminum 19 nevertheless li found that exopolysaccharides could facilitate flocculation 22 the effect of eom on the flocculation of microcystis with inorganic flocculants has been well studied thus far but inadequate attention has been paid to the effects of eom on the flocculation with cationic polymers 16 hence this study aimed to reveal the role of eom in the harvest of microcystis by using flocculation with cpam and filtration the specific objectives are aimed to 1 determine the removal efficiencies of microcystis through flocculation filtration treatment at different growth periods 2 determine the effects of the concentration and components of eom on the removal of microcystis these studies will help to understand the differences in harvesting microcystis in the in situ treatment and provide proper strategy for effective removal of microcystis 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of microcystis aeruginosa and extraction of eom microcystis aeruginosa fachb905 strain was provided by the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology china and was incubated in sterile bg11 medium at 25 c with a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle under a light intensity of about 1 800 lx 23 24 after incubation the cultures were centrifuged at 9000 rpm to separate the cells and the eom the precipitate was re suspended in bg11 medium and centrifuged for three times to wash away the residual eom and consequently re suspended in bg11 medium as eom free cells 25 eom samples were obtained by filtering the liquid supernatant with whatman gf c membranes whatman britain and preserved at 20 c until flocculation the eom concentration was monitored as the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration with an automatic toc analyzer vario toc elementar germany 26 the polysaccharide and protein concentration in the eom were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid assay 27 and coomassie brilliant blue staining 28 respectively with a spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 uv vis agilent usa 2 2 flocculation filtration experiment solid cpam was purchased from henan xinwangyuan water purification co ltd china with a mw of 8 107 da with a cationic degree of 40 the flocculation experiment of microcystis was carried out in a 50 ml conical flask under 400 rpm g 213 s 1 stirring within 40 s 4 then the mixture was immediately filtered by a 100 μm pore size stainless steel sieve with a diameter of 50 cm without settlement 29 the area of the sieve was adequately large versus the volume of the samples to avoid mesh blocking the effluent was collected to measure the removal efficiency which was represented by the optical density od at 680 nm 30 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y o d m o d n o d m 100 where od m is the od of raw water and od n is the od of the effluent all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 1 effect of the growth periods of microcystis to explore the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis at different times in the in situ treatment microcystis were flocculated and filtrated at various growth periods without dilution meanwhile the flocculation progresses of the microcystis from 5th day and 20th day were continuously photographed by a camera eos 90d canon during photographing the incubation from 5th day was flocculated without dilution but the 20 day incubation was diluted to an od680nm value of 0 142 which was similar to that of 5 day incubation where the eom concentration in 20 day incubation was also diluted with the same multiples 2 2 2 effect of the biomass of microcystis eom free microcystis cells were diluted in a bg11 medium into several samples with various od values which was consistent with the od values of microcystis at various growth periods and consequently flocculated and filtrated to determine the effect of biomass on the removal efficiency as the removal of eom free cells was relatively low according to our pre experiment the flocculation of eom free cells was prolonged as 5 min to ensure adequate reaction of these cells 2 2 3 effect of the eom concentration and components the eom from 20 days of incubation was also diluted into different concentration with doc from 1 25 to 10 mg l the diluted eom was mixed with the same concentration of eom free cells with od680nm of 0 150 and then flocculated and filtrated to determine the effect of eom concentration on the removal efficiency microcystis culture with od680nm of 0 150 was related to a cell density of 2 106 cells ml to simulate an algal bloom in a high algae laden period 30 meanwhile the removal efficiencies of eom free cells mixed with 5 mg l eom extracted from different growth periods were compared to analyze the effects of the eom components on the flocculation with 1 mg l cpam which were related to the proportion of proteins and polysaccharides 2 2 4 effect of the molecular weight mw distribution of eom eom samples 500 ml gathered on the 20th day was concentrated tenfold with a rotary evaporator ika germany at 20 c 14 the concentrated samples were separated according to mw ranges by continuous centrifugation 4 850 rpm 20 min universal 320 hettich germany through 100k and 30k nmwl ultrafiltration membranes amicon ultra 15 millipore usa in which the eom was divided into fractions of mw 100 30 100 and 30 kda the volume of each fraction was adjusted to 50 ml with purified water and the doc concentration of each fraction was determined to describe the mw distribution of eom 14 moreover the eom fractions with different mw ranges were mixed with eom free microcystis cells which were flocculated and filtrated to identify the effective mw ranges for the formation of large and compact flocs 2 3 scanning electron microscope pictures of flocs the flocs of the eom free cells the eom sample and a mixture of the two from the 20th day were transferred with pipette tips to chips of silicon placed in a culture dish the solution was removed as much as possible after fixation with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight the flocs on the chips were washed with 0 9 normal saline for several times dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol 31 and freeze dried christ germany the flocs were observed and photographed by a scanning electron microscope hitachi s4800 hitachi japan 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 software ibm corp usa a probability value of 0 05 was selected as the threshold level for statistical significance graphs were drawn in origin 2017 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 effect of growth periods on the removal efficiency of microcystis fig 1 a showed the proliferation of microcystis and release of eom over a 25 day incubation the exponential growth period of microcystis was between 5th day to 15th day with an increase of od680nm from 0 142 to 0 662 after 15 days the stationary growth period appeared with od680nm ranging from 0 820 to 0 876 the accumulated concentration of eom gradually increased from 5 01 mg l to 17 95 mg l during the incubation fig 1b showed the removal efficiency of microcystis at different growth periods the initial od680nm value of each growth period was 0 142 0 384 0 663 0 868 and 0 820 respectively the microcystis could not be effectively flocculated after 5 days of incubation with a removal efficiency lower than 40 after 10 days more than 90 of microcystis were removed at 1 2 mg l cpam however further increasing the cpam dosage led to a decrease in removal efficiency after 15 days the removal efficiency increased from 19 64 96 73 as cpam dose increased from 0 5 to 4 mg l but it slightly decreased to 89 93 with 8 mg l cpam after incubation for 20 and 25 days the removal efficiency increased to 96 42 when cpam dosage increased to 3 mg l and remained over 96 with cpam dosage higher than 3 mg l as shown in fig 1c the cells on the 5th day could not be aggregated however when diluted to an od680nm value of 0 142 similar to that of 5 day incubation the 20 day incubation could form large flocs 500 μm under stirring fig 1d thus the incubation time and dosage of cpam significantly affected the removal efficiency overall microcystis can only be effectively flocculated after 10 days of incubation but longer incubation time might increase the consumption of cpam 3 2 effect of biomass and eom concentration of microcystis on the removal efficiency during the incubation both the biomass and eom concentration increased the high removal efficiency after 10 days of incubation might ascribed to the increased biomass or the accumulated eom as shown in fig 2 a the removal efficiencies of microcystis without eom were all less than 50 with 0 25 8 mg l cpam lower than those with eom added as shown in fig 1b meanwhile the od680nm of microcystis varying from 0 142 to 0 862 did not have a z significant effect on the removal efficiency eom free cells were mixed with the eom extracted from the 20 days culture at various concentrations as shown in fig 2b the removal efficiencies increased when cpam dosage increased at first after achieving the highest level the removal efficiency decreased when the cpam dosage further increased when 1 25 mg l eom was added the removal efficiency reached 73 24 at 0 5 mg l cpam and then declined to 5 98 at 3 mg l cpam when 2 5 mg l eom was added it achieved 97 79 at 1 mg l cpam but decreased to 22 2 at 4 mg l cpam as 5 mg l eom was added the highest removal efficiency of 98 95 was found at 2 mg l cpam while further increasing the cpam dosage only caused a slight decline meanwhile the removal efficiency was 98 25 at 3 mg l cpam with 10 mg l eom and no decrease occurred with increasing cpam dosage until the highest tested dosage of 8 mg l the original image and the micrograph of the flocs of microcystis with or without the addition of eom vividly showed the effects of eom on the formation of flocs si fig s1 with 2 5 mg l eom the cells aggregated into large flocs with size far more than 500 μm by 1 mg l cpam conversely without the addition of eom the size of the flocs was less than 100 μm hence increasing the eom concentration induced the formation of large and compact flocs of microcystis and improve the removal efficiency which was over 90 when more than 2 5 mg l eom was added 3 3 effect of eom characteristic on the removal efficiency at the same doc concentration the removal efficiency was 22 64 with eom from the 5 days culture but increased to 95 73 with eom from the 15 days culture and slightly deceased to 87 31 with the eom derived from the periods after the 20th day fig 3 a thus it was determined that the eom characteristics affected the removal efficiency fig 3b showed that the proportion of protein and polysaccharide to eom increased gradually during the growth and achieved the highest value of 0 10 mg mg eom and 0 48 mg mg eom on the 15th day but decreased to 0 06 mg mg eom and 0 37 mg mg eom after the 15th day which was consistent with the removal of microcystis fig 3c hanumanth has reported two different strains of microcystis aeruginosa ma555 and ma564 whose protein concentration was 0 1 mg mg doc and 0 11 mg mg doc respectively and polysaccharide concentration was 0 36 mg mg doc and 1 34 mg mg doc respectively in the stationary stages the concentration of proteins and polysaccharides in our study was lower than that of ma564 but similar to that of ma555 16 after microcystis from the 15th day were flocculated the concentration of proteins decreased by 55 and the concentration of polysaccharides decreased by 32 while the doc content reduced by 25 thus higher protein and polysaccharide concentrations in the eom were benefit for flocculation with cpam 3 4 effect of mw distribution of eom on the removal efficiency as shown in fig 4 a the eom collected from the culture after incubation for 15 days was divided into high mw fraction 100 kda medium mw fraction 30 100 kda and low mw fraction 30 kda the high mw fraction 100 kda account for 23 34 of the eom in terms of doc while 7 49 of the eom was attributed to medium mw fraction 30 100 kda and 69 16 to low mw fraction 30 kda the proportion of protein with high mw medium mw and low mw to the total protein was 53 47 17 76 and 28 76 respectively while the proportion of polysaccharide to the total polysaccharide was 56 54 15 11 and 28 34 respectively the proportion of protein and polysaccharide with high mw was higher than that with low mw which was different from the trends of doc distribution fig 4b showed the removal of microcystis cells with these three fractions of various mw ranges the removal efficiency increased from 11 86 to 85 33 with a high mw fraction concentration increasing from 0 to 2 5 mg l and maintained over 90 with 3 15 mg l high mw fraction meanwhile it gradually increased to 82 4 as the medium mw fraction concentration increased to 15 mg l but slightly decreased to 77 07 as the medium mw fraction further increased to 20 mg l both the addition of high mw fraction and medium mw fraction improve the removal of microcystis however the removal efficiency was less than 20 with 0 20 mg l low mw fraction these results indicate that the mw distribution played a decisive role in the facilitation of eom for the aggregation of cells by cpam 4 discussion after flocculated by cpam microcystis were aggregated into large and compact flocs and consequently effectively removed through filtration cpam was deemed more effective for the flocculation of suspended particles than inorganic flocculants 32 bleeke also observed similarly large flocs formed by cpam 33 however ma used cpam to treat kaolin solution and the flocs were far smaller than those of microcystis 9 except the effectiveness of cpam the specific characteristics of microcystis might also play an important role in the formation of large flocs it was found that the removal efficiency increased during the growth of microcystis as the biomass and eom concentration gradually increased generally flocculation was based on the electrostatic interaction between the cells and the flocculants which was inhibited by increased biomass as the extra cells would compete for flocculants and disturb the destabilization of other cells however the removal efficiency of microcystis after incubation for 10 days with higher biomass exceled that after incubated for only 5 days indicating that effective removal of microcystis could not be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between cpam and the cells it was determined that the eom concentration significantly influenced the removal of microcystis conversely the biomass of microcystis had few effects on the formation of large and compact flocs when the eom was washed away the same phenomenon was found in hanumanth s study where the removal efficiency of microcystis by cationic polymers and air floatation was over 90 but less than 20 when the eom were removed both air floatation and rotary drum filtration suffered from turbulent flow and required large and compact flocs for effective removal 4 34 in which the facilitation of eom for the formation of large and compact flocs was further confirmed the optimal removal efficiency of microcystis increased as the eom concentration increased however the increase of eom concentration caused low removal efficiency at low cpam dosage and required more cpam to achieve optimal removal eom were reported to carry negative functional groups that would compete for the cationic flocculants with the cells pivokonsky found that the eom would combine with ferric iron into complexes to decrease the removal efficiency 35 therefore the eom of microcystis would cause a demand for higher cpam dosages in some studies the inhibition of eom was overcome by adding more flocculants and the removal efficiency achieved a relatively high optimum value 5 however with low eom concentration the removal efficiency of microcystis by cpam and filtration remained low regardless of the cpam dosage it could not be improved unless more eom were added which was contradictory to the inhibition of eom for the interaction between cpam and cells as the removal efficiency relied on the formation of large and compact flocs rather than the destabilization of microcystis the interaction between eom and cpam might facilitate the aggregation of the cells although it influenced the interaction between the cells and cpam the sem results confirmed this conjecture fig 5 when flocculated without eom the cpam covered on the cell surface to destabilize the cells while only a few cpam molecules could bridge between the cells fig 5a the connections were too weak to overcome the hydraulic shear resulting in no large flocs formed under rapid stirring with the addition of eom the bridging materials became stronger which allowed the cells to maintained aggregation under stirring fig 5b the enhanced bridging compound was formed by the complexation between cpam and eom which was proven by the formation of large flocs when the eom was separately flocculated by the cpam fig 5c these results showed that the eom could bridge the cpam molecules and enhance the bridging of cpam between the cells while the cpam could not effectively aggregate the cells on its own when most of the cells were aggregated into large flocs the removal efficiency was over 90 with 1 25 mg l doc the eom only encouraged cpam to aggregate part of the cells because the capacity of eom to bridge the cpam molecules was limited by the eom concentration the eom concentration play an important role in the flocculation of microcystis with cpam to achieve a removal of over 90 more than 2 5 mg l eom is needed for the flocculation however excess eom would consume more cpam the recommended ratio of concentration of cpam and eom is 0 2 0 8 for instance with 2 5 mg l eom 0 5 2 mg l cpam is needed to obtain a removal of over 90 with 5 mg l eom 1 4 mg l cpam is appropriate fig 2b when the ratio of cpam dosage and eom concentration was less than 0 2 the eom concentration was excessive and the aggregation of the cells was weakened as the aggregation was induced by the bridging between eom and cpam the overdosed eom would form a shield around the cpam molecules and invalidate the bridging capacity of eom meanwhile it was found that the removal efficiency turned to decline from the highest level when the ratio was 0 8 for example the removal with the addition of 2 5 mg l eom declined when flocculated with 2 mg l cpam while that with 5 mg l eom declined when flocculated with 4 mg l cpam which could also be attributed to the barrier of cpam surrounding the eom overall the effective flocculation relied on the concentration of cpam and eom which might allow the cpam and the eom to interact and finally enhance aggregation except for the eom concentration the eom components also influenced the formation of large and compact flocs the removal efficiencies of eom free cells with 5 mg l eom from different growth periods varied and had a positive correlation with the proportion of protein and polysaccharide in the eom the proteins and polysaccharides of microcystis have been reported to inhibit the coagulation of inorganic flocculants 19 36 37 this was mainly attributed to the negative functional groups they bear which would compete for flocculants and disturb the destabilization of the cells when flocculated with inorganic flocculants however hanumanth detected that both the proteins and the acid polysaccharides participated in the formation of fiber shape flocs by cationic polyelectrolyte 16 moreover the removal efficiency of proteins and polysaccharides was significantly higher than that of the total eom as the eom was determined to bridge the cpam molecules to enhance the aggregation of microcystis proteins and polysaccharides that represent the polymers with long chain structure were deemed to be essential for the successful removal despite the inhibition of negatively charged eom to negatively charged cells meanwhile the proteins and the polysaccharides were also considered as bridges between the cationic polymers and the cells that enhanced flocculation 16 as both the eom and the surface of cells were negatively charged the connection between eom and cells was achieved by the conjugations of proteins and polysaccharides with the glycoprotein on the cells surface overall the facilitation of proteins and polysaccharides to flocculation can likely be attributed to it bridging between the cpam molecules or between cpam and the cells surface by which the cells could be more strongly aggregated under rapid stirring mw distribution was another eom characteristics influencing the flocculation of microcystis as the role of eom was mainly regarded as bridges the length of eom molecules which was related to the mw might affect the aggregation of the cells the proportion of each mw fraction of the eom was in the order of low mw high mw medium mw however the removal efficiency of the cells with the addition of each fraction was in the following order high mw medium mw low mw the low mw fraction failed to induce the formation of large flocs at various doc concentration this result proved that the formation of large and compact flocs relied on the facilitation of high mw fractions bernhardt found that the removal of high mw eom by flocculation was more effective 15 while the removal of low mw compounds by flocculation was negligible 17 these studies indicated that the interaction between high mw fraction and flocculants tended to form undissolved complexes hanumanth detected that more protein bands of 75 250 kda were observed through sds page for the micorcystis strain which resulted in higher separation relative to chlorella 16 38 supporting the relationship between the high mw fraction and the effective flocculation efficiency both the cpam and the effective eom components bear high mw which indicated a possible interlacement among multiple high mw molecules razali found that cationic polymers with higher mw result in a higher removal efficiency contributing to the bridging mechanism 39 meanwhile eom with high mw polymers with negatively charged functional groups was suggested to combine with several cpam molecules into complexes it was speculated that the cpam molecules kept far from each other due to mutual electrostatic exclusion although the low mw eom with anionic functional groups could also adsorb to the cpam it was unable to carry out effective intermolecular bridging with cpam in contrast high mw polymers owned more binding sites and longer molecule chain which allowed a firm combination between cpam molecules overall the excellent flocculation performance of cpam on microcystis was attributed to its high mw similarly the facilitation of eom to the flocculation relied on its high mw fraction when flocculated without eom added cpam tended to absorbed to the surface of cells and formed small flocs which was more closed to the patch theory 40 but the weak connection could not help the cells aggregate into large flocs eom offered combination between cpam molecules and thus formed a net like structure to bridge or catch the cells more tightly generally electrostatic neutralization could destabilize the suspended cells and introduce their sedimentation but do little help to the aggregation of flocs hydrogen binding and van der waals force could only support the formation of loose flocs therefore the compact flocs were presumed to be formed by the bridging and sweeping of cpam and eom 5 conclusion this study determined the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis at various growth periods with cpam the eom could interact with cpam and thus aggregate the cpam and cells into large and compact flocs under fierce hydraulic shear the high mw fraction 100 kda in eom was identified as effective component for the formation of large flocs while the effect of low mw fraction 30 kda was negligible these findings revealed the facilitation mechanism of eom on the removal of micorcystis by cpam from the perspective of the interaction between cpam and eom which enhances understand the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis in situ flocculation filtration treatment

13552,flocculation filtration treatment with cationic polymers and a rotary drum filter is an effective method to control microcystis bloom by separating microcystis from water however flocculation and corresponding removal are significantly affected by dissolved organic matters of which extracellular organic matter eom of microcystis is the main source during microcystis blooms hence this study investigated the effect of eom on the removal of microcystis by using flocculation with cationic polyacrylamide cpam and filtration with 100 μm filter results showed that the removal efficiency increased with the growth of microcystis and was attributed to the accumulated eom with eom 2 5 mg l extracted from stationary growth period the cells could form large flocs with cpam over 90 of which could be detained by a 100 μm sieve scanning electron microscope images showed that eom interacted with cpam and formed complexes which bridged between the cells more strongly meanwhile the removal was affected by eom characteristics and had a positive correlation with the proportion of protein and polysaccharide in the eom which were usually regarded as polymers the high molecular weight mw 30 kda fraction was thus identified as an effective component in eom to facilitate the formation of large and compact flocs especially the fraction with mw 100 kda this study partly revealed the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis from the perspective of the concentration and characteristic of eom and aid the understanding of the interaction between cpam and high mw eom fraction for the formation of large and compact flocs keywords microcystis extracellular organic matter polyacrylamide flocculation filtration molecular weight 1 introduction the outbreak of microcystis blooms in eutrophic freshwater bodies is becoming a global issue that conduct a serious threats to aquatic ecosystems 1 3 in situ harvesting accumulated microcystis cells from water is a direct and ecological friendly method for the control of cyanobacterial blooms through harvesting the biomass of microcystis and nutrient loading in water are both reduced to protect aquatic ecosystems and the collected microcystis can be further used as biological resources 4 5 sedimentation and filtration processes are often applied to achieve the desired higher removal efficiency of microalgae however sedimentation through centrifugation has a high cost and the high centrifugal force that may adversely affect cell integrity 6 gravity sedimentation has to occupy a large area of land and consume a long time for the settlement of the microalgae and is further limited by the stable suspension of these particles membrane micro ultra filtration processes also attain high biomass concentrations but are easily inhibited by membrane fouling 7 the use of magnetic nanoparticles and ultrasound are being investigated but are yet to be scaled on pilot and commercial scales 8 9 an in situ rotary drum filter covered with 35 μm pore size sieves was used to continuously treat microcystis laden water in lake dianchi which could automatically separate the cyanobacterium from water and remove them with an auto backwashing facility returning relatively cleaner effluent to the lake 4 however microcystis have a wide range of size distribution from single cell to colonies of which the small particles could hardly be detained and result in high residual biomass in the effluent 10 hence flocculation was used as pretreatment to enlarge the sizes of microcystis for higher removal efficiency of rotary drum filter inorganic flocculants e g ferric and aluminum are commonly used for the flocculation of microcystis 11 12 however they require a relatively long time for aggregating microcystis and the flocs are loose and easily broken up 13 considering the short hydraulic retention time within 1 min and fierce hydraulic shear in the rotary drum flocculation by inorganic flocculants is inapplicable as pretreatment in previous study the microcystis could be flocculated into large and compact flocs with a diameter of over 500 μm by cationic polyacrylamide cpam within 30 s and effectively removed by consequent filtration 4 meanwhile the consumption of cpam dosage was only 1 mg l which is far less than that of inorganic flocculants however when the practical operation lasted for 1 year differences were found in the removal efficiency of microcystis with cpam in various seasons for the in situ harvesting in lake dianchi but the cause remained unclear this was probably attributed to the variety of the biomass or the release of extracellular organic matters eom the effect of microcystis biomass has been taken into account in our previous study but the effect of eom has not been systematical studied 4 which usually increases as the biomass increases 14 eom has been considered to promote or inhibit the flocculation of cyanobacterial cells in various studies 13 16 18 for example it has been reported that the eom competed for flocculants 19 20 while hanumanth found that eom could increase the removal efficiency of microcystis 16 the inconsistent results might be attributable to the varied concentration and characteristic of the eom 14 21 cyanobacterial proteins were separated as possible inhibitory organic matter for aluminum 19 nevertheless li found that exopolysaccharides could facilitate flocculation 22 the effect of eom on the flocculation of microcystis with inorganic flocculants has been well studied thus far but inadequate attention has been paid to the effects of eom on the flocculation with cationic polymers 16 hence this study aimed to reveal the role of eom in the harvest of microcystis by using flocculation with cpam and filtration the specific objectives are aimed to 1 determine the removal efficiencies of microcystis through flocculation filtration treatment at different growth periods 2 determine the effects of the concentration and components of eom on the removal of microcystis these studies will help to understand the differences in harvesting microcystis in the in situ treatment and provide proper strategy for effective removal of microcystis 2 materials and methods 2 1 cultivation of microcystis aeruginosa and extraction of eom microcystis aeruginosa fachb905 strain was provided by the freshwater algae culture collection at the institute of hydrobiology china and was incubated in sterile bg11 medium at 25 c with a 12 h light 12 h dark cycle under a light intensity of about 1 800 lx 23 24 after incubation the cultures were centrifuged at 9000 rpm to separate the cells and the eom the precipitate was re suspended in bg11 medium and centrifuged for three times to wash away the residual eom and consequently re suspended in bg11 medium as eom free cells 25 eom samples were obtained by filtering the liquid supernatant with whatman gf c membranes whatman britain and preserved at 20 c until flocculation the eom concentration was monitored as the dissolved organic carbon doc concentration with an automatic toc analyzer vario toc elementar germany 26 the polysaccharide and protein concentration in the eom were determined using the phenol sulfuric acid assay 27 and coomassie brilliant blue staining 28 respectively with a spectrophotometer agilent cary 60 uv vis agilent usa 2 2 flocculation filtration experiment solid cpam was purchased from henan xinwangyuan water purification co ltd china with a mw of 8 107 da with a cationic degree of 40 the flocculation experiment of microcystis was carried out in a 50 ml conical flask under 400 rpm g 213 s 1 stirring within 40 s 4 then the mixture was immediately filtered by a 100 μm pore size stainless steel sieve with a diameter of 50 cm without settlement 29 the area of the sieve was adequately large versus the volume of the samples to avoid mesh blocking the effluent was collected to measure the removal efficiency which was represented by the optical density od at 680 nm 30 1 r e m o v a l e f f i c i e n c y o d m o d n o d m 100 where od m is the od of raw water and od n is the od of the effluent all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 2 1 effect of the growth periods of microcystis to explore the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis at different times in the in situ treatment microcystis were flocculated and filtrated at various growth periods without dilution meanwhile the flocculation progresses of the microcystis from 5th day and 20th day were continuously photographed by a camera eos 90d canon during photographing the incubation from 5th day was flocculated without dilution but the 20 day incubation was diluted to an od680nm value of 0 142 which was similar to that of 5 day incubation where the eom concentration in 20 day incubation was also diluted with the same multiples 2 2 2 effect of the biomass of microcystis eom free microcystis cells were diluted in a bg11 medium into several samples with various od values which was consistent with the od values of microcystis at various growth periods and consequently flocculated and filtrated to determine the effect of biomass on the removal efficiency as the removal of eom free cells was relatively low according to our pre experiment the flocculation of eom free cells was prolonged as 5 min to ensure adequate reaction of these cells 2 2 3 effect of the eom concentration and components the eom from 20 days of incubation was also diluted into different concentration with doc from 1 25 to 10 mg l the diluted eom was mixed with the same concentration of eom free cells with od680nm of 0 150 and then flocculated and filtrated to determine the effect of eom concentration on the removal efficiency microcystis culture with od680nm of 0 150 was related to a cell density of 2 106 cells ml to simulate an algal bloom in a high algae laden period 30 meanwhile the removal efficiencies of eom free cells mixed with 5 mg l eom extracted from different growth periods were compared to analyze the effects of the eom components on the flocculation with 1 mg l cpam which were related to the proportion of proteins and polysaccharides 2 2 4 effect of the molecular weight mw distribution of eom eom samples 500 ml gathered on the 20th day was concentrated tenfold with a rotary evaporator ika germany at 20 c 14 the concentrated samples were separated according to mw ranges by continuous centrifugation 4 850 rpm 20 min universal 320 hettich germany through 100k and 30k nmwl ultrafiltration membranes amicon ultra 15 millipore usa in which the eom was divided into fractions of mw 100 30 100 and 30 kda the volume of each fraction was adjusted to 50 ml with purified water and the doc concentration of each fraction was determined to describe the mw distribution of eom 14 moreover the eom fractions with different mw ranges were mixed with eom free microcystis cells which were flocculated and filtrated to identify the effective mw ranges for the formation of large and compact flocs 2 3 scanning electron microscope pictures of flocs the flocs of the eom free cells the eom sample and a mixture of the two from the 20th day were transferred with pipette tips to chips of silicon placed in a culture dish the solution was removed as much as possible after fixation with 2 5 glutaraldehyde at 4 c overnight the flocs on the chips were washed with 0 9 normal saline for several times dehydrated with different concentrations of ethanol 31 and freeze dried christ germany the flocs were observed and photographed by a scanning electron microscope hitachi s4800 hitachi japan 2 4 statistical analysis statistical analyses were performed using ibm spss statistics 22 software ibm corp usa a probability value of 0 05 was selected as the threshold level for statistical significance graphs were drawn in origin 2017 software originlab usa 3 results 3 1 effect of growth periods on the removal efficiency of microcystis fig 1 a showed the proliferation of microcystis and release of eom over a 25 day incubation the exponential growth period of microcystis was between 5th day to 15th day with an increase of od680nm from 0 142 to 0 662 after 15 days the stationary growth period appeared with od680nm ranging from 0 820 to 0 876 the accumulated concentration of eom gradually increased from 5 01 mg l to 17 95 mg l during the incubation fig 1b showed the removal efficiency of microcystis at different growth periods the initial od680nm value of each growth period was 0 142 0 384 0 663 0 868 and 0 820 respectively the microcystis could not be effectively flocculated after 5 days of incubation with a removal efficiency lower than 40 after 10 days more than 90 of microcystis were removed at 1 2 mg l cpam however further increasing the cpam dosage led to a decrease in removal efficiency after 15 days the removal efficiency increased from 19 64 96 73 as cpam dose increased from 0 5 to 4 mg l but it slightly decreased to 89 93 with 8 mg l cpam after incubation for 20 and 25 days the removal efficiency increased to 96 42 when cpam dosage increased to 3 mg l and remained over 96 with cpam dosage higher than 3 mg l as shown in fig 1c the cells on the 5th day could not be aggregated however when diluted to an od680nm value of 0 142 similar to that of 5 day incubation the 20 day incubation could form large flocs 500 μm under stirring fig 1d thus the incubation time and dosage of cpam significantly affected the removal efficiency overall microcystis can only be effectively flocculated after 10 days of incubation but longer incubation time might increase the consumption of cpam 3 2 effect of biomass and eom concentration of microcystis on the removal efficiency during the incubation both the biomass and eom concentration increased the high removal efficiency after 10 days of incubation might ascribed to the increased biomass or the accumulated eom as shown in fig 2 a the removal efficiencies of microcystis without eom were all less than 50 with 0 25 8 mg l cpam lower than those with eom added as shown in fig 1b meanwhile the od680nm of microcystis varying from 0 142 to 0 862 did not have a z significant effect on the removal efficiency eom free cells were mixed with the eom extracted from the 20 days culture at various concentrations as shown in fig 2b the removal efficiencies increased when cpam dosage increased at first after achieving the highest level the removal efficiency decreased when the cpam dosage further increased when 1 25 mg l eom was added the removal efficiency reached 73 24 at 0 5 mg l cpam and then declined to 5 98 at 3 mg l cpam when 2 5 mg l eom was added it achieved 97 79 at 1 mg l cpam but decreased to 22 2 at 4 mg l cpam as 5 mg l eom was added the highest removal efficiency of 98 95 was found at 2 mg l cpam while further increasing the cpam dosage only caused a slight decline meanwhile the removal efficiency was 98 25 at 3 mg l cpam with 10 mg l eom and no decrease occurred with increasing cpam dosage until the highest tested dosage of 8 mg l the original image and the micrograph of the flocs of microcystis with or without the addition of eom vividly showed the effects of eom on the formation of flocs si fig s1 with 2 5 mg l eom the cells aggregated into large flocs with size far more than 500 μm by 1 mg l cpam conversely without the addition of eom the size of the flocs was less than 100 μm hence increasing the eom concentration induced the formation of large and compact flocs of microcystis and improve the removal efficiency which was over 90 when more than 2 5 mg l eom was added 3 3 effect of eom characteristic on the removal efficiency at the same doc concentration the removal efficiency was 22 64 with eom from the 5 days culture but increased to 95 73 with eom from the 15 days culture and slightly deceased to 87 31 with the eom derived from the periods after the 20th day fig 3 a thus it was determined that the eom characteristics affected the removal efficiency fig 3b showed that the proportion of protein and polysaccharide to eom increased gradually during the growth and achieved the highest value of 0 10 mg mg eom and 0 48 mg mg eom on the 15th day but decreased to 0 06 mg mg eom and 0 37 mg mg eom after the 15th day which was consistent with the removal of microcystis fig 3c hanumanth has reported two different strains of microcystis aeruginosa ma555 and ma564 whose protein concentration was 0 1 mg mg doc and 0 11 mg mg doc respectively and polysaccharide concentration was 0 36 mg mg doc and 1 34 mg mg doc respectively in the stationary stages the concentration of proteins and polysaccharides in our study was lower than that of ma564 but similar to that of ma555 16 after microcystis from the 15th day were flocculated the concentration of proteins decreased by 55 and the concentration of polysaccharides decreased by 32 while the doc content reduced by 25 thus higher protein and polysaccharide concentrations in the eom were benefit for flocculation with cpam 3 4 effect of mw distribution of eom on the removal efficiency as shown in fig 4 a the eom collected from the culture after incubation for 15 days was divided into high mw fraction 100 kda medium mw fraction 30 100 kda and low mw fraction 30 kda the high mw fraction 100 kda account for 23 34 of the eom in terms of doc while 7 49 of the eom was attributed to medium mw fraction 30 100 kda and 69 16 to low mw fraction 30 kda the proportion of protein with high mw medium mw and low mw to the total protein was 53 47 17 76 and 28 76 respectively while the proportion of polysaccharide to the total polysaccharide was 56 54 15 11 and 28 34 respectively the proportion of protein and polysaccharide with high mw was higher than that with low mw which was different from the trends of doc distribution fig 4b showed the removal of microcystis cells with these three fractions of various mw ranges the removal efficiency increased from 11 86 to 85 33 with a high mw fraction concentration increasing from 0 to 2 5 mg l and maintained over 90 with 3 15 mg l high mw fraction meanwhile it gradually increased to 82 4 as the medium mw fraction concentration increased to 15 mg l but slightly decreased to 77 07 as the medium mw fraction further increased to 20 mg l both the addition of high mw fraction and medium mw fraction improve the removal of microcystis however the removal efficiency was less than 20 with 0 20 mg l low mw fraction these results indicate that the mw distribution played a decisive role in the facilitation of eom for the aggregation of cells by cpam 4 discussion after flocculated by cpam microcystis were aggregated into large and compact flocs and consequently effectively removed through filtration cpam was deemed more effective for the flocculation of suspended particles than inorganic flocculants 32 bleeke also observed similarly large flocs formed by cpam 33 however ma used cpam to treat kaolin solution and the flocs were far smaller than those of microcystis 9 except the effectiveness of cpam the specific characteristics of microcystis might also play an important role in the formation of large flocs it was found that the removal efficiency increased during the growth of microcystis as the biomass and eom concentration gradually increased generally flocculation was based on the electrostatic interaction between the cells and the flocculants which was inhibited by increased biomass as the extra cells would compete for flocculants and disturb the destabilization of other cells however the removal efficiency of microcystis after incubation for 10 days with higher biomass exceled that after incubated for only 5 days indicating that effective removal of microcystis could not be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between cpam and the cells it was determined that the eom concentration significantly influenced the removal of microcystis conversely the biomass of microcystis had few effects on the formation of large and compact flocs when the eom was washed away the same phenomenon was found in hanumanth s study where the removal efficiency of microcystis by cationic polymers and air floatation was over 90 but less than 20 when the eom were removed both air floatation and rotary drum filtration suffered from turbulent flow and required large and compact flocs for effective removal 4 34 in which the facilitation of eom for the formation of large and compact flocs was further confirmed the optimal removal efficiency of microcystis increased as the eom concentration increased however the increase of eom concentration caused low removal efficiency at low cpam dosage and required more cpam to achieve optimal removal eom were reported to carry negative functional groups that would compete for the cationic flocculants with the cells pivokonsky found that the eom would combine with ferric iron into complexes to decrease the removal efficiency 35 therefore the eom of microcystis would cause a demand for higher cpam dosages in some studies the inhibition of eom was overcome by adding more flocculants and the removal efficiency achieved a relatively high optimum value 5 however with low eom concentration the removal efficiency of microcystis by cpam and filtration remained low regardless of the cpam dosage it could not be improved unless more eom were added which was contradictory to the inhibition of eom for the interaction between cpam and cells as the removal efficiency relied on the formation of large and compact flocs rather than the destabilization of microcystis the interaction between eom and cpam might facilitate the aggregation of the cells although it influenced the interaction between the cells and cpam the sem results confirmed this conjecture fig 5 when flocculated without eom the cpam covered on the cell surface to destabilize the cells while only a few cpam molecules could bridge between the cells fig 5a the connections were too weak to overcome the hydraulic shear resulting in no large flocs formed under rapid stirring with the addition of eom the bridging materials became stronger which allowed the cells to maintained aggregation under stirring fig 5b the enhanced bridging compound was formed by the complexation between cpam and eom which was proven by the formation of large flocs when the eom was separately flocculated by the cpam fig 5c these results showed that the eom could bridge the cpam molecules and enhance the bridging of cpam between the cells while the cpam could not effectively aggregate the cells on its own when most of the cells were aggregated into large flocs the removal efficiency was over 90 with 1 25 mg l doc the eom only encouraged cpam to aggregate part of the cells because the capacity of eom to bridge the cpam molecules was limited by the eom concentration the eom concentration play an important role in the flocculation of microcystis with cpam to achieve a removal of over 90 more than 2 5 mg l eom is needed for the flocculation however excess eom would consume more cpam the recommended ratio of concentration of cpam and eom is 0 2 0 8 for instance with 2 5 mg l eom 0 5 2 mg l cpam is needed to obtain a removal of over 90 with 5 mg l eom 1 4 mg l cpam is appropriate fig 2b when the ratio of cpam dosage and eom concentration was less than 0 2 the eom concentration was excessive and the aggregation of the cells was weakened as the aggregation was induced by the bridging between eom and cpam the overdosed eom would form a shield around the cpam molecules and invalidate the bridging capacity of eom meanwhile it was found that the removal efficiency turned to decline from the highest level when the ratio was 0 8 for example the removal with the addition of 2 5 mg l eom declined when flocculated with 2 mg l cpam while that with 5 mg l eom declined when flocculated with 4 mg l cpam which could also be attributed to the barrier of cpam surrounding the eom overall the effective flocculation relied on the concentration of cpam and eom which might allow the cpam and the eom to interact and finally enhance aggregation except for the eom concentration the eom components also influenced the formation of large and compact flocs the removal efficiencies of eom free cells with 5 mg l eom from different growth periods varied and had a positive correlation with the proportion of protein and polysaccharide in the eom the proteins and polysaccharides of microcystis have been reported to inhibit the coagulation of inorganic flocculants 19 36 37 this was mainly attributed to the negative functional groups they bear which would compete for flocculants and disturb the destabilization of the cells when flocculated with inorganic flocculants however hanumanth detected that both the proteins and the acid polysaccharides participated in the formation of fiber shape flocs by cationic polyelectrolyte 16 moreover the removal efficiency of proteins and polysaccharides was significantly higher than that of the total eom as the eom was determined to bridge the cpam molecules to enhance the aggregation of microcystis proteins and polysaccharides that represent the polymers with long chain structure were deemed to be essential for the successful removal despite the inhibition of negatively charged eom to negatively charged cells meanwhile the proteins and the polysaccharides were also considered as bridges between the cationic polymers and the cells that enhanced flocculation 16 as both the eom and the surface of cells were negatively charged the connection between eom and cells was achieved by the conjugations of proteins and polysaccharides with the glycoprotein on the cells surface overall the facilitation of proteins and polysaccharides to flocculation can likely be attributed to it bridging between the cpam molecules or between cpam and the cells surface by which the cells could be more strongly aggregated under rapid stirring mw distribution was another eom characteristics influencing the flocculation of microcystis as the role of eom was mainly regarded as bridges the length of eom molecules which was related to the mw might affect the aggregation of the cells the proportion of each mw fraction of the eom was in the order of low mw high mw medium mw however the removal efficiency of the cells with the addition of each fraction was in the following order high mw medium mw low mw the low mw fraction failed to induce the formation of large flocs at various doc concentration this result proved that the formation of large and compact flocs relied on the facilitation of high mw fractions bernhardt found that the removal of high mw eom by flocculation was more effective 15 while the removal of low mw compounds by flocculation was negligible 17 these studies indicated that the interaction between high mw fraction and flocculants tended to form undissolved complexes hanumanth detected that more protein bands of 75 250 kda were observed through sds page for the micorcystis strain which resulted in higher separation relative to chlorella 16 38 supporting the relationship between the high mw fraction and the effective flocculation efficiency both the cpam and the effective eom components bear high mw which indicated a possible interlacement among multiple high mw molecules razali found that cationic polymers with higher mw result in a higher removal efficiency contributing to the bridging mechanism 39 meanwhile eom with high mw polymers with negatively charged functional groups was suggested to combine with several cpam molecules into complexes it was speculated that the cpam molecules kept far from each other due to mutual electrostatic exclusion although the low mw eom with anionic functional groups could also adsorb to the cpam it was unable to carry out effective intermolecular bridging with cpam in contrast high mw polymers owned more binding sites and longer molecule chain which allowed a firm combination between cpam molecules overall the excellent flocculation performance of cpam on microcystis was attributed to its high mw similarly the facilitation of eom to the flocculation relied on its high mw fraction when flocculated without eom added cpam tended to absorbed to the surface of cells and formed small flocs which was more closed to the patch theory 40 but the weak connection could not help the cells aggregate into large flocs eom offered combination between cpam molecules and thus formed a net like structure to bridge or catch the cells more tightly generally electrostatic neutralization could destabilize the suspended cells and introduce their sedimentation but do little help to the aggregation of flocs hydrogen binding and van der waals force could only support the formation of loose flocs therefore the compact flocs were presumed to be formed by the bridging and sweeping of cpam and eom 5 conclusion this study determined the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis at various growth periods with cpam the eom could interact with cpam and thus aggregate the cpam and cells into large and compact flocs under fierce hydraulic shear the high mw fraction 100 kda in eom was identified as effective component for the formation of large flocs while the effect of low mw fraction 30 kda was negligible these findings revealed the facilitation mechanism of eom on the removal of micorcystis by cpam from the perspective of the interaction between cpam and eom which enhances understand the differences in the removal efficiency of microcystis in situ flocculation filtration treatment

13553,this study was carried out to investigate the potential of scirpus grossus in polishing final discharge of palm oil mill effluent pome the removal of total suspended solids tss and chemical oxygen demand cod from pome by s grossus was conducted in two different flow systems a sub surface ss and a free surface fs batch constructed wetland cw systems s grossus was exposed to pome for 30 days it was found that s grossus plants performed better in tss removal from pome in both systems 98 as compared with unplanted treatments 85 plants developed root mats which increased the filtration efficiency leading to a reduction of tss during the treatment period additionally on day 7 the tss removal by the fs system was higher than that by the ss system with concentrations of 8 and 99 mg l respectively on that day the content of suspended solids in pome was believed to help this happen as a system with more suspended solids will sediment faster than a system with less suspended solids the removal of cod on the other hand did not differ between the two flow systems or between treatments with and without plants 96 97 indicating that sand medium played a significant role in cod removal from pome it can be concluded that treatment combining sand medium s grossus and the fs system is highly capable of polishing tss and cod in final discharged pome cw could be a promising green

the water used during the extraction of crude palm oil from fresh fruit bunches ends up as palm oil mill effluent pome 1 pome is an acidic thick brownish liquid with high levels of total solids 47 050 mg l oil and grease 37 883 mg l chemical oxygen demand cod 89 591 mg l and biochemical oxygen demand bod 34 771 mg l 2 this is due to the presence of lignocelluloses and hemicellulose from the fruit 3 therefore it is a necessity to treat and finally cleanse the pome of pollutants before discharge into the environment the ponding system which encompasses several anaerobic and facultative ponds has been adopted by most of the palm oil mills in malaysia for treatment of their effluents 4 ponding systems are easy to operate but require more land and a relatively long hydraulic retention time hrt of 45 60 days generate bad odour and show difficulty in maintaining the liquor distribution and biogas collection 5 6 various types of polishing technology have been studied to find their effectiveness in improving the quality of pome effluent the polishing technologies that can be applied in pome treatment include advanced oxidation processes aops 7 membrane technologies 8 9

which the media frequently used in cw is usually gravel or sand that acts as support for the plants to grow 18 19 in recent years phytoremediation which utilizes natural resources from plants has been vastly explored by researchers to remediate organic and inorganic effluent for example salvinia cucullata chenopodium album l ricinus communis ranunculus sceleratus rumex dentatus eclipta alba l alternanthera philoxeroide l 20 22 scirpus grossus azolla pinnata salvinia molesta and water hyacinth 23 24 were used to further polish recycled pulp and paper effluent to obtain a better quality of effluent as for pome floating and emergent plant species for example eichhornia crassipes 25 azolla pinnata 13 lemna minor 13 26 chrysopogon zizanioides l 27 pennisetum purpureum 12 and ipomoea aquatica forsk 28 were used to study the removal efficiencies of cod bod and total suspended solids tss from pome according to studies the emergent plant c zizanioides l has the ability to remove cod and bod 90 and 94 respectively at high cod and bod concentrations 810 and 400 mg l respectively 27 as compared to floating plants 200 250 mg l 13 25 as far as we are aware there are no studies utilizing the malaysian native emergent plant species scirpus grossus as a phytoremediator in treating pome this plant species has good potential to treat pome since it has been proven that it can degrade hydrocarbons in diesel 29 30 efficiently remove dyes from contaminated medium 31 32 and successfully enhance the adsorption of heavy metals fe al cr pb from water 33 39 as well as having the capability to polish recycled paper mill effluent 23 24 sago mill effluent 40 and domestic wastewater 18 41 42 therefore based on the outstanding capability of s grossus it was selected to phytoremediate pome the objective of this study was to determine the potential removal of tss and cod from pome by s grossus and to compare the performance of the sub surface ss and free surface fs batch cw systems in polishing pome 2 materials and methods 2 1 propagation of plants s grossus is an indigenous plant species in malaysia known locally as rumput menderong it is a plant with bisexual grouped flowers fig 1 b simple leaves fig 1 c hollow and triangular cross cut stems fig 1 d and fibrous roots fig 1 e 39 it can grow more than 2 m long wide garden soil with a composition of 3 2 1 topsoil organic sand was used as the propagation medium s grossus was collected from tasik chini pahang malaysia and propagated from rhizome in crates 58 cm 30 cm 20 cm at a greenhouse in universiti kebangsaan malaysia these plants were consistently watered until the saplings reached six weeks old saplings at this age had an average mass of 12 g and were harvested to facilitate phytoremediation of pome at this age the s grossus plants exhibited a rapid period of growth log phase that could remediate the pome it is advisable to avoid using s grossus plants that are approaching the diminishing phase when plants will grow more slowly and finally stop growing stationary phase week 24 in this phase the effectiveness of treatment is expected to be decreased 2 2 characterization of pome pome was collected from a palm mill in dengkil malaysia in clean containers immediately brought to the laboratory and preserved at 4 c the palm oil mill comprises nine anaerobic ponds and six aerobic ponds altogether to treat raw pome produced by the mill the pome was treated using the existing ponds and then discharged to the nearby river the collection point of pome was from the ponds raw pome and also from the discharge point treated pome the samples collected were characterized to determine their ph cod ammonia nitrogen and tss 2 3 bio polishing of pome using scirpus grossus in constructed wetland the phytoremediation study was conducted in a greenhouse of universiti kebangsaan malaysia the study was carried out for 30 days with two types of batch constructed wetland cw systems ss and fs in the ss batch system the pome was at the same level as the fine sand fig 2 a while in the fs batch system it was 5 cm above the fine sand fig 2 b each cw system consisted of treatments with and without plants in triplicate r1 r2 and r3 a number of 12 batch cws made of high density polyethylene hdpe crate with dimensions of 58 cm 30 cm 20 cm l w d were used as the whole experimental setup each was filled with 30 kg of fine sand with minimal contents of macro and micronutrients in order to observe the direct toxicity effect of the pome towards s grossus 34 43 treatments with plants were planted with ten saplings of s grossus represented by in fig 2 c about 5 l of pome was poured into each ss cw whereas 7 l of pome was poured into each fs cw healthy saplings were transferred into the cw system treatment with plants with a density of 57 saplings m2 the initial level of pome was marked and tap water was added on average once every two days to maintain the level water samples were taken during days 0 7 14 21 and 30 2 4 analytical methods for ph cod ammonia nitrogen and tss analytical determination of ph was done using an iq 150 multiprobe iq scientific instruments usa cod and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 n of pome were determined using uv spectrophotometer hach test kits dr6000 hach company usa the methods involved were method 8000 44 and 8038 13 18 respectively analysis of tss was done using the filtration technique samples were shaken to obtain homogenous mixing and filtered through a 0 45 μm cellulose membrane filter whatman uk the filter cake obtained was dried at 110 5 c in an mmm laboratory oven venticell 707 comfort germany for 3 days 45 and weighed 2 5 statistical analysis the experimental data were statistically evaluated using spss statistics version 21 spss inc usa and at 95 confidence limits for the data 16 a significance level of p 0 05 was used the tss and cod removal dependent factors according to the cw system treatment with and without plants and exposure period independent factors were analyzed using a two way analysis of variance anova 46 47 34 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of pome table 1 shows the characterization of raw pome and treated pome final discharge it was compared with the environmental quality act 2009 for industrial effluents 48 this act specifies two standards for effluent discharge standards a and b according to the department of environment doe malaysia 48 industrial effluents with concentration parameter values greater than those listed in standard a should not be discharged into any inland waters within the catchment areas while industrial effluents having concentration parameter values greater than the limits listed in standard b should not be discharged into any other inland waters standard a has lower parameter concentrations to ensure the sustainability of the existing environment since this effluent will be discharged within the catchment areas as listed in table 1 the concentrations of cod ammonia nitrogen and tss in raw pome exceed the limits of both standards the high concentration of these parameters is due to the cell walls organelles short fibres a variety of carbohydrates a range of nitrogenous compounds free organic acids and an assembly of minor organic and mineral constituents from the oil palm fresh fruit 4 therefore the raw pome was conventionally treated by the ponding systems available in the mill the ph and concentrations of cod ammonia nitrogen and tss should be below the limits specified by standard a in order to be discharged into the river however the mill has obtained permission from doe malaysia to utilize its treated pome as soil fertilizer and thus the treated effluent was not discharged to river after being subjected to a few treatment processes the ph 8 4 and concentrations of ammonia nitrogen 18 mg l were within 5 5 9 0 and below 20 mg l the limits given by standard b respectively but the concentrations of cod 410 mg l and tss 130 mg l were still above the standard b limits 200 and 100 mg l respectively since the existing ponding treatment system show inadequacy in removing tss and cod below the threshold set by the doe this effluent from the final discharge treated pome needs to be further polished therefore treated pome will be further polished via phytoremediation to reduce the concentration of cod and tss below the standard limits set by the doe to protect the sustainability of the environment 3 2 removal of total suspended solids tss fig 3 illustrates the concentration of tss for both cw systems ss and fs for treatments with and without plants on days 0 7 14 21 and 30 in general the concentrations of tss in both systems and treatments decreased as the exposure time increased and thus the tss removal increased throughout the exposure period the tss reduction and increment trend of tss removal in the treatment without plants prove that the medium itself may reduce tss in the pome through physical sand filtration the suspended solids were settled down and later trapped in the sand this is similar to the findings of said et al 49 who used phragmites karka to polish tss colour and cod from coffee mill effluent in addition the tss removal was significantly higher at p 0 05 for treatments with plants than for treatments without plants represented by the letter b in fig 3 also the presence of plants in the systems significantly enhanced the removal of tss by 3 6 34 7 the existence of fibrous roots in the treatments with plants played an essential role in trapping tss physically together with sand medium throughout the exposure period in addition tss of pome consisting organic solids which are trapped in sand and plant roots will be gradually degraded by rhizosphere to soluble sources for plant and microbe growth 50 51 the maximum tss removal achieved by ss and fs in treatments with plants was 99 in line with the findings observed for tss removal from sago mill effluent 44 on day 7 the removal of tss in treatments with plants decreased to 99 mg l for the ss system and 8 mg l for the fs system below the limits of standards b 100 mg l and a 50 mg l respectively according to gorgoglione and torretta 52 suspended solids might be removed by sedimentation as well as by filtration through plants that finally resulted in higher removal in fs system compared to the ss system there was more sedimentation in the fs system since it used a volume of 7 l compared with 5 l in the ss system thus allowing the fs system to achieve higher tss removal on day 7 the additional tss in upper water layer in fs system settled down on the medium surface and trapped within the sand and roots whereas in ss system the tss was already within and trapped in the sand medium and plant roots there was a statistically significant interaction at p 0 05 within systems treatments and exposure times table 2 a the statistics indicate that the removal of tss was better in the fs system than in the ss system due to faster and higher removal rate in the early exposure days fig 3 in the treatments with plants than in treatments without plants and as the exposure period increased there was also a statistically significant interaction between system time treatment time and system treatment time 3 3 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod fig 4 demonstrates the concentration of cod by both the ss and the fs batch cw system on days 0 7 14 21 and 30 the concentrations of cod in both systems and treatments i e with and without plants decreased as the exposure time increased thus increasing the removal of cod throughout the exposure period the overall cod removal efficiency was 97 in the planted ss system and 96 in the planted fs system fig 4 also no significant difference p 0 05 was observed for cod in both systems table 2 b in addition there was no significant difference between treatments with and without plants represented by letter b for cod removal fig 4 and table 2 b the decreased cod was mainly due to the sand medium and minor participation by the plants these results contradicted those of achak et al 53 in which they found that the existence of phragmites australis typha latifolia and arundo donax could enhance the removal of cod by almost 20 after the sand filter this might be due to the application of gravel and soil the gravel prevents asphyxiation conditions of the roots ensuring normal growth of the plants while the larger pore size of soil allows the transport of large particles such as organic molecules and bacteria 54 55 other studies conducted by al sbani et al 46 al mansoory et al 56 and al sbani et al 47 that applied gravel and soil during the phytoremediation of organic contaminants proved the existence of anoxic condition throughout the treatment period it is recommended that in a future study a layer of gravel and soil be added on the top of the sand layer in the reactor although no significant cod removal by planted and non planted cws but it has significant impact on tss removal according to selvamurugan et al 50 and berendsen et al 51 cod removal is due to the activities of microbes that can degrade organic carbons supplying good sources for both plant and microbe growth thus healthy plants with good rooting system assist tss removal besides there was no significant interaction between all parameters table 2 b since the removal were not very different in both treatments and systems cod represents the amount of oxygen needed to oxidize organic and inorganic material through chemical pathways 44 the pome complied with the standard a limit 80 mg l the removal of cod from pome by s grossus in this study was 97 when compared with the cod removal from pulp and paper mill effluent 66 24 and sago mill effluent 88 44 it can therefore be concluded that the treatment with plants and under the fs system could be considered as a possible alternative to polish pome for the remediation of tss and cod 3 4 removal performance of other plant species and polishing methods for pome the performance of s grossus in polishing pome is better than that of other plant species as reported in table 3 c zizanioides l and i aquatica forsk will be used as the nearest comparison to s grossus as they are both emergent plants s grossus was able to polish cod from pome with 90 removal on day 7 while c zizanioides l and i aquatica forsk showed removal rates of 39 and 86 5 respectively the highest removal was achieved when using s grossus even though the initial concentration of cod in pome used in the treatment was the highest 1700 mg l compared to the other studies 721 and 1003 mg l respectively the cod used in this study was in the range of 1 7 2 4 fold more concentrated as compared to research conducted by darajeh et al 27 and zulfahmi et al 28 respectively it can be concluded that s grossus was 56 7 better in removing cod from pome at 1700 cod mg l 90 removal on day 7 than c zizanioides l at 721 cod mg l 39 at day 14 this is due to the differences in the plant rooting systems of the two plant species and also environmental parameters such as soil type and texture and climate 57 58 besides emergent plants floating plant species were also used to treat pome as listed in table 3 compared to emergent plants floating plants are less resistant more suitable for phytotreatment of pome at lower cod concentrations and require a longer treatment period selection of different plant species will affect the removal efficiencies of treatment another factor that influences the removal efficiency is the selection of polishing technologies table 4 one of the treatment technologies used to polish pome categorized under aop is photocatalysis it can be seen that the cod and tss removal performance varied from 55 to almost 100 adsorption using activated carbon seems a very promising polishing technology to treat pome since this technology was able to reduce almost 100 of high cod 4700 mg l and tss 1800 mg l concentrations but the adsorbent cost incurred by industry would hinder its application different polishing technologies have various removal efficiencies of cod and tss therefore appropriate polishing technology should be selected to treat pome with specific cod and tss concentrations to ensure that the maximum removal is achieved furthermore another consideration when selecting polishing technology for pome is the byproduct produced after the treatment it is worth observing that with the polishing technologies listed in table 4 and phytoremediation secondary sludge or waste can be unintentionally created in a study conducted by alshekhli et al 60 s grossus was processed as adsorbent to remove methylene blue from contaminated water the drawback of using treated s grossus to treat methylene blue is that the sludge produced was categorized as hazardous waste and therefore could not be converted into soil conditioner or feedstock contributing no assurance on sustainability therefore this approach does not meet the sustainable development goals sdgs the sdgs adopted by all united nations member states in 2015 recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others and that development must balance social economic and environmental sustainability 61 hence another approach was taken by converting the treated plants post treatment of pome into feedstock for phytoremediation of pome the content of ammoniacal nitrogen in the pome was proven to increase the carbohydrate and protein content in foliating aquatic plants 13 high contents of carbohydrate and protein highlight the ability of treating plants post treatment of pome to provide additional value through conversion into feedstock 3 5 future research opportunities in this study phytotechnology was used to polish pome the native plant species s grossus was able to further polish pome with cod and tss removal efficiencies of up to 90 within 7 days in fs system future studies should focus on a few matters to ensure the readiness of phytoremediation for real applications according to akhbari et al 62 an amount of 650 000 l day of pome is generated with every 1000 tons of fresh fruit bunch processed per day based on our findings on batch fs system the volume of pome that can be treated by 1 m2 is 40 3 l thus the area required to phytotreat an effluent loading of 650 000 l day might be more than one acre and hence there is a need to look for further improvement that would allow the area required for treatment to be reduced such as the use of continuous mode treatment with multiple stages in which continuous operation can cater for a higher volume of effluent while minimizing the area requirement in addition the phytoremediation process can also be enhanced by integrating microorganisms bacteria fungi algae enzymes etc in the treatment another issue normally raised when phytoremediation is selected to treat a contaminated medium is the fate of the plants after treatment treatment of plant species post phytotreatment should be applied carefully so that they will not create another waste in order to achieve zero waste discharge instead of targeting zero waste which is too ideal to be achieved researchers need to study the potential of plants so that they can be reused or converted into value added products in the system to ensure a positive impact on social and environmental sustainability and financial aspects as suggested by the united nations development programme 61 even though a lot more research work should be done before phytotechnology can be adopted by industry we shall never give up on gathering and strengthening the fundamentals of this research part on phytoremediation 4 conclusions after 30 days of the treatment period it was be observed that sand and s grossus had assisted the removal of tss 40 99 and cod 81 98 the ability of s grossus was proven to have significantly assisted the removal of tss rather than cod future studies need to be conducted using different substrates such as gravel and soil since they contribute positively to cod removal by other plants in addition it was observed that the fs system showed faster removal of tss than the ss system the findings demonstrated the potential and capability of treatments with the native plant s grossus for polishing tss and cod from final discharged pome and that the fs system performed better than the ss system the application of s grossus in a cw system is considered green for the environment as it does not produce products that may further contaminate the environment since after treatment the plants have the potential to be converted into feedstock declaration of competing interest the authors report no declarations of interest acknowledgements the authors would like to extend their gratitude to the ministry of higher education malaysia the faculty of engineering and

and fs for treatments with and without plants on days 0 7 14 21 and 30 in general the concentrations of tss in both systems and treatments decreased as the exposure time increased and thus the tss removal increased throughout the exposure period the tss reduction and increment trend of tss removal in the treatment without plants prove that the medium itself may reduce tss in the pome through physical sand filtration the suspended solids were settled down and later trapped in the sand this is similar to the findings of said et al 49 who used phragmites karka to polish tss colour and cod from coffee mill effluent in addition the tss removal was significantly higher at p 0 05 for treatments with plants than for treatments without plants represented by the letter b in fig 3 also the presence of plants in the systems significantly enhanced the removal of tss by 3 6 34 7 the existence of fibrous roots in the treatments with plants played an essential role in trapping tss physically together with sand medium throughout the exposure period in addition tss of pome consisting organic solids which are trapped in sand and plant roots will be gradually degraded by rhizosphere to soluble sources for plant and microbe growth 50 51 the maximum tss removal achieved by ss and fs in treatments with plants was 99 in line with the findings observed for tss removal from sago mill effluent 44 on day 7 the removal of tss in treatments with plants decreased to 99 mg l for the ss system and 8 mg l for the fs system below the limits of standards b 100 mg l and a 50 mg l respectively according to gorgoglione and torretta 52 suspended solids might be removed by sedimentation as well as by filtration through plants that finally resulted in higher removal in fs system compared to the ss system there was more sedimentation in the fs system since it used a volume of 7 l compared with 5 l in the ss system thus allowing the fs system to achieve higher tss removal on day 7 the additional tss in upper water layer in fs system settled down on the medium surface and trapped within the sand and roots whereas in ss system the tss was already within and trapped in the sand medium and plant roots there was a statistically significant interaction at p 0 05 within systems treatments and exposure times table 2 a the statistics indicate that the removal of tss was better in the fs system than in the ss system due to faster and higher removal rate in the early exposure days fig 3 in the treatments with plants than in treatments without plants and as the exposure period increased there was also a statistically significant interaction between system time treatment time and system treatment time 3 3 removal of chemical oxygen demand cod fig 4 demonstrates the concentration of cod by both the ss and the fs batch cw system on days 0 7 14 21 and 30 the concentrations of cod in both systems and treatments i e with and without plants decreased as the exposure time increased thus increasing the removal of cod throughout the exposure period the overall cod removal efficiency was 97 in the planted ss system and 96 in the planted fs system fig 4 also no significant difference p 0 05 was observed for cod in both systems table 2 b in addition there was no significant difference between treatments with and without plants represented by letter b for cod removal fig 4 and table 2 b the decreased cod was mainly due to the sand medium and minor participation by the plants these results contradicted those of achak et al 53 in which they found that the existence of phragmites australis typha latifolia and arundo donax could enhance the removal of cod by almost 20 after the sand filter this might be due to the application of gravel and soil the gravel prevents asphyxiation conditions of the roots ensuring normal growth of the plants while the larger pore size of soil allows the transport of large particles such as organic molecules and bacteria 54 55 other studies conducted by al sbani et al 46 al mansoory et al 56 and al sbani et al 47 that applied gravel and soil during the phytoremediation of organic contaminants proved the existence of anoxic condition throughout the treatment period it is recommended that in a future study a layer of gravel and soil be added on the top of the sand layer in the reactor although no significant cod removal by planted and non planted cws but it has significant impact on tss removal according to selvamurugan et al 50 and berendsen et al 51 cod removal is due to the activities of microbes that can degrade organic carbons supplying good sources for both plant and microbe growth thus healthy plants with good rooting system assist tss removal besides there was no significant interaction between all parameters table 2 b since the removal were not very different in both treatments and systems cod represents the amount of oxygen needed to oxidize organic and inorganic material through chemical pathways 44 the pome complied with the standard a limit 80 mg l the removal of cod from pome by s grossus in this study was 97 when compared with the cod removal from pulp and paper mill effluent 66 24 and sago mill effluent 88 44 it can therefore be concluded that the treatment with plants and under the fs system could be considered as a possible alternative to polish pome for the remediation of tss and cod 3 4 removal performance of other plant species and polishing methods for pome the performance of s grossus in polishing pome is better than that of other plant species as reported in table 3 c zizanioides l and i aquatica forsk will be used as the nearest comparison to s grossus as they are both emergent plants s grossus was able to polish cod from pome with 90 removal on day 7 while c zizanioides l and i aquatica forsk showed removal rates of 39 and 86 5 respectively the highest removal was achieved when using s grossus even though the initial concentration of cod in pome used in the treatment was the highest 1700 mg l compared to the other studies 721 and 1003 mg l respectively the cod used in this study was in the range of 1 7 2 4 fold more concentrated as compared to research conducted by darajeh et al 27 and zulfahmi et al 28 respectively it can be concluded that s grossus was 56 7 better in removing cod from pome at 1700 cod mg l 90 removal on day 7 than c zizanioides l at 721 cod mg l 39 at day 14 this is due to the differences in the plant rooting systems of the two plant species and also environmental parameters such as soil type and texture and climate 57 58 besides emergent plants floating plant species were also used to treat pome as listed in table 3 compared to emergent plants floating plants are less resistant more suitable for phytotreatment of pome at lower cod concentrations and require a longer treatment period selection of different plant species will affect the removal efficiencies of treatment another factor that influences the removal efficiency is the selection of polishing technologies table 4 one of the treatment technologies used to polish pome categorized under aop is photocatalysis it can be seen that the cod and tss removal performance varied from 55 to almost 100 adsorption using activated carbon seems a very promising polishing technology to treat pome since this technology was able to reduce almost 100 of high cod 4700 mg l and tss 1800 mg l concentrations but the adsorbent cost incurred by industry would hinder its application different polishing technologies have various removal efficiencies of cod and tss therefore appropriate polishing technology should be selected to treat pome with specific cod and tss concentrations to ensure that the maximum removal is achieved furthermore another consideration when selecting polishing technology for pome is the byproduct produced after the treatment it is worth observing that with the polishing technologies listed in table 4 and phytoremediation secondary sludge or waste can be unintentionally created in a study conducted by alshekhli et al 60 s grossus was processed as adsorbent to remove methylene blue from contaminated water the drawback of using treated s grossus to treat methylene blue is that the sludge produced was categorized as hazardous waste and therefore could not be converted into soil conditioner or feedstock contributing no assurance on sustainability therefore this approach does not meet the sustainable development goals sdgs the sdgs adopted by all united nations member states in 2015 recognize that action in one area will affect outcomes in others and that development must balance social economic and environmental sustainability 61 hence another approach was taken by converting the treated plants post treatment of pome into feedstock for phytoremediation of pome the content of ammoniacal nitrogen in the pome was proven to increase the carbohydrate and protein content in foliating aquatic plants 13 high contents of carbohydrate and protein highlight the ability of treating plants post treatment of pome to provide additional value through conversion into feedstock 3 5 future research opportunities in this study phytotechnology was used to polish pome the native plant species s grossus was able to further polish pome with cod and tss removal efficiencies of up to 90 within 7 days in fs system future studies should focus on a few matters to ensure the readiness of phytoremediation for real applications according to akhbari et al 62 an amount of 650 000 l day of pome is generated with every 1000 tons of fresh fruit bunch processed per day based on our findings on batch fs system the volume of pome that can be treated by 1 m2 is 40 3 l thus the area required to phytotreat an effluent loading of 650 000 l day might be more than one acre and hence there is a need to look for further improvement that would allow the area required for treatment to be reduced such as the use of continuous mode treatment with multiple stages in which continuous operation can cater for a higher volume of effluent while minimizing the area requirement in addition the phytoremediation process can also be enhanced by integrating microorganisms bacteria fungi algae enzymes etc in the treatment another issue normally raised when phytoremediation is selected to treat a contaminated medium is the fate of the plants after treatment treatment of plant species post phytotreatment should be applied carefully so that they will not create another waste in order to achieve zero waste discharge instead of targeting zero waste which is too ideal to be achieved researchers need to study the potential of plants so that they can be reused or converted into value added products in the system to ensure a positive impact on social and environmental sustainability and financial aspects as suggested by the united nations development programme 61 even though a lot more research work should be done before phytotechnology can be adopted by industry we shall never give up on gathering and strengthening the fundamentals of this research part on phytoremediation 4 conclusions after 30 days of the treatment period it was be observed that sand and s grossus had assisted the removal of tss 40 99 and cod 81 98 the ability of s grossus was proven to have significantly assisted the removal of tss rather than cod future studies need to be conducted using different substrates such as gravel and soil since they contribute positively to cod removal by other plants in addition it was observed that the fs system showed faster removal of tss than the ss system the findings demonstrated the potential and capability of treatments with the native plant s grossus for polishing tss and cod from final discharged pome and that the fs system performed better than the ss system the application of s grossus in a cw system is considered green for the environment as it does not produce products that may further contaminate the environment since after treatment the plants have the potential to be converted into feedstock declaration of competing

13554,hazardous organic pollutants have been attracting heightened interest in recent years due to their persisting properties low biodegradability and negative influence on aquatic life wildlife and humans even at low concentrations considering their dangerous effect on the environment several treatments using different techniques were adopted to remove them from water and wastewater herein electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops especially anodic oxidation ao electro fenton ef heterogeneous electro fenton hef and photoelectro fenton pef have been thoroughly reviewed and found to be promising compared to conventional methods the state of the art of the previous treatment processes has been discussed in detail where each technique has its own merits and challenges these processes depend on their operating conditions mainly ph current density nature of electrodes used and conductivity of the solution etc the efficiencies of eaops follows the order as pef ef ao and can mineralize the recalcitrant organic pollutants completely keywords organic pollutants wastewater treatment degradation mineralization electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops 1 introduction nowadays water pollution has been considered a global concern which needs to be respected considering the negative impact of contaminated water and the limitation of drinking water sources 1 many industries required in the modern world release toxic compounds into the environment they have recently gained great interest due to their persisting properties and hazardous effects on wildlife and human beings some of these compounds are water soluble and defined in the stockholm convention as a group of mostly man made chemicals with a carbon based structure produced for industrial purposes 2 3 some organic pollutants are recalcitrant and remain intact in the environment for a long time furthermore they have a greater capacity to migrate through food chains with a higher potential for bioaccumulation 4 wastewaters composition depends on its origin where they may contain dyestuffs solvents and persistant organic pollutants pops such as pesticides and industrial by products of various elemental compositions i e polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perfluorinated compounds dioxins dioxanes and others 2 currently the removal of these pollutants from water sources is vital and important due to their toxicity and their impact on human health animals and plants concerning the wastewater treatment field the choice of the treatment procedure varies according to effluent and pollutant types in reality water or wastewater treatment facilities rarely contain an individual process instead they have a series of techniques typically wastewater treatment involves physical chemical and biological processes before discharging the treated wastewater into the environment wastewater treatment plants may contain separation and degradation techniques generally degradation processes can be grouped into two categories biological and chemical processes chemical processes and advanced oxidation processes aops are recommended when biological treatments are not able to reduce pollution from wastewater 5 the combination of several methods is necessary when the removal of different contaminants is needed 6 aops are environmentalfriendly methods in which organic matters are destroyed until their mineralization by hydroxyl radicals oh generated in situ 7 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops had gained much interest in the wastewater treatment field having environmental compatibility where the main reagent is an electron hydroxyl radicals are generated in electrolytic system by the external addition of catalyst as in the case of electro fenton ef process or anodic oxidation of water as in the case of anodic oxidation process the amount of catalyst required for eaops are found very less compared to the conventional aops in some of the eaops reagents are generated in situ as in the case of ef process where hydrogen peroxide is generated in the electrolytic system via two electron cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen practically they are adopted for the treatment of wastewater with chemical oxygen demand cod between 0 1 100 g l 1 8 biodegradability enhancement and reduction in toxicity of wastewater are the other advantages of eaops and other aops compared to other wastewater treatment methods 9 10 it is also found that eaops are very effective for the oxidation of arsenite and thus able to reduce arsenic toxicity in drinking water 11 these processes have many advantages that justify their potential use their strategy takes into consideration effluent remediation and the implementation of alternative processes with less hazardous effects 12 they can be applied under mild operation conditions of ambient temperature and pressure without any need for auxiliary chemicals they use compact that promote a higher efficiency without the production of secondary waste given the possibility of their automation and their easy combination with other conventional technologies or integrated treatment 13 therefore some of these technologies have some drawbacks that limit their applications the activity reduction and shortening of the electrode lifetime service due to the adsorption of organic materials on their surface are the main drawbacks 8 eaops include several processes such as peroxi coagulation fered fenton and sono electro fenton however the most popular ones are anodic oxidation ao anodic oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 ao h2o2 electro fenton ef heterogeneous electro fenton hef photoelectro fenton pef and solar photoelectro fenton process spef 14 the degradation of organic pollutants with those eaops depends on many factors that affect its effectiveness and kinetic rate the main influencing parameters are electrode nature initial concentration of organics supporting electrolyte nature applied potential or current liquid flow or stirring rate ph and temperature 8 14 herein this review provides an overview on the aforementioned processes i e ao ef hef pef and spef indicating their potential toward organic pollutants their effectiveness in water purification and wastewater treatment based on recent publications in this field in general this paper presents an up to date view of these processes to remove harmful organic pollutants it attaches great importance to the fundamental aspects which were the cornerstones of further development and brilliant achievements moreover this review gives attention to the recent novel and promising progress made in eaops in the degradation of organic contaminants by different materials especially in the last a few years it provides inspiring perceptions for researchers to future research directions in particular it presents a new and comprehensive review on eaops that would further promote the relevant research and devote efforts to tackle the bottleneck of the development of these technologies for their large scale application 2 decolorization mineralization and energetic parameters during the electrolysis in the case of colored solutions such as dyestuff the color removal efficiency cr can be practically monitored through the determination of color decay according to eq 1 15 16 1 c r abs 0 abs t abs 0 100 where abs0 and abst are the initial and final absorbance of the solution at the maximum visible wavelength λmax however the absorption method could be criticized regarding by products that could also absorb in the same wavelength range nevertheless high performance liquid chromatography hplc can provide the identification of the decomposition products the degradation of wastewaters by eaops can be measured by the removal of their total organic carbon toc and or chemical oxygen demand cod herein cod and toc are related to their mineralization the cod and toc removals are depicted in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 15 2 cod removal cod 0 cod t cod 0 100 3 toc removal toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 where codt and toct are the experimental cod and toc in mg l 1 respectively at electrolysis time t and cod0 and toc0 are the corresponding initial values before treatment the current efficiency ce can be computed from cod abatement mg l 1 eq 4 16 the determination of toc during electrolysis allows the measurement of the mineralization current efficiency mce as presented in eq 5 16 4 ce δ cod fvs 8 i t 100 5 mce nfvsδ toc exp 4 32 10 7 m i t 100 where f is the faraday constant 96 487 c mol 1 i is

of volume ec in kwh m 3 per unit of cod mass eccod in kwh g 1 cod and per unit of toc mass ectoc in kwh g 1 toc expression which are considered as essential energetic parameters to evaluate the

at initial and given operating time t respectively and vs is the solution volume l 3 removal kinetics of organic pollutants considering oh as the main oxidizing agent in the eaops their reaction with organic pollutants rh is presented in eq 9 the kinetic rate can be written as shown in eq 10 18 9 rh oh oxidation products 10 d rh dt k abs oh rh oh radicals are very reactive species during the electrolysis their concentration reaches a steady state and does not accumulate in the solution consequently kapp is equal to kabs oh where kapp and kabs are apparent and absolute rate constants respectively eq 10 can be written as shown in eq 11 or eq 12 where eq 12 is the integrated form of eq 11 18 19 11 d rh dt k app rh 12 ln rh 0 rh t k app t where rh t and rh 0 are the concentration of organic pollutant at time t and at the beginning of electrolysis generally the kabs of the reaction between organic pollutants and oh can be determined through the competitive kinetic method the 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba 19 21 the benzoic acid ba and salicylic acid sa 22 can be taken as standard competitors since their rate constant values are well known in the literature being kabs 4 hba 2 19 109 m 1 s 1 kabs ba 4 3 109 l m 1 s 1 and kabs sa 2 2 1010 m 1 s 1 furthermore other standards can be used and their rate constants are reported elsewhere 23 the absolute rate constant kabs can be calculated using eq 13 19 13 ln rh 0 rh t ln s 0 s t k abs rh k abs s where kabs s and kabs rh are the rate constants for the reaction of the standard s and rh with oh respectively rh 0 and s 0 are the initial rh and s concentrations respectively and rh t and s t are the concentrations at a given time t of rh and s respectively 4 eaops degradation pathway identification of intermediates and inorganic ions evolution during electrolysis it is necessary to monitor the formation of reaction intermediates and inorganic ions generally it gives information about the degradation pathway for further investigation of the toxicity of the treated effluent and its degree with respect to legal discharge standards practically hplc and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis of treated wastewater can affirm the presence of different oxidation by products intermediates carboxylic acids inorganic ions in addition the removal kinetics of pollutants can be controlled by hplc 18 24 solano et al 25 identified 13 hydroxylated derivatives and 21 aromatic intermediates and monitored the release of so4 2 no3 and nh4 ions during the treatment of 0 26 mm of congo red dye by ao h2o2 ef and pef using pt air diffusion cell at ph 3 0 the identification revealed the presence of intermediates including benzene naphthalene biphenyl monoazo diazo and phthalic acid compounds tartronic tartatic oxamic oxalic and acetic acids were detected as the final carboxylic acids in all eaops studied concerning inorganic ions they observed that the initial nitrogen was mostly lost as n volatile gas and oxidized to no3 ion and a lesser extent to ammonium ion whereas its sulfur atom was transformed into so4 2 ions 5 anodic oxidation the ao is an electrochemical process based on the direct oxidation of pollutants on an anode surface where the electrode material and the operating conditions are crucial 26 ao h2o2 process is a variant of ao where carbonaceous cathodes are employed 14 electrochemical oxidation can be achieved in two different ways direct or indirect oxidation the former is obtained by the direct oxidation which corresponds to the electron transfer of the organic pollutants at the anode whereas the indirect or mediated oxidation corresponds to the reaction of organic pollutants with electrogenerated oxidants such as oh h2o2 and clo however both oxidation pathways may coexist in the ao process 27 during electrolysis the oxidation mechanisms can occur following two main approaches i the electrochemical conversion where target pollutants are partially transformed into organic intermediate byproducts which may be biodegradable or not and require subsequential treatment ii the electrochemical combustion of pollutants that convert them into dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives which are totally mineralized during electrolysis and converted into h2o co2 and other inorganic compounds 15 28 generally active anodes give electrochemical conversion and non active anodes yield to electrochemical combustion table 1 presents some examples of the degradation of different pollutants by anodic oxidation process based on recent applications it recapitulates various types of recalcitrant pollutants and their oxidation using active and non active anodes as can be seen from these applications the boron doped diamond bdd electrode material has been affirmed to be an efficient anode to degrade various compounds it should be mentioned that bdd anode is commonly used despite its higher cost other non active anodes are currently offered as an alternative the sub stoichiometric tio2 tino2n 1 especially those with 4 n 6 such as ti4o7 anodes have a large o2 evolution overpotential these electrodes are characterized by good corrosion resistant high electrical conductivity and high chemical stability at room temperature 29 they yield a better efficiency compared to that of active anodes as pt or dsa but slightly inferior to that of bdd anode as reported by ganiyu et al 30 ti4o7 has been used recently in wastewater treatment as given in table 1 oh radicals are generated by the direct oxidation of water molecules at the anode surface eq 14 and oxidize organic pollutants as presented in eq 15 however some side reactions such as the oxidation of radicals to dioxygen eq 16 31 the production of weaker agents compared to oh such as h2o2 eq 17 o3 formation eq 18 and the electrochemical generation of other oxidants from co existing ions such as chlorine eqs 19 21 peroxodisulfate eqs 22 and 23 peroxodicarbonate eq 24 peroxymonocarbonate eqs 25 and 26 peroxodiphosphate eqs 27 and 28 can compete with the reaction presented in eq 14 13 14 32 33 14 m h2o m oh h e 15 m oh r m mco2 nh2o px 16 m oh m ½o2 h e 17 2 m oh 2

po4 2 h e where m m oh r x stand for anode material heterogeneous oh radicals organic matter and inorganic ions respectively moreover the availability of oh in the cell is related to the potential window for water discharge of the used electrodes they are physisorbed in the case of non active electrodes and chemisorbed in the case of active anodes fig 1 depending on the interaction between the formed oh and the anode surface this propriety can be determined through the oxygen evolution overpotential of the anode and the adsorption enthalpy of oh on its surface 31 34 35 during electrolysis the availability of oh can be influenced by their consumption by parasitic reactions eqs 16 18 as mentioned before in addition to their reaction with other species as presented below eqs 29 44 where all kinetic rate constants are given in m 1 s 1 14 32 refer ref 36 in eq 29 ref 37 in eq 30 ref 37 in eq 31 ref 38 in eq 32 ref 38 in eq 33 ref 39 in eq 34 ref 40 in eq 35 ref 41 in eq 36 ref 42 in eq

o 2 oh h o 2 h 2 o 2 7 10 7 it is well known that the anode nature highly affects the efficiency and selectivity of the ao process non active anode materials such as bdd ti4o7 sno2 and pbo2 are known for their weaker interaction with oh this type of electrodes promotes a lower electrochemical activity of o2 evolution reaction eq 16 high o2 overpotential anodes and higher chemical reactivity with organics they lead to complete the mineralization of organic pollutants into co2 however as reported by panizza et al 44 the use of sno2 and pbo2 electrodes is limited due to their short life time service and the release of toxic ions in the solution mainly in the case of pbo2 active anodes such as ti pt ruo2 tio2 dsa cl2 and iro2 ta2o5 dsa o2 are characterized by low oxidation power results from their low o2 overvoltage they only promote the conversion of target pollutants into organic intermediate byproducts which may be biodegradable or not however they can not attain total mineralization and organic combustion into co2 13 31 5 1 effect of supporting electrolytes the presence of salts in wastewater is a primordial fact practically in the case of pollutant model studies supporting electrolytes are usually used in eaops to facilitate the passage of electric current in the electrochemical cell and provide the electrogeneration of oxidants such as active chlorine species furthermore several salts are reported to be efficient for the remediation of different target pollutants by increasing the solution conductivity 45 sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium nitrate nano3 sodium carbonate na2co3 and sodium perchlorate naclo4 are common supporting electrolytes 14 among them nano3 and naclo4 are strongly stable compounds that can avoid generating any oxidizing species likely to react with organic pollutants making them better chose for studying direct ao 46 for further comparison the effect of different electrolytes nacl na2so4 na2co3 and hclo4 on alizarin red s ars degradation using bdd anode was studied and compared results concluded that fast and complete discolorisation of ars was achieved after 6 min using nacl electrolyte 47 similarly canizares et al 45 confirmed the interesting role of indirect oxidation process by active chlorine species hclo clo cl2 etc in the electrochemical oxidation process in many research papers and especially in the case of the remediation of dyestuff solutions nacl has shown superiority over na2so4 and other electrolytes 48 49 likewise turro et al 50 performed the ao of landfill leachate on dsa electrode using hclo4 as the main supporting electrolyte they carried out the effect of hclo4 at 0 25 and 1 m concentrations where the results showed a negligible effect of this parameter on the degradation fig 2 a moreover they investigated the indirect oxidation by adding na2so4 and nacl similar results were found in the absence as in the presence of additional nacl 20 mm this concentration of nacl contributed only with about 10 in the overall oxidation however when nacl supporting electrolyte concentration increased up to 100 mm the performance was enhanced and this was more evident for cod removal for example cod removal was 43 and 75 at 0 and 100 mm of added nacl after 240 min of electrolysis time respectively however the addition of 20 mm na2so4 harmed the total carbon and total phenol removal their removal was 3 and 47 respectively after 120 min their corresponding values were 20 and 74 without extra electrolytes fig 2b they attributed the inhibitory action of sulfate ions to the improvement of the side reaction of o2 evolution which can limit the electrogeneration of chlorine hypochlorite active species in acidic media the presence of sulfate promotes the formation of so2 which acts as a moderate reductant in the case of active anodes such as metal oxide anodes the reduction by so2 is presented in eqs 45 47 whereas in the case of non active anodes the presence of sulfates leads to produce sulfate radicals eq 35 and persulfate s2o8 2 in the case of bdd that oxidize pollutants as presented in eqs 48 and 49 17 45 so2 h2o h2so3 2h so3 2 46 so3 2 o so4 2 47 so4 2 dye r reduced dye 48 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e 49 s2o8 2 dye r oxidized dye ro the use of nacl salt as a supporting electrolyte leads to the formation of active chlorine species formed from chloride ions at the surface of suitable anodes which are considered as oxidants for treating wastewaters through indirect oxidation 46 the generation of active chlorine species during oxidation of chlorides is presented in eqs 19 21 51 however it has been reported by dominguez et al 51 that higher chloride ion contents promote the generation of large amounts of other chlorine species i e clo2 clo3 and clo4 these species are oh consuming with less oxidizing potential which limits the efficiency of electrochemical treatment eqs 29 34 they lead to the possible generation of persistent organochlorine products which may be more toxic than their parent molecules 46 their amount can be reduced by the irradiation of the solution as reported by kiwi et al 52 5 2 effect of ph the stability of the oxidizing agents in the solution depends on their ph the pka of hocl clo couple is given equal to 7 55 17 globally chlorine cl2 is the predominant species when ph 3 00 hypochlorous acid hocl for 3 00 ph 7 50 and hypochlorite ion clo for ph 7 50 53 hocl has the highest standard potential e 1 49 v she compared to cl2 e 1 36 v she and clo e 0 89 v she hence the indirect oxidation of pollutants by active chlorine must be efficient under acidic conditions it is well known that oh formation is better in acidic media 34 generally in the case of reactive oxygen species among them oh ho2 o2 and h2o2 are of special research interest because of their oxidation potential they are ph dependent where at higher ph conditions they will be converted to their anion forms which are characterized by lower oxidation ability 46 similarly in the case of persulfate the solution ph can influence the type of the formed species therefore in the basic medium many species can be produced as presented in eqs 50 55 36 50 so4 oh oh so4 2 51 s2o8 2 2h2o ho2 2so4 2 3h 52 ho2 s2o8 2 so4 so4 2 h o2 53 hso5 so5 2 h 54 so5 2 h2o h2o2 so4 2 55 hso5 h2o2 h so4 2 h2o o2 5 3 effect of applied current or potential in the wastewater electrochemical cells a constant current a or current density a m 2 is provided to the cell in galvanostatic mode however a constant potential v is supplied between the cathode and the anode of the cell in potentiostatic mode the electrochemical degradation was carried out sometime in a three electrode cell i e a working electrode anode a counter electrode cathode and a reference electrode at the laboratory scale usually eaops are operated in a galvanostatic mode with an inactive anode where high cell voltage is required for the concomutant oxidation of organics and water 14 46 this parameter has to be optimized since it directly influences the amount of oxidizing species parasitic reactions energy consumption and the mce 14 for example in the study performed by cai et al 54 current density influences positively the toc removal which can be assigned to the increased production of oh and reactive species similarly the degradation kinetic rate of 2 chlorobenzoic acid on bdd anode was improved by increasing the current from 50 to 300 ma where the apparent kinetic rate increased from 0 015 min 1 to 0 034 min 1 respectively 19 however increasing the current density value enhances energy consumption and leads to decrease mce values 55 for example el ghenymy et al 56 reported that after 180 min of electrolysis increasing the current density enhanced the toc removal efficiency of orange g reaching 77 85 94 and 100 at 33 67 100 and 150 ma cm 2 respectively fig 3 a whereas they affirmed that the mineralization current efficiency dropped while increasing the current density mce values were about 15 9 8 and 6 at 33 67 100 and 150 ma cm 2 respectively after 180 min of electrolysis fig 3b 5 4 effect of temperature although the temperatures of wastewater are different it is necessary to evaluate its effect on the efficiency of the ao process it has been reported that temperature has an important effect on the mass diffusion of particles in wastewater the conductivity of the entire degradation system the reaction rates between pollutants and oxidation groups and it may lead to indirect differences in ec 57 yavuz et al 58 observed a little change in decolorization efficiency for different temperatures 25 30 and 40 c concluding that there is no need to adjust the temperature of the solution and the model wastewater can be treated at its normal temperature fig 4 a however another study reported that a rise in the temperature from 20 c to 40 c favored cod removal due to the enhancement of the electro generation of inorganic oxidizing agents 44 for instance high temperatures may enhance the rate of oxidation reaction between organics and active chlorine 59 similarly petrucci et al 60 observed a positive effect of the increase of temperature on the elimination of reactive blue 19 dye the rate of mineralization was less than 80 at 20 c while it was increased to 90 at 60 c after 480 min and 360 min respectively moreover further improvement was achieved at 60 c resulting in total discolorisation in half the operating time required at 20 c fig 4b dos santos et al 61 reported that rising temperature from 25 c to 45 c influences tartrazine treatment efficiency results revealed a large enhancement of color reduction rapid toc removal higher mce values and gradually lower ectoc as the temperature was increased 5 5 pollutants concentration the initial pollutant concentration affects the ao process with a logical outcome in which highly concentrated effluents require longer electrolysis time to reach a given degradation percentage 19 62 63 panizza and oturan reported that the kinetic rate constant lessened with the increasing pollutant concentration due to the progressive acceleration of parasitic reactions between the oxidation intermediates and oh species 64 increasing the initial pollutant amount while keeping other parameters constant reduced both pollutant decay and cod removal efficiency which necessitates longer reaction times for complete purification of concentrated solutions generally this behavior is linked to the higher concentration of organics in solution to react with a similar amount of oxidizing species 63 6 electro fenton ef is an extended version of the fenton process in which h2o2 is in situ electrochemically generated in acidic conditions 98 99 fenton based technologies are known by their higher efficiency for the removal of organic pollutants where previous papers were reviewed the recent developments and applications of this technique for instance liu et al 100 summarized recent development in the in situ production of h2o2 in fenton fenton like process nair et al 101 are interested to carbonaceous cathode materials used for ef mousset et al 102 reviewed the potential of ef process in the case of its combination with biological treatments sirés and brillas 103 studied the fenton based electrochemical advanced reporting several trends for upgrading classical fenton processes limitations dos santos et al 104 investigated its efficiency toward pharmaceuticals compounds more recent and interesting reviews can be found elsewhere 100 105 108 depending on the form in which the iron enters the system the ef process can be presented in two forms cathodic and anodic fenton processes fig 5 in cathodic fenton processes iron is added as fe ii or fe iii salt and one or both reagents fe ii and h2o2 are produced in situ eqs 59 and 60 whereas in anodic fenton processes also known as peroxicoagulation process the source of the ferrous ion required for fenton reaction is a sacrificial iron fe 0 anode eq 61 38 109 the process involves the classical fenton mechanism in the absence of pollutants as presented in eqs 59 64 28 38 110 112 practically it has been reported that ef process is more efficient in acidic condition especially at the solution ph around 3 113 however for ph lower than three may decrease the availability of h2o2 due to reactions in eq 65 and 66 consequently the increase of ph enhances the decomposition of h2o2 to form o2 and h2o eq 67 and leads to coagulate pollutants by fe oh n formed at higher ph 18 56 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 57 fe3 e fe2 58 fe 0 fe2 2e 59 i n i t i a t i o n f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h oh 70 m 1 s 1 60 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 0 001

peroxide that prevents the risks of its storage transport and handling besides the possibility of controlling and optimizing the degradation and mineralization kinetics and performing mechanistic studies moreover it promotes a higher elimination of organic compounds due to continuous regeneration of fe2 ions at the cathode and the non formation of sludge 35 however similarly to fenton process the performance of ef also depends on fenton reagent concentration an increase of fe2 and h2o2 concentrations may limit the process by scavenging reactions eqs 43 and 64 which decreases the reactivity of oh 28 practically the ef process can combine ao and ef efficiencies by using an active or non active anode and carbonaceous cathode 34 table 2 contains examples of the removal of some organic pollutants by the ef process 6 1 effect of iron catalyst concentration fe2 concentration is a key parameter of the fenton reaction the efficiency of the ef process increases with the increase of fe2 concentration where the generation rate of h2o2 via o2 reduction is identical to fe2 amount it has been reported that upon an optimal value of fe2 concentration the efficiency of the process decreases due to the presence of parasitic reactions related to the higher amount of fe2 eqs 63 and 64 garcia segura et al 114 studied the effect of fe2 concentration on flumequine degradation by the ef process fig 6 they observed that a higher degradation rate was attained using 2 0 and 4 0 mm fe2 at 240 min moreover from 0 5 to 4 0 mm fe2 about 75 of incineration was always obtained at 360 min however for a concentration higher than 6 0 mm fe2 they reported that the efficiency was highly decreased after 240 min where only 58 of toc decay was reached they attributed this behavior to the higher fe2 concentration that leads to generate fe iii complexes of short carboxylic acids which react slowly with bdd oh and the consumption of oh with the excess of fe2 added the same result was reported elsewhere 115 similarly lin et al 116 reported that for a solution of 0 2 mm of sucralose treated under 200 ma applied current and 50 mm of na2so4 using pt and bdd anodes increasing the fe2 concentration from 0 05 to 0 2 mm enhanced the mineralization however it decreases by enhancing the fe2 concentration to 0 5 mm for both pt and bdd anodes consequently they had chosen 0 2 mm as the optimal fe2 concentration likewise panizza et al 64 investigated the influence of fe2 concentration on the electrochemical oxidation of 200 mg l 1 altrazin red ar applying a constant current of 300 ma at ph 3 and using bdd anode and graphite felt gf cathode results revealed that the ar removal increased with increasing catalyst concentration from 0 1 to 0 2 mm and decreased by increasing the amount of fe2 above 0 2 mm the same result was reported by zazou et al when they investigated the degradation of real textile wastewater using bdd gf system 115 and oturan et al while studying the removal of para aminosalicylic acid using bdd gf and pt gf cells 117 6 2 effect of current the applied current is usually a critical parameter in eaops and similarly for the ef process it is considered as the driving force for h2o2 production the amount of oh radicals formed during electrolysis and the electro regeneration of fe2 it is directly related to the applied voltage on the electrochemical system which affects the efficiency of the process and its cost 18 however a higher applied current leads to higher oxygen evolution and hydrogen production eqs 68 and 69 that limit some main reactions such as the direct oxidation of water and regeneration of fe2 on the anode and cathode respectively 18 68 2h2o 4h o2 4e 69 2h 2e h2 lin et al 116 reported that the elimination rate of sucralose suc enhanced with increasing the current from 100 to 200 ma in both bdd cf and pt cf systems the mineralization percentage of suc solution in both systems decreased when the current increased from 200 to 500 ma due to the parasitic reaction fig 7 a hence as a result they selected 200 ma as the optimal current moreover mce values dropped with the increase of the applied current from 100 to 500 ma in both cells for instance the mce values after 60 min at 100 200 300 and 500 ma were 32 20 14 and 9 respectively fig 7 b however during the first 120 min reaction ectoc in pt cf cell was higher than that in the bdd cf cell reporting that at 30 120 180 and 360 min it reached for pt cf cell about 0 17 0 26 0 31 and 0 55 kw h g 1 toc while for bdd cf system these values were 0 12 0 23 0 33 and 0 65 kw h g 1 toc respectively fig 7 c teymori et al 118 optimized the current density for the elimination of malachite green mg by ef process using iron as anode and cathode in the electrolytic cell based on the removal efficiency and energy consumption they showed that increasing the applied current density from 2 5 ma cm 2 to 10 ma cm 2 enhanced the removal efficiency from 76 to 94 however increasing the current density up to 15 ma cm 2 changed slightly mg removal consequently they considered 10 ma cm 2 as an optimal value since the electrical energy consumption is proportional to the applied current similarly jiao et al 119 investigated the effect of current on the removal of orange ii they observed that increasing the current above 100 ma the orange ii removal efficiency in dsa modified activated carbon fiber cells kept constantly above 98 it showed only a slight increase when they increased the density of current from 100 to 200 ma cm 2 fig 8 a they also reported that after 120 min h2o2 concentration was affected by current reaching 49 2 100 2 139 8 and 189 6 mg l 1 using 50 100 150 and 200 ma respectively fig 8b 6 3 effect of temperature temperature can affect the electron transfer mass transfer rate the self decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the concentration of dissolved o2 and fe2 regeneration 120 121 it may affect the efficiency of the treatment as observed by wang et al 122 that displayed the influence of temperature 25 c 35 c and 45 c on the discolorisation of real dyeing wastewater using graphite cathodes and pt ti anode from the reported results the discolorisation efficiency decreased from 71 to 39 as the temperature increased likewise the toc removal efficiency of nitrotoluenes was favorable at low temperatures where the toc at 303 k was higher than at 323 k 95 vs 85 at 3 h as reported by chen et al 123 on the other hand it may have a positive effect on ef efficiency for instance the degradation kinetics of bromothymol blue was improved when the temperature rises from 20 c to 40 c and the apparent kinetic rate constants kapp obtained at 20 30 and 40 c were 0 203 0 212 and 0 262 min 1 respectively 124 in summary this parameter should be optimized to not affect the efficiency of the process 6 4 effect of supporting electrolyte generally and similarly to all eaops the use of supporting electrolytes is necessary for the treatment of low conductivity effluents by the ef process na2so4 has been observed to be the most used electrolyte in the ef process 18 it has been utilized for the treatment of different molecule models where active sulfate species can enhance the treatment efficiency usually 50 mm na2so4 is employed for the ef process leading to a great current passage therefore increasing its concentration above 50 mm may lead to enhance side reactions as observed by gökkuş et al 125 when the electrolyte was more concentrated the limited currents increased and the reduction potential became lower 126 for instance yahya et al 127 reported a higher mineralization efficiency of na2so4 compared to nacl for the treatment of ofloxcacin ofl antibiotic drug solution by ef using platinum anode and cf cathode they showed that the cod decays were 75 3 in na2so4 and 63 6 for nacl after 300 min of treatment using 0 2 mm ofl 0 2 mm fe2 50 mm na2so4 100 mm nacl at ph 3 0 and under 200 ma current intensity for further comparison with other salts thiam et al 128 evaluated the effect of the supporting electrolyte nature on the removal of carmoisine solutions using ef with bdd anode and air diffusion cathode in a recirculation flow cell the conditions were 209 3 mg l 1 of carmoisine ph 3 0 0 5 mm fe2 and 35 c using 50 mm of na2so4 liclo4 or nacl results showed that the degradation efficiency increases in the order nacl liclo4 na2so4 with a quick decolorization that needs about 25 min for cl and 60 min for either so4 2 and clo4 to get a colorless solution fig 9 a they attributed the quicker discolorisation rate of clo4 compared to so4 2 to the generation of smaller amounts of oh in the sulfate media due to the partial inhibition of fenton s reaction by the formation of sulfate iron complexes however for toc decay they observed a quick reduction of about 67 in so4 2 63 in clo4 and 57 in cl during the first 180 min reporting that upon the further treatment the toc removal was slightly enhanced and attained maximum mineralization of 76 72 and 64 respectively fig 9b the decrease of the efficiency of nacl may be attributed to the formation of organochlorine molecules in the presence of chlorine species and or the depletion of h2o2 in this electrolyte by its reaction with hclo to produce o2 gas and cl ions eq 70 128 70 hclo h2o2 cl o2 g h2o h however comparing the same ions mentioned above daneshvar et al 129 reported that maximal mineralization of about 75 was achieved during the oxidation of orange ii by ef at ph 3 0 using a stirred reactor with a gf cathode and pt anode in clo4 in this study the mineralization order was clo4 cl so4 2 and the concentration of naclo4 did not influence the degradation of orange ii when its amount was increased from 0 05 to 0 1 m moreover they explained the weaker degradation in so4 2 media by the consumption of fe2 ions as sulfate iron complexes 7 importance of chelating agents and heterogeneous ef process ef process showed a higher potential in degrading various types of organic pollutants however its application in acidic ph between 2 5 and 3 5 154 limits its implementation on a large scale as the ph of the industrial wastewater is alkaline or neutral the iron catalyst is converted to insoluble hydroxides depending on the ph value under these conditions the elimination of organics is likely to happen by the electrocoagulation process rather than by degradation 155 therefore this technical challenge can be overcome using some solutions that help in extending the operational ph range among them the use of chelating agents and hef instead of conventional one remains the most promising tool that may promote its real application in wastewater treatment plants 7 1 effect of chelating agent in order to enhance the catalytic activity of iron toward h2o2 at higher ph chelating compounds are used depending on their ability to form stable complexes with fe iii 154 the production of these complexes prevents the precipitation of fe iii where the degradation efficiency can be improved via accelerating the cycling of fe ii fe iii by the reduction of fe iii complexes at the cathode 156 whereby faster reduction rates of fe iii complexes occur for those with higher redox potential table 3 157 although as reported by liu et al 158 conventional cathodes such as cf can not ensure continuously the reduction of fe iii complex therefore they demonstrated that ni coating might be an excellent candidate for introducing atomic hydrogen h which has a higher potential for fe ii complex regeneration they reported that toc removal of ciprofloxacin increased from 42 cf to 81 ni cf at a natural ph in the case of humic acid the ligands used in this approach may be natural as humic acids or synthetic as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds oxalate citrate and nitrilotriacetic acid nta 154 the chelates must be chosen carefully depending on their different impacts on the redox potential of fe ii fe iii their stability ph range the metal ligand bond strength functional chemical structure and toxicity and biodegradability of both chelate and complex formed table 3 156 159 160 generally it has to be employed in excess to largely complex iron present in the medium and re complex those released from the destruction of the chelate by oh 160 nevertheless their added amount to the electrolytic cell must be optimized since they contribute to increase the toc of the treated effluent 154 this condition may present a limitation for the use of some biodegradable and non toxic agents such as oxalate fe chelate 1 20 table 3 where large amounts must be added to complete the complexation of fe iii as reported elsewhere 160 the ph of effluents changes depending on their original source table 3 presents some examples of chelates that can be used for different types of wastewaters depending on their ph as shown in table 3 nta and edta are the most stable agents in a wide range of ph in contrast considering the environmental sustainability requirements edds was reported to present a better choice that ensures good performance 103 however for a ph value above eight the chelating agents lose their efficiency in complexing iron 159 it is worthy to mention that these substances have a photoactive character that could be beneficial for enhancing the treatment via photo associated processes such as photo fenton and pef 161 162 7 2 heterogeneous ef process the development of hef has gained much interest recently it is been developed to use insoluble iron catalysts prepared catalyst by the load of transition metals in inorganic or organic materials nanoparticles or through cathodic materials with iron 164 165 it allows extending the treatment to circum neutral ph conditions where the production of oh from fenton reaction becomes possible through heterogeneous fenton s reaction between fe ii and h2o2 at the catalyst surface 164 166 169 yu et al 170 reported that using pyrite in ef process allowed the achievement of higher toc removal under neutral and alcalin ph compared to homogenuous ef process fig 10 in this case the degradation and mineralization of 50 mg l 1diclofenac under 31 84 ma cm 2 and at ph 3 are similar where pyrite ef is slightly higher compared to ef and electrolysis fig 10a however at ph 7 and 9 pyrite ef yielded higher removal efficiency fig 10 b and c compared to the other processes after 180 min treatment the toc removal reached 45 60 and 85 by electrolysis ef and pyrite ef respectively fig 10d the use of some catalysts allows the release of low amounts of iron to the treated solution preventing the formation of undesired sludge in this case oh can be generated in the bulk of the solution and on the catalyst surface contrarily in the case of stable catalysts 154 155 for instance barhoumi et al 171 attributed the higher efficiency for the removal of sulfamethazine by pyrite ef compared to the classical ef to the higher concentration of iron ii released into the solution during the electrolysis for 2 g l 1 of pyrite fe2 concentration released was found to be 4 5 mm whereas it was only 0 2 mm in the case of ef reaching 83 and 87 of toc removal respectively zhang et al 172 quantified the production of oh radicals during ef and hef where modified iron carbon with polytetrafluoroethylene was used as a heterogeneous catalyst the study was performed using 25 mmol l 1 dimethyl sulfoxide at ph 7 7 and under i 100 ma 153 6 μ mol l 1 was detected as maximum oh amount at 120 min of electrolysis in the case of hef whereas in the case of ef the highest obtained amount of oh was about 100 μ mol l 1 at 60 min after 120 min they observed that the concentration of oh in ef did not increase attributing this result to the possible precipitation of fe2 as ferric hydroxides in neutral condition this approach is believed to be cost efficient due to the possible reuse of the catalyst several times 164 several authors confirmed the low cost of this process leading to a higher efficiency for the removal of target pollutants for instance yang et al 173 reported the excellent stability of the synthesized feiifeiii layered double hydroxide modified carbon felt feiifeiii ldh cf toward the degradation and mineralization of ofloxacin after 6 runs fig 11 they observed that the complete removal of the studied molecules and a slight decrease of 12 of toc removal after six runs moreover they affirmed that even after 20 reuse cycles the characterization of the cathode showed that feiifeiii ldh particles were still crowded and clustered on the cathode these results affirm that this modified cathode can be used for a long term in hef similarly dong et al 174 reported the stability of the prepared self supporting carbon fiber paper electrode modified by fe and mn even after five reuses indicating its possible use for long time service they attributed this result to the low leaching of fe and mn in the solution after a long electrolysis time likewise heidari et al 175 highlighted the efficiency of chalcopyrite as an iron based natural catalyst for the elimination of cefazolin by hef they found that this catalyst yields higher stability even after five runs with higher removal efficiency compared to several catalysts some recent examples on the efficiency of hef for the removal of different organic pollutants are gathered in table 4 heterogeneous catalysts can be grouped into five categories i iron minerals such as ferrite ferrihydrite goethite magnetite schlor hematite and pyrite ii waste materials such as fly ash and sludge containing iron iii zero valent iron iv iron and iron oxide loaded onto activated carbon alumina biosorbent fiber silica or zeolite and v soil with laterite or clays such as bentonite kaolinite laponite montmorillonite sepiolite etc 155 materials such as goethite magnetite hematite pyrite vermiculite clays or synthesized catalysts have shown higher efficiency for the treatment of different target pollutants 166 in the case of cathode materials used in hef materials functionalized with iron and or transition metals present the best option they are generally used to improve cathode properties and increase the electric conductivity besides h2o2 electrogeneration 165 cathode modifications can be gathered under three categories 101 i carbonaceous materials grafted by fe fe containing compounds like fe fe2o3 3d graphene 188 ii fe fe transition metals coated on carbon aerogels such as fecuc aerogel 189 and iii bimetallic materials on carbon fe co gf 190 more recent applications of modified carbon materials are reviewed elsewhere 101 165 191 8 cathode modifications it is well known that cathode material plays an important role in the ef ef efficiency depends on the capacity of the cathode material to produce hydrogen peroxide which controls the generation rate of oh species the main oxidant for the elimination of organic pollutants 192 outran et al 35 reported the interest gained by carbonaceous cathodes instead of mercury for h2o2 production based on their non toxicity good stability higher conductivity and chemical resistance in addition to higher overvoltage for h2 evolution reaction and the low catalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide decomposition cathodes such as carbon polytetrafluoroethylene oxygen diffusion graphite and three dimensional electrodes activated carbon fiber carbon felt carbon sponge reticulated vitreous carbon and carbon nanotubes are practically highly thought for instance liu et al 193 investigated the elimination of perfluorooctanoate pfoa by ef with h2o2 generated on a hierarchically porous carbon cathode by oxygen reduction reaction using three electrode cell they reported an efficient mineralization of pfoa with a toc removal of 91 and 70 at ph 2 and 6 respectively using 0 4 v applied potential at 4 h time electrolysis sopaj et al 192 investigated the impact of the cathode on ef efficiency for the mineralization of sulfamethazine smt drug they studied the effect of different cathode electrodes such as stainless steel ss carbon sponge cs and cf with different porosities the best results were obtained using cs anodes that generate higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide in the solution the cs with a porosity of 45 ppi was the most effective followed by cf cathode however ss produced fewer amounts of h2o2 for a current ranging from 50 to 100 ma concerning smt removal they observed that the most effective system was pt cs 45 ppi achieving a mineralization rate of 91 at 300 ma while the poorest mineralization rate of 41 was obtained using pt ss system in the same operating conditions the amount of h2o2 produced during electrolysis can be monitored spectroscopically by titration of the complex 1 1 formed between ti iv and h2o2 measuring its color intensity in acidic media at a wavelength of 423 nm moreover the current efficiency ɛ of h2o2 generation can be calculated using eq 71 119 192 71 ε nfcv 0 t idt where n is the electron s number involved in the formation of h2o2 through oxygen reduction n 2 f is the faraday constant 96 485 c m 1 v is volume l i is the current a c is the concentration of h2o2 m and t is the electrolysis time s compared to conventional carbonaceous materials the modified cathodes can yield to increase in the amount of h2o2 produced in the reactor modifications can be achieved through introducing other active carbon materials to carbon support such as graphene doping with a heteroatom o n f b and addition of a metal oxide such as mno2 ta2o5 v2o5 ceo2 etc 191 furthermore recent strategies and trends used to develop two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr catalysts for h2o2 were reviewed by anantharaj et al 194 table 5 shows a comparison between different conventional and modified cathodes in terms of h2o2 production 9 regeneration of cathode as long as these eaops are on the way to be developed for large scale applications cathode modifications have gained attention recently for increasing h2o2 production and hef applications the characteristics of cathode materials in terms of reuse and stability are an interesting issue generally cathode recyclability affects its performance and the total maintenance costs 191 several authors investigated the long term stability of different cathodes highlighting their potential reuse su et al 204 reported the stability of the cathode prepared by introducing iron in the interior of carbon nanotube cavities cnts they observed that this cathode exhibits a higher h2o2 production low iron leaching levels and higher removal of phenol which were 9 68 times faster when compared with iron being confined externally on the walls of cnts moreover they demonstrated the dependency of the cathode reuse on the iron 0 amount and efficient conversion between iron iii and iron ii where for fe 0 the 2e pathway of the orr was likely dominant the measurement of the reusability of the cathode to evaluate its stability was investigated after five runs results showed that phenol elimination and the rate constant decreased to 79 32 and 29 36 respectively garcía rodríguez et al 205 evaluated the stability of carbon felt iron oxide air diffusion cathode prepared by the electrodeposition of iron iii they reported that after 10 runs a gradual loss of fe oxide deposits from the cathode and a drop of dye mineralization rate was observed fig 12 after 360 min of electrolysis of a solution of 50 mg l 1 malachite green at 21 7 ma cm 2 and ph 3 toc removal value decreased from 85 to 68 it has been reported that doping cathodes with heteroatoms such as fluorine boron oxygen phosphate and nitrogen that present stable active sites for 2 e orr can enhance the stability of cathode materials 191 206 207 in the case of doping with heteroatoms the co bond becomes longer than the oo which favors ooh groups desorption and increases the 2e transfer for example deng et al 197 reported the higher stability of nickel foam cathode coated with nitrogen doped porous carbon after five cycles in terms of hydrogen peroxide production and sulfathiazole removal they reported that under optimal conditions fe2 0 mm for h2o2 study or 0 25 mm for ef experiments current density 20 ma cm 2 ph 3 sulfathiazole 50 mg l 1 and flow rate 500 ml min 1 about 1519 mm of h2o2 was accumulated and almost total removal of sulfathiazole was obtained after 3 h of electrolysis time similarly hu et al 208 affirmed the higher activity and stability of n and o self doped biomass porous carbon cathode synthesized by black soya bean with h2o2 accumulation even after 4 cycles likewise the stable accumulation of h2o2 was observed by zhu et al 209 in the case of a cathode co doped with n and s atoms after being reused for 10 times under 25 ma cm 2 current density similar observations were reported by other authors elsewhere 177 200 furthermore cathode modification with other compounds such as polymers of aniline tetrafluoro ethylene anthraquinone and its derivatives were reported to have a significant effect to enhance the selectively of h2o2 production 194 210 10 photoelectro fenton the pef process is the association of uv radiation and the conventional ef process which leads to producing more oh than in the ef process 211 this process

has been well proved for various pollutants table 6 khataee et al 213 investigated a comparison between ef and pef technologies for the elimination of triarylmethane dye in a recirculating reactor using an uv c lamp 254 nm of 15 w they observed that the degradation efficiency of ef and pef processes for 20 mg l 1 of dye solution was 23 and 98 after 60 min of reaction time respectively almeida et al 214 studied the mineralization of 244 mg l 1 of acid red 29 ar29 azo dye by pef compared to ef process using bdd air diffusion system the mineralization obtained by ef was poor compared to fast discolorisation and nearly complete mineralization of ar29 solution by pef they attributed this result to the faster destruction of intermediates by the synergistic action of the formed bdd oh oh radicals and uv a irradiation they observed that the degradation of ar29 followed the pseudo first order kinetic model under optimal conditions of 0 5 1 0 mm fe2 and ph 3 0 the same observations were reported by garcia segura et al 114 during the galvanostatic treatment of flumequine by pef and ef using bdd anode and air diffusion cathode they achieved partial mineralization 75 89 of flumequine solution by ef using 2 0 mm of fe2 at ph 3 0 fig 13 a whereas the pef process was more efficient and about 94 96 of toc removal was achieved fig 13b this difference can be attributed to fe iii oxamate and fe iii oxalate complexes which undergo quick photolysis under uv a irradiation solano et al 25 affirmed the higher effectiveness of the pef process compared to ef and ao h2o2 for the degradation of congo red dye solutions they observed that the efficiency of the oxidation decreased in this order pef ef ao h2o2 where complete mineralization was achieved by pef after 360 min at j 66 7 ma cm 2 due to the parallel photolytic action of uv a light fig 14 moreover as mentioned in section 6 3 organochlorine compounds limit the efficiency of the ef process which can be overcome by applying photo

production of cl yields to the formation of different reactive species such as cl2 cl hocl and oh as presented in reactions eqs 83 87 these species can react with fenton reagents h2o2 and fe2 besides

which renewable and free sunlight can be used as a uv source to irradiate the solution this process has been examined by different authors table 6 for instance solano et al 25 performed the treatment of acidic solutions of congo red by spef technique using a solar flow reactor equipped with a pt air diffusion filter press system results confirmed the viability of spef for the remediation of water polluted with congo red under the most favorable conditions of 0 26 mm dye 0 50 mm of fe2 50 mm of na2so4 and 100 ma cm 2 current density almost total mineralization 49 of mce and ec of 0 45 kw h g 1 cod were attained in 240 min because of the fast photodecarboxylation of the fe iii carboxylate complexes murrieta et al 216 highlighted the efficiency of a new solar photoelectron fenton like spef like process which prevents the use of a gas diffusion cathode commonly used for the electro generation of h2o2 and promotes the use of more simple and cheaper electrodes in this study they investigated the elimination of acid red 1 ar1 using a flow reactor including a filter press cell endowed with a ti ir sn sb oxide anode electrode to oxidize cl ions to hclo and a ss cathode comparing the spef like technique with ao process with electro generated active cl2 ao hclo electro fenton like ef like processes and photoelectro fenton like pef like they observed that the oxidation power increased in the order ao hclo ef like pef like spef like fig 15 hence for the treatment of 0 2 mm ar1 in 25 mm na2so4 and 35 mm nacl at ph 3 0 under 15 ma cm 2 current density and in the presence of 0 40 mm fe2 total discolorization and 74 of cod removal at 120 min and 480 min respectively with 0 076 kw h g 1 cod of energy consumption and 25 of average current efficiency were obtained fig 15 11 conclusion recently the control of water pollution has taken on increasing importance pollution sources are different based on the origin of the contaminants among them dyes pops and emergent pollutants have attracted heightened awareness in the wastewater treatment field due to their higher toxicity higher ability to migrate in food chains and their bioaccumulation potential due to the efficiency and non selectivity of eaops they gained a higher interest for being a promising way for the removal of organic pollutants in different matrices their efficiency has been confirmed by the achievement of high removal rates very efficient remediation of water and low energy consumption hence efforts ought to explore the possibility of eaops applications at industrial large plant scale for treating organic pollutants in future developments homogeneous fenton processes using chelating agents and hef based ones showed a higher potential of organic removal at higher ph they present promising tools that may promote the real application of these techniques in wastewater treatment plants future studies should focus on improving the stability of the solid catalysts and modified cathodes for long periods investigating the application of hef based processes on real wastewaters therefore efforts out to be made to give more details on the cost efficient of large scale

13554,hazardous organic pollutants have been attracting heightened interest in recent years due to their persisting properties low biodegradability and negative influence on aquatic life wildlife and humans even at low concentrations considering their dangerous effect on the environment several treatments using different techniques were adopted to remove them from water and wastewater herein electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops especially anodic oxidation ao electro fenton ef heterogeneous electro fenton hef and photoelectro fenton pef have been thoroughly reviewed and found to be promising compared to conventional methods the state of the art of the previous treatment processes has been discussed in detail where each technique has its own merits and challenges these processes depend on their operating conditions mainly ph current density nature of electrodes used and conductivity of the solution etc the efficiencies of eaops follows the order as pef ef ao and can mineralize the recalcitrant organic pollutants completely keywords organic pollutants wastewater treatment degradation mineralization electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops 1 introduction nowadays water pollution has been considered a global concern which needs to be respected considering the negative impact of contaminated water and the limitation of drinking water sources 1 many industries required in the modern world release toxic compounds into the environment they have recently gained great interest due to their persisting properties and hazardous effects on wildlife and human beings some of these compounds are water soluble and defined in the stockholm convention as a group of mostly man made chemicals with a carbon based structure produced for industrial purposes 2 3 some organic pollutants are recalcitrant and remain intact in the environment for a long time furthermore they have a greater capacity to migrate through food chains with a higher potential for bioaccumulation 4 wastewaters composition depends on its origin where they may contain dyestuffs solvents and persistant organic pollutants pops such as pesticides and industrial by products of various elemental compositions i e polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons perfluorinated compounds dioxins dioxanes and others 2 currently the removal of these pollutants from water sources is vital and important due to their toxicity and their impact on human health animals and plants concerning the wastewater treatment field the choice of the treatment procedure varies according to effluent and pollutant types in reality water or wastewater treatment facilities rarely contain an individual process instead they have a series of techniques typically wastewater treatment involves physical chemical and biological processes before discharging the treated wastewater into the environment wastewater treatment plants may contain separation and degradation techniques generally degradation processes can be grouped into two categories biological and chemical processes chemical processes and advanced oxidation processes aops are recommended when biological treatments are not able to reduce pollution from wastewater 5 the combination of several methods is necessary when the removal of different contaminants is needed 6 aops are environmentalfriendly methods in which organic matters are destroyed until their mineralization by hydroxyl radicals oh generated in situ 7 electrochemical advanced oxidation processes eaops had gained much interest in the wastewater treatment field having environmental compatibility where the main reagent is an electron hydroxyl radicals are generated in electrolytic system by the external addition of catalyst as in the case of electro fenton ef process or anodic oxidation of water as in the case of anodic oxidation process the amount of catalyst required for eaops are found very less compared to the conventional aops in some of the eaops reagents are generated in situ as in the case of ef process where hydrogen peroxide is generated in the electrolytic system via two electron cathodic reduction of dissolved oxygen practically they are adopted for the treatment of wastewater with chemical oxygen demand cod between 0 1 100 g l 1 8 biodegradability enhancement and reduction in toxicity of wastewater are the other advantages of eaops and other aops compared to other wastewater treatment methods 9 10 it is also found that eaops are very effective for the oxidation of arsenite and thus able to reduce arsenic toxicity in drinking water 11 these processes have many advantages that justify their potential use their strategy takes into consideration effluent remediation and the implementation of alternative processes with less hazardous effects 12 they can be applied under mild operation conditions of ambient temperature and pressure without any need for auxiliary chemicals they use compact that promote a higher efficiency without the production of secondary waste given the possibility of their automation and their easy combination with other conventional technologies or integrated treatment 13 therefore some of these technologies have some drawbacks that limit their applications the activity reduction and shortening of the electrode lifetime service due to the adsorption of organic materials on their surface are the main drawbacks 8 eaops include several processes such as peroxi coagulation fered fenton and sono electro fenton however the most popular ones are anodic oxidation ao anodic oxidation with electrogenerated h2o2 ao h2o2 electro fenton ef heterogeneous electro fenton hef photoelectro fenton pef and solar photoelectro fenton process spef 14 the degradation of organic pollutants with those eaops depends on many factors that affect its effectiveness and kinetic rate the main influencing parameters are electrode nature initial concentration of organics supporting electrolyte nature applied potential or current liquid flow or stirring rate ph and temperature 8 14 herein this review provides an overview on the aforementioned processes i e ao ef hef pef and spef indicating their potential toward organic pollutants their effectiveness in water purification and wastewater treatment based on recent publications in this field in general this paper presents an up to date view of these processes to remove harmful organic pollutants it attaches great importance to the fundamental aspects which were the cornerstones of further development and brilliant achievements moreover this review gives attention to the recent novel and promising progress made in eaops in the degradation of organic contaminants by different materials especially in the last a few years it provides inspiring perceptions for researchers to future research directions in particular it presents a new and comprehensive review on eaops that would further promote the relevant research and devote efforts to tackle the bottleneck of the development of these technologies for their large scale application 2 decolorization mineralization and energetic parameters during the electrolysis in the case of colored solutions such as dyestuff the color removal efficiency cr can be practically monitored through the determination of color decay according to eq 1 15 16 1 c r abs 0 abs t abs 0 100 where abs0 and abst are the initial and final absorbance of the solution at the maximum visible wavelength λmax however the absorption method could be criticized regarding by products that could also absorb in the same wavelength range nevertheless high performance liquid chromatography hplc can provide the identification of the decomposition products the degradation of wastewaters by eaops can be measured by the removal of their total organic carbon toc and or chemical oxygen demand cod herein cod and toc are related to their mineralization the cod and toc removals are depicted in eqs 2 and 3 respectively 15 2 cod removal cod 0 cod t cod 0 100 3 toc removal toc 0 toc t toc 0 100 where codt and toct are the experimental cod and toc in mg l 1 respectively at electrolysis time t and cod0 and toc0 are the corresponding initial values before treatment the current efficiency ce can be computed from cod abatement mg l 1 eq 4 16 the determination of toc during electrolysis allows the measurement of the mineralization current efficiency mce as presented in eq 5 16 4 ce δ cod fvs 8 i t 100 5 mce nfvsδ toc exp 4 32 10 7 m i t 100 where f is the faraday constant 96 487 c mol 1 i is

of volume ec in kwh m 3 per unit of cod mass eccod in kwh g 1 cod and per unit of toc mass ectoc in kwh g 1 toc expression which are considered as essential energetic parameters to evaluate the

at initial and given operating time t respectively and vs is the solution volume l 3 removal kinetics of organic pollutants considering oh as the main oxidizing agent in the eaops their reaction with organic pollutants rh is presented in eq 9 the kinetic rate can be written as shown in eq 10 18 9 rh oh oxidation products 10 d rh dt k abs oh rh oh radicals are very reactive species during the electrolysis their concentration reaches a steady state and does not accumulate in the solution consequently kapp is equal to kabs oh where kapp and kabs are apparent and absolute rate constants respectively eq 10 can be written as shown in eq 11 or eq 12 where eq 12 is the integrated form of eq 11 18 19 11 d rh dt k app rh 12 ln rh 0 rh t k app t where rh t and rh 0 are the concentration of organic pollutant at time t and at the beginning of electrolysis generally the kabs of the reaction between organic pollutants and oh can be determined through the competitive kinetic method the 4 hydroxybenzoic acid 4 hba 19 21 the benzoic acid ba and salicylic acid sa 22 can be taken as standard competitors since their rate constant values are well known in the literature being kabs 4 hba 2 19 109 m 1 s 1 kabs ba 4 3 109 l m 1 s 1 and kabs sa 2 2 1010 m 1 s 1 furthermore other standards can be used and their rate constants are reported elsewhere 23 the absolute rate constant kabs can be calculated using eq 13 19 13 ln rh 0 rh t ln s 0 s t k abs rh k abs s where kabs s and kabs rh are the rate constants for the reaction of the standard s and rh with oh respectively rh 0 and s 0 are the initial rh and s concentrations respectively and rh t and s t are the concentrations at a given time t of rh and s respectively 4 eaops degradation pathway identification of intermediates and inorganic ions evolution during electrolysis it is necessary to monitor the formation of reaction intermediates and inorganic ions generally it gives information about the degradation pathway for further investigation of the toxicity of the treated effluent and its degree with respect to legal discharge standards practically hplc and gas chromatography mass spectrometry gc ms analysis of treated wastewater can affirm the presence of different oxidation by products intermediates carboxylic acids inorganic ions in addition the removal kinetics of pollutants can be controlled by hplc 18 24 solano et al 25 identified 13 hydroxylated derivatives and 21 aromatic intermediates and monitored the release of so4 2 no3 and nh4 ions during the treatment of 0 26 mm of congo red dye by ao h2o2 ef and pef using pt air diffusion cell at ph 3 0 the identification revealed the presence of intermediates including benzene naphthalene biphenyl monoazo diazo and phthalic acid compounds tartronic tartatic oxamic oxalic and acetic acids were detected as the final carboxylic acids in all eaops studied concerning inorganic ions they observed that the initial nitrogen was mostly lost as n volatile gas and oxidized to no3 ion and a lesser extent to ammonium ion whereas its sulfur atom was transformed into so4 2 ions 5 anodic oxidation the ao is an electrochemical process based on the direct oxidation of pollutants on an anode surface where the electrode material and the operating conditions are crucial 26 ao h2o2 process is a variant of ao where carbonaceous cathodes are employed 14 electrochemical oxidation can be achieved in two different ways direct or indirect oxidation the former is obtained by the direct oxidation which corresponds to the electron transfer of the organic pollutants at the anode whereas the indirect or mediated oxidation corresponds to the reaction of organic pollutants with electrogenerated oxidants such as oh h2o2 and clo however both oxidation pathways may coexist in the ao process 27 during electrolysis the oxidation mechanisms can occur following two main approaches i the electrochemical conversion where target pollutants are partially transformed into organic intermediate byproducts which may be biodegradable or not and require subsequential treatment ii the electrochemical combustion of pollutants that convert them into dehydrogenated or hydroxylated derivatives which are totally mineralized during electrolysis and converted into h2o co2 and other inorganic compounds 15 28 generally active anodes give electrochemical conversion and non active anodes yield to electrochemical combustion table 1 presents some examples of the degradation of different pollutants by anodic oxidation process based on recent applications it recapitulates various types of recalcitrant pollutants and their oxidation using active and non active anodes as can be seen from these applications the boron doped diamond bdd electrode material has been affirmed to be an efficient anode to degrade various compounds it should be mentioned that bdd anode is commonly used despite its higher cost other non active anodes are currently offered as an alternative the sub stoichiometric tio2 tino2n 1 especially those with 4 n 6 such as ti4o7 anodes have a large o2 evolution overpotential these electrodes are characterized by good corrosion resistant high electrical conductivity and high chemical stability at room temperature 29 they yield a better efficiency compared to that of active anodes as pt or dsa but slightly inferior to that of bdd anode as reported by ganiyu et al 30 ti4o7 has been used recently in wastewater treatment as given in table 1 oh radicals are generated by the direct oxidation of water molecules at the anode surface eq 14 and oxidize organic pollutants as presented in eq 15 however some side reactions such as the oxidation of radicals to dioxygen eq 16 31 the production of weaker agents compared to oh such as h2o2 eq 17 o3 formation eq 18 and the electrochemical generation of other oxidants from co existing ions such as chlorine eqs 19 21 peroxodisulfate eqs 22 and 23 peroxodicarbonate eq 24 peroxymonocarbonate eqs 25 and 26 peroxodiphosphate eqs 27 and 28 can compete with the reaction presented in eq 14 13 14 32 33 14 m h2o m oh h e 15 m oh r m mco2 nh2o px 16 m oh m ½o2 h e 17 2 m oh 2

po4 2 h e where m m oh r x stand for anode material heterogeneous oh radicals organic matter and inorganic ions respectively moreover the availability of oh in the cell is related to the potential window for water discharge of the used electrodes they are physisorbed in the case of non active electrodes and chemisorbed in the case of active anodes fig 1 depending on the interaction between the formed oh and the anode surface this propriety can be determined through the oxygen evolution overpotential of the anode and the adsorption enthalpy of oh on its surface 31 34 35 during electrolysis the availability of oh can be influenced by their consumption by parasitic reactions eqs 16 18 as mentioned before in addition to their reaction with other species as presented below eqs 29 44 where all kinetic rate constants are given in m 1 s 1 14 32 refer ref 36 in eq 29 ref 37 in eq 30 ref 37 in eq 31 ref 38 in eq 32 ref 38 in eq 33 ref 39 in eq 34 ref 40 in eq 35 ref 41 in eq 36 ref 42 in eq

o 2 oh h o 2 h 2 o 2 7 10 7 it is well known that the anode nature highly affects the efficiency and selectivity of the ao process non active anode materials such as bdd ti4o7 sno2 and pbo2 are known for their weaker interaction with oh this type of electrodes promotes a lower electrochemical activity of o2 evolution reaction eq 16 high o2 overpotential anodes and higher chemical reactivity with organics they lead to complete the mineralization of organic pollutants into co2 however as reported by panizza et al 44 the use of sno2 and pbo2 electrodes is limited due to their short life time service and the release of toxic ions in the solution mainly in the case of pbo2 active anodes such as ti pt ruo2 tio2 dsa cl2 and iro2 ta2o5 dsa o2 are characterized by low oxidation power results from their low o2 overvoltage they only promote the conversion of target pollutants into organic intermediate byproducts which may be biodegradable or not however they can not attain total mineralization and organic combustion into co2 13 31 5 1 effect of supporting electrolytes the presence of salts in wastewater is a primordial fact practically in the case of pollutant model studies supporting electrolytes are usually used in eaops to facilitate the passage of electric current in the electrochemical cell and provide the electrogeneration of oxidants such as active chlorine species furthermore several salts are reported to be efficient for the remediation of different target pollutants by increasing the solution conductivity 45 sodium chloride nacl potassium chloride kcl sodium sulfate na2so4 sodium nitrate nano3 sodium carbonate na2co3 and sodium perchlorate naclo4 are common supporting electrolytes 14 among them nano3 and naclo4 are strongly stable compounds that can avoid generating any oxidizing species likely to react with organic pollutants making them better chose for studying direct ao 46 for further comparison the effect of different electrolytes nacl na2so4 na2co3 and hclo4 on alizarin red s ars degradation using bdd anode was studied and compared results concluded that fast and complete discolorisation of ars was achieved after 6 min using nacl electrolyte 47 similarly canizares et al 45 confirmed the interesting role of indirect oxidation process by active chlorine species hclo clo cl2 etc in the electrochemical oxidation process in many research papers and especially in the case of the remediation of dyestuff solutions nacl has shown superiority over na2so4 and other electrolytes 48 49 likewise turro et al 50 performed the ao of landfill leachate on dsa electrode using hclo4 as the main supporting electrolyte they carried out the effect of hclo4 at 0 25 and 1 m concentrations where the results showed a negligible effect of this parameter on the degradation fig 2 a moreover they investigated the indirect oxidation by adding na2so4 and nacl similar results were found in the absence as in the presence of additional nacl 20 mm this concentration of nacl contributed only with about 10 in the overall oxidation however when nacl supporting electrolyte concentration increased up to 100 mm the performance was enhanced and this was more evident for cod removal for example cod removal was 43 and 75 at 0 and 100 mm of added nacl after 240 min of electrolysis time respectively however the addition of 20 mm na2so4 harmed the total carbon and total phenol removal their removal was 3 and 47 respectively after 120 min their corresponding values were 20 and 74 without extra electrolytes fig 2b they attributed the inhibitory action of sulfate ions to the improvement of the side reaction of o2 evolution which can limit the electrogeneration of chlorine hypochlorite active species in acidic media the presence of sulfate promotes the formation of so2 which acts as a moderate reductant in the case of active anodes such as metal oxide anodes the reduction by so2 is presented in eqs 45 47 whereas in the case of non active anodes the presence of sulfates leads to produce sulfate radicals eq 35 and persulfate s2o8 2 in the case of bdd that oxidize pollutants as presented in eqs 48 and 49 17 45 so2 h2o h2so3 2h so3 2 46 so3 2 o so4 2 47 so4 2 dye r reduced dye 48 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e 49 s2o8 2 dye r oxidized dye ro the use of nacl salt as a supporting electrolyte leads to the formation of active chlorine species formed from chloride ions at the surface of suitable anodes which are considered as oxidants for treating wastewaters through indirect oxidation 46 the generation of active chlorine species during oxidation of chlorides is presented in eqs 19 21 51 however it has been reported by dominguez et al 51 that higher chloride ion contents promote the generation of large amounts of other chlorine species i e clo2 clo3 and clo4 these species are oh consuming with less oxidizing potential which limits the efficiency of electrochemical treatment eqs 29 34 they lead to the possible generation of persistent organochlorine products which may be more toxic than their parent molecules 46 their amount can be reduced by the irradiation of the solution as reported by kiwi et al 52 5 2 effect of ph the stability of the oxidizing agents in the solution depends on their ph the pka of hocl clo couple is given equal to 7 55 17 globally chlorine cl2 is the predominant species when ph 3 00 hypochlorous acid hocl for 3 00 ph 7 50 and hypochlorite ion clo for ph 7 50 53 hocl has the highest standard potential e 1 49 v she compared to cl2 e 1 36 v she and clo e 0 89 v she hence the indirect oxidation of pollutants by active chlorine must be efficient under acidic conditions it is well known that oh formation is better in acidic media 34 generally in the case of reactive oxygen species among them oh ho2 o2 and h2o2 are of special research interest because of their oxidation potential they are ph dependent where at higher ph conditions they will be converted to their anion forms which are characterized by lower oxidation ability 46 similarly in the case of persulfate the solution ph can influence the type of the formed species therefore in the basic medium many species can be produced as presented in eqs 50 55 36 50 so4 oh oh so4 2 51 s2o8 2 2h2o ho2 2so4 2 3h 52 ho2 s2o8 2 so4 so4 2 h o2 53 hso5 so5 2 h 54 so5 2 h2o h2o2 so4 2 55 hso5 h2o2 h so4 2 h2o o2 5 3 effect of applied current or potential in the wastewater electrochemical cells a constant current a or current density a m 2 is provided to the cell in galvanostatic mode however a constant potential v is supplied between the cathode and the anode of the cell in potentiostatic mode the electrochemical degradation was carried out sometime in a three electrode cell i e a working electrode anode a counter electrode cathode and a reference electrode at the laboratory scale usually eaops are operated in a galvanostatic mode with an inactive anode where high cell voltage is required for the concomutant oxidation of organics and water 14 46 this parameter has to be optimized since it directly influences the amount of oxidizing species parasitic reactions energy consumption and the mce 14 for example in the study performed by cai et al 54 current density influences positively the toc removal which can be assigned to the increased production of oh and reactive species similarly the degradation kinetic rate of 2 chlorobenzoic acid on bdd anode was improved by increasing the current from 50 to 300 ma where the apparent kinetic rate increased from 0 015 min 1 to 0 034 min 1 respectively 19 however increasing the current density value enhances energy consumption and leads to decrease mce values 55 for example el ghenymy et al 56 reported that after 180 min of electrolysis increasing the current density enhanced the toc removal efficiency of orange g reaching 77 85 94 and 100 at 33 67 100 and 150 ma cm 2 respectively fig 3 a whereas they affirmed that the mineralization current efficiency dropped while increasing the current density mce values were about 15 9 8 and 6 at 33 67 100 and 150 ma cm 2 respectively after 180 min of electrolysis fig 3b 5 4 effect of temperature although the temperatures of wastewater are different it is necessary to evaluate its effect on the efficiency of the ao process it has been reported that temperature has an important effect on the mass diffusion of particles in wastewater the conductivity of the entire degradation system the reaction rates between pollutants and oxidation groups and it may lead to indirect differences in ec 57 yavuz et al 58 observed a little change in decolorization efficiency for different temperatures 25 30 and 40 c concluding that there is no need to adjust the temperature of the solution and the model wastewater can be treated at its normal temperature fig 4 a however another study reported that a rise in the temperature from 20 c to 40 c favored cod removal due to the enhancement of the electro generation of inorganic oxidizing agents 44 for instance high temperatures may enhance the rate of oxidation reaction between organics and active chlorine 59 similarly petrucci et al 60 observed a positive effect of the increase of temperature on the elimination of reactive blue 19 dye the rate of mineralization was less than 80 at 20 c while it was increased to 90 at 60 c after 480 min and 360 min respectively moreover further improvement was achieved at 60 c resulting in total discolorisation in half the operating time required at 20 c fig 4b dos santos et al 61 reported that rising temperature from 25 c to 45 c influences tartrazine treatment efficiency results revealed a large enhancement of color reduction rapid toc removal higher mce values and gradually lower ectoc as the temperature was increased 5 5 pollutants concentration the initial pollutant concentration affects the ao process with a logical outcome in which highly concentrated effluents require longer electrolysis time to reach a given degradation percentage 19 62 63 panizza and oturan reported that the kinetic rate constant lessened with the increasing pollutant concentration due to the progressive acceleration of parasitic reactions between the oxidation intermediates and oh species 64 increasing the initial pollutant amount while keeping other parameters constant reduced both pollutant decay and cod removal efficiency which necessitates longer reaction times for complete purification of concentrated solutions generally this behavior is linked to the higher concentration of organics in solution to react with a similar amount of oxidizing species 63 6 electro fenton ef is an extended version of the fenton process in which h2o2 is in situ electrochemically generated in acidic conditions 98 99 fenton based technologies are known by their higher efficiency for the removal of organic pollutants where previous papers were reviewed the recent developments and applications of this technique for instance liu et al 100 summarized recent development in the in situ production of h2o2 in fenton fenton like process nair et al 101 are interested to carbonaceous cathode materials used for ef mousset et al 102 reviewed the potential of ef process in the case of its combination with biological treatments sirés and brillas 103 studied the fenton based electrochemical advanced reporting several trends for upgrading classical fenton processes limitations dos santos et al 104 investigated its efficiency toward pharmaceuticals compounds more recent and interesting reviews can be found elsewhere 100 105 108 depending on the form in which the iron enters the system the ef process can be presented in two forms cathodic and anodic fenton processes fig 5 in cathodic fenton processes iron is added as fe ii or fe iii salt and one or both reagents fe ii and h2o2 are produced in situ eqs 59 and 60 whereas in anodic fenton processes also known as peroxicoagulation process the source of the ferrous ion required for fenton reaction is a sacrificial iron fe 0 anode eq 61 38 109 the process involves the classical fenton mechanism in the absence of pollutants as presented in eqs 59 64 28 38 110 112 practically it has been reported that ef process is more efficient in acidic condition especially at the solution ph around 3 113 however for ph lower than three may decrease the availability of h2o2 due to reactions in eq 65 and 66 consequently the increase of ph enhances the decomposition of h2o2 to form o2 and h2o eq 67 and leads to coagulate pollutants by fe oh n formed at higher ph 18 56 o2 g 2h 2e h2o2 57 fe3 e fe2 58 fe 0 fe2 2e 59 i n i t i a t i o n f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 o h oh 70 m 1 s 1 60 f e 3 h 2 o 2 f e 2 h h o 2 0 001

peroxide that prevents the risks of its storage transport and handling besides the possibility of controlling and optimizing the degradation and mineralization kinetics and performing mechanistic studies moreover it promotes a higher elimination of organic compounds due to continuous regeneration of fe2 ions at the cathode and the non formation of sludge 35 however similarly to fenton process the performance of ef also depends on fenton reagent concentration an increase of fe2 and h2o2 concentrations may limit the process by scavenging reactions eqs 43 and 64 which decreases the reactivity of oh 28 practically the ef process can combine ao and ef efficiencies by using an active or non active anode and carbonaceous cathode 34 table 2 contains examples of the removal of some organic pollutants by the ef process 6 1 effect of iron catalyst concentration fe2 concentration is a key parameter of the fenton reaction the efficiency of the ef process increases with the increase of fe2 concentration where the generation rate of h2o2 via o2 reduction is identical to fe2 amount it has been reported that upon an optimal value of fe2 concentration the efficiency of the process decreases due to the presence of parasitic reactions related to the higher amount of fe2 eqs 63 and 64 garcia segura et al 114 studied the effect of fe2 concentration on flumequine degradation by the ef process fig 6 they observed that a higher degradation rate was attained using 2 0 and 4 0 mm fe2 at 240 min moreover from 0 5 to 4 0 mm fe2 about 75 of incineration was always obtained at 360 min however for a concentration higher than 6 0 mm fe2 they reported that the efficiency was highly decreased after 240 min where only 58 of toc decay was reached they attributed this behavior to the higher fe2 concentration that leads to generate fe iii complexes of short carboxylic acids which react slowly with bdd oh and the consumption of oh with the excess of fe2 added the same result was reported elsewhere 115 similarly lin et al 116 reported that for a solution of 0 2 mm of sucralose treated under 200 ma applied current and 50 mm of na2so4 using pt and bdd anodes increasing the fe2 concentration from 0 05 to 0 2 mm enhanced the mineralization however it decreases by enhancing the fe2 concentration to 0 5 mm for both pt and bdd anodes consequently they had chosen 0 2 mm as the optimal fe2 concentration likewise panizza et al 64 investigated the influence of fe2 concentration on the electrochemical oxidation of 200 mg l 1 altrazin red ar applying a constant current of 300 ma at ph 3 and using bdd anode and graphite felt gf cathode results revealed that the ar removal increased with increasing catalyst concentration from 0 1 to 0 2 mm and decreased by increasing the amount of fe2 above 0 2 mm the same result was reported by zazou et al when they investigated the degradation of real textile wastewater using bdd gf system 115 and oturan et al while studying the removal of para aminosalicylic acid using bdd gf and pt gf cells 117 6 2 effect of current the applied current is usually a critical parameter in eaops and similarly for the ef process it is considered as the driving force for h2o2 production the amount of oh radicals formed during electrolysis and the electro regeneration of fe2 it is directly related to the applied voltage on the electrochemical system which affects the efficiency of the process and its cost 18 however a higher applied current leads to higher oxygen evolution and hydrogen production eqs 68 and 69 that limit some main reactions such as the direct oxidation of water and regeneration of fe2 on the anode and cathode respectively 18 68 2h2o 4h o2 4e 69 2h 2e h2 lin et al 116 reported that the elimination rate of sucralose suc enhanced with increasing the current from 100 to 200 ma in both bdd cf and pt cf systems the mineralization percentage of suc solution in both systems decreased when the current increased from 200 to 500 ma due to the parasitic reaction fig 7 a hence as a result they selected 200 ma as the optimal current moreover mce values dropped with the increase of the applied current from 100 to 500 ma in both cells for instance the mce values after 60 min at 100 200 300 and 500 ma were 32 20 14 and 9 respectively fig 7 b however during the first 120 min reaction ectoc in pt cf cell was higher than that in the bdd cf cell reporting that at 30 120 180 and 360 min it reached for pt cf cell about 0 17 0 26 0 31 and 0 55 kw h g 1 toc while for bdd cf system these values were 0 12 0 23 0 33 and 0 65 kw h g 1 toc respectively fig 7 c teymori et al 118 optimized the current density for the elimination of malachite green mg by ef process using iron as anode and cathode in the electrolytic cell based on the removal efficiency and energy consumption they showed that increasing the applied current density from 2 5 ma cm 2 to 10 ma cm 2 enhanced the removal efficiency from 76 to 94 however increasing the current density up to 15 ma cm 2 changed slightly mg removal consequently they considered 10 ma cm 2 as an optimal value since the electrical energy consumption is proportional to the applied current similarly jiao et al 119 investigated the effect of current on the removal of orange ii they observed that increasing the current above 100 ma the orange ii removal efficiency in dsa modified activated carbon fiber cells kept constantly above 98 it showed only a slight increase when they increased the density of current from 100 to 200 ma cm 2 fig 8 a they also reported that after 120 min h2o2 concentration was affected by current reaching 49 2 100 2 139 8 and 189 6 mg l 1 using 50 100 150 and 200 ma respectively fig 8b 6 3 effect of temperature temperature can affect the electron transfer mass transfer rate the self decomposition of hydrogen peroxide the concentration of dissolved o2 and fe2 regeneration 120 121 it may affect the efficiency of the treatment as observed by wang et al 122 that displayed the influence of temperature 25 c 35 c and 45 c on the discolorisation of real dyeing wastewater using graphite cathodes and pt ti anode from the reported results the discolorisation efficiency decreased from 71 to 39 as the temperature increased likewise the toc removal efficiency of nitrotoluenes was favorable at low temperatures where the toc at 303 k was higher than at 323 k 95 vs 85 at 3 h as reported by chen et al 123 on the other hand it may have a positive effect on ef efficiency for instance the degradation kinetics of bromothymol blue was improved when the temperature rises from 20 c to 40 c and the apparent kinetic rate constants kapp obtained at 20 30 and 40 c were 0 203 0 212 and 0 262 min 1 respectively 124 in summary this parameter should be optimized to not affect the efficiency of the process 6 4 effect of supporting electrolyte generally and similarly to all eaops the use of supporting electrolytes is necessary for the treatment of low conductivity effluents by the ef process na2so4 has been observed to be the most used electrolyte in the ef process 18 it has been utilized for the treatment of different molecule models where active sulfate species can enhance the treatment efficiency usually 50 mm na2so4 is employed for the ef process leading to a great current passage therefore increasing its concentration above 50 mm may lead to enhance side reactions as observed by gökkuş et al 125 when the electrolyte was more concentrated the limited currents increased and the reduction potential became lower 126 for instance yahya et al 127 reported a higher mineralization efficiency of na2so4 compared to nacl for the treatment of ofloxcacin ofl antibiotic drug solution by ef using platinum anode and cf cathode they showed that the cod decays were 75 3 in na2so4 and 63 6 for nacl after 300 min of treatment using 0 2 mm ofl 0 2 mm fe2 50 mm na2so4 100 mm nacl at ph 3 0 and under 200 ma current intensity for further comparison with other salts thiam et al 128 evaluated the effect of the supporting electrolyte nature on the removal of carmoisine solutions using ef with bdd anode and air diffusion cathode in a recirculation flow cell the conditions were 209 3 mg l 1 of carmoisine ph 3 0 0 5 mm fe2 and 35 c using 50 mm of na2so4 liclo4 or nacl results showed that the degradation efficiency increases in the order nacl liclo4 na2so4 with a quick decolorization that needs about 25 min for cl and 60 min for either so4 2 and clo4 to get a colorless solution fig 9 a they attributed the quicker discolorisation rate of clo4 compared to so4 2 to the generation of smaller amounts of oh in the sulfate media due to the partial inhibition of fenton s reaction by the formation of sulfate iron complexes however for toc decay they observed a quick reduction of about 67 in so4 2 63 in clo4 and 57 in cl during the first 180 min reporting that upon the further treatment the toc removal was slightly enhanced and attained maximum mineralization of 76 72 and 64 respectively fig 9b the decrease of the efficiency of nacl may be attributed to the formation of organochlorine molecules in the presence of chlorine species and or the depletion of h2o2 in this electrolyte by its reaction with hclo to produce o2 gas and cl ions eq 70 128 70 hclo h2o2 cl o2 g h2o h however comparing the same ions mentioned above daneshvar et al 129 reported that maximal mineralization of about 75 was achieved during the oxidation of orange ii by ef at ph 3 0 using a stirred reactor with a gf cathode and pt anode in clo4 in this study the mineralization order was clo4 cl so4 2 and the concentration of naclo4 did not influence the degradation of orange ii when its amount was increased from 0 05 to 0 1 m moreover they explained the weaker degradation in so4 2 media by the consumption of fe2 ions as sulfate iron complexes 7 importance of chelating agents and heterogeneous ef process ef process showed a higher potential in degrading various types of organic pollutants however its application in acidic ph between 2 5 and 3 5 154 limits its implementation on a large scale as the ph of the industrial wastewater is alkaline or neutral the iron catalyst is converted to insoluble hydroxides depending on the ph value under these conditions the elimination of organics is likely to happen by the electrocoagulation process rather than by degradation 155 therefore this technical challenge can be overcome using some solutions that help in extending the operational ph range among them the use of chelating agents and hef instead of conventional one remains the most promising tool that may promote its real application in wastewater treatment plants 7 1 effect of chelating agent in order to enhance the catalytic activity of iron toward h2o2 at higher ph chelating compounds are used depending on their ability to form stable complexes with fe iii 154 the production of these complexes prevents the precipitation of fe iii where the degradation efficiency can be improved via accelerating the cycling of fe ii fe iii by the reduction of fe iii complexes at the cathode 156 whereby faster reduction rates of fe iii complexes occur for those with higher redox potential table 3 157 although as reported by liu et al 158 conventional cathodes such as cf can not ensure continuously the reduction of fe iii complex therefore they demonstrated that ni coating might be an excellent candidate for introducing atomic hydrogen h which has a higher potential for fe ii complex regeneration they reported that toc removal of ciprofloxacin increased from 42 cf to 81 ni cf at a natural ph in the case of humic acid the ligands used in this approach may be natural as humic acids or synthetic as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds oxalate citrate and nitrilotriacetic acid nta 154 the chelates must be chosen carefully depending on their different impacts on the redox potential of fe ii fe iii their stability ph range the metal ligand bond strength functional chemical structure and toxicity and biodegradability of both chelate and complex formed table 3 156 159 160 generally it has to be employed in excess to largely complex iron present in the medium and re complex those released from the destruction of the chelate by oh 160 nevertheless their added amount to the electrolytic cell must be optimized since they contribute to increase the toc of the treated effluent 154 this condition may present a limitation for the use of some biodegradable and non toxic agents such as oxalate fe chelate 1 20 table 3 where large amounts must be added to complete the complexation of fe iii as reported elsewhere 160 the ph of effluents changes depending on their original source table 3 presents some examples of chelates that can be used for different types of wastewaters depending on their ph as shown in table 3 nta and edta are the most stable agents in a wide range of ph in contrast considering the environmental sustainability requirements edds was reported to present a better choice that ensures good performance 103 however for a ph value above eight the chelating agents lose their efficiency in complexing iron 159 it is worthy to mention that these substances have a photoactive character that could be beneficial for enhancing the treatment via photo associated processes such as photo fenton and pef 161 162 7 2 heterogeneous ef process the development of hef has gained much interest recently it is been developed to use insoluble iron catalysts prepared catalyst by the load of transition metals in inorganic or organic materials nanoparticles or through cathodic materials with iron 164 165 it allows extending the treatment to circum neutral ph conditions where the production of oh from fenton reaction becomes possible through heterogeneous fenton s reaction between fe ii and h2o2 at the catalyst surface 164 166 169 yu et al 170 reported that using pyrite in ef process allowed the achievement of higher toc removal under neutral and alcalin ph compared to homogenuous ef process fig 10 in this case the degradation and mineralization of 50 mg l 1diclofenac under 31 84 ma cm 2 and at ph 3 are similar where pyrite ef is slightly higher compared to ef and electrolysis fig 10a however at ph 7 and 9 pyrite ef yielded higher removal efficiency fig 10 b and c compared to the other processes after 180 min treatment the toc removal reached 45 60 and 85 by electrolysis ef and pyrite ef respectively fig 10d the use of some catalysts allows the release of low amounts of iron to the treated solution preventing the formation of undesired sludge in this case oh can be generated in the bulk of the solution and on the catalyst surface contrarily in the case of stable catalysts 154 155 for instance barhoumi et al 171 attributed the higher efficiency for the removal of sulfamethazine by pyrite ef compared to the classical ef to the higher concentration of iron ii released into the solution during the electrolysis for 2 g l 1 of pyrite fe2 concentration released was found to be 4 5 mm whereas it was only 0 2 mm in the case of ef reaching 83 and 87 of toc removal respectively zhang et al 172 quantified the production of oh radicals during ef and hef where modified iron carbon with polytetrafluoroethylene was used as a heterogeneous catalyst the study was performed using 25 mmol l 1 dimethyl sulfoxide at ph 7 7 and under i 100 ma 153 6 μ mol l 1 was detected as maximum oh amount at 120 min of electrolysis in the case of hef whereas in the case of ef the highest obtained amount of oh was about 100 μ mol l 1 at 60 min after 120 min they observed that the concentration of oh in ef did not increase attributing this result to the possible precipitation of fe2 as ferric hydroxides in neutral condition this approach is believed to be cost efficient due to the possible reuse of the catalyst several times 164 several authors confirmed the low cost of this process leading to a higher efficiency for the removal of target pollutants for instance yang et al 173 reported the excellent stability of the synthesized feiifeiii layered double hydroxide modified carbon felt feiifeiii ldh cf toward the degradation and mineralization of ofloxacin after 6 runs fig 11 they observed that the complete removal of the studied molecules and a slight decrease of 12 of toc removal after six runs moreover they affirmed that even after 20 reuse cycles the characterization of the cathode showed that feiifeiii ldh particles were still crowded and clustered on the cathode these results affirm that this modified cathode can be used for a long term in hef similarly dong et al 174 reported the stability of the prepared self supporting carbon fiber paper electrode modified by fe and mn even after five reuses indicating its possible use for long time service they attributed this result to the low leaching of fe and mn in the solution after a long electrolysis time likewise heidari et al 175 highlighted the efficiency of chalcopyrite as an iron based natural catalyst for the elimination of cefazolin by hef they found that this catalyst yields higher stability even after five runs with higher removal efficiency compared to several catalysts some recent examples on the efficiency of hef for the removal of different organic pollutants are gathered in table 4 heterogeneous catalysts can be grouped into five categories i iron minerals such as ferrite ferrihydrite goethite magnetite schlor hematite and pyrite ii waste materials such as fly ash and sludge containing iron iii zero valent iron iv iron and iron oxide loaded onto activated carbon alumina biosorbent fiber silica or zeolite and v soil with laterite or clays such as bentonite kaolinite laponite montmorillonite sepiolite etc 155 materials such as goethite magnetite hematite pyrite vermiculite clays or synthesized catalysts have shown higher efficiency for the treatment of different target pollutants 166 in the case of cathode materials used in hef materials functionalized with iron and or transition metals present the best option they are generally used to improve cathode properties and increase the electric conductivity besides h2o2 electrogeneration 165 cathode modifications can be gathered under three categories 101 i carbonaceous materials grafted by fe fe containing compounds like fe fe2o3 3d graphene 188 ii fe fe transition metals coated on carbon aerogels such as fecuc aerogel 189 and iii bimetallic materials on carbon fe co gf 190 more recent applications of modified carbon materials are reviewed elsewhere 101 165 191 8 cathode modifications it is well known that cathode material plays an important role in the ef ef efficiency depends on the capacity of the cathode material to produce hydrogen peroxide which controls the generation rate of oh species the main oxidant for the elimination of organic pollutants 192 outran et al 35 reported the interest gained by carbonaceous cathodes instead of mercury for h2o2 production based on their non toxicity good stability higher conductivity and chemical resistance in addition to higher overvoltage for h2 evolution reaction and the low catalytic activity for hydrogen peroxide decomposition cathodes such as carbon polytetrafluoroethylene oxygen diffusion graphite and three dimensional electrodes activated carbon fiber carbon felt carbon sponge reticulated vitreous carbon and carbon nanotubes are practically highly thought for instance liu et al 193 investigated the elimination of perfluorooctanoate pfoa by ef with h2o2 generated on a hierarchically porous carbon cathode by oxygen reduction reaction using three electrode cell they reported an efficient mineralization of pfoa with a toc removal of 91 and 70 at ph 2 and 6 respectively using 0 4 v applied potential at 4 h time electrolysis sopaj et al 192 investigated the impact of the cathode on ef efficiency for the mineralization of sulfamethazine smt drug they studied the effect of different cathode electrodes such as stainless steel ss carbon sponge cs and cf with different porosities the best results were obtained using cs anodes that generate higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide in the solution the cs with a porosity of 45 ppi was the most effective followed by cf cathode however ss produced fewer amounts of h2o2 for a current ranging from 50 to 100 ma concerning smt removal they observed that the most effective system was pt cs 45 ppi achieving a mineralization rate of 91 at 300 ma while the poorest mineralization rate of 41 was obtained using pt ss system in the same operating conditions the amount of h2o2 produced during electrolysis can be monitored spectroscopically by titration of the complex 1 1 formed between ti iv and h2o2 measuring its color intensity in acidic media at a wavelength of 423 nm moreover the current efficiency ɛ of h2o2 generation can be calculated using eq 71 119 192 71 ε nfcv 0 t idt where n is the electron s number involved in the formation of h2o2 through oxygen reduction n 2 f is the faraday constant 96 485 c m 1 v is volume l i is the current a c is the concentration of h2o2 m and t is the electrolysis time s compared to conventional carbonaceous materials the modified cathodes can yield to increase in the amount of h2o2 produced in the reactor modifications can be achieved through introducing other active carbon materials to carbon support such as graphene doping with a heteroatom o n f b and addition of a metal oxide such as mno2 ta2o5 v2o5 ceo2 etc 191 furthermore recent strategies and trends used to develop two electron oxygen reduction reaction orr catalysts for h2o2 were reviewed by anantharaj et al 194 table 5 shows a comparison between different conventional and modified cathodes in terms of h2o2 production 9 regeneration of cathode as long as these eaops are on the way to be developed for large scale applications cathode modifications have gained attention recently for increasing h2o2 production and hef applications the characteristics of cathode materials in terms of reuse and stability are an interesting issue generally cathode recyclability affects its performance and the total maintenance costs 191 several authors investigated the long term stability of different cathodes highlighting their potential reuse su et al 204 reported the stability of the cathode prepared by introducing iron in the interior of carbon nanotube cavities cnts they observed that this cathode exhibits a higher h2o2 production low iron leaching levels and higher removal of phenol which were 9 68 times faster when compared with iron being confined externally on the walls of cnts moreover they demonstrated the dependency of the cathode reuse on the iron 0 amount and efficient conversion between iron iii and iron ii where for fe 0 the 2e pathway of the orr was likely dominant the measurement of the reusability of the cathode to evaluate its stability was investigated after five runs results showed that phenol elimination and the rate constant decreased to 79 32 and 29 36 respectively garcía rodríguez et al 205 evaluated the stability of carbon felt iron oxide air diffusion cathode prepared by the electrodeposition of iron iii they reported that after 10 runs a gradual loss of fe oxide deposits from the cathode and a drop of dye mineralization rate was observed fig 12 after 360 min of electrolysis of a solution of 50 mg l 1 malachite green at 21 7 ma cm 2 and ph 3 toc removal value decreased from 85 to 68 it has been reported that doping cathodes with heteroatoms such as fluorine boron oxygen phosphate and nitrogen that present stable active sites for 2 e orr can enhance the stability of cathode materials 191 206 207 in the case of doping with heteroatoms the co bond becomes longer than the oo which favors ooh groups desorption and increases the 2e transfer for example deng et al 197 reported the higher stability of nickel foam cathode coated with nitrogen doped porous carbon after five cycles in terms of hydrogen peroxide production and sulfathiazole removal they reported that under optimal conditions fe2 0 mm for h2o2 study or 0 25 mm for ef experiments current density 20 ma cm 2 ph 3 sulfathiazole 50 mg l 1 and flow rate 500 ml min 1 about 1519 mm of h2o2 was accumulated and almost total removal of sulfathiazole was obtained after 3 h of electrolysis time similarly hu et al 208 affirmed the higher activity and stability of n and o self doped biomass porous carbon cathode synthesized by black soya bean with h2o2 accumulation even after 4 cycles likewise the stable accumulation of h2o2 was observed by zhu et al 209 in the case of a cathode co doped with n and s atoms after being reused for 10 times under 25 ma cm 2 current density similar observations were reported by other authors elsewhere 177 200 furthermore cathode modification with other compounds such as polymers of aniline tetrafluoro ethylene anthraquinone and its derivatives were reported to have a significant effect to enhance the selectively of h2o2 production 194 210 10 photoelectro fenton the pef process is the association of uv radiation and the conventional ef process which leads to producing more oh than in the ef process 211 this process enhances the degradation rate of target pollutants through additional oh generated from the irradiation of h2o2 uvc light 200 300 nm 35 eq 72 the photochemical reduction of fe3 ions which regenerate fe2 eqs 73 77 and the irradiation of intermediates and fe oh 2 complexes formed under acidic conditions at λ 580 nm eq 78 34 52 111 212 72 h2o2 hv 2 oh 73 fe3 h2o hv oh fe2 h 74 fe3 h2o fe oh 2 h 75 fe oh 2 hv fe2 oh 76 fe3 2h2o fe oh 2 2h 77 fe oh 2 hν feoh oh 78 fe oocr 2 hν fe2 co2 g r where r is the organic compound several research papers reported the superior efficiency of pef over ef which has been well proved for various pollutants table 6 khataee et al 213 investigated a comparison between ef and pef technologies for the elimination of triarylmethane dye in a recirculating reactor using an uv c lamp 254 nm of 15 w they observed that the degradation efficiency of ef and pef processes for 20 mg l 1 of dye solution was 23 and 98 after 60 min of reaction time respectively almeida et al 214 studied the mineralization of 244 mg l 1 of acid red 29 ar29 azo dye by pef compared to ef process using bdd air diffusion system the mineralization obtained by ef was poor compared to fast discolorisation and nearly complete mineralization of ar29 solution by pef they attributed this result to the faster destruction of intermediates by the synergistic action of the formed bdd oh oh radicals and uv a irradiation they observed that the degradation of ar29 followed the pseudo first order kinetic model under optimal conditions of 0 5 1 0 mm fe2 and ph 3 0 the same observations were reported by garcia segura et al 114 during the galvanostatic treatment of flumequine by pef and ef using bdd anode and air diffusion cathode they achieved partial mineralization 75 89 of flumequine solution by ef using 2 0 mm of fe2 at ph 3 0 fig 13 a whereas the pef process was more efficient and about 94 96 of toc removal was achieved fig 13b this difference can be attributed to fe iii oxamate and fe iii oxalate complexes which undergo quick photolysis under uv a irradiation solano et al 25 affirmed the higher effectiveness of the pef process compared to ef and ao h2o2 for the degradation of congo red dye solutions they observed that the efficiency of the oxidation decreased in this order pef ef ao h2o2 where complete mineralization was achieved by pef after 360 min at j 66 7 ma cm 2 due to the parallel photolytic action of uv a light fig 14 moreover as mentioned in section 6 3 organochlorine compounds limit the efficiency of the ef process which can be overcome by applying photo

production of cl yields to the formation of different reactive species such as cl2 cl hocl and oh as presented in reactions eqs 83 87 these species can react with fenton reagents h2o2 and fe2 besides

which renewable and free sunlight can be used as a uv source to irradiate the solution this process has been examined by different authors table 6 for instance solano et al 25 performed the treatment of acidic solutions of congo red by spef technique using a solar flow reactor equipped with a pt air diffusion filter press system results confirmed the viability of spef for the remediation of water polluted with congo red under the most favorable conditions of 0 26 mm dye 0 50 mm of fe2 50 mm of na2so4 and 100 ma cm 2 current density almost total mineralization 49 of mce and ec of 0 45 kw h g 1 cod were attained in 240 min because of the fast photodecarboxylation of the fe iii carboxylate complexes murrieta et al 216 highlighted the efficiency of a new solar photoelectron fenton like spef like process which prevents the use of a gas diffusion cathode commonly used for the electro generation of h2o2 and promotes the use of more simple and cheaper electrodes in this study they investigated the elimination of acid red 1 ar1 using a flow reactor including a filter press cell endowed with a ti ir sn sb oxide anode electrode to oxidize cl ions to hclo and a ss cathode comparing the spef like technique with ao process with electro generated active cl2 ao hclo electro fenton like ef like processes and photoelectro fenton like pef like they observed that the oxidation power increased in the order ao hclo ef like pef like spef like fig 15 hence for the treatment of 0 2 mm ar1 in 25 mm na2so4 and 35 mm nacl at ph 3 0 under 15 ma cm 2 current density and in the presence of 0 40 mm fe2 total discolorization and 74 of cod removal at 120 min and 480 min respectively with 0 076 kw h g 1 cod of energy consumption and 25 of average current efficiency were obtained fig 15 11 conclusion recently the control of water pollution has taken on increasing importance pollution sources are different based on the origin of the contaminants among them dyes pops and emergent pollutants have attracted heightened awareness in the wastewater treatment field due to their higher toxicity higher ability to migrate in food chains and their bioaccumulation potential due to the efficiency and non selectivity of eaops they gained a higher interest for being a promising way for the removal of organic pollutants in different matrices their efficiency has been confirmed by the achievement of high removal rates very efficient remediation of water and low energy consumption hence efforts ought to explore the possibility of eaops applications at industrial large plant scale for treating organic pollutants in future developments homogeneous fenton processes using chelating agents and hef based ones showed a higher potential of organic removal at higher ph they present promising tools that may promote the real application of these techniques in wastewater treatment plants future studies should focus on improving the stability of the solid catalysts and modified cathodes for long periods investigating the application of hef based processes on real wastewaters therefore efforts out to be made to give more details on the cost efficient of large scale applications of these techniques and their long term efficiency availability of data and materials all data generated or analyzed during this study are recorded from recently published papers
