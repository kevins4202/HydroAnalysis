17760,biochar draws increasing attention as soil amendment carbon sink slow release fertilizer and adsorbent herein it was interesting to find out that among 11 kinds of commercial biochar 3 of them facilitated ferrate oxidation of sulfamethoxazole smx with the addition of biochar oxidation rates of 5 kinds of organic pollutants including antibiotics pharmaceuticals and personal care product increased by 3 14 times and the total organic carbon toc removal ratio increased by 2 4 8 times radical scavenging experiment electron spin resonance esr analysis and probe compound sulfoxide oxidation experiment showed that no radical but intermediate iron species fe iv and fe v participated in the oxidation reactions redox active moieties phenolic hydroxyl on biochar interact with ferrate as electron shuttle and enhance the formation of intermediate iron species through electron transfer the intermediate iron species not only interacted with organic pollutants and accelerated their transformation but also corrupted oxidized the physical structure of biochar and expanded its surface area and pore volume increase of surface area and pore volume of the spent biochar in turn resulted in the improved adsorption capacity in addition to eliminating emerging organic pollutants ferrate biochar removed 8 7 31 6 of toc in authentic water and decreased the formation potential of

reactivity of fe v and fe iv species was higher by several orders of magnitude rush et al 1995 sharma 2011 high reactivity of intermediate iron species also made them unstable and easy to decompose huang et al 2018 lee et al 2014 exploring methods to enhance the formation of intermediate iron species is promising for the control of organic pollutants in aquatic environment biochar is a carbon material prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass compared with activated carbon biochar was easy to be prepared low pyrolysis temperature no further activation treatment but its capacity on pollutants adsorption was inferior on the other hand due to the low temperature pyrolysis treatment organics of biomass were not sufficiently carbonized aromatic moieties phenolic moieties quinone moieties

interact with ferrate through electron transfer process exploring the effect of biochar on ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants and revealing the reaction mechanism would facilitate the water

discussion 3 1 effect of biochar on ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants five kinds of emerging organic pollutants smx cbz cip dcf and deet were used to test the effect of biochar on ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants when these pollutants were adsorbed by biochar alone less than 7 of smx cbz cip dcf and deet was removed within 20 min fig 1 a as mentioned in the introduction part biochar was prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass without further chemical activation or physical activation activation is a dominant step for the development of micropore structure in activated carbon and endows its adsorption capacity hayashi et al 2000 no activation treatment makes the adsorption capacity of biochar inferior compared with biochar ferrate was effective for the removal of organic pollutants around 75 of smx 70 of cbz 97 of cip and 65 of dcf was oxidized by ferrate at ph 8 0 within 20 min respectively fig 1b in comparison deet was resistant to ferrate oxidation and less than 15 of deet was oxidized under the same conditions these results are in accordance with published data which smx cbz cip and dcf could be oxidized by ferrate jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2015 while deet was a recalcitrant pollutant aghdam et al 2017 li et al 2019a zhang et al 2019a interestingly as biochar and ferrate were co added into the polluted water removal rate and removal ratio of the 5 pollutants were improved fig 1c content of cip and dcf initial content 10 μm dropped below hplc detection limit within 5 min of reaction and content of smx and cbz dropped below the detection limit within 20 min compared with the oxidation of deet in ferrate alone group the removal percentage of deet surpassed 70 in 20 min in ferrate biochar group the determined pseudo first order reaction rate constants obtained in ferrate biochar group were 3 14 times higher than that achieved in ferrate alone group fig 1d in pilot experiment the removal of organic pollutants in ferrate biochar system at ph 7 0 was determined the reactions were fast and the cip and dcf would be removed within minutes or seconds fig s1 which made it difficult to determine the accurate reaction rate constant thus experiments were conducted at ph 8 0 the result suggested that biochar significantly improved ferrate oxidation removal of organic pollutants in aqueous solution results above showed that the target pollutants were effectively removed in the system however whether the pollutants were oxidized or adsorbed by the spent biochar was uncertain the spent biochar was collected and extracted with methanol to determine the content of adsorbed pollutants fig s2 the results showed that the content of adsorbed smx cip and dcf was below hplc detection limit while low level of cbz 0 02 μmol and deet 0 035 μmol was adsorbed in the spent biochar according to fig 1c all the added smx cbz cip dcf and over 70 of deet had been removed within 20 min in the ferrate biochar system these data suggested that chemical oxidation was the dominant process for the abatement of the target pollutants in the ferrate biochar system hazardous products may form in the oxidation of organic pollutants stadler et al 2012 yang et al 2019 and some products could be consumed by biofilm in water distribution system hammes and egli 2005 eliminating toc could improve the stability chemical and microbial and quality of the treated water for the adsorption of smx cbz cip dcf and deet with biochar the average toc removal was around 7 fig 1e in ferrate treatment group around 12 of toc on average was removed after filtration ferrate oxidation transformed organic pollutants into hydroxylated products and these products may be further adsorbed by the ferrate resulted ferric nanoparticles yang et al 2018 in ferrate biochar group over 40 of toc was removed in treatment of smx and over 30 of toc was removed in treatment of cbz cip dcf and deet deet was recalcitrant to ferrate oxidation and less than 4 of toc was removed by the ferrate resulted particles ferric floc however 30 3 of toc was removed in the treatment of deet with ferrate biochar on average over 35 of toc was removed in the treatment of these 5 organics 22 higher than that in ferrate alone group and 28 higher than that in biochar adsorption group in addition to improving ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants biochar enhanced the removal of dissolved organics in the system different kinds of biochar were commercially available besides the biochar used in above experiment labeled as 1 another 10 kinds of biochar were investigated for their effect on catalyzing ferrate oxidation of smx fig 1f in combination of ferrate with biochar 2 4 5 7 8 and 10 smx was oxidized removed below detection limit within 20 min however adsorption capacity of biochar 2 7 and 10 was higher than that of biochar 1 and over 20 of smx was adsorbed by these samples within 20 min fig s3 it was difficult to distinguish the removal of smx by the enhanced ferrate oxidation process or by the biochar dominated adsorption process in these groups in comparison adsorption capacity of biochar 4 and 5 was inferior less than 10 of smx was adsorbed similar with biochar 1 biochar 4 and 5 also have intense effect on improving ferrate oxidation of smx to simplify the investigation biochar 1 was used in the following experiments 3 2 dominant oxidant in the ferrate biochar system previous studies reported that persistent free radicals on biochar and reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 induced by biochar suspension could contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants fang et al 2015 2017 fu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 since the removal of smx cbz cip dcf and deet was substantially improved in ferrate biochar system radicals may participate in the reaction process esr analysis and radical scavenging experiment were carried out to test the possible function of radicals in ferrate biochar system methanol and tert butanol were used as quenching agents to study the function of inorganic radicals in different system in ferrate oxidation of smx methanol and tert butanol showed no intense inhibiting effect fig 2 a for the oxidation of smx with ferrate biochar methanol and tert butanol inhibited the oxidation of smx by 18 6 and 13 1 respectively fig 2b isao yamazaki and lawrence h piette reported that etoh and tert butanol could scavenge the high valence iron species yamazaki and piette 1991 shao et al 2019 explored the effect of caso3 for ferrate activation and claimed that methanol may competitively react with fe v fe iv and thus impact the oxidation of target pollutants shao et al 2019 to further exclude the possible involvement of oh in ferrate biochar oxidation process oxidation of benzoic acid was tested fig 2c benzoic acid was a stable compound and could be oxidized by oh buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 less than 10 of benzoic acid was removed in ferrate biochar and ferrate biochar groups indicating that oh was not the dominant oxidant in ferrate biochar system in addition to radical scavenging experiment esr analysis was carried out to identify the existence of radicals esr spectra of the samples spiked with dmpo oh scavenger and tmp singlet oxygen scavenger had not obvious peaks fig s4 this indicates that neither oh nor singlet oxygen existed in ferrate biochar system it has been reported that organic radicals such as semiquinones cyclopentadienyls and phenoxyls known as persistent free radicals may exist in biochar and activate oxidants to degraded organic pollutant fang et al 2014b 2015 however no signal of persistent free radicals was recorded in the raw biochar spent biochar and the solution of ferrate biochar in addition studies reported that the half life of persistent free radicals ranged from hours to days under atmospheric conditions the biochar used in above experiment was aged for 30 days after rinse and its effect on accelerating ferrate oxidation of smx did not vary fig s5 persistent free radicals were not the active components resulting in the activation of ferrate by biochar ferrate was unstable in water and would decay into fe v fe iv and fe iii species at ph 8 0 58 of ferrate 50 μm decayed in 20 min fig 2d with the addition of biochar 10 mg l 86 of ferrate decayed in 20 min biochar reacted with ferrate and enhanced its decomposition formation of intermediate iron species may be enhanced in the reaction process sulfoxides were used as probe compounds to distinguish different oxidant in radical oxidation and ferrate oxidation reactions through the identification of oxidation products dong et al 2020 wang et al 2018b when ferrate solely reacted with pmso 9 79 μm at ph 8 0 4 19 μm of pmso was consumed through oxygen transfer reaction with the formation of 4 19 μm of pmso2 fig 2e when 9 79 μm of pmso was oxidized by the ferrate biochar system nearly all of the pmso was oxidized in 20 min with the formation of 9 77 μm of pmso2 fig 2f reaction rate of pmso with ferrate and ferrate biochar was 0 081 min 1 and 0 445 min 1 respectively oxidation of pmso in ferrate biochar system was 5 5 times higher than that in ferrate group adsorption experiment showed that less than 3 of pmso and pmso2 was adsorbed by the raw biochar and the spent biochar fig s6 above results indicate that the oxidative intermediate iron species were largely formed in the reaction of ferrate with biochar they may account for the enhanced oxidation of organic pollutants in the system fig 1 chemical properties of biochar before and after the reaction with ferrate were analyzed with xps fig s7 after the reaction percentage of c element on raw biochar decreased from 82 46 to 78 59 accordingly the percentage of o increased from 17 54 to 20 86 and the percentage of fe increased from 0 to 0 55 table s2 the photoelectron spectrum of c 1s of biochar could be divided into 4 sub peaks attributing to graphitic structures aliphatic structures phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic groups domínguez et al 2013 fang et al 2014a after reaction with ferrate position of these sub peaks did not shift while intensity of these peaks varied fig 3 a and b generally relative intensity of phenolic hydroxyl on biochar decreased from 20 46 to 15 46 after the reaction while the relative intensity of carboxylic groups increased by 2 and proportions of aliphatic structures and graphitic structures on biochar did not show significant change before and after the reaction fig 3c this indicated that after the reaction of ferrate with biochar the reduction functional groups like phenolic hydroxyl on biochar were oxidized into oxidation functional groups like carboxylic groups the biochar used in this study was prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass at 300 c 500 c according to the published literature biochar prepared at this temperature has high capacity to donate electrons klüpfel et al 2014 the electron rich aromatic moieties on biochar may donate electron to ferrate with the enhanced formation of highly reactive intermediate iron species fe v and fe iv in the system fig 3d microscopic morphology and element component of raw biochar and spent biochar were analyzed through sem edx analysis the raw biochar was sphere and mainly composed by c and o after the reaction with ferrate floc mixed with the biochar the content of fe element and o element increased to 3 88 and 18 32 respectively while the content of c element decreased to 68 4 fig 4 a and b variation trend of these elements detected by edx analysis was similar with that detected by xps analysis table s2 increase of o element indicates that the biochar had been oxidized by examining the spent biochar with xrd and comparing the data with standard pattern it was found that the iron oxides on spent biochar were a mixture composed by fe3o4 jcpds 79 0416 and fe2o3 jcpds 21 0920 fig s8 previous studies reported that in ferrate oxidation of hazardous species and organic pollutants fe2o3 and feooh particles formed in the reaction prucek et al 2015 yang et al 2019 above result indicates that the iron oxides formed in ferrate biochar system were different with that formed in the reduction of ferrate biochar not only enhanced the formation of intermediate iron species in the reaction with ferrate but also influenced the property of the resulted iron oxides removal of solution toc was substantially improved after ferrate biochar treatment fig 1f by analyzing the variation of micro structures of raw biochar and spent biochar with bet it was found that the surface area sbet increased from 90 to 160 m2 g after the reaction with ferrate fig 4c in this process surface area of micropores smic increased from 9 1 to 35 9 m2 g improved by 400 and external surface area sext increased from 81 to 127 m2 g improved by 57 the total pore volume vtot of biochar increased from 0 46 to 0 88 cm3 g after reaction with ferrate fig 4d the volume of micropores vmic increased from 0 033 to 0 076 cm3 g and external volume vext increased from 0 41 to 0 8 cm3 g both the surface area and the pore volume of the spent biochar were improved this increase of surface area and pore volume would facilitate the adsorption of organic components similar with the chemical activation in the preparation of activated carbon reaction of ferrate with biochar led to the increase of biochar surface area and pore volume in above paragraphs we revealed that highly oxidative intermediate iron species formed in the ferrate biochar system these reactive species oxidized phenolic hydroxyl on biochar into graphitic structures aliphatic structures and carboxylic groups this process could be regarded as a kind of chemical activation in which the physical structure of biochar was corrupted by fe vi fe v and fe iv species with the expansion of biochar surface area and pore volume expanded surface area and enlarged pore volume contributed for the improved removal of toc in the system 3 3 controlling the formation of dbps in source water treatment in conventional water treatment natural organic matters nom more ubiquitously exist than emerging micro pollutants nom would influence aesthetic property such as turbidity and the intensity of color of water competitively consume water treatment agents such as coagulants oxidants and disinfectants and react with disinfectants with the formation of dbps xu et al 2007 effect of ferrate biochar treatment on the removal of toc and formation of dbps in source water was investigated by comparison with ferrate alone the collected source water sample containing 5 81 mg c l of toc when the dosage of biochar increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l toc removal increased from 1 3 to 3 5 fig 5 a effect of biochar adsorption on toc removal in source water was inferior ferrate resulted iron oxides particles could adsorb organics yang et al 2018 and the toc percentage removal increased from 3 7 to 12 7 as the dosage of ferrate increased from 20 μm to 80 μm effect of ferrate on toc removal was correlated with the chemical property of target compounds it seems that nom in natural water were not easy to be removed by the ferrate resulted particles as the dosage of ferrate and biochar increased from 20 μm 5 mg l to 80 μm 20 mg l respectively the toc percentage removal increased from 8 7 to 31 6 combination of ferrate with biochar substantially improved the removal of nom in authentic water formation potential of 20 kinds of dbps 6 kinds of haas 4 kinds of thms 5 kinds of hans 2 kinds of hks 2 kinds of hacams and chloral hydrate in chlorination of source water was determined for the chlorination of raw water up to 338 83 μg l of thms 104 71 μg l of haas 42 12 μg l of hans 57 75 μg l of hks 5 72 μg l of hacams and 53 44 μg l of chloral hydrate formed fig 5c 5d 5e and 5f up to 549 13 μg l of dbps formed in raw water fig 5b as the dosage of ferrate increased from 20 μm to 80 μm formation of the total dbps decreased from 528 56 μg l to 474 06 μg l by 3 7 13 7 fig 5b previous studies reported that ferrate pre oxidation could control the formation of dbp in the following chlorination treatment gan et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 the improved control of dbp formation in ferrate groups is in accordance with the removal of dissolved organics in relevant samples in which 3 7 12 7 of toc was removed with the increased dosage of ferrate from 20 μm to 80 μm fig 5a compared with ferrate alone ferrate biochar was more effective for controlling the formation of dbps after treatment by ferrate 20 μm biochar 5 mg l formation of the total dbps decreased to 498 48 μg l by 9 2 fig 5b as the dosage of ferrate and biochar further increased to 40 μm 10 mg l and 80 μm 20 mg l formation of the total dbps decreased to 462 1 and 417 47 μg l by 15 8 and 23 9 respectively fig 5b in these groups toc removal was 8 7 19 2 and 31 6 respectively fig 5a since the formation of dbps correlated with the content of dissolved organics the enhanced removal of toc in ferrate biochar group was correlated with the more intense effect of ferrate biochar on controlling the formation of dbps compared with that in the ferrate alone groups 3 4 reusability of the spent biochar after reaction with ferrate the spent biochar was collected to test its reusability on ferrate oxidation and toc removal interestingly the spent biochar showed more intense effect on accelerating smx oxidation compared with the raw biochar fig 6 a in ferrate biochar system 10 μm of smx was eliminated within 20 min when the spent biochar was reused the complete oxidation time shortened to 10 min in the 3rd cycle and to 5 min in the 4th cycle according to the published results fe ii could promote fe vi decomposition and produce fe v lee et al 2014 and fe iii oxides have surface reactivity to catalyze fe vi decomposition jiang et al 2015 mixed valence iron oxide including fe3o4 and fe2o3 on the spent biochar may catalyze the decomposition of ferrate with the formation of intermediate iron species detailed reaction mechanism is under investigation although the degradation rate of smx was accelerated with the addition of spent biochar toc removal was deteriorated with the increase of biochar reuse cycles fig 6b as determined in above section 4 6 of toc was removed through biochar adsorption and 41 2 of toc was removed in ferrate biochar system in the reaction with smx when the spent biochar added into smx solution 3 2 of toc was adsorbed and the toc removal ratio in ferrate biochar group decreased to 33 1 when the biochar was reused for 4 times the toc removal in biochar and ferrate biochar groups decreased to 2 5 and 21 5 respectively repeat use of biochar may lead to the accumulation of smx degradation products and iron oxides on the biochar the iron oxides would block micropores of biochar and the smx degradation products would take the active adsorption sites on biochar these factors deteriorate the toc adsorption capacity of the spent biochar 4 conclusions ferrate draws increasing interest as a green oxidant for water treatment intermediate iron species such as fe v and fe iv would form in the reduction of ferrate and other processes and these species were highly reactive for pollutants degradation shao et al 2019 wang et al 2018b in this study it was found that biochar would interact with ferrate and enhance the formation of intermediate iron species this property accelerated the oxidation of smx cbz cip dcf and deet by 3 14 times more importantly the combination of ferrate with biochar improved the removal of toc from 7 by biochar alone and 13 by ferrate alone to 35 theoretically the oxidation of organics and removal of toc do not always linearly correlate with the inhibition on the formation of dbps besides impacting microbial stability of treated water lower molecular weight organics may react with chlorine disinfectants and lead to the formation of dbps enhancing oxidation capacity of oxidants removing dissolved organics and controlling the formation potential of dbps was comprehensively considered in this study effect of ferrate biochar treatment on controlling the formation of dbps has been proved in the treatment of authentic water sample fig 5 considering that biochar was easy to be prepared through the hydrolysis of biomass and has wide application in environmental remediation the combination of biochar with ferrate provides an effective method for the elimination of emerging pollutants in polluted

17760,biochar draws increasing attention as soil amendment carbon sink slow release fertilizer and adsorbent herein it was interesting to find out that among 11 kinds of commercial biochar 3 of them facilitated ferrate oxidation of sulfamethoxazole smx with the addition of biochar oxidation rates of 5 kinds of organic pollutants including antibiotics pharmaceuticals and personal care product increased by 3 14 times and the total organic carbon toc removal ratio increased by 2 4 8 times radical scavenging experiment electron spin resonance esr analysis and probe compound sulfoxide oxidation experiment showed that no radical but intermediate iron species fe iv and fe v participated in the oxidation reactions redox active moieties phenolic hydroxyl on biochar interact with ferrate as electron shuttle and enhance the formation of intermediate iron species through electron transfer the intermediate iron species not only interacted with organic pollutants and accelerated their transformation but also corrupted oxidized the physical structure of biochar and expanded its surface area and pore volume increase of surface area and pore volume of the spent biochar in turn resulted in the improved adsorption capacity in addition to eliminating emerging organic pollutants ferrate biochar removed 8 7 31 6 of toc in authentic water and decreased the formation potential of

with industrialization the concentration of organic and inorganic pollutants in aquatic environment is increasing hong et al 2005 kanzari et al 2014 nadal et al 2007 wang et al 2012 oxidation is an effective method for the abatement of organic pollutants and controlling their toxicity bokare and choi 2014 von gunten 2018 however oxidation treatment would increase the formation of labile dissolved organics in water ramseier et al 2011 these products could readily be consumed by microbe biofilm and negatively influence the microbiological stability of drinking water hammes and egli

reactivity of fe v and fe iv species was higher by several orders of magnitude rush et al 1995 sharma 2011 high reactivity of intermediate iron species also made them unstable and easy to decompose huang et al 2018 lee et al 2014 exploring methods to enhance the formation of intermediate iron species is promising for the control of organic pollutants in aquatic environment biochar is a carbon material prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass compared with activated carbon biochar was easy to be prepared low pyrolysis temperature no further activation treatment but its capacity on pollutants adsorption was inferior on the other hand due to the low temperature pyrolysis treatment organics of biomass were not sufficiently carbonized aromatic moieties phenolic moieties quinone moieties

fe iv fe v species shao et al 2019 degradation rates of the investigated organic pollutants increased by 6 1 173 7 times compared with fe vi alone considering that biochar has redox property and may interact with ferrate through electron transfer process exploring the effect of biochar on ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants and revealing the reaction mechanism would facilitate the water

discussion 3 1 effect of biochar on ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants five kinds of emerging organic pollutants smx cbz cip dcf and deet were used to test the effect of biochar on ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants when these pollutants were adsorbed by biochar alone less than 7 of smx cbz cip dcf and deet was removed within 20 min fig 1 a as mentioned in the introduction part biochar was prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass without further chemical activation or physical activation activation is a dominant step for the development of micropore structure in activated carbon and endows its adsorption capacity hayashi et al 2000 no activation treatment makes the adsorption capacity of biochar inferior compared with biochar ferrate was effective for the removal of organic pollutants around 75 of smx 70 of cbz 97 of cip and 65 of dcf was oxidized by ferrate at ph 8 0 within 20 min respectively fig 1b in comparison deet was resistant to ferrate oxidation and less than 15 of deet was oxidized under the same conditions these results are in accordance with published data which smx cbz cip and dcf could be oxidized by ferrate jiang et al 2012 wang et al 2015 while deet was a recalcitrant pollutant aghdam et al 2017 li et al 2019a zhang et al 2019a interestingly as biochar and ferrate were co added into the polluted water removal rate and removal ratio of the 5 pollutants were improved fig 1c content of cip and dcf initial content 10 μm dropped below hplc detection limit within 5 min of reaction and content of smx and cbz dropped below the detection limit within 20 min compared with the oxidation of deet in ferrate alone group the removal percentage of deet surpassed 70 in 20 min in ferrate biochar group the determined pseudo first order reaction rate constants obtained in ferrate biochar group were 3 14 times higher than that achieved in ferrate alone group fig 1d in pilot experiment the removal of organic pollutants in ferrate biochar system at ph 7 0 was determined the reactions were fast and the cip and dcf would be removed within minutes or seconds fig s1 which made it difficult to determine the accurate reaction rate constant thus experiments were conducted at ph 8 0 the result suggested that biochar significantly improved ferrate oxidation removal of organic pollutants in aqueous solution results above showed that the target pollutants were effectively removed in the system however whether the pollutants were oxidized or adsorbed by the spent biochar was uncertain the spent biochar was collected and extracted with methanol to determine the content of adsorbed pollutants fig s2 the results showed that the content of adsorbed smx cip and dcf was below hplc detection limit while low level of cbz 0 02 μmol and deet 0 035 μmol was adsorbed in the spent biochar according to fig 1c all the added smx cbz cip dcf and over 70 of deet had been removed within 20 min in the ferrate biochar system these data suggested that chemical oxidation was the dominant process for the abatement of the target pollutants in the ferrate biochar system hazardous products may form in the oxidation of organic pollutants stadler et al 2012 yang et al 2019 and some products could be consumed by biofilm in water distribution system hammes and egli 2005 eliminating toc could improve the stability chemical and microbial and quality of the treated water for the adsorption of smx cbz cip dcf and deet with biochar the average toc removal was around 7 fig 1e in ferrate treatment group around 12 of toc on average was removed after filtration ferrate oxidation transformed organic pollutants into hydroxylated products and these products may be further adsorbed by the ferrate resulted ferric nanoparticles yang et al 2018 in ferrate biochar group over 40 of toc was removed in treatment of smx and over 30 of toc was removed in treatment of cbz cip dcf and deet deet was recalcitrant to ferrate oxidation and less than 4 of toc was removed by the ferrate resulted particles ferric floc however 30 3 of toc was removed in the treatment of deet with ferrate biochar on average over 35 of toc was removed in the treatment of these 5 organics 22 higher than that in ferrate alone group and 28 higher than that in biochar adsorption group in addition to improving ferrate oxidation of organic pollutants biochar enhanced the removal of dissolved organics in the system different kinds of biochar were commercially available besides the biochar used in above experiment labeled as 1 another 10 kinds of biochar were investigated for their effect on catalyzing ferrate oxidation of smx fig 1f in combination of ferrate with biochar 2 4 5 7 8 and 10 smx was oxidized removed below detection limit within 20 min however adsorption capacity of biochar 2 7 and 10 was higher than that of biochar 1 and over 20 of smx was adsorbed by these samples within 20 min fig s3 it was difficult to distinguish the removal of smx by the enhanced ferrate oxidation process or by the biochar dominated adsorption process in these groups in comparison adsorption capacity of biochar 4 and 5 was inferior less than 10 of smx was adsorbed similar with biochar 1 biochar 4 and 5 also have intense effect on improving ferrate oxidation of smx to simplify the investigation biochar 1 was used in the following experiments 3 2 dominant oxidant in the ferrate biochar system previous studies reported that persistent free radicals on biochar and reactive oxygen species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh and singlet oxygen 1o2 induced by biochar suspension could contribute to the degradation of organic pollutants fang et al 2015 2017 fu et al 2016 yang et al 2016 since the removal of smx cbz cip dcf and deet was substantially improved in ferrate biochar system radicals may participate in the reaction process esr analysis and radical scavenging experiment were carried out to test the possible function of radicals in ferrate biochar system methanol and tert butanol were used as quenching agents to study the function of inorganic radicals in different system in ferrate oxidation of smx methanol and tert butanol showed no intense inhibiting effect fig 2 a for the oxidation of smx with ferrate biochar methanol and tert butanol inhibited the oxidation of smx by 18 6 and 13 1 respectively fig 2b isao yamazaki and lawrence h piette reported that etoh and tert butanol could scavenge the high valence iron species yamazaki and piette 1991 shao et al 2019 explored the effect of caso3 for ferrate activation and claimed that methanol may competitively react with fe v fe iv and thus impact the oxidation of target pollutants shao et al 2019 to further exclude the possible involvement of oh in ferrate biochar oxidation process oxidation of benzoic acid was tested fig 2c benzoic acid was a stable compound and could be oxidized by oh buxton et al 1988 neta et al 1988 less than 10 of benzoic acid was removed in ferrate biochar and ferrate biochar groups indicating that oh was not the dominant oxidant in ferrate biochar system in addition to radical scavenging experiment esr analysis was carried out to identify the existence of radicals esr spectra of the samples spiked with dmpo oh scavenger and tmp singlet oxygen scavenger had not obvious peaks fig s4 this indicates that neither oh nor singlet oxygen existed in ferrate biochar system it has been reported that organic radicals such as semiquinones cyclopentadienyls and phenoxyls known as persistent free radicals may exist in biochar and activate oxidants to degraded organic pollutant fang et al 2014b 2015 however no signal of persistent free radicals was recorded in the raw biochar spent biochar and the solution of ferrate biochar in addition studies reported that the half life of persistent free radicals ranged from hours to days under atmospheric conditions the biochar used in above experiment was aged for 30 days after rinse and its effect on accelerating ferrate oxidation of smx did not vary fig s5 persistent free radicals were not the active components resulting in the activation of ferrate by biochar ferrate was unstable in water and would decay into fe v fe iv and fe iii species at ph 8 0 58 of ferrate 50 μm decayed in 20 min fig 2d with the addition of biochar 10 mg l 86 of ferrate decayed in 20 min biochar reacted with ferrate and enhanced its decomposition formation of intermediate iron species may be enhanced in the reaction process sulfoxides were used as probe compounds to distinguish different oxidant in radical oxidation and ferrate oxidation reactions through the identification of oxidation products dong et al 2020 wang et al 2018b when ferrate solely reacted with pmso 9 79 μm at ph 8 0 4 19 μm of pmso was consumed through oxygen transfer reaction with the formation of 4 19 μm of pmso2 fig 2e when 9 79 μm of pmso was oxidized by the ferrate biochar system nearly all of the pmso was oxidized in 20 min with the formation of 9 77 μm of pmso2 fig 2f reaction rate of pmso with ferrate and ferrate biochar was 0 081 min 1 and 0 445 min 1 respectively oxidation of pmso in ferrate biochar system was 5 5 times higher than that in ferrate group adsorption experiment showed that less than 3 of pmso and pmso2 was adsorbed by the raw biochar and the spent biochar fig s6 above results indicate that the oxidative intermediate iron species were largely formed in the reaction of ferrate with biochar they may account for the enhanced oxidation of organic pollutants in the system fig 1 chemical properties of biochar before and after the reaction with ferrate were analyzed with xps fig s7 after the reaction percentage of c element on raw biochar decreased from 82 46 to 78 59 accordingly the percentage of o increased from 17 54 to 20 86 and the percentage of fe increased from 0 to 0 55 table s2 the photoelectron spectrum of c 1s of biochar could be divided into 4 sub peaks attributing to graphitic structures aliphatic structures phenolic hydroxyl and carboxylic groups domínguez et al 2013 fang et al 2014a after reaction with ferrate position of these sub peaks did not shift while intensity of these peaks varied fig 3 a and b generally relative intensity of phenolic hydroxyl on biochar decreased from 20 46 to 15 46 after the reaction while the relative intensity of carboxylic groups increased by 2 and proportions of aliphatic structures and graphitic structures on biochar did not show significant change before and after the reaction fig 3c this indicated that after the reaction of ferrate with biochar the reduction functional groups like phenolic hydroxyl on biochar were oxidized into oxidation functional groups like carboxylic groups the biochar used in this study was prepared by the pyrolysis of biomass at 300 c 500 c according to the published literature biochar prepared at this temperature has high capacity to donate electrons klüpfel et al 2014 the electron rich aromatic moieties on biochar may donate electron to ferrate with the enhanced formation of highly reactive intermediate iron species fe v and fe iv in the system fig 3d microscopic morphology and element component of raw biochar and spent biochar were analyzed through sem edx analysis the raw biochar was sphere and mainly composed by c and o after the reaction with ferrate floc mixed with the biochar the content of fe element and o element increased to 3 88 and 18 32 respectively while the content of c element decreased to 68 4 fig 4 a and b variation trend of these elements detected by edx analysis was similar with that detected by xps analysis table s2 increase of o element indicates that the biochar had been oxidized by examining the spent biochar with xrd and comparing the data with standard pattern it was found that the iron oxides on spent biochar were a mixture composed by fe3o4 jcpds 79 0416 and fe2o3 jcpds 21 0920 fig s8 previous studies reported that in ferrate oxidation of hazardous species and organic pollutants fe2o3 and feooh particles formed in the reaction prucek et al 2015 yang et al 2019 above result indicates that the iron oxides formed in ferrate biochar system were different with that formed in the reduction of ferrate biochar not only enhanced the formation of intermediate iron species in the reaction with ferrate but also influenced the property of the resulted iron oxides removal of solution toc was substantially improved after ferrate biochar treatment fig 1f by analyzing the variation of micro structures of raw biochar and spent biochar with bet it was found that the surface area sbet increased from 90 to 160 m2 g after the reaction with ferrate fig 4c in this process surface area of micropores smic increased from 9 1 to 35 9 m2 g improved by 400 and external surface area sext increased from 81 to 127 m2 g improved by 57 the total pore volume vtot of biochar increased from 0 46 to 0 88 cm3 g after reaction with ferrate fig 4d the volume of micropores vmic increased from 0 033 to 0 076 cm3 g and external volume vext increased from 0 41 to 0 8 cm3 g both the surface area and the pore volume of the spent biochar were improved this increase of surface area and pore volume would facilitate the adsorption of organic components similar with the chemical activation in the preparation of activated carbon reaction of ferrate with biochar led to the increase of biochar surface area and pore volume in above paragraphs we revealed that highly oxidative intermediate iron species formed in the ferrate biochar system these reactive species oxidized phenolic hydroxyl on biochar into graphitic structures aliphatic structures and carboxylic groups this process could be regarded as a kind of chemical activation in which the physical structure of biochar was corrupted by fe vi fe v and fe iv species with the expansion of biochar surface area and pore volume expanded surface area and enlarged pore volume contributed for the improved removal of toc in the system 3 3 controlling the formation of dbps in source water treatment in conventional water treatment natural organic matters nom more ubiquitously exist than emerging micro pollutants nom would influence aesthetic property such as turbidity and the intensity of color of water competitively consume water treatment agents such as coagulants oxidants and disinfectants and react with disinfectants with the formation of dbps xu et al 2007 effect of ferrate biochar treatment on the removal of toc and formation of dbps in source water was investigated by comparison with ferrate alone the collected source water sample containing 5 81 mg c l of toc when the dosage of biochar increased from 5 mg l to 20 mg l toc removal increased from 1 3 to 3 5 fig 5 a effect of biochar adsorption on toc removal in source water was inferior ferrate resulted iron oxides particles could adsorb organics yang et al 2018 and the toc percentage removal increased from 3 7 to 12 7 as the dosage of ferrate increased from 20 μm to 80 μm effect of ferrate on toc removal was correlated with the chemical property of target compounds it seems that nom in natural water were not easy to be removed by the ferrate resulted particles as the dosage of ferrate and biochar increased from 20 μm 5 mg l to 80 μm 20 mg l respectively the toc percentage removal increased from 8 7 to 31 6 combination of ferrate with biochar substantially improved the removal of nom in authentic water formation potential of 20 kinds of dbps 6 kinds of haas 4 kinds of thms 5 kinds of hans 2 kinds of hks 2 kinds of hacams and chloral hydrate in chlorination of source water was determined for the chlorination of raw water up to 338 83 μg l of thms 104 71 μg l of haas 42 12 μg l of hans 57 75 μg l of hks 5 72 μg l of hacams and 53 44 μg l of chloral hydrate formed fig 5c 5d 5e and 5f up to 549 13 μg l of dbps formed in raw water fig 5b as the dosage of ferrate increased from 20 μm to 80 μm formation of the total dbps decreased from 528 56 μg l to 474 06 μg l by 3 7 13 7 fig 5b previous studies reported that ferrate pre oxidation could control the formation of dbp in the following chlorination treatment gan et al 2015 jiang et al 2016 the improved control of dbp formation in ferrate groups is in accordance with the removal of dissolved organics in relevant samples in which 3 7 12 7 of toc was removed with the increased dosage of ferrate from 20 μm to 80 μm fig 5a compared with ferrate alone ferrate biochar was more effective for controlling the formation of dbps after treatment by ferrate 20 μm biochar 5 mg l formation of the total dbps decreased to 498 48 μg l by 9 2 fig 5b as the dosage of ferrate and biochar further increased to 40 μm 10 mg l and 80 μm 20 mg l formation of the total dbps decreased to 462 1 and 417 47 μg l by 15 8 and 23 9 respectively fig 5b in these groups toc removal was 8 7 19 2 and 31 6 respectively fig 5a since the formation of dbps correlated with the content of dissolved organics the enhanced removal of toc in ferrate biochar group was correlated with the more intense effect of ferrate biochar on controlling the formation of dbps compared with that in the ferrate alone groups 3 4 reusability of the spent biochar after reaction with ferrate the spent biochar was collected to test its reusability on ferrate oxidation and toc removal interestingly the spent biochar showed more intense effect on accelerating smx oxidation compared with the raw biochar fig 6 a in ferrate biochar system 10 μm of smx was eliminated within 20 min when the spent biochar was reused the complete oxidation time shortened to 10 min in the 3rd cycle and to 5 min in the 4th cycle according to the published results fe ii could promote fe vi decomposition and produce fe v lee et al 2014 and fe iii oxides have surface reactivity to catalyze fe vi decomposition jiang et al 2015 mixed valence iron oxide including fe3o4 and fe2o3 on the spent biochar may catalyze the decomposition of ferrate with the formation of intermediate iron species detailed reaction mechanism is under investigation although the degradation rate of smx was accelerated with the addition of spent biochar toc removal was deteriorated with the increase of biochar reuse cycles fig 6b as determined in above section 4 6 of toc was removed through biochar adsorption and 41 2 of toc was removed in ferrate biochar system in the reaction with smx when the spent biochar added into smx solution 3 2 of toc was adsorbed and the toc removal ratio in ferrate biochar group decreased to 33 1 when the biochar was reused for 4 times the toc removal in biochar and ferrate biochar groups decreased to 2 5 and 21 5 respectively repeat use of biochar may lead to the accumulation of smx degradation products and iron oxides on the biochar the iron oxides would block micropores of biochar and the smx degradation products would take the active adsorption sites on biochar these factors deteriorate the toc adsorption capacity of the spent biochar 4 conclusions ferrate draws increasing interest as a green oxidant for water treatment intermediate iron species such as fe v and fe iv would form in the reduction of ferrate and other processes and these species were highly reactive for pollutants degradation shao et al 2019 wang et al 2018b in this study it was found that biochar would interact with ferrate and enhance the formation of intermediate iron species this property accelerated the oxidation of smx cbz cip dcf and deet by 3 14 times more importantly the combination of ferrate with biochar improved the removal of toc from 7 by biochar alone and 13 by ferrate alone to 35 theoretically the oxidation of organics and removal of toc do

17761,wildfires can have severe and lasting impacts on the water quality of aquatic ecosystems however our understanding of these impacts is founded primarily from studies of small watersheds with well connected runoff regimes despite the predominance of large low relief rivers across the fire prone boreal forest it is unclear to what extent and duration wildfire related material e g ash can be observed within these systems that typically buffer upstream disturbance signals following the devastating 2016 fort mcmurray wildfire in western canada we initiated a multi faceted water quality monitoring program that suggested brief hours to days wildfire signatures could be detected in several large river systems particularly following rainfall events greater than 10 mm continuous monitoring of flow and water quality showed distinct precipitation associated signatures of ash transport in rivers draining expansive 800 100 000 km2 and partially burned 1 22 percent burned watersheds which were not evident in nearby unburned regions yields of suspended sediment nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and metals lead others from impacted rivers were 1 2 10 times greater than from those draining unburned regions post fire suspended sediment concentrations in impacted rivers were often larger than pre fire 95 prediction intervals based on several years of water sampling these multiple lines of evidence indicate that low relief landscapes can mobilize wildfire related material to rivers similarly though less intensively and over shorter durations than headwater regions we propose that uneven mixing of heavily impacted tributaries with high order rivers may partially explain detection of wildfire signals in these large systems that may impact downstream water users

on water quality in rivers draining diverse watershed sizes especially very large ones are scant watershed hydrologic connectivity also influences river response to landscape disturbance bracken and croke 2007 for instance steeper topographic settings and well drained soils can promote rapid hydro geochemical connections between disturbed landscapes and rivers and contribute to sustaining

watershed buffering capacity ebel and mirus 2014 prepas et al 2003 these attributes are characteristic of many areas across the circumpolar boreal forest where low topographic relief heterogeneous

boreal landscapes e g depante et al 2018 olefeldt et al 2013 prepas et al 2003 wilkinson et al 2018 wildfire impacts on water quality at large basin scales in these regions have not been previously reported this is a critical knowledge gap considering the high future probability of more severe fires occurring across the circumpolar boreal forest the primary objective of this study is to assess the impacts of the may 2016 fort mcmurray horse river wildfire in northeastern alberta canada on the water quality of large 1 000 km2 drainage areas and low relief 5 drainage area slope rivers in the region using a multi tiered monitoring approach to target signal detection in these large rivers we first compared suspended sediment dissolved material ion nutrient and metal concentrations and yields in rivers draining burned areas with an unburned control station second at each station we assessed if precipitation events and subsequent river flow mobilized more wildfire related material relative to non precipitation periods finally we evaluated suspended sediment dissolved material and flow relationships in rivers draining burned landscapes with pre fire data from the same river we hypothesized that rivers draining burned watersheds would be resistant to unbuffered overland flow and therefore show no detectable differences in water quality relative to rivers draining unburned landscapes or extensive historical data 2 methods 2 1 study region our study region is contained within the boreal plains ecozone which is characterized by flat and rolling landscapes with thick

a high severity see supplementary material for methodology 2 2 monitoring and historic data post fire river water quality monitoring in this study focused on three rivers the athabasca clearwater and hangingstone three burned impacted stations were established 1 on the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray left bank 2 the clearwater river near the mouth and 3 the hangingstone river at fort mcmurray fig 1 these locations drain a gradient of watershed size hangingstone clearwater athabasca and reflected a contrasting gradient of relative burned area and area burned at a high severity in their watersheds athabasca clearwater hangingstone table 1 an unburned control station was also initiated on the athabasca river at grand rapids upstream of the wildfire perimeter each of these four water quality stations incorporated multiple measurement approaches and where possible were co located near meteorological and flow stations to better understand hydrological influences on post fire water quality 2 2 1 water quality measurements a multiple method approach for sampling river chemistry of each of the four water quality stations was implemented after the fire to assess differences between unburned and burned locations fig 1 table s1 nearly two weeks after the fire began we deployed multi probe data sondes hydrolab ds5x ott hydromet usa just offshore at the two athabasca stations burned and unburned and near mid channel at the smaller clearwater and hangingstone stations two additional sondes were deployed downstream of fort mcmurray just offshore of each bank of the athabasca river to assess river mixing conditions fig 1 each calibrated sonde recorded general water quality including water temperature ph specific conductivity turbidity and dissolved oxygen at 15 min intervals sondes were retrieved and replaced with calibrated instruments every week to limit impacts from fouling and sensor drift all sonde monitoring concluded in mid october 2016 in addition to the sondes we collected daily water quality samples at the four main stations fig 1 table s1 surface water autosamplers teldyne isco usa were deployed on the river bank at each station burned may august 2016 control june august 2016 with water intakes placed mid column just offshore at the two athabasca locations and mid channel in the clearwater and hangingstone rivers each autosampler collected equal aliquots of river water every 3 h into 1 l propak plastic bags in holders for a time integrated sample each day weekly grab samples of surface waters were manually collected at each station from may to august 2016 to supplement automated sampling after wading waist deep at each location water samples were collected at 30 cm depth directly into pre cleaned or new plastic or glass bottles depending on chemical methods at the three burned stations athabasca fort mcmurray clearwater mouth hangingstone fort mcmurray grab sampling continued monthly through 2016 2017 and 2018 via other programs all water samples were analyzed at accredited laboratories for suspended sediment total ion na k mg ca cl total nutrient total organic carbon total kjeldahl nitrogen total phosphorus and total metal 29 metal scan concentrations only total measurements were considered for autosampler water samples to limit sample chemical transformation concerns during storage 2 2 2 precipitation and river flow measurements to identify periods when wildfire related material may be mobilized in burned watersheds we delineated notable local precipitation events and subsequent river flow response periods at each water quality station total daily precipitation data from meteorological stations nearest to sampling locations fig 1 table s1 were used to identify noteworthy rainfalls equalling or exceeding 10 mm 94th percentile of daily rain events at fort mcmurray a 1999 2015 precipitation events at each station see supplementary material are defined in time here as the day of the noteworthy rainfall plus five subsequent days to encompass flow and biogeochemical responses of each river days not within a precipitation event period are defined as non event periods hourly and daily flow data before and after the wildfire were retrieved from hydrometric stations close to water quality locations where possible figs 1 and 2 table s1 discharge at the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray left bank station was calculated by difference in measured daily flows between the nearby athabasca river downstream of fort mcmurray and clearwater river at draper stations flow at athabasca river at grand rapids was calculated using daily runoff yields from the upstream athabasca river at athabasca hydrometric station scaled to the drainage area at the grand rapids location table 1 fig 1 2 2 3 historic water quality data historic water quality data from long term provincial and oil sands monitoring programs 2001 2016 were used to quantify pre and post fire water quality conditions at the three impacted stations table s1 monthly surface water sampling has been ongoing in the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray for many decades while the clearwater and hangingstone rivers have been monitored for several years monthly grab sampling also occurred in 2015 pre fire and 2016 post fire at burned high hills christina clearwater hangingstone and unburned calumet mackay ells firebag river stations via regional monitoring networks table s1 fig s1a water collection and analytical methods from historical programs were consistent with those used during the post fire sampling program 2 3 quantitative analyses 2 3 1 water quality assessment river turbidity and conductivity are typically negatively correlated during high water events due to flow related sediment concentration and ion dilution schlesinger 2007 however after wildfires ash laden runoff pulses during storms can trigger concurrent increases in turbidity and conductivity in receiving waters dahm et al 2015 earl and blinn 2003 to identify existence of concentration dilution and concentration concentration periods in each river mean hourly sonde and flow data were included in an unconstrained principal components analysis pca canoco v 5 03 biometris the netherlands six hour covariances using a 60 min moving window of turbidity and conductivity were quantified at each station including sonde only locations to directly compare the magnitude and frequency of suspected ash mobilization periods i e positive covariances between stations we also performed a laboratory ash mixing experiment to demonstrate how ash affected turbidity and conductivity measurements in an aqueous solution we collected loose grey and black ash from the soil surface of burned forested plot 0 25 m2 in the clearwater river watershed n56 6849 w 111 2560 on may 13 16 prior to post fire rainfall events later in the laboratory we incrementally added 500 mg of ash to 10 l of deionized water and continuously stirred the solution while turbidity conductivity and ph were measured using a calibrated sonde descriptive statistics were calculated to quantify differences in yields of selected particle bound and dissolved chemicals between impacted and control river stations on the athabasca river to link assessments of selected chemicals at each station to other measured parameters we correlated all parameter concentrations with concurrent measurements of flow turbidity conductivity and ph to organize parameters as particle bound type positive correlation with flow and turbidity or dissolved type positive correlation with conductivity and ph 2 3 2 precipitation and flow assessment all water quality data i e sonde and samples at each station were binned into precipitation event 10 mm and non event 10 mm periods for comparisons this approach was used on sonde turbidity conductivity covariance data and concentrations and yields of sampled chemicals assessment of hydrologic responses of impacted rivers before and after the fire is described in the supplementary material 2 3 3 historic water quality assessment post fire changes in particle bound and dissolved river water chemistry relative to historic records were evaluated in the three rivers draining burned watersheds table s1 using concentration discharge c q relationships monthly pre fire water quality data suspended sediments as a proxy of particle bound chemicals total calcium as a proxy for specific conductivity dissolved chemicals see table s2 from each river station were log transformed and linearly regressed with log transformed pre fire daily discharge data subsequently 95 prediction intervals were calculated sigmaplot v13 systat usa to serve as a boundary of what c q relationships would be expected in the river based on historic conditions when post fire c q relationships 2016 18 were compared with historic relationships data points that were outside of the bounds of the prediction intervals were considered noteworthy other monthly grab sample and flow data from four unburned and four burned river stations were used in a repeated measures anova spss v 25 ibm usa to assess lower resolution pre fire 2015 and post fire 2016 impacts on water quality 3 results 3 1 sonde water quality high frequency water quality monitoring by sondes at the four main stations typically showed flow concentration for turbidity and flow dilution for conductivity fig 3 and ph as well as contrasting seasonal changes for water temperature and dissolved oxygen these trends were evident in pc1 and pc2 scores of the pca table s3 however sharp peaks in turbidity and conductivity together occurred during short periods hours to days often along the rising limb of the hydrograph at burned stations only the third principal component at each burned station reflected this covariation between turbidity and conductivity in the absence of association with flow at the athabasca river control station pc3 scores also showed periods of concurrent increases in turbidity and conductivity but were positively associated with flow perhaps suggesting an influence of saline groundwater gibson et al 2016 mean 6 h covariance scores of turbidity and conductivity more distinctly showed differences between stations than did the pca covariances from burned stations were 3 25 times higher than the control station though means were influenced by the highest values fig 4 highest covariances at impacted stations typically occurred during precipitation events mean 14 113 and were 2 22 times higher than non event periods these observations were consistent with results of the ash mixing experiment that demonstrated concurrent increases in turbidity specific conductivity and ph as ash was added to deionized water fig s2 further though pre fire grab sampling in impacted rivers showed consistent negative associations between turbidity concentrations and specific conductivity 11 38 of post fire precipitation event turbidity and conductivity samples were greater than the upper historic 95 prediction interval suggesting a more positive association between the parameters during those periods fig s3 within the burned reach of the athabasca river turbidity and conductivity covariances on the left bank decreased from a mean of 7 7 maximum 1 071 upstream to a mean of 7 0 maximum 574 downstream however the downstream right bank station observed much higher covariance values mean 17 2 maximum 3 782 than either station on the left bank which together suggests an unmixed chemical profile longitudinally and laterally in the river fig 4 3 2 sample water quality daily automated and grab sample water quality results indicated only slight differences between burned and control stations when aggregated to the entire sampling season fig 5 for example seasonal mean daily sediment yields june 22 august 30 16 from the directly comparable stations of the athabasca river at grand rapids unburned gr and the

with the suspended sediment results post wildfire and likely other correlates table s2 similarly monthly suspended sediment yields across a subset of several rivers draining burned and unburned watersheds in the region before and after the fire indicated no fire effect fig s1b total calcium used as a proxy measure for dissolved material table s2 also showed similar yields between the impacted 0 23 0 01 kg ha 1 d 1 and the control station 0 21 0 01 kg ha 1 d 1 on the athabasca river fig 5 differences in monthly calcium yields between a subset of rivers draining burned and unburned watersheds were also statistically similar fig s1b alternatively total organic carbon toc most of which is in the dissolved form in the athabasca river glozier et al 2018 had mean yields greater at the control 91 5 g ha 1 d 1 relative to the impacted 67 3 g ha 1 d 1 station substantial differences occurred within and between stations when classifying data by precipitation event and non event periods at impacted stations only peaks of concentrations fig 6 and yields during precipitation events were observed relative to non event periods for suspended sediment concentrations 1 7 6 6 times

parameters rarely exceeded national surface water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life government of canada 2019 or the relative number of exceedances were comparable to pre fire conditions or those at control stations table s4 3 3 historic water quality elevated suspended sediment concentrations observed at burned stations did not result from higher flows than sampled historically nor wholesale changes in the hydrological conditions of impacted river systems see supplementary material figs s4 s6 specifically the prediction intervals calculated using historic c q relationships for suspended sediment from the burned athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray station were exceeded on four occasions after the wildfire fig 7 two of these exceedances occurred on june 09 and july 31 16 when the two largest recorded rainfalls in the fort mcmurray region occurred during that summer sampling during subsequent years showed no similar notable concentrations five exceedances of the upper historic prediction interval occurred in the clearwater river during precipitation events in 2016 but none during the following years the hangingstone river experienced 17 exceedances relative to its historic concentration discharge relationship however these exceedances occurred during precipitation event and non event periods in 2016 as well as across multiple years after the fire including during spring runoff in 2017 these c q results were likely similar to other particle bound measures table s2 compared to suspended sediment concentrations only four exceedances of the upper historic prediction interval for total calcium concentration were observed across all rivers and likely similar for other dissolved type chemicals table s2 collectively suspended sediment concentration exceedances of historic 95 prediction intervals in impacted rivers became more frequent as watershed size decreased and the proportion of burned area and area burned at high severity across watersheds increased table 1 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 episodic detections of fire related material in large river systems despite a naturally turbid and organic rich water qualities prior to disturbance figs 3 5 and 6 glozier et al 2018 b the potential for considerable dilution including from substantial subsurface contributions to regional river flow gibson et al 2016 and c poor hydrologic connectivity between the landscapes and low relief rivers chanasyk et al 2003 devito et al 2017 gibson et al 2016 ireson et al 2015 wildfire impacts on river water quality were detectable at the very large basin scale following the 2016 fort mcmurray wildfire three independent monitoring approaches reported brief precipitation related increases in wildfire related material i e suspended and dissolved material nutrients metals burton et al 2016 earl and blinn 2003 reale et al 2015 in rivers draining burned watersheds relative to a control station or historic pre fire data figs 3 4 6 7 these findings were also supported by an ash mixing experiment fig s2 and other historic data together this weight of evidence suggests rainfall induced surface erosion delivered ash and soil from local burned hillslopes into large rivers that briefly impacted water quality without shifting overall metrics of river water quality relative to unburned regions fig 5 the role of precipitation events in mobilizing particle bound chemicals across burned landscapes is well established in the literature e g bladon et al 2014 burton et al 2016 langhans et al 2016 townsend and douglas 2000 and in more extensively burned regions of the boreal plains burke et al 2005 however detection of suspended chemicals in large wetland dominated low slope river watersheds with low proportions of areas burned table 1 was a key outcome of this study alternatively total measurements mostly in dissolved form e g total calcium total organic carbon others table s2 showed inconsistent changes between impacted and control stations as well as between precipitation and non event periods perhaps reflecting uneven burning of peat at depth where non erosive flows dominate devito et al 2012 wilkinson et al 2018 4 2 factors shaping wildfire signal detection in large river systems following wildfire loss of ground cover decreased surface roughness and soil crusting and sealing larsen et al 2009 can impede infiltration and expose soils to splash and fluvial erosion shakesby and doerr 2006 these processes often allow storms to mobilize loads of sediment nutrients and contaminants downstream bayley et al 1992 betts and jones 2009 moody and martin 2001 neary et al 2005 however the magnitude and duration of these water quality impacts are shaped by the intensity of precipitation events and the erosive potential of impacted landscapes langhans et al 2016 headwater systems with typically small extensively burned steep and flashy landscapes often show substantial sediment yields from burned watersheds relative to those unburned typically 100x smith et al 2011 with water quality impacts often detected for months to years e g inbar et al 1998 owens et al 2013 in this study of lower relief and wetland dominated landscapes catchments are large burn less extensively and runoff storage is prevalent table 1 devito et al 2012 these conditions resulted in suspended sediment yield ratios impacted control 1 3x with detectable water quality impacts at only hourly and daily scales figs 3 4 6 however fire related impacts on water quality in this study table 1 fig 6 as well as those in headwater regions rhoades et al 2011 demonstrate that differing basin sizes proportions of area burned and area burned at high severity can impact water quality of river systems differently this suggests that mobilization of fire related materials downstream is likely driven by similar processes across differing landscapes but are shaped by catchment and fire related characteristics however we postulate that incomplete hydro chemical mixing may also play an important role in wildfire signal detection in these large rivers expected to buffer landscape chemical signals blöchl et al 2007 large rivers can substantially modify upstream and locally derived terrestrial material via mixing dilution and sedimentation processes temnerud and bishop 2005 however we suggest that the complexities of mixing river waters of different qualities and quantities may have also been responsible for the detection and downstream persistence of wildfire chemical signals observed in these large rivers particularly in the athabasca river other studies have reported a persistence of plumes mixing zones downstream of river confluences because of differences in water densities particle loads or the physico chemical composition of sediments bouchez et al 2010 herrero et al 2018 stone et al 2011 measurements assessing cross sectional changes in water quality of the athabasca river suggest incomplete mixing occurs well downstream of anthropogenic or tributary inputs glozier et al 2018 following the wildfire and precipitation events we observed that both low and high order tributaries draining severely burned watersheds delivered plumes of ash to the athabasca river that were visible for several kilometers downstream of confluences fig 8 empirical evidence from the three athabasca river sondes supported these visual observations for example we observed strong differences in turbidity conductivity and turbidity conductivity covariance values measured on the left and right banks of the athabasca river at the same longitudinal location fig 4 higher turbidity values on the right bank were coincident with turbidity and conductivity spikes in the smaller but more extensively burned clearwater and hangingstone rivers that empty upstream from the right bank the entry of these rivers established a distinct fire impacted plume on the right bank of the athabasca river through to where sonde measurements occurred though it was unclear where the right bank plume mixed fully with the athabasca river downstream we did observe likely mixing and dilution of fire influenced plumes on the left bank of the athabasca near the upstream of fort mcmurray station several severely burned low order streams entered the athabasca river on the left bank and passed though the sonde just downstream resulting in defined precipitation related turbidity and conductivity spikes up to 1000 ntu and 350 μs cm 1 respectively figs 3 and 8 downstream of fort mcmurray on the same bank another sonde measured turbidity and conductivity spikes often 10 60 as large with lower turbidity conductivity covariances fig 4 compared to the upstream location and similar to the unimpacted grand rapids station these results suggest efficient mixing of the small fire impacted plumes on the left bank with larger volumes of unimpacted athabasca river water over just a few kilometers of this reach regardless this uneven mixing of waters from impacted tributaries with the large athabasca river may simultaneously explain observed downstream persistence of wildfire signals but also overall signal attenuation due to dilution i e relative to headwater regions both of which were defining observations of this study 4 3 human related impacts of wildfires in large river systems the occurrence of and damage from wildland urban interface fires has increased over the previous decade in western north america schoennagel et al 2017 westerling et al 2006 as such an event the fort mcmurray wildfire burned regions both within and surrounding the remote urban center of fort mcmurray alberta however this wildfire presented a unique situation where very large low relief watersheds were expected to buffer wildfire impacts on local surface water resources interestingly though we observed relatively muted water quality changes in these very large rivers compared to headwater regions these arguably inconsequential basin scale effects still resulted in impacts to post fire drinking water treatment costs borne by the local municipality similar to headwater regions bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2019 thurton 2017 preliminary analyses unpublished suggest unmixed plumes in the athabasca river from heavily impacted low order tributaries discharging upstream of the drinking water treatment plant intake on the river may have been responsible thus exclusive focus on the magnitude and persistence of the impacts of wildfire on surface water quality may fail to uncover its true stresses on surface water resources this consideration may be particularly applicable to future wildland urban interface fires as export of complex chemicals e g plastics from residential commercial and industrial settings may present unique water quality conditions in receiving waterbodies of human importance oliver et al 2012 5 conclusions this study presents a multi tiered approach to monitoring the flow and water quality of large rivers in a low relief region affected by an expansive and severe wildfire while broader wildfire impacts to water quality of regional rivers were markedly lower than commonly reported in smaller watersheds of greater relief water quality impacts were nonetheless observed across a range of very large river basin scales novel use of continuous flow and general chemical monitoring was key to identifying impacted periods in the rivers studied herein similar to few other investigations cooke et al 2016 dahm et al 2015 mast et al 2016 in particular our study emphasizes the importance of considering the spatial frame of reference entire basin vs local when evaluating wildfire impacts on water quality in large river basins the proximity and scale of this and other recent wildfires to major urban municipalities further highlights the importance of shifting north american wildfire regimes as increasing threats to community

17761,wildfires can have severe and lasting impacts on the water quality of aquatic ecosystems however our understanding of these impacts is founded primarily from studies of small watersheds with

observed within these systems that typically buffer upstream disturbance signals following the devastating 2016 fort mcmurray wildfire in western canada we initiated a multi faceted water quality monitoring program that suggested brief hours to days wildfire signatures could be detected in several large river systems particularly following rainfall events greater than 10 mm continuous monitoring of flow and water quality showed distinct precipitation associated signatures of ash transport in rivers draining expansive 800 100 000 km2 and partially burned 1 22 percent burned watersheds which were not evident in nearby unburned regions yields of suspended sediment nutrients nitrogen phosphorus and metals lead others from impacted rivers were 1 2 10 times greater than from those draining unburned regions post fire suspended sediment concentrations in impacted rivers were often larger than pre fire 95 prediction intervals based on several years of water sampling these multiple lines of evidence indicate that low relief landscapes can mobilize wildfire related material to rivers similarly though less intensively and over shorter durations than headwater regions we propose that uneven mixing of heavily impacted tributaries with high order rivers may partially explain detection of wildfire signals in these large systems that may impact downstream water users

the impacts of the may 2016 fort mcmurray horse river wildfire in northeastern alberta canada on the water quality of large 1 000 km2 drainage areas and low relief 5 drainage area slope rivers in the region using a multi tiered monitoring approach to target signal detection in these large rivers we first compared suspended sediment dissolved material ion nutrient and metal concentrations and yields in rivers draining burned areas with an unburned control station second at each station we assessed if precipitation events and subsequent river flow mobilized more wildfire related material relative to non precipitation periods finally we evaluated suspended sediment dissolved material and flow relationships in rivers draining burned landscapes with pre fire data from the same river we hypothesized that rivers draining burned watersheds would be resistant to unbuffered overland flow and therefore show no detectable differences in water quality relative to rivers draining unburned landscapes or extensive historical data 2 methods 2 1 study region our study region is contained within the boreal plains ecozone which is characterized by flat and rolling landscapes with thick

a high severity see supplementary material for methodology 2 2 monitoring and historic data post fire river water quality monitoring in this study focused on three rivers the athabasca clearwater and hangingstone three burned impacted stations were established 1 on the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray left bank 2 the clearwater river near the mouth and 3 the hangingstone river at fort mcmurray fig 1 these locations drain a gradient of watershed size hangingstone clearwater athabasca and reflected a contrasting gradient of relative burned area and area burned at a high severity in their watersheds athabasca clearwater hangingstone table 1 an unburned control station was also initiated on the athabasca river at grand rapids upstream of the wildfire perimeter each of these four water quality stations incorporated multiple measurement approaches and where possible were co located near meteorological and flow stations to better understand hydrological influences on post fire water quality 2 2 1 water quality measurements a multiple method approach for sampling river chemistry of each of the four water quality stations was implemented after the fire to assess differences between unburned and burned locations fig 1 table s1 nearly two weeks after the fire began we deployed multi probe data sondes hydrolab ds5x ott hydromet usa just offshore at the two athabasca stations burned and unburned and near mid channel at the smaller clearwater and hangingstone stations two additional sondes were deployed downstream of fort mcmurray just offshore of each bank of the athabasca river to assess river mixing conditions fig 1 each calibrated sonde recorded general water quality including water temperature ph specific conductivity turbidity and dissolved oxygen at 15 min intervals sondes were retrieved and replaced with calibrated instruments every week to limit impacts from fouling and sensor drift all sonde monitoring concluded in mid october 2016 in addition to the sondes we collected daily water quality samples at the four main stations fig 1 table s1 surface water autosamplers teldyne isco usa were deployed on the river bank at each station burned may

station from may to august 2016 to supplement automated sampling after wading waist deep at each location water samples were collected at 30 cm depth directly into pre cleaned or new plastic or glass bottles depending on chemical methods at the three burned stations athabasca fort mcmurray clearwater mouth hangingstone fort mcmurray grab sampling continued monthly through 2016 2017 and 2018 via

and river flow measurements to identify periods when wildfire related material may be mobilized in burned watersheds we delineated notable local precipitation events and subsequent river flow response periods at each water quality station total daily precipitation data from meteorological stations nearest to sampling locations fig 1 table s1 were used to identify noteworthy rainfalls equalling or exceeding 10 mm 94th percentile of daily rain events at fort mcmurray a 1999 2015 precipitation events at each station see supplementary material are defined in time here as the day of the noteworthy rainfall plus five subsequent days to encompass flow and biogeochemical responses of each river days not within a precipitation event period are defined as non event periods hourly and daily flow data before and after the wildfire were retrieved from hydrometric stations close to water quality locations where possible figs 1 and 2 table s1 discharge at the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray left bank station was calculated by difference in measured daily flows between the nearby athabasca river downstream of fort mcmurray and clearwater river at draper stations flow at athabasca river at grand rapids was calculated using daily runoff yields from the upstream athabasca river at athabasca hydrometric station scaled to the drainage area at the grand rapids location table 1 fig 1 2 2 3 historic water quality data historic water quality data from long term provincial and oil sands monitoring programs 2001 2016 were used to quantify pre and post fire water quality conditions at the three impacted stations table s1 monthly surface water sampling has been ongoing in the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray for many decades while the clearwater and hangingstone rivers have been monitored for several years monthly grab sampling also occurred in 2015 pre fire and 2016 post fire at burned high hills christina clearwater hangingstone and unburned calumet mackay ells firebag river stations via regional monitoring networks table s1 fig s1a water collection and analytical methods from historical programs were consistent with those used during the post fire sampling program 2 3 quantitative analyses 2 3 1 water quality assessment river turbidity and conductivity are typically negatively correlated during high water events due to flow related sediment concentration and ion dilution schlesinger 2007 however after wildfires ash laden runoff pulses during storms can trigger concurrent increases in turbidity and conductivity in receiving waters dahm et al 2015 earl and blinn 2003 to identify existence of concentration dilution and concentration concentration periods in each river mean hourly sonde and flow data were included in an unconstrained principal components analysis pca canoco v 5 03 biometris the netherlands six hour covariances using a 60 min moving window of turbidity and conductivity were quantified at each station including sonde only locations to directly compare the magnitude and frequency of suspected ash mobilization periods i e positive covariances between stations we also performed a laboratory ash mixing experiment to demonstrate how ash affected turbidity and conductivity measurements in an aqueous solution we collected loose grey and black ash from the soil surface of burned forested plot 0 25 m2 in the clearwater river watershed n56 6849 w 111 2560 on may 13 16 prior to post fire rainfall events later in the laboratory we incrementally added 500 mg of ash to 10 l of deionized water and continuously stirred the solution while turbidity conductivity and ph were measured using a calibrated sonde descriptive statistics were calculated to quantify differences in yields of selected particle bound and dissolved chemicals between impacted and control river stations on the athabasca river to link assessments of selected chemicals at each station to other measured parameters we correlated all parameter concentrations with concurrent measurements of flow turbidity conductivity and ph to organize parameters as particle bound type positive correlation with flow and turbidity or dissolved type positive correlation with conductivity and ph 2 3 2 precipitation and flow assessment all water quality data i e sonde and samples at each station were binned into precipitation event 10 mm and non event 10 mm periods for comparisons this approach was used on sonde turbidity conductivity covariance data and concentrations and yields of sampled chemicals assessment of hydrologic responses of impacted rivers before and after the fire is described in the supplementary material 2 3 3 historic water quality assessment post fire changes in particle bound and dissolved river water chemistry relative to historic records were evaluated in the three rivers draining burned watersheds table s1 using concentration discharge c q relationships monthly pre fire water quality data suspended sediments as a proxy of particle bound chemicals total calcium as a proxy for specific conductivity dissolved chemicals see table s2 from each river station were log transformed and linearly regressed with log transformed pre fire

conditions when post fire c q relationships 2016 18 were compared with historic relationships data points that were outside of the bounds of the prediction intervals were considered noteworthy other monthly grab sample and flow data from four unburned and four burned river stations were used in a repeated measures anova spss v 25 ibm usa to assess lower resolution pre fire 2015 and post fire 2016 impacts on water quality 3 results 3 1 sonde water quality high frequency water quality monitoring by sondes at the four main stations typically showed flow concentration for turbidity and flow dilution for conductivity fig 3 and ph as well as contrasting seasonal changes for water temperature and dissolved oxygen these trends were evident in pc1 and pc2 scores of the pca table s3 however sharp peaks in turbidity and conductivity together occurred during short periods hours to days often along the rising limb of the hydrograph at burned stations only the third principal component at each burned station reflected this covariation between turbidity and conductivity in the absence of association with flow at the athabasca river control station pc3 scores also showed periods of concurrent increases in turbidity and conductivity but were positively associated with flow perhaps suggesting an influence of saline groundwater gibson et al 2016 mean 6 h covariance scores of turbidity and conductivity more distinctly showed differences between stations than did the pca covariances from burned stations were 3 25 times higher than the control station though means were influenced by the highest values fig 4 highest covariances at impacted stations typically occurred during precipitation events mean 14 113 and were 2 22 times higher than non event periods these observations were consistent with results of the ash mixing experiment that demonstrated concurrent increases in turbidity specific conductivity and ph as ash was added to deionized water fig s2 further though pre fire grab sampling in impacted rivers showed consistent negative associations between turbidity concentrations and specific conductivity 11 38 of post fire precipitation event turbidity and conductivity samples were greater than the upper historic 95 prediction interval suggesting a more positive association between the parameters during those periods fig s3 within the burned reach of the athabasca river turbidity and conductivity covariances on the left bank decreased from a mean of 7 7 maximum 1 071 upstream to a mean of 7 0 maximum 574 downstream however the downstream right bank station observed much higher covariance values mean 17 2 maximum 3 782 than either station on the left bank which together suggests an unmixed chemical profile longitudinally and laterally in the river fig 4 3 2 sample water quality daily automated and grab sample water quality results indicated only slight differences between burned and control stations when aggregated to the entire sampling season fig 5 for example seasonal mean daily sediment yields june 22 august 30 16 from the directly comparable stations of the athabasca river at grand rapids unburned gr and the

with the suspended sediment results post wildfire and likely other correlates table s2 similarly monthly suspended sediment yields across a subset of several rivers draining burned and unburned watersheds in the region before and after the fire indicated no fire effect fig s1b total calcium used as a proxy measure for dissolved material table s2 also showed similar yields between the impacted 0 23 0 01 kg ha 1 d 1 and the control station 0 21 0 01 kg ha 1 d 1 on the athabasca river fig 5 differences in monthly calcium yields between a subset of rivers draining burned and unburned watersheds were also statistically similar fig s1b alternatively total organic carbon toc most of which is in the dissolved form in the athabasca river glozier et al 2018 had mean yields greater at the control 91 5 g ha 1 d 1 relative to the impacted 67 3 g ha 1 d 1 station substantial differences occurred within and between stations when classifying data by precipitation event and non event

parameters rarely exceeded national surface water quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life government of canada 2019 or the relative number of exceedances were comparable to pre fire conditions or those at control stations table s4 3 3 historic water quality elevated suspended sediment concentrations observed at burned stations did not result from higher flows than sampled historically nor wholesale changes in the hydrological conditions of impacted river systems see supplementary material figs s4 s6 specifically the prediction intervals calculated using historic c q relationships for suspended sediment from the burned athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray station were exceeded on four occasions after the wildfire fig 7 two of these exceedances occurred on june 09 and july 31 16 when the two largest recorded rainfalls in the fort mcmurray region occurred during that summer sampling during subsequent years showed no similar notable concentrations five exceedances of the upper historic prediction interval occurred in the clearwater river during precipitation events in 2016 but none during the following years the hangingstone river experienced 17 exceedances relative to its historic concentration discharge relationship however these exceedances occurred during precipitation event and non event periods in 2016 as well as across multiple years after the fire including during spring runoff in 2017 these c q results were likely similar to other particle bound measures table s2 compared to suspended sediment concentrations only four exceedances of the upper historic prediction interval for total calcium concentration were observed across all rivers and likely similar for other dissolved type chemicals table s2 collectively suspended sediment concentration exceedances of historic 95 prediction intervals in impacted rivers became more frequent as watershed size decreased and the proportion of burned area and area burned at high severity across watersheds increased table 1 fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 episodic detections of fire related material in large river systems despite a naturally turbid and organic rich water

and c poor hydrologic connectivity between the landscapes and low relief rivers chanasyk et al 2003 devito et al 2017 gibson et al 2016 ireson et al 2015 wildfire impacts on river water quality were detectable at the very large basin scale following the 2016 fort mcmurray wildfire three independent monitoring approaches reported brief precipitation related increases in wildfire related material i e suspended and dissolved material nutrients metals burton et al 2016 earl and blinn 2003 reale et al 2015 in rivers draining burned watersheds relative to a control station or historic pre fire data figs 3 4 6 7 these findings were also supported by an ash mixing experiment fig s2 and other historic data together this weight of evidence suggests rainfall induced surface erosion delivered ash and soil from local burned hillslopes into large rivers that briefly impacted water quality without shifting overall metrics of river water quality relative to unburned regions fig 5 the role of precipitation events in mobilizing particle bound chemicals across burned landscapes is well established in the literature e g bladon et al 2014 burton et al 2016 langhans et al 2016 townsend and douglas 2000 and in more extensively burned regions of the boreal plains burke et al 2005 however detection of suspended chemicals in large wetland dominated low slope river watersheds with low proportions of areas burned table 1 was a key outcome of this study alternatively total measurements mostly in dissolved form e g total calcium total organic carbon others table s2 showed inconsistent changes between impacted and control stations as well as between precipitation and non event periods perhaps reflecting uneven burning of peat at depth where non erosive flows dominate devito et al 2012 wilkinson et al 2018 4 2 factors shaping wildfire signal detection in large river systems following wildfire loss of ground cover decreased surface roughness and soil crusting and sealing larsen et al 2009 can impede infiltration and expose soils to splash and fluvial erosion shakesby and doerr 2006 these processes often allow storms to mobilize loads of sediment nutrients and contaminants downstream bayley et al 1992 betts and jones 2009 moody and martin 2001 neary et al 2005 however the magnitude and duration of these water quality impacts are shaped by the intensity of precipitation events and the erosive potential of impacted landscapes langhans et al 2016 headwater systems with typically small extensively burned steep and flashy landscapes often show substantial sediment yields from burned watersheds relative to those unburned typically 100x smith et al 2011 with water quality impacts often detected for months to years e g inbar et al 1998 owens et al 2013 in this study of lower relief and wetland dominated landscapes catchments are large burn less extensively and runoff storage is prevalent table 1 devito et al 2012 these conditions resulted in suspended sediment yield ratios impacted control 1 3x with detectable water quality impacts at only hourly and daily scales figs 3 4 6 however fire related impacts on water quality in this study table 1 fig 6 as well as those in headwater regions rhoades et al 2011 demonstrate that differing basin sizes proportions of area burned and area burned at high severity can impact water quality of river systems differently this suggests that mobilization of fire related materials downstream is likely driven by similar processes across differing landscapes but are shaped by catchment and fire related characteristics however we postulate that incomplete hydro chemical mixing may also play an important role in wildfire signal detection in these large rivers expected to buffer landscape chemical signals blöchl et al 2007 large rivers can substantially modify upstream and locally derived terrestrial material via mixing dilution and sedimentation processes temnerud and bishop 2005 however we suggest that the complexities of mixing river waters of different qualities and quantities may have also been responsible for the detection and downstream persistence of wildfire chemical signals observed in these large rivers particularly in the athabasca river other studies have reported a persistence of plumes mixing zones downstream of river confluences because of differences in water densities particle loads or the physico chemical composition of sediments bouchez et al 2010 herrero et al 2018 stone et al 2011 measurements assessing cross sectional changes in water quality of the athabasca river suggest incomplete mixing occurs well downstream of anthropogenic or tributary inputs glozier et al 2018 following the wildfire and precipitation events we observed that both low and high order tributaries draining severely burned watersheds delivered plumes of ash to the athabasca river that were visible for several kilometers downstream of confluences fig 8 empirical evidence from the three athabasca river sondes supported these visual observations for example we observed strong differences in turbidity conductivity and turbidity conductivity covariance values measured on the left and right banks of the athabasca river at the same longitudinal location fig 4 higher turbidity values on the right bank were coincident with turbidity and conductivity spikes in the smaller but more extensively burned clearwater and hangingstone rivers that empty upstream from the right bank the entry of these rivers established a distinct fire impacted plume on the right bank of the athabasca river through to where sonde measurements occurred though it was unclear where the right bank plume mixed fully with the athabasca river downstream we did observe likely mixing and dilution of fire influenced plumes on the left bank of the athabasca near the upstream of fort mcmurray station several severely burned low order streams entered the athabasca river on the left bank and passed though the sonde just downstream resulting in defined precipitation related turbidity and conductivity spikes up to 1000 ntu and 350 μs cm 1 respectively figs 3 and 8 downstream of fort mcmurray on the same bank another sonde measured turbidity and conductivity spikes often 10 60 as large with lower turbidity conductivity covariances fig 4 compared to the upstream location and similar to the unimpacted grand rapids station these results suggest efficient mixing of the small fire impacted plumes on the left bank with larger volumes of unimpacted athabasca river water over just a few kilometers of this reach regardless this uneven mixing of waters from impacted tributaries with the large athabasca river may simultaneously explain observed downstream persistence of wildfire signals but also overall signal attenuation due to dilution i e relative to headwater regions both of which were defining observations of this study 4 3 human related impacts of wildfires in large river systems the occurrence of and damage from wildland urban interface fires has increased over the previous decade in western north america schoennagel et al 2017 westerling et al 2006 as such an event the fort mcmurray wildfire burned regions both within and surrounding the remote urban center of fort mcmurray alberta however this wildfire presented a unique situation where very large low relief watersheds were expected to buffer wildfire impacts on local surface water resources interestingly though we observed relatively muted water quality changes in these very large rivers compared to headwater regions these arguably inconsequential basin scale effects still resulted in impacts to post fire drinking water treatment costs borne by the local municipality similar to headwater regions bladon et al 2014 emelko et al 2011 hohner et al 2019 thurton 2017 preliminary analyses unpublished suggest unmixed plumes in the athabasca river from heavily impacted low order tributaries discharging upstream of the drinking water treatment plant intake on the river may have been responsible thus exclusive focus on the magnitude and persistence of the impacts of wildfire on surface water quality may fail to uncover its true stresses on surface water resources this consideration may be particularly applicable to future wildland urban interface fires as export of complex chemicals e g plastics from residential commercial and industrial settings may present unique water quality conditions in receiving waterbodies of human importance oliver et al 2012 5 conclusions this study presents a multi tiered approach to monitoring the flow and water quality of large rivers in a low relief region affected by an expansive and severe wildfire while broader wildfire impacts to water quality of regional rivers were markedly lower than commonly reported in smaller watersheds of greater relief water quality impacts were nonetheless observed across a range of very large river basin scales novel use of continuous flow and general chemical monitoring was key to identifying impacted periods in the rivers studied herein similar to few other investigations cooke et al 2016 dahm et al 2015 mast et al 2016 in particular our study emphasizes the importance of considering the spatial frame of reference entire basin vs local when evaluating wildfire impacts on water quality in large river basins the proximity and scale of this and other recent wildfires to major urban municipalities further highlights the importance of shifting north american wildfire regimes as increasing threats to community

disinfection processes wang et al 2016 west et al 2016 sources of n nitrosamines in surface water include by products from drinking water and wastewater treatment systems and unintentional formation during a few industrial processing chen et al 2019 fan and lin 2018 for example food and beverage industries employing the fermentation process remain an important source of n nitrosamines fan and lin 2018 numerous surveys from different countries e g usa china spain and australia have been conducted to examine the abundance of different n nitrosamines and available precursors in water bodies including surface water groundwater and wastewater chen et al 2019 dai and mitch 2013 farré et al 2020 kristiana et al 2017 ma et al 2012 a previous study has presented an excellent picture of n nitrosamines around china and found n nitrosodimethylamine ndma in a range of 0 189 ng l and generally with the highest concentration among others bei et al 2016 most of the studies reported ndma or ndma formation potential fp as the most dominant compound among n nitrosamines irrespective of sources and seasonal variations bei et al 2016 chen et al 2016 krasner et al 2013 woods et al 2015 however few exceptions are also documented for other n nitrosamines i e n nitrosomorpholine nmor krasner et al 2013 chen et al 2019 observed the total highest concentration of n nitrosamines up to 1100 ng l in the southeastern pearl river delta of china with the sequence of n nitrosodibutylamine ndba ndma n nitrosodiethylamine ndea n nitrossopyrrolidine npyr in addition to the anthropogenic sources dissolved organic matter dom are well recognized as the catastrophic precursors for the formation of n nitrosamines wang et al 2013a systematically studied the ndma fp by different fractions of dom and noticed that hydrophilic fraction has 1 3 3 5 times higher extent of causing ndma fp than the hydrophobic fraction in terms of molecular size lower molecular weight 1 kda fraction of dom was found to be more responsible for the formation of ndma npyr nmor and n nitrospiperidine npip compared to the large sized molecular fraction wang et al 2013b a recent study used high resolution mass spectrometry hrms orbitrap analysis for investigating the relationship between dom and ndma fp farré et al 2019 they concluded that dom constituents with h c 1 5 correlated positively with ndma fp these dom constituents present bioavailable fraction of dom containing higher heteroatoms such as nitrogen and can be used as a marker for potential wastewater inputs or algal bloom in aquatic body d andrilli et al 2015 farré et al 2019 although few studies successfully explored the association and role of different dom fractions on basis of molecular size and hydrophobicity hydrophilicity in the formation of n nitrosamines wang et al 2013a 2013b dom n nitrosamines relationship employing spectroscopic based tools for quality monitoring aspects is still mostly unknown the successful application could help in drafting a strategy for controlling water quality and understanding the association of dom constituents with the abundance of n nitrosamines fluorescence spectra of water and wastewater present fluorescent dissolved organic matter fdom associated with protein like and humic like contents which was found to be helpful in describing the overall changes in dom up to some extent li et al 2020 maqbool et al 2020 fluorescence spectra in the form of an excitation emission matrix eem of dom are complex with several overlying fdom peaks requiring additional interpretation approach a mathematical tool parallel factor analysis parafac developed by stedmon and bro 2008 is a multi way parallel data analysis technique that is recognized for distinguishing fdom on the basis of fluorescence features given that the eem parafac approach has previously explored the occurrence of fdom and micropollutants sgroi et al 2017 in a recent study fluorescence based monitoring of an advanced wastewater treatment process provided a strong correlation between the removal of protein like fluorescence and ndma fp and its precursors roccaro et al 2020 yang and coworkers assessed the correlation between the eem parafac components and ndma fp in nine different drinking water systems a direct correlation was reported between ndma fp and protein like component yang et al 2015 in these studies only ndma ndma fp were tried to correlate with fdom the association between different n nitrosamines and fdom are not discussed yet in the current study the correlation between n nitrosamines and dom are explored to develop seasonal monitoring tool for source and treated water in different drinking water treatment plants in a southern city of china specific objectives include i determining the relationship between the fluorescence components and n nitrosamines or ndma fp ii measuring dependence of n nitrosamines and fdom on the seasonal variation and iii impacts of treatment on fluorescence components and n nitrosamines as well as ndma fp this report is first in providing simultaneous monitoring of fdom through eem parafac and n nitrosamines to find the relationship between the different fluorophores n nitrosamines and ndma fp 2 material and methods 2 1 water samples collected source and treated water effluent samples from 10 different drinking water

spectra uv vis spectra were obtained to ensure the dom concentration in the sample the uv absorbance at 254 nm was confirmed to less than 0 05 cm 1 to avoid any inner filter effects ly et al 2018 following are the adjustments of fluorescence spectrometer for collection of three dimensional eems excitation ex and emission em ranges were set at 220 450 nm and 280 600 nm with scan steps of 5 nm

applied to eems datasets of cumulative samples of source and treated water from all 10 different drinking water treatment plants total samples used for combined modeling are 120 with 20 samples collected each month the modeling was performed using the domflour toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc usa by following the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 the parafac analysis comprises the following steps i remove scattering by cutting few wavelengths ii non negativity constraints iii loading leverage iv identify and removal of outliers if any and v validation for a suitable number of components through split half analysis the fmax represents the maximum fluorescence intensity for an individual component e g humic like and protein like this fluorescence intensity was also normalized by using the raman integration method lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 7 statistical analysis the principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation were conducted to select suitable fluorescence indices to represent the seasonal changes in n nitrosamines of source and treated water in 10 drinking water plants the selected parameters are sum of n nitrosamines na ndma fp nine n

averages parameters during wet ws and dry ds seasons in 10 drinking water plants the data points of different drinking water plants were arrange as ws dwp1 to ws dwp10 and ds dwp1 to ds dwp10 for the wet and dry seasons respectively the pearson correlation among different parameters was also analyzed on monthly values of selected parameters and presented in the form of heat map all the statistical analysis were performed using origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of n nitrosamines in source and treated water the general occurrence of n nitrosamines in water samples collected from 10 different drinking water plants is shown in fig 1 and table s8 among the n nitrosamines ndma and ndpha were present in all of water samples i e 100 followed by nmor npyr ndea npip nmea ndba and ndpa with detection frequency of 97 98 93 93 85 97 70 78 72 67 63 65 52 52 and 48 48 for source treated water respectively the detection frequency is based on the mdl table s5 and presented in table s8 the frequencies of n nitrosamine species in this study are reported to be slightly different from those obtained from the previous surveys for other chinese water sources for example ma et al 2012 observed the highest frequency i e 100 of ndea relative to other n nitrosamine counterparts in jialu river basin while ndma was also frequently detected 98 another excellent n nitrosamines detection campaign found nmor 77 superior in the frequency sequence followed by ndba 68 while the ndma has presented only 38 bei et al 2016 the above reports however have also shown that ndma ndea and ndba are among the commonly found n nitrosamines in surface water bei et al 2016 ma et al 2012 and are in good agreement with our study it is noteworthy that the water source properties could play a vital role in n nitrosamines formation for example as compared to surface water wastewater effluent has shown the consistent presence of ndma and nmor with 100 frequency chen et al 2019 meanwhile ndea has shown a substantial frequency of 67 along with ndma 77 in groundwater ma et al 2012 the four abundant n nitrosamines found in source and treated water are ndma ndba npyr and ndpha with average composition of 29 5 26 7 20 0 25 2 18 9 16 0 and 9 0 9 9 fig 1 at concentrations of 4 2 2 0 3 4 2 1 2 8 3 4 3 2 4 1 2 7 1 9 2 1 1 6 and 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 2 ng l respectively table s8 such diverse n nitrosamines in the source could ascribe to heterogeneous contaminant sources due to extensive urbanization rising industrial and modern agricultural activities in the city the main industries in the city include pharmaceutical electronics electroplating leather textile and printing and paper factories wu et al 2020 rare studies are available in the literature reporting nine nitrosamines in source or drinking water for instance n nitrosamines campaigns in 11 spanish drinking water plants showed the absence of npyr npip ndpa and nmea reporting limit of 0 1 ng l farré et al 2020 a study on a drinking water plant in north america found only ndma above the minimum reporting limit of 1 5 ng l woods et al 2015 a recent study traced the leading sources of n nitrosamines in a river delta and found five n nitrosamines ndma ndea npyr nmor and ndba abundant in industrial effluent however ndma ndea and nmor were abundant in domestic wastewater leading to the river delta chen et al 2019 krauss and coworkers observed higher share of industrial effluent in n nitrosamines pollution than domestic discharge in different sewage treatment plants of switzerland ndma and nmor were found to be likely candidates for contamination in drinking water krauss et al 2009 the average distribution of n nitrosamines in source and treated water is presented in fig s4 unlike other chinese regions ndma in drinking water systems of this southern city was not at a higher concentration for instance the ndma concentration in surface waters i e rivers and reservoirs in other works was 53 6 ng l wang et al 2016 and 28 5 ng l bei et al 2016 significantly higher than that in the current study meanwhile other n nitrosamines are comparable bei et al 2016 wang et al 2016 it should be underlined the slight difference in the n nitrosamines concentration between the source and treated water p 0 24 one way anova implying neither inadequate removal of n nitrosamines nor any noticeable production of n nitrosamines upon drinking treatment practices fig 1 the performances of these drinking water plants in terms of basic quality parameters are reasonable table s9 the limited removal of all n nitrosamine are frequently reported in studies and are challenging to achieve safe drinking water levels luo et al 2012 wang et al 2016 these concentrations in treated water meet the standard for potable water and would not pose any severe human health risk who 2011 none of the n nitrosamines in treated water has shown discrimination source vs treated in detected frequencies implying the dependence of treated water on source quality strong relationships r2 0 36 0 91 and p 0 001 between the concentration of n nitrosamines in source and treated water are found as illustrated in fig s5 it is essential to note all of the treatment facilities continuously dosed naocl for disinfection for the estimation of the available precursors in source and treated water the results of ndma fp for source and treated samples collected are presented in fig 2 the ndma formation potential was found in the range of 14 7 38 8 ng l and 11 4 34 4 ng l with an average median of 26 3 6 2 25 3 ng l and 19 2 5 7 18 1 ng l for source and treated water respectively the average decrease 27 1 10 6 in ndma fp presented a slight reduction of precursors anova p 0 05 during the treatment units the correlation among n nitrosamines or ndma fp and bulk parameters such as doc tn nh4 no2 no3 and turbidity were also conducted for source and treated water there was no any strong linear relationship found with doc but tn and no3 have shown up to a few extents illustrated in tables s10 and s11 our results aligned with few other studies which did not find any significant relationship between the basic water quality parameters and n nitrosamines in drinking water or ndma fp bei et al 2016 wang et al 2016 nevertheless some opposite observations were devised for example yang et al 2015 reported a linear correlation between doc and ndma fp r 0 53 p 0 001 from the above results it infers that all drinking water plants in the southern city of china are receiving the source water with a moderate concentration of n nitrosamines and current operating conditions are providing treated water meeting all the guidelines for drinking water the average cancer risk of n nitrosamines was found to be in the range of 1 79 10 10 ndpha to 5 01 10 6 ndma eight n nitrosamines except ndma were far below the generally accepted risk of 10 6 and ndma was found close to the risk level 10 6 us epa 2015 table s7 3 2 seasonal impacts in n nitrosamines the average temperature and the rainfall were 28 87 0 44 and 22 03 2 78 c and 456 90 106 85 and 30 54 20 24 mm for the wet season july to september and the dry season october to december respectively in this territory there is no major discrepancy in temperature but the rainfall does significantly change between the two seasons no any noticeable impacts of season changes were recorded on basis quality parameters in source and treated water between wet and dry seasons table s9 the results indicated that the general occurrence of n nitrosamines was profoundly affected by the seasonal variation the higher rainfall in the wet season likely caused less release or generation of n nitrosamines in source water fig 3 similarly so did it for the n nitrosamine concentrations in treated water the highest difference in n nitrosamines concentration can be found between august and december anova p 0 001 the average concentrations during these months were recorded to be 6 12 1 63 and 22 34 4 76 ng l in source water and 6 38 1 38 and 21 97 3 15 ng l in treated water respectively tables s12 and s13 the range of total n nitrosamines during august and december was found to be 2 79 9 32 and 13 75 31 06 ng l in source water 3 59 8 28 and 18 36 28 83 in treated water respectively such a matching concentration of n nitrosamines in source and treated water of different treatment systems during both of the seasons illustrated the identical activities around different reservoirs or matching seasonal influence on these water compartments a previous study by jurado sánchez et al 2012 had witnessed the insignificant effects of temperature and rainfall on n nitrosamines in source water but effluent showed an increase in the pollutants concentration when the season changed from summer to winter unlike the current study chloramine was employed in their study jurado sánchez et al 2012 there was no any matching trend or correlation of any basic water quality parameters with n nitrosamines during the varying seasons in the current area under investigation tables s10 and s11 which urged to investigate further the behavior of all nine n nitrosamines in different treatment facilities in addition to already present n nitrosamines the extent of available precursors during varying seasons estimated through measuring the ndma fp are illustrated in fig 4 interestingly there was a strong correlation between ndma fp with n nitrosamines regardless of the sources and the treated water r2 0 77 highlighting the importance of precursor substances in the water source which varied upon the climate change previous studies have also compared the ndma fp during different seasons and found the dilution effects in high rainfall events up to some extent for instance uzun et al 2015 investigated the impacts of seasonal parameters precipitation on ndma fp in 12 different water sources including rivers and lakes reservoirs they concluded that not all the water sources were affected by precipitation in terms of water quality all the rivers and mostly reservoirs showed higher ndma fp during flood season and vice verse results were reported for remaining reservoirs their work ascribed such variability in different rivers and reservoirs to the land use which possibly impacted the nom along influx to the water bodies on the contrary to the previous study which reported that ndma fp in water bodies is location dependent rather than being affected by seasonal variation aydin et al 2012 our study has shown the higher influence of rainfall with matching concentration in source and treated water of drinking water plants the results are in line with a nationwide ndma campaign in japan presenting higher ndma concentration in the raw water and effluent during the winter season than that during summer and results were pronounced in the east and west parts of the country asami et al 2009 the further exploration of n nitrosamines in drinking water involves understanding the dynamics of each n nitrosamine as illustrated in fig 5 s6 and s7 most of the n nitrosamines share a similar trend with total n nitrosamines except for ndpha and nmor which have lower concentration during the wet season and higher concentration in the dry season it is interesting to note that ndpha and nmor behaved significantly p 0 001 different from the rest which infers that weather conditions have a pronounced influence on the main sources of nmor and ndpha e g roads streets roofs pavements and parking lots and or precursors availability and ultimately determine the composition of overall n nitrosamines the cluster of ndma and ndpha in source and treated water of all drinking water treatment plants are shown in fig 5 and trends of remaining n nitrosamines are presented in figs s6 and s7 on opposite of others n nitrosamines nmor and ndpha have shown positive association with rainfall compare to the increase of ndma with changes in season the variation in ndpha was more severe with the average reduction of more than seven times in both source and treated water the uniform changes in each n nitrosamine in source and treated water of all drinking water treatment plants indicated that environmental conditions or the aquatic biogeochemistry had played a critical role rather than rainfall dilution and anthropogenic activities previous studies reported substantial changes in allochthonous and autochthonous activity upon changes in season shi et al 2020 which could change the occurrence of precursors and their links to such unusual behavior of different n nitrosamines it infers that not only one factor controls the n nitrosamines concentration in aquatic bodies biogeochemistry land use and industrial activities play a composite role the following discussion is comprised of the impact of changing season on dom composition which associates with different sources of activities in the source water 3 3 seasonal impacts on fdom for fdom a two component eem parafac model was validated and provided a component 1 c1 with ex em of 245 414 nm and component 2 c2 located at ex em 230 280 328 nm fig 6 the selection criteria for determining the reasonable number of components is based on the split half validation according to previous available studies c1 is traditionally termed as a humic like component while c2 resembles free and or bound protein like component cory and mcknight 2005 vera et al 2017 multiple sources of fluorescence have been reported in studies such as the terrestrial dom algal bloom and effluent organic matter microbial humification singh et al 2010 williams et al 2019 generally the components located beyond emission of 380 nm are assigned to humic like fluorescence with origins of microbial humification or terrestrial humic substances li et al 2014 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the peaks located 380 nm are assigned to different protein like fluorescence moieties tryptophan and tyrosine like amino acids are the main sources of such fluorescence signatures the former located at longer emission than the later baghoth et al 2011 also the traditional indices such as hix and bix were of use to compare with eem parafac regarding the seasonal changes in source and treated water the extent of these indices in source and treated water of all drinking water plants did not present any clear tendency with the change of the weather conditions including the rainfall fig s8 most notably the eem parafac components illustrated the direct impact of rainfall on the dom changes showing linear relationships between the fluorescence components with the extent of rainfall with c1 and c2 being r2 of 0 62 and 0 41 respectively fig s9 fig 7 represents the changing fluorescence components in source and treated water over the six months of sampling period in all drinking water plants it is noteworthy that both components have shown different trends p 0 05 one way anova which infers that seasonal changes in the city substantially influence the dom composition in the aquatic system the average of fluorescence components in source water has a relatively linear increase and decrease in fmax of c1 and c2 respectively the fluorescence component with maximum 0 32 0 05 r u and minimum 0 18 0 024 r u intensities of c1 were recorded during september and december respectively on the other hand dom were enriched 0 38 0 05 r u with c2 in november and it showed the lowest abundance 0 25 0 04 r u in july it infers that the wet season with hot summer conditions favors the release of the humic like fdom in reservoirs providing the source water to the different treatment plants which was ascribed to the washout of diverse soil leaf derived organic substances from upstream catchments into water supplies mostly rivers and lakes ly et al 2015 this finding is in line with a few previous studies presenting the higher release of humic substances during the rainfall events and vice versa for the protein like component higher rainfall caused the release of dom from the deep soil with more erosion heading toward the surface water liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 on the other hand mild flow rate during dry season provides a perfect niche to thrive microorganisms release autochthonous dom mostly having the feature like protein contents ly et al 2017 to compare the relative changes in dom c1 c2 was determined on the average basis of the wet season july to september and dry season october to december fig 8 a significant difference in fdom composition anova p 0 001 was recorded in source and treated water between wet and dry seasons with dominant humic like and protein like constituents respectively the composition of fdom c1 c2 also corresponds to the relative abundance of c1 and c2 in the source water numerous studies have found protein like components as dominant fluorescence features than the humic like in soluble microbial products and effluent organic matter ly et al 2018 shen et al 2012 current results also provide evidence of substantial concentration of soluble microbial products or effluent organic matter in source water by presenting a lower c1 c2 ratio during dry season several studies have proved compositional variations in dom upon changing season through application of fluorescence spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry by all these techniques bioploymers with large molcular weight with fluorescence featues of protein like and molecular composition with o poor aromatics were found to be abundant in dry season showing the presence of bioavialable dom liu et al 2020 shi et al 2020 so et al 2017 it is speculated that such prominent changes in dom composition could be linked with abundances of precursors in drinking water systems especially in the source water effluent organic matter have been observed to be the leading sources of precursors for ndma and other n nitrosamines ma et al 2012 wang et al 2011 few of the n nitrosamines specifically ndma ndm fp have shown direct association with fdom composition and concentration in water and wastewater treatment systems roccaro et al 2020 yang et al 2015 on the other hand a few studies have reported terrestrial humic substances as the origins for n nitrosamines after releasing amine precursors under photochemical irradiation bushaw newton and moran 1999 mitch and sedlak 2002 below are the correlations presented for the different fluorescence components and indicators to obtain any proxies for these season dependent n nitrosamines in source and treated water 3 4 correlation between n nitrosamines and spectroscopic indicators the aforementioned results proved that seasonal changes influenced n nitrosamines and fdom in water sources rainfall was found to be mostly responsible for the patterns obtained in a bid to untangle the complex relationship between a variety of parameters pca was applied to compile all the given data together with heat map for pearson correlation figs 9 and s10 the principal component 1 pc1 explained for 50 82 of the total variances while the pc2 was responsible for 16 48 of the variations fig 9 these correlations imply that the protein like component c2 possibly derived from the microbial activity and effluent organic matter in the reservoir is mostly responsible for the n nitrosamines excluding nmor and ndpha or it also potentially forms these compounds as measured in terms of ndma fp the concentrations of nmor and ndpha have been determined by humic like component and the ratio of c1 c2 which presented the overall composition change in dom a similar correlation can be found in treated water fig s10 and the above results already proved that the abundance of the n nitrosamines or the ndma fp solely depends on the influent quality and also mirrors the n nitrosamines composition the extent of correlation determined through heat map also clearly distinguished the occurrence of ndpha and nmor from the rest of n nitrosamines and provided fluorescence components c1 c2 as a fluorescence proxy these correlations indicated that organic matter from autochthonous activities in the surface water are directly linked with the n nitrosamines formation however terrestrial dom could act as proxy for a few of them e g nmor and ndpha such a noticeable difference in the concentration of these n nitrosamines nmor and ndpha with the rainfall and concurrent changes in humic like fluorescence indicated the dual effects of rainfall on source water chemistry first is the leaching of these particular n nitrosamines from the roads streets roofs pavements and parking lots meanwhile the soil erosion dom extraction from deep soil and dried leaf vegetation are second effect the rainfall could also leach n nitrosamines from improperly disposed waste and dumping sites and transport them into source water reservoirs the binding property of humic substances could also assist in the mobility of n nitrosamines it concludes from the discussion that humic substances could be an appropriate proxy for the nmor and ndpha in source water rather than a source for their generation results from this work demonstrate that seasonal dependent dom composition in source water could affect the occurrence of n nitrosamines and also provide precursors for the formation of these compounds unlike the basic water quality parameters and traditional fluorescence indices the general occurrence of n nitrosamines in source and treated water of drinking water plants could sufficiently be explained by eem parafac modeling the treated water quality is found to depend on source water unless operating parameters are regulated and tuned under seasonal variations the important implication of the study is to monitor the water quality through the fluorescence spectroscopy method and to obtain information related to carcinogenic pollutants a future broader study comprising of sampling from different climate regions is mandatory to develop a reliable relationship between these constituents this approach could also be proved as a source tracking tool to monitor the different discharges to the drinking water resources i e surface water and penetration of the groundwater furthermore such studies help to adjust the parameters of the water treatment plants with changes in seasonal to limit such compounds in treated water 4 conclusions this study investigated the occurrence of n nitrosamines in source and treated water from 10 different drinking water systems in a southern city of china the impacts of seasonal change and the presence of different dom on the abundance of n nitrosamines and ndma fp are comprehensively investigated following are the conclusions drawn from the results all n nitrosamines in source and treated water are found to be well below the guidelines the maximum levels recorded for total n nitrosamines and ndma fp in the source and treated water are 31 60 28 84 and 38 86 34 41 ng l respectively the strong linear relationship r2 0 77 p 0 001 between the total n nitrosamines and ndma fp in source and drinking water has also been found the general concentration of n nitrosamines was recorded to be low max 9 3 ng l in the wet season rainfall 456 90 106 85 mm however it increased more than two folds max 31 6 ng l in the dry season with an average rainfall of 30 54 20 24 mm ndma fp also followed a similar trend meanwhile two n nitrosamines ndpha and nmor have shown vice versa trends the eem parafac modeling provides unique trends of different fluorescence components and their relative contributions wet season was found to be favorable for humic like component and dry season released dom enriched with protein like fluorescence the calculated c1 c2 ratio was double fold 1 05 0 12 and 1 10 0 25 in wet season than dry season with a ratio of 0 55 0 11 and 0 52 0 13 in source and drinking water respectively the statistical analysis provided a correlation and insights into changes in n nitrosamines and dom among the n nitrosamines seven of these were correlated with protein like c2 fluorescence presenting their association with autochthonous dom or contamination by effluent organic matter meanwhile the dynamics of nmor and ndpha were well explained by humic like c1 fluorescence and abundance could also be determined by the ratio of humic like to protein like fluorescence c1 c2 the results of the study provided a coherence among the different n nitrosamines concentration ndma fp and fluorescence components these findings are useful in presenting the overall water quality in drinking water i e fluorescence proxies could be an

17762,n nitrosamines have been identified as emerging contaminants with tremendous carcinogenic potential for human beings this study examined the seasonal changes in the occurrence of n nitrosamines and n nitrosodimethylamine formation potential ndma fp in drinking water resources and potable water from 10 drinking water treatment plants in a southern city of china the changes in n nitrosamines are well correlated with dissolved organic matter dom particularly fluorophores which were measured and compared between traditional fluorescence indices and excitation emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis eem parafac four of n nitrosamine species including n nitrosodimethylamine ndma n nitrosodibutylamine ndba n nitrosopyrrolidine npyr and n nitrosodiphenylamine ndpha are found to be abundant compounds with an average of 29 5 26 7 20 0 25 2 18 9 16 0 and 9 0 9 9 in the source and treated water respectively the sum of n nitrosamines concentration is recorded to be low in the wet season july september whereas the dry season october december provided opposite impacts eem parafac modeling indicated the predominance of humic like component c1 in the wet season while in the dry season the water was dominant in protein like component c2 all the n nitrosamines excluding ndpha and n nitrosomorpholine nmor showed a strong association with protein like component c2 in contrast humic like c1 which was directly influenced by rainfall was found to be a suitable proxy for nmor and ndpha the results of this study are valuable to understand the correlation between

sources dissolved organic matter dom are well recognized as the catastrophic precursors for the formation of n nitrosamines wang et al 2013a systematically studied the ndma fp by different fractions

d andrilli et al 2015 farré et al 2019 although few studies successfully explored the association and role of different dom fractions on basis of molecular size and hydrophobicity hydrophilicity in the formation of n nitrosamines wang et al 2013a 2013b dom n nitrosamines relationship employing spectroscopic based tools for quality monitoring aspects is still mostly unknown the successful application could help in drafting a strategy for controlling water quality and understanding the association of dom constituents with the abundance of n nitrosamines fluorescence spectra of water and

approach a mathematical tool parallel factor analysis parafac developed by stedmon and bro 2008 is a multi way parallel data analysis technique that is recognized for distinguishing fdom on the basis of fluorescence features given that the eem parafac approach has previously explored the occurrence of fdom and micropollutants sgroi et al 2017 in a recent study fluorescence based monitoring of an advanced wastewater treatment process provided a strong correlation between the removal of protein like fluorescence and ndma fp and its precursors roccaro et al 2020 yang and coworkers assessed the correlation between the eem parafac components and ndma fp in nine different drinking water systems a direct correlation was reported between ndma fp and protein like component yang et al 2015 in these studies only ndma ndma fp were tried to correlate with fdom the association between different n nitrosamines and fdom are not discussed yet in the current study the correlation between n nitrosamines and dom are explored to develop seasonal monitoring tool for source and treated water in different drinking water treatment plants in a southern city of china specific objectives include i determining the relationship between the fluorescence components and n nitrosamines or ndma fp ii measuring dependence of n nitrosamines and fdom on the seasonal variation and iii impacts of

spectra uv vis spectra were obtained to ensure the dom concentration in the sample the uv absorbance at 254 nm was confirmed to less than 0 05 cm 1 to avoid any inner filter effects ly et al 2018 following are the adjustments of fluorescence spectrometer for collection of three dimensional eems excitation ex and emission em ranges were set at 220 450 nm and 280 600 nm with scan steps of 5 nm and 1 nm respectively scans were gathered with a speed of 30 000 nm min both of the slits ex and em were fixed at 5 nm of each the eems of milli q water 18 ωm as blank was subtracted from the eems of

applied to eems datasets of cumulative samples of source and treated water from all 10 different drinking water treatment plants total samples used for combined modeling are 120 with 20 samples collected each month the modeling was performed using the domflour toolbox in matlab 13 0 mathworks inc usa by following the tutorial of stedmon and bro 2008 the parafac analysis comprises the following steps i remove scattering by cutting few wavelengths ii non negativity constraints iii loading leverage iv identify and removal of outliers if any and v validation for a suitable number of components through split half analysis the fmax represents the maximum fluorescence intensity for an individual component e g humic like and protein like this fluorescence intensity was also normalized by using the raman integration method lawaetz and stedmon 2009 2 7 statistical analysis the principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation were conducted to select suitable fluorescence indices to represent the seasonal changes in n nitrosamines of source and treated water in 10 drinking water plants the selected parameters are sum of n nitrosamines na ndma fp nine n nitrosamines eem parafac components and fluorescence indices hix and bix a pca biplot was developed which showed loading and scores for the selected components the pca was performed on three months averages parameters during wet ws and dry ds seasons in 10 drinking water plants the data points of different drinking water plants were arrange as ws dwp1 to ws dwp10 and ds dwp1 to ds dwp10 for the wet and dry seasons respectively the pearson correlation among different parameters was also analyzed on monthly values of selected parameters and presented in the form of heat map all the statistical analysis were performed using origin software 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of n nitrosamines in source and treated water the general occurrence of n nitrosamines in water samples collected from 10 different drinking water plants is shown in fig 1 and table s8 among the n nitrosamines ndma and ndpha were present in all of water samples i e 100 followed by nmor npyr ndea npip nmea ndba and ndpa with detection frequency of 97 98 93 93 85 97 70 78 72 67 63 65 52 52 and 48 48 for source treated water respectively the detection frequency is based on the mdl table s5 and presented in table s8 the frequencies of n nitrosamine species in this study are reported to be slightly different from those obtained from the previous surveys for other chinese water sources for example ma et al 2012 observed the highest frequency i e 100 of ndea relative to other n nitrosamine counterparts in jialu river basin while ndma was also frequently detected 98 another excellent n nitrosamines detection campaign found nmor 77 superior in the frequency sequence followed by ndba 68 while the ndma has presented only 38 bei et al 2016 the above reports however have also shown that ndma ndea and ndba are among the commonly found n nitrosamines in surface water bei et al 2016 ma et al 2012 and are in good agreement with our study it is noteworthy that the water source properties could play a vital role in n nitrosamines formation for example as compared to surface water wastewater effluent has shown the consistent presence of ndma and nmor with 100 frequency chen et al 2019 meanwhile ndea has shown a substantial frequency of 67 along with ndma 77 in groundwater ma et al 2012 the four abundant n nitrosamines found in source and treated water are ndma ndba npyr and ndpha with average composition of 29 5 26 7 20 0 25 2 18 9 16 0 and 9 0 9 9 fig 1 at concentrations of 4 2 2 0 3 4 2 1 2 8 3 4 3 2 4 1 2 7 1 9 2 1 1 6 and 1 3 1 1 1 3 1 2 ng l respectively table s8 such diverse n nitrosamines in the source could ascribe to heterogeneous contaminant sources due to extensive urbanization rising industrial and modern agricultural activities in the city the main industries in the city include pharmaceutical electronics electroplating leather textile and printing and paper factories wu et al 2020 rare studies are available in the literature reporting nine nitrosamines in source or drinking water for instance n nitrosamines campaigns in 11 spanish drinking water plants showed the absence of npyr npip ndpa and nmea reporting limit of 0 1 ng l farré et al 2020 a study on a drinking water plant in north america found only ndma above the minimum reporting limit of 1 5 ng l woods et al 2015 a recent study traced the leading sources of n nitrosamines in a river delta and found five n nitrosamines ndma ndea npyr nmor and ndba abundant in industrial effluent however ndma ndea and nmor were abundant in domestic wastewater leading to the river delta chen et al 2019 krauss and coworkers observed higher share of industrial effluent in n nitrosamines pollution than domestic discharge in different sewage treatment plants of switzerland ndma and nmor were found to be likely candidates for contamination in drinking water krauss et al 2009 the average distribution of n nitrosamines in source and treated water is presented in fig s4 unlike other chinese regions ndma in drinking water systems of this southern city was not at a higher concentration for instance the ndma concentration in surface waters i e rivers and reservoirs in other works was 53 6 ng l wang et al 2016 and 28 5 ng l bei et al 2016 significantly higher than that in the current study meanwhile other n nitrosamines are comparable bei et al 2016 wang et al 2016 it should be underlined the slight difference in the n nitrosamines concentration between the source and treated water p 0 24 one way anova implying neither inadequate removal of n nitrosamines nor any noticeable production of n nitrosamines upon drinking treatment practices fig 1 the performances of these drinking water plants in terms of basic quality parameters are reasonable table s9 the limited removal of all n nitrosamine are frequently reported in studies and are challenging to achieve safe drinking water levels luo et al 2012 wang et al 2016 these concentrations in treated water meet the standard for potable water and would not pose any severe human health risk who 2011 none of the n nitrosamines in treated water has shown discrimination source vs treated in detected frequencies implying the dependence of treated water on source quality strong relationships r2 0 36 0 91 and p 0 001 between the concentration of n nitrosamines in source and treated water are found as illustrated in fig s5 it is essential to note all of the treatment facilities continuously dosed naocl for disinfection for the estimation of the available precursors in source and treated water the results of ndma fp for source and treated samples collected are presented in fig 2 the ndma formation potential was found in the range of 14 7 38 8 ng l and 11 4 34 4 ng l with an average median of 26 3 6 2 25 3 ng l and 19 2 5 7 18 1 ng l for source and treated water respectively the average decrease 27 1 10 6 in ndma fp presented a slight reduction of precursors anova p 0 05 during the treatment units the correlation among n nitrosamines or ndma fp and bulk parameters such as doc tn nh4 no2 no3 and turbidity were also conducted for source and treated water there was no any strong linear relationship found with doc but tn and no3 have shown up to a few extents illustrated in tables s10 and s11 our results aligned with few other studies which did not find any significant relationship between the basic water quality parameters and n nitrosamines in drinking water or ndma fp bei et al 2016 wang et al 2016 nevertheless some opposite observations were devised for example yang et al 2015 reported a linear correlation between doc and ndma fp r 0 53 p 0 001 from the above results it infers that all drinking water plants in the southern city of china are receiving the source water with a moderate concentration of n nitrosamines and current operating conditions are providing treated water meeting all the guidelines for drinking water the average cancer risk of n nitrosamines was found to be in the range of 1 79 10 10 ndpha to 5 01 10 6 ndma eight n nitrosamines except ndma were far below the generally accepted risk of 10 6 and ndma was found close to the risk level 10 6 us epa 2015 table s7 3 2 seasonal impacts in n nitrosamines the average temperature and the rainfall were 28 87 0 44 and 22 03 2 78 c and 456 90 106 85 and 30 54 20 24 mm for the wet season july to september and the dry season october to december respectively in this territory there is no major discrepancy in temperature but the rainfall does significantly change between the two seasons no any noticeable impacts of season changes were recorded on basis quality parameters in source and treated water between wet and dry seasons table s9 the results indicated that the general occurrence of n nitrosamines was profoundly affected by the seasonal variation the higher rainfall in the wet season likely caused less release or generation of n nitrosamines in source water fig 3 similarly so did it for the n nitrosamine concentrations in treated water the highest difference in n nitrosamines concentration can be found between august and december anova p 0 001 the average concentrations during these months were recorded to be 6 12 1 63 and 22 34 4 76 ng l in source water and 6 38 1 38 and 21 97 3 15 ng l in treated water respectively tables s12 and s13 the range of total n nitrosamines during august and december was found to be 2 79 9 32 and 13 75 31 06 ng l in source water 3 59 8 28 and 18 36 28 83 in treated water respectively such a matching concentration of n nitrosamines in source and treated water of different treatment systems during both of the seasons illustrated the identical activities around different reservoirs or matching seasonal influence on these water compartments a previous study by jurado sánchez et al 2012 had witnessed the insignificant effects of temperature and rainfall on n nitrosamines in source water but effluent showed an increase in the pollutants concentration when the season changed from summer to winter unlike the current study chloramine was employed in their study jurado sánchez et al 2012 there was no any matching trend or correlation of any basic water quality parameters with n nitrosamines during the varying seasons in the current area under investigation tables s10 and s11 which urged to investigate further the behavior of all nine n nitrosamines in different treatment facilities in addition to already present n nitrosamines the extent of available precursors during varying seasons estimated through measuring the ndma fp are illustrated in fig 4 interestingly there was a strong correlation between ndma fp with n nitrosamines regardless of the sources and the treated water r2 0 77 highlighting the importance of precursor substances in the water source which varied upon the climate change previous studies have also compared the ndma fp during different seasons and found the dilution effects in high rainfall events up to some extent for instance uzun et al 2015 investigated the impacts of seasonal parameters precipitation on ndma fp in 12 different water sources including rivers and lakes reservoirs they concluded that not all the water sources were affected by precipitation in terms of water quality all the rivers and mostly reservoirs showed higher ndma fp during flood season and vice verse results were reported for remaining reservoirs their work ascribed such variability in different rivers and reservoirs to the land use which possibly impacted the nom along influx to the water bodies on the contrary to the previous study which reported that ndma fp in water bodies is location dependent rather than being affected by seasonal variation aydin et al 2012 our study has shown the higher influence of rainfall with matching concentration in source and treated water of drinking water plants the results are in line with a nationwide ndma campaign in japan presenting higher ndma concentration in the raw water and effluent during the winter season than that during summer and results were pronounced in the east and west parts of the country asami et al 2009 the further exploration of n nitrosamines in drinking water involves understanding the dynamics of each n nitrosamine as illustrated in fig 5 s6 and s7 most of the n nitrosamines share a similar trend with total n nitrosamines except for ndpha and nmor which have lower concentration during the wet season and higher concentration in the dry season it is interesting to note that ndpha and nmor behaved significantly p 0 001 different from the rest which infers that weather conditions have a pronounced influence on the main sources of nmor and ndpha e g roads streets roofs pavements and parking lots and or precursors availability and ultimately determine the composition of overall n nitrosamines the cluster of ndma and ndpha in source and treated water of all drinking water treatment plants are shown in fig 5 and trends of remaining n nitrosamines are presented in figs s6 and s7 on opposite of others n nitrosamines nmor and ndpha have shown positive association with rainfall compare to the increase of ndma with changes in season the variation in ndpha was more severe with the average reduction of more than seven times in both source and treated water the uniform changes in each n nitrosamine in source and treated water of all drinking water treatment plants indicated that environmental conditions or the aquatic biogeochemistry had played a critical role rather than rainfall dilution and anthropogenic activities previous studies reported substantial changes in allochthonous and autochthonous activity upon changes in season shi et al 2020 which could change the occurrence of precursors and their links to such unusual behavior of different n nitrosamines it infers that not only one factor controls the n nitrosamines concentration in aquatic bodies biogeochemistry land use and industrial activities play a composite role the following discussion is comprised of the impact of changing season on dom composition which associates with different sources of activities in the source water 3 3 seasonal impacts on fdom for fdom a two component eem parafac model was validated and provided a component 1 c1 with ex em of 245 414 nm and component 2 c2 located at ex em 230 280 328 nm fig 6 the selection criteria for determining the reasonable number of components is based on the split half validation according to previous available studies c1 is traditionally termed as a humic like component while c2 resembles free and or bound protein like component cory and mcknight 2005 vera et al 2017 multiple sources of fluorescence have been reported in studies such as the terrestrial dom algal bloom and effluent organic matter microbial humification singh et al 2010 williams et al 2019 generally the components located beyond emission of 380 nm are assigned to humic like fluorescence with origins of microbial humification or terrestrial humic substances li et al 2014 yamashita and jaffé 2008 the peaks located 380 nm are assigned to different protein like fluorescence moieties tryptophan and tyrosine like amino acids are the main sources of such fluorescence signatures the former located at longer emission than the later baghoth et al 2011 also the traditional indices such as hix and bix were of use to compare with eem parafac regarding the seasonal changes in source and treated water the extent of these indices in source and treated water of all drinking water plants did not present any clear tendency with the change of the weather conditions including the rainfall fig s8 most notably the eem parafac components illustrated the direct impact of rainfall on the dom changes showing linear relationships between the fluorescence components with the extent of rainfall with c1 and c2 being r2 of 0 62 and 0 41 respectively fig s9 fig 7 represents the changing fluorescence components in source and treated water over the six months of sampling period in all drinking water plants it is noteworthy that both components have shown different trends p 0 05 one way anova which infers that seasonal changes in the city substantially influence the dom composition in the aquatic system the average of fluorescence components in source water has a relatively linear increase and decrease in fmax of c1 and c2 respectively the fluorescence component with maximum 0 32 0 05 r u and minimum 0 18 0 024 r u intensities of c1 were recorded during september and december respectively on the other hand dom were enriched 0 38 0 05 r u with c2 in november and it showed the lowest abundance 0 25 0 04 r u in july it infers that the wet season with hot summer conditions favors the release of the humic like fdom in reservoirs providing the source water to the different treatment plants which was ascribed to the washout of diverse soil leaf derived organic substances from upstream catchments into water supplies mostly rivers and lakes ly et al 2015 this finding is in line with a few previous studies presenting the higher release of humic substances during the rainfall events and vice versa for the protein like component higher rainfall caused the release of dom from the deep soil with more erosion heading toward the surface water liu et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 on the other hand mild flow rate during dry season provides a perfect niche to thrive microorganisms release autochthonous dom mostly having the feature like protein contents ly et al 2017 to compare the relative changes in dom c1 c2 was determined on the average basis of the wet season july to september and dry season october to december fig 8 a significant difference in fdom composition anova p 0 001 was recorded in source and treated water between wet and dry seasons with dominant humic like and protein like constituents respectively the composition of fdom c1 c2 also corresponds to the relative abundance of c1 and c2 in the source water numerous studies have found protein like components as dominant fluorescence features than the humic like in soluble microbial products and effluent organic matter ly et al 2018 shen et al 2012 current results also provide evidence of substantial concentration of soluble microbial products or effluent organic matter in source water by presenting a lower c1 c2 ratio during dry season several studies have proved compositional variations in dom upon changing season through application of fluorescence spectroscopy size exclusion chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry by all these techniques bioploymers with large molcular weight with fluorescence featues of protein like and molecular composition with o poor aromatics were found to be abundant in dry season showing the presence of bioavialable dom liu et al 2020 shi et al 2020 so et al 2017 it is speculated that such prominent changes in dom composition could be linked with abundances of precursors in drinking water systems especially in the source water effluent organic matter have been observed to be the leading sources of precursors for ndma and other n nitrosamines ma et al 2012 wang et al 2011 few of the n nitrosamines specifically ndma ndm fp have shown direct association with fdom composition and concentration in water and wastewater treatment systems roccaro et al 2020 yang et al 2015 on the other hand a few studies have reported terrestrial humic substances as the origins for n nitrosamines after releasing amine precursors under photochemical irradiation bushaw newton and moran 1999 mitch and sedlak 2002 below are the correlations presented for the different fluorescence components and indicators to obtain any proxies for these season dependent n nitrosamines in source and treated water 3 4 correlation between n nitrosamines and spectroscopic indicators the aforementioned results proved that seasonal changes influenced n nitrosamines and fdom in water sources rainfall was found to be mostly responsible for the patterns obtained in a bid to untangle the complex relationship between a variety of parameters pca was applied to compile all the given data together with heat map for pearson correlation figs 9 and s10 the principal component 1 pc1 explained for 50 82 of the total variances while the pc2 was responsible for 16 48 of the variations fig 9 these correlations imply that the protein like component c2 possibly derived from the microbial activity and effluent organic matter in the reservoir is mostly responsible for the n nitrosamines excluding nmor and ndpha or it also potentially forms these compounds as measured in terms of ndma fp the concentrations of nmor and ndpha have been determined by humic like component and the ratio of c1 c2 which presented the overall composition change in dom a similar correlation can be found in treated water fig s10 and the above results already proved that the abundance of the n nitrosamines or the ndma fp solely depends on the influent quality and also mirrors the n nitrosamines composition the extent of correlation determined through heat map also clearly distinguished the occurrence of ndpha and nmor from the rest of n nitrosamines and provided fluorescence components c1 c2 as a fluorescence proxy these correlations indicated that organic matter from autochthonous activities in the surface water are directly linked with the n nitrosamines formation however terrestrial dom could act as proxy for a few of them e g nmor and ndpha such a noticeable difference in the concentration of these n nitrosamines nmor and ndpha with the rainfall and concurrent changes in humic like fluorescence indicated the dual effects of rainfall on source water chemistry first is the leaching of these particular n nitrosamines from the roads streets roofs pavements and parking lots meanwhile the soil erosion dom extraction from deep soil and dried leaf vegetation are second effect the rainfall could also leach n nitrosamines from improperly disposed waste and dumping sites and transport them into source water reservoirs the binding property of humic substances could also assist in the mobility of n nitrosamines it concludes from the discussion that humic substances could be an appropriate proxy for the nmor and ndpha in source water rather than a source for their generation results from this work demonstrate that seasonal dependent dom composition in source water could affect the occurrence of n nitrosamines and also provide precursors for the formation of these compounds unlike the basic water quality parameters and traditional fluorescence indices the general occurrence of n nitrosamines in source and treated water of drinking water plants could sufficiently be explained by eem parafac modeling the treated water quality is found to depend on source water unless operating parameters are regulated and tuned under seasonal variations the important implication of the study is to monitor the water quality through the fluorescence spectroscopy method and to obtain information related to carcinogenic pollutants a future broader study comprising of sampling from different climate regions is mandatory to develop a reliable relationship between these constituents this approach could also be proved as a source tracking tool to monitor the different discharges to the drinking water resources i e surface water and penetration of the groundwater furthermore such studies help to adjust the parameters of the water treatment plants with changes in seasonal to limit such compounds in treated water 4 conclusions this study investigated the occurrence of n nitrosamines in source and treated water from 10 different drinking water systems in a southern city of china the impacts of seasonal change and the presence of different dom on the abundance of n nitrosamines and ndma fp are comprehensively investigated following are the conclusions drawn from the results all n nitrosamines in source and treated water are found to be well below the guidelines the maximum levels recorded for total n nitrosamines and ndma fp in the source and treated water are 31 60 28 84 and 38 86 34 41 ng l respectively the strong linear relationship r2 0 77 p 0 001 between the total n nitrosamines and ndma fp in source and drinking water has also been found the general concentration of n nitrosamines was recorded to be low max 9 3 ng l in the wet season rainfall 456 90 106 85 mm however it increased more than two folds max 31 6 ng l in the dry season with an average rainfall of 30 54 20 24 mm ndma fp also followed a similar trend meanwhile two n nitrosamines ndpha and nmor have shown vice versa trends the eem parafac modeling provides unique trends of different fluorescence components and their relative contributions wet season was found to be favorable for humic like component and dry season released dom enriched with protein like fluorescence the calculated c1 c2 ratio was double fold 1 05 0 12 and 1 10 0 25 in wet season than dry season with a ratio of 0 55 0 11 and 0 52 0 13 in source and drinking water respectively the statistical analysis provided a correlation and insights into changes in n nitrosamines and dom among the n nitrosamines seven of these were correlated with protein like c2 fluorescence presenting their association with autochthonous dom or contamination by effluent organic matter meanwhile the dynamics of nmor and ndpha were well explained by humic like c1 fluorescence and abundance could also be determined by the ratio of humic like to protein like fluorescence c1 c2 the results of the study provided a coherence among the different n nitrosamines concentration ndma fp and fluorescence components these findings are useful in presenting the overall water quality in drinking water i e fluorescence proxies could be an useful tool for the rough estimation of n nitrosamines and precursors available to form n nitrosamines declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17763,harmful cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious environmental threat to freshwater lakes and reservoirs investigating the dynamics of toxic bloom forming cyanobacterial genus microcystis is a challenging task due to its huge spatiotemporal heterogeneity the hydroacoustic technology allows for rapid scanning of the water column synoptically and has a significant potential for rapid non invasive in situ quantification of aquatic organisms the aim of this work is to develop a reliable cost effective method for the accurate quantification of the biomass b of gas bearing cyanobacterium microcystis in water bodies using a high frequency scientific echosounder first we showed that gas bearing microcystis colonies are much stronger backscatterers than gas free phytoplanktonic algae then in the tank experiments we found a strong logarithmic relationship between the volume backscattering coefficient sv and microcystis b proxies such as microcystis bound chlorophyll a chl a micro and particle volume concentration the sv b ratio remained unchanged over a wide range of b concentrations when the same source of microcystis material was used our measurements in lake dianchi china also revealed strong logarithmic relationship between sv and chl a micro the biomass calibrated echosounder was used to study the diurnal variability of microcystis b in the lake we found a sharp increase in the cyanobacterium b and sv chl a micro ratio near the water surface during the daytime and more uniform distribution of these parameters during the nighttime we argue that the variations in b and sv chl a micro ratio could be associated with temporal changes in thermal stratification and turbulent mixing our data suggest that the sv chl a micro ratio positively correlates with i the percentage of larger colonies in population and or ii the content of free gas in cells the last properties allow microcystis colonies to attain rapid floating which enables them to concentrate at the water surface at conducive ambient conditions the sv chl a micro ratio can be a new important variable reflecting the ability of microcystis colonies to migrate vertically monitoring of this ratio may help to determine the early warning threshold for microcystis scum formation the proposed acoustic technology for in situ quantification of microcystis biomass can be a powerful tool for accurate monitoring and assessment of this cyanobacterium at high spatiotemporal resolution in water bodies graphical abstract image 1 keywords backscattering signal gas bearing cyanobacterium gas vesicle remote quantification vertical distribution surface scum 1 introduction cyanobacteria blooms have major environmental social and economic impacts in particular microcystis blooms and the associated algal toxin microcystin have been implicated in human and animal illnesses and are causing increasing worldwide concern chorus and bartram 1999 paerl and otten 2013 qin et al 2010 srivastava et al 2013 we lack a comprehensive understanding of the role of different ecological factors in the development of microcystis blooms and as a result the control of such blooms is a challenging task the development of suitable methods for monitoring cyanobacterial blooms for purposes of research and management became an important issue in recent decades anderson 2009 various physical and chemical approaches are used to quantify microcystis biomass including microscopic counting geider et al 1997 srivastava et al 2013 measurements of chlorophyll a chl a concentrations cullen 1982 iriarte et al 2007 yentsch and menzel 1963 laser particle analysers karp boss et al 2007 li et al 2014 the flow cytometer method wang et al 2014 wert et al 2013 and satellite remote sensing kahru 1997 wu et al 2015 despite this there is no satisfactory method for fast and accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal organization of cyanobacterial blooms for instance microscopic counting is a widely used method for identifying phytoplankton species composition however microscopic observations are time consuming and only allow for analysis of a small number of water samples other commonly used methods such as chl a measurement laser particle analysers and flow cytometry measure proxies of microcystis biomass in limited volumes may not be able to distinguish microcystis from other phytoplankton organisms these methods are labour and time intensive thus hampering the rapid monitoring of the microcystis biomass in a dynamic and spatially heterogeneous environment in contrast satellite remote sensing may provide detailed spatial information on phytoplankton distribution over large aquatic areas but it only detects phytopigment densities in the near surface water layer at relatively large time intervals bok et al 2010 kim et al 2010 and is highly dependent on weather conditions kim et al 2018 therefore more accurate methodologies are urgently needed to monitor microcystis variability at a high spatiotemporal resolution in the entire water column over large aquatic basins contrary to the above mentioned methods acoustic remote sensing methods allow quasi synoptic surveys of large volumes of water scientific echosounders provide high resolution data on organism abundance in both space and time and have been widely used to quantify fish zooplankton huber et al 2011 simmonds and maclennan 2005 stanton et al 1994 and gas bubbles ostrovsky 2003 however acoustic methods cannot typically classify individual targets taxonomically small gas bearing fish larvae and zooplankton are strong sound scatterers and thus can be detected with scientific echosounders and acoustic doppler current profilers adcp lorke et al 2004 potiris et al 2018 recent studies showed that spatial and temporal variability of gas containing cyanobacteria could be observed with acoustic devices at ultrasonic frequencies godlewska et al 2018 hofmann and peeters 2013 to date no reliable methods have been developed for in situ acoustic quantification of bloom forming cyanobacteria and monitoring their populations microcystis similar to some other cyanobacteria contain gas vesicles gvs to regulate buoyancy and manage their position in the water column the gvs have a hollow structure and are usually shaped like rods with a diameter of approximately 100 nm the gv shell walls are composed of 2 nm thick protein molecules that make the structure rigid and enable them to sustain pressure collapse of up to 0 5 mpa walsby 1994 a recent study of frequency dependent backscattering of rod shaped gvs from cyanobacterium anabaena flos aquae revealed two resonance peaks 120 and 85 mhz which demonstrate that their acoustic behaviour is different from those of microbubbles yang et al 2017 the gvs are aggregated in gas vacuoles of irregular outline within the cell walsby 1994 while cells form colonies of different sizes and often complex shapes the presence of gas containing structures significantly increases the backscattering properties of planktonic organisms lavery et al 2007 martin et al 1996 stanton et al 1994 the acoustic properties of the microcystis colony are hard to infer from the properties of its components when scatterers are tightly packed together their scattered fields interact at particle separations less than the wavelength e g for 200 khz echosounder at distances 0 75 cm for randomly packed units the face of the cluster behaves as a pressure release surface and sound reflection takes place at this interface clay and medwin 1977 thus a scattering cross section of a small gv containing cell cell containing colony and closely spaced population of colonies do not equal the sum of cross sections of their respective components while much effort has been made to study the physical characteristics of microcystis colonies their backscattering acoustic properties are still unknown echosounder and adcp measurements made during an intense microcystis sp bloom in lake kinneret israel suggested that the presence of gvs in cells make this cyanobacterium acoustically visible which also allows for observing its spatiotemporal variability and vertical migrations ostrovsky et al 2017 2018 to thoroughly examine the possibility to quantify the cyanobacterial biomass with an echosounder we carried out intensive measurements of acoustic backscattering signal at different concentrations of the cyanobacteria in an outdoor tank and a lake the main aims of this study were 1 to investigate the relationship between the acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis and its biomass under controlled experimental conditions and in the field 2 to elaborate a simple cost effective acoustic method for high resolution quantitative in situ monitoring and accurate investigations of the spatiotemporal variability of microcystis in water bodies 3 to demonstrate the advantages of the acoustic technology based on 24 h observations on lake dianchi 2 materials and methods 2 1 measurements design and instrumentation acoustic data were collected with a simrad ey60 scientific echosounder equipped with a 200 khz narrow beam 7 transducer es200 7 the system was used to measure the acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis colonies in an outdoor experimental tank the guanqiao field station wuhan china and lake dianchi kunming china the main purposes of the tank experiments were 1 to evaluate the contribution of gvs to a microcystis colony backscattering signal and 2 to quantify the relationships between the acoustic backscattering signal and microcystis sp abundance over a wide range of biomasses we used chl a concentration and particle volume concentration pvc as common biomass proxies first we compared the acoustic backscattering signal from intact microcystis colonies versus that of colonies with collapsed in cell gvs after exposure to critical collapse pressure in the experimental tank at a given biomass concentration the measurements were carried out on microcystis of chl a concentrations of 53 μg l 1 and 55 μg l 1 for cells with intact and with collapsed gvs respectively from the same source to collapse the gvs in the cells the microcystis collected from the pond were placed in a steel chamber and exposed for 1 min under high pressure of 0 7 mpa that exceeds the critical collapse pressure of gvs this method has been used to study the mechanical properties of microcystis walsby 1991 the gv collapse was verified using a transmission electron microscope ht 770 hitachi japan next we investigated the relationship between the backscattering signal of microcystis containing intact gvs and biomass concentration in the tank experiments we used the microcystis material collected from the same pond in these tests further in lake dianchi we studied the in situ relationship between the backscattering signal and the biomass of phytoplankton with microcystis sp being the predominant species the concurrent acoustic and biological samplings were carried out in the field over 24 h 2 2 acoustic considerations measurements and data processing small aquatic organisms e g plankton aggregate at specific strata and the reflected sound from these organisms is observed as a scattering layer on the echogram of an echosounder iida et al 1996 the volume density n ind m 3 of echo reflecting objects e g fish gas bubbles plankton can be estimated using the echo integration method simmonds and maclennan 2005 ostrovsky et al 2008 macaulay et al 2018 1 n sv σbs where sv is the volume backscattering coefficient m2 m 3 and σbs is the mean backscattering cross section m2 taking the mean weight biovolume of individuals w into account one can relate the biomass concentration b nw of these organisms to sv 2 b sv σbs w the denominator σbs w β is a scaling factor for sv translation into the biomass biovolume if the mean σbs and w are constants at given conditions the denominator in 2 is also constant then the biomass of planktonic organisms is directly proportional to sv iida et al 1996 and the sv b ratio is the constant β with the volume backscattering strength sv db re 1 m 10 log sv the relationship between sv and b takes the following form 3 sv 10 log b 10 log β in practice the linear regression between sv and log b can be calculated assuming that sv a log b c where a and c are the parameters if a is equal or close to 10 then the sv b ratio is the constant if the correlation between these variables is strong and a significantly differs from 10 the sv b ratio varies with b and the power relationship can be used to approximate the relationship between sv and b sv β ba 10 in the last case sv b b a 10 1 in this study the biomass concentration b is represented by chl a concentration or pvc note that the scaling factor β σbs w depends on the echo reflecting properties σbs of the specific target e g microcystis colony and its weight equivalent e g biovolume chl a concentration in turn the σbs may also depend on the amount of gvs per colony biovolume while chl a concentration may vary with species and ambient conditions e g light nutrient availability thus the actual relationship between sv and b may vary with location and time the presence of gas in small planktonic organisms makes them acoustically contrast with a much stronger backscattering signal than gas free organisms hofmann and peeters 2013 therefore one can expect that sv of gas bearing microcystis colonies in the water column should be correlated to their biomass or one of the biomass proxies e g chl a or biovolume concentration ostrovsky et al 2018 for a 200 khz transducer used in this study the wavelength is 7 5 mm which is much larger than the typical diameter of microcystis colonies 40 500 μm in our study see below fig 2 this causes rayleigh or resonant scattering by colonies urick 1967 the σbs for a particle in the rayleigh regime is proportional to the sixth power of the particle diameter and is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength the latter means that larger particles have much greater σbs than smaller ones and that echosounders at higher acoustic frequency have superior sensitivity to smaller particles the higher the frequency of the echosounder the shorter the obtainable range due to increased signal attenuation ostrovsky et al 2008 the nearfield distance i e the distance between the transducer and the closest measurable range ona and mitson 1996 was 0 59 m for a 200 khz transducer at a maximum range of 3 m and pulse duration of 0 128 ms used the near boundary dead zone where sv cannot be assessed was calculated as pulse length multiplied by sound velocity and divided by 2 ona and mitson 1996 was 0 1 m the data were collected at sampling rates of 10 pings s 1 the lower threshold for data collection was set to 100 db a minimum scattering strength of 35 db was chosen for boundary detection bottom or water surface prior to the start of each sampling campaign the echosounder was calibrated with a 13 7 mm diameter standard copper sphere foote 1982 the acoustic data were collected concurrently with water samples taken by siphons for ground truthing and microcystis biomass assessment all collected acoustic data were stored on a computer and later processed using the echoview software version 8 0 myriax pty ltd hobart tasmania australia which automatically compensates the received echo depending on the range r m by the time varied gain tvg a 20 log10 r tvg is applied during the process of echo integration the acoustic data were collected over 5 6 min intervals adjacent to or coinciding with the time of water column sampling for microcystis ground truthing as detailed below 2 3 outdoor tank experiment the experiments were conducted at the guanqiao field station wuhan china in an outdoor plastic cylindrical tank with a 2 m diameter and 2 m height fig 1 on 18th may 2017 the tank was filled with tap water a day before the measurements to allow the chlorine to dissipate the water temperatures during the experiment were 21 24 c a downward oriented transducer was positioned a couple of centimetres below the water surface at the tank centre first we performed acoustic measurements in the tank in pure tap water to determine the background noise caused mainly by the reverberation of the emitted echo signal prior to the introduction of the microcystis colonies we experimentally selected two depths of 1 2 0 1 m and 1 6 0 1 m where the noise level was minimal measurements in these layers allowed us to minimize the acoustic threshold for microcystis detection in the tank the estimated noise level see below was subtracted from the measured backscattering signals obtained for various microcystis concentrations further we measured sv of six microcystis concentrations produced in the tank microcystis used for the experiments were collected with a bolting silk plankton net mesh size 64 μm from a pond located close to the tank coarse debris of organic particles was removed by filtering through a 300 μm mesh microscopic examination showed that microcystis colonies contributed to more than 98 of the total phytoplankton biovolume in our experiments six different concentrations of microcystis colonies were produced by adding the mesh concentrated material in the tank each increasing concentration of microcystis was approximately double the preceding one after each addition of the concentrated microcystis material the water in the tank was mixed to homogeneously disperse the colonies throughout the water column after each mixing procedure the downward oriented transducer was centred so that the acoustic beam was directed along the central tank axis to avoid the possible effect of the enhanced turbulence induced during the water mixing on the backscattering signal orr et al 2000 the acoustic data collection was started 10 min after mixing acoustic data were collected over 6 min 3600 pings the data were binned into 100 ping segments resulting in 36 data points per sampling depth for each cyanobacterium concentration the chl a concentrations and pvc in the tank water serve as the ground truth for acoustic measurements at each microcystis concentration water samples were siphoned via 8 mm silicone tubes positioned along the inner tank wall as far as possible from the acoustic beam thus minimizing possible interference the samples were collected into plastic jars after removal of three volumes of tube water from each sampling depth the collected samples were kept on ice brought to the laboratory and analysed within 2 h after sampling the water samples collected from the tank were analysed for chl a concentration using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 the 500 ml water subsamples were filtered through whatman glass microfiber filters grade gf c 1 2 μm chl a was extracted with 5 ml of 90 acetone in darkness at 4 c after 24 h the extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm after extraction the absorbance was measured at 630 663 750 and 645 nm the total chl a was determined using the method described by yentsch and menzel 1963 sample signals were calibrated with a chl a standard sigma aldrich c6144 all measurements were carried out in duplicate laser in situ scattering and transmissometry lisst 200x manufactured by sequoia scientific inc was used for measuring pvcs to calibrate the instrument the background scattering measurements were acquired using deionized water and the resulting plot was compared with the manufacturer s calibration for pvc measurements in the water samples we followed the protocol suggested by karp boss et al 2007 the data were recorded at 1 hz sampling rate in water subsamples for 2 min 120 measurements without stirring to avoid damaging the microcystis colonies and to minimize their possible upward migration the raw data were further analysed at non spherical mode using the lisst sop 200x program and presented as mean pvc μl l 1 the instrument provides pvc in 36 logarithmically increasing size bins ranging from 1 μm to 500 μm the colony size distribution measured with the lisst 200x showed that the diameters of prevailing colonies which contribute the most to the total volume concentration were in the range between 40 μm and 150 μm fig 2a 2 4 field measurements the field data were collected in the shallow eutrophic lake dianchi kunming where microcystis sp was the dominant phytoplankton species at the time of sampling 16 17 july 2017 water depth at the sampling site was 3 2 m acoustic data were collected continuously for 24 h at a rate of 10 pings per second with an upward oriented transducer positioned at the bottom of the lake the level of passive noise without sound transmission was measured and then subtracted from the backscattering signal to reduce ambient noise to obtain accurate sv values from microcystis related echoes the signals from large objects fish and gas bubbles rising from the bottom were automatically removed using the object detection algorithm in the echoview software fig 3 the remaining data were averaged and used to compute the mean sv and standard deviation sd of particulate material mainly gas bearing microcystis colonies the acoustic data were binned into 100 ping time segments and 0 1 m depth segments to match the centres of specific acoustic bins to the water sampling locations the 24 h continuous acoustic sampling in lake dianchi was accompanied by the ground truth measurements that included water sampling of chl a for laboratory analysis the water sampling was started at 10 00 a m on july 16 2017 and continued at 3 h intervals the samples were collected from water depths ranging from 0 2 m to 2 0 m at 0 2 m intervals resulting in ten sampling depths per time the water samples were kept on ice in darkness for 4 h prior to measuring the chl a concentration to compare the acoustic measurements with chl a concentration at each sampling time a 5 min 3000 pings fragment of the acoustic record was selected and processed by the echoview the chl a concentration in lake samples was measured using a multiple excitation wavelength phytoplankton photosynthesis analyzer phyto pam ii walz heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany the instrument distinguishes four algal groups cyanobacteria green algae diatoms dinoflagellates and phycoerythrin containing algae according to their characteristic absorbance spectra for their different antenna pigments at five excitation wavelengths 440 480 540 590 and 625 nm beecraft et al 2017 reference spectra measured for chlorella vulgaris and cyclotella sp as representatives of the green group chlorophytes and brown group diatoms dinoflagellates chrysophytes cryptophytes signals respectively were used throughout for the blue group most cyanobacteria we used the spectrum of the microscopically defined dominant cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa subsamples of 3 ml each in duplicate were transferred to a dark incubator for in vivo chl a fluorescence measurement the phytowin v2 13 software was then used to translate the recorded fluorescence responses of the various phytoplankton groups into the relative amount of each group in terms of chl a equivalent μg chl a l 1 the total chl a chl a tot concentration was used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass the chl a concentration belonging to the blue group chl a micro was used as a proxy for microcystis biomass an example of particle size distributions measured with the lisst 200x in the near surface water of lake dianchi on 16th july 2017 is presented in fig 2b note that the lisst measurements could overestimate the volume concentration of microcystis colonies as 20 of chl a was attributed to non microcystis phytoplankton see below since microcystis colonies are notably larger than other algae only smaller size bins would be affected fig 2 shows that in lake dianchi the contribution of large 150 μm colonies to the total volume concentration of all colonies particles 31 6 were 21 times higher than in the tank experiments 1 5 because the proportion of smaller microcystis colonies in the lake dianchi water sample could be overestimated the real contribution of the larger colonies could be even higher 3 results 3 1 tank experiment results first we compared the backscattering signals from microcystis colonies containing intact gvs and colonies exposed to high pressure which collapses their gvs the gv collapse was verified by examination under an electron microscope fig 4 a b comparison of the acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis with intact and with collapsed gvs showed a dramatic difference in backscattering signals fig 4 c d the microcystis cells containing intact gvs had a mean sv of 63 9 0 7 db the mean sv for cells with collapsed gvs was much weaker 75 1 0 2 db and was very similar to the mean background noise level in the tank of 76 5 0 2 db fig 5 which hindered the precise estimation of sv for microcystis with collapsed gvs our results show that gvs are the main source of acoustic backscattering signal of gas bearing microcystis in addition we measured the backscattering signals from green algae and diatoms with similar chl a concentration of 50 μg chl a l 1 under the same experimental conditions the estimated sv values of these algae which do not contain free gas in their cells were similar to the background level i e the actual backscattering signal was undetectable under these experimental conditions further we investigated the relationship between the sv of microcystis colonies with intact gvs and microcystis biomass for six concentrations this allowed us to compute regressions between sv and two widely used cyanobacteria biomass proxies chl a concentration and pvc the determined background noise level sv and selected 5 db signal to noise ratio limited the low range of measured microcystis concentrations to 6 μg chl a l 1 and pvc to 9 μl l 1 for the tank measurements the data above these limits are shown in fig 6 the results demonstrate a highly correlated logarithmic relationship between these variables for chl a concentrations ranging from 6 μg chl a l 1 to 107 μg chl a l 1 the empirical relationship between sv and log chl a can be described by the following equation r2 0 973 p 0 001 4 sv 9 86 0 50 log chl a 80 39 0 78 or 4a sv 9 15 10 9 chl a 0 986 0 050 hereafter the regression coefficients are shown as the mean standard error for pvc ranging from 9 μl l 1 to 280 μl l 1 the empirical relationship between sv and pvc can be described by the following equation r2 0 940 p 0 001 5 sv 8 82 0 52 log pvc 81 51 0 97 or 5a sv 7 06 10 9 pvc 0 882 0 050 the power indices in eqn 4a and eqn 5a are 1 this suggests that the relationships between sv and chl a as well as between sv and pvc can be also approximated by linear equations see section 2 2 indicating that the sv chl a and sv pvc ratios do not change significantly with microcystis concentration under experimental conditions 3 2 field measurements in lake dianchi the acoustic sampling was accompanied by the quantification of chl a concentration in water samples using a phyto pam ii that allows us to distinguish between total chl a chl a tot and cyanobacteria bound chl a at the time of our field measurements microcystis was the predominant cyanobacterium species in the lake therefore the last variable can be attributed to microcystis bound chl a concentration chl a micro the chl a tot varied vertically showing maximum values near the water surface and the lowest values near the bottom fig 7 a the percentage of chl a micro relative to chl a tot reached 80 93 in the upper 0 6 m stratum and decreased with depth down to 23 46 close to the bottom fig 7b as a result the chl a micro concentrations were 4 5 times higher in the upper water stratum than near the bottom which is characteristic of the vertical distribution of buoyant cyanobacteria during low water turbulence e g hozumi et al 2020 the relationship between chl a tot and chl a micro computed for the entire water column can be expressed by the following equation r2 0 991 p 0 001 6 chl a tot 13 6 0 6 0 99 0 01 chl a micro the slope coefficient in eqn 6 is 1 thus chl a tot can be presented as a simple sum of chl a micro and a constant of 13 6 μg chl a l 1 which can be attributed to chl a associated with other algae not cyanobacteria this depicts the principal difference between the vertical distributions of microcystis sp and other phytoplankton species in the water column which should be taken into account when analysing the relationship between the backscattering signal from gas bearing microcystis and chl a tot the latter can be illustrated by two in situ relationships sv vs chl a tot and sv vs chl a micro fig 8 for a broad range of chl a tot concentrations 14 μg chl a l 1 to 179 μg chl a l 1 the relationship between sv and chl a tot can be described by the following equation r2 0 834 p 0 001 7 sv 19 16 1 04 log chl a tot 91 20 1 67 or 7a sv 7 58 10 10 chl a tot 1 92 0 10 for a broad range of chl a micro concentrations 4 μg chl a l 1 to 167 μg chl a l 1 the relationship between sv and chl a micro can be described by the following equation r2 0 872 p 0 001 8 sv 12 78 0 59 log chl a micro 78 00 0 84 or 8a sv 1 58 10 8 chl a micro 1 28 0 06 the correlation coefficients were significantly high for both regressions however taking into account that gas bearing microcystis alone could contribute to the acoustic backscattering strength see above only eqn 8 should be viable in contrast eqn 7 is biased due to the presence of acoustically transparent algae that contributed to chl a tot the large difference in the percentage of chl a micro in chl a tot in various strata see above influenced the slope in eqn 7a remarkably the power index in eqn 8a is much closer to one than that in eqn 7a so that the sv chl a micro ratio in lake dianchi just slightly increased with chl a micro i e toward the water surface the low variability of this ratio concurs with the steadiness of the sv chl a ratio in the tank experiments thus our measurements carried out in both tank experiments and field surveys showed a high correlation between backscattering strength versus microcystis bound chl a concentration the results obtained in experimental conditions and in situ suggest that the volume backscattering coefficient per unit of microcystis biomass have little variance at given conditions still the sv values at specific chl a micro concentrations in lake dianchi eqn 8 were 6 9 db higher than those computed for the same concentrations of chl a in tank experiments eqn 4 such a notable difference indicates that acoustic backscattering response per unit of microcystis biomass can vary between locations and may be attributed to site specific or time specific properties of species strains resulting from adaptations to given ambient conditions likewise the difference in regression coefficients at various locations or conditions suggests that specific relationships should be estimated in each case to allow for accurate quantification of the spatiotemporal variability of microcystis biomass based on acoustic measurements examples of echograms and corresponding fragments of vertical distributions of chl a micro concentrations in lake dianchi during two 10 min sampling periods are presented in fig 9 the data show explicit vertical heterogeneity in microcystis distribution in the water column with the highest concentrations in the upper 1 m stratum during both sampling periods at 01 25 the chl a micro concentrations were noticeably lower than at 18 20 in the same strata thus the data illustrates high spatiotemporal variability of microcystis biomass which can be caused by lateral transport of cyanobacterium patches with currents and or vertical migrations of colonies the diurnal dynamics of sv in the water column recorded continuously over 24 h in lake dianchi is shown in fig 10 a the corresponding dynamics of microcystis bound chl a concentrations calculated based on sv using eqn 8 are presented in fig 10b the results show that below 0 6 m the microcystis bound chl a concentration sharply decreased with depth during the daytime such that concentrations of chl a micro near the water surface were 3 6 times higher than near the lake bottom in contrast the microcystis colonies were more uniformly distributed in the water column in the nighttime during the nighttime the near surface chl a micro was much lower compared to the daytime thus our observations revealed large vertical variations and day night differences in microcystis biomass 4 discussion 4 1 acoustic response of microcystis sp the results of the tank experiments showed that the backscattering signal of gas bearing microcystis colonies was much stronger than the signal received from colonies with collapsed gvs this indicates that the gvs are responsible for microcystis strong backscattering response which makes this cyanobacterium acoustically visible at ultrasonic frequencies high acoustic visibility of gas bearing invertebrates to echosounders at ultrasound frequencies has been previously demonstrated for instance for some planktonic organisms such as siphonophora warren 2001 and chaoborus flavicans lorke et al 2004 wood and gartner 2010 showed that the backscattering signal measured with adcp at 614 khz was primarily associated with the presence of the cyanobacterium aphanizomenon flos aquae which has gv containing cells a high acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis was reported at lake kinneret ostrovsky et al 2017 2018 cherin et al 2017 studied the acoustic properties of halobacterium salinarum containing gvs and characterized them as a unique class of biologically derived ultrasound contrast agents to date there are a limited number of publications where gas bearing planktonic organisms were studied using acoustic techniques ostrovsky et al 2017 2018 godlewska et al 2018 our results show that the presence of gas structures in microcystis cells enables us to instrumentally distinguish this cyanobacterium from gas free phytoplankton and to quantify its biomass 4 2 relationship between microcystis biomass and its backscattering signal the high correlation between sv and log b obtained during the tank experiments and field measurements demonstrates that a backscattering signal can be used as a measure of microcystis biomass and enables spatiotemporal variability mapping of this cyanobacterium implementation of acoustic techniques is also suggested for evaluating the spatial distribution of the buoyant cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens hofmann and peeters 2013 with a wide range of biomass concentrations from diluting the concentrated microcystis material analysis of the parameters of the regression equations obtained during controlled tank experiments showed that the slope coefficient in the sv log b regression was equal or close to 10 meaning that sv b ratio was almost unvarying the direct calculations of sv chl a and sv pvc ratios showed very low variability 8 9e 09 0 6e 09 and 4 5e 09 0 4e 09 respectively this indicates that the acoustic properties of microcystis colonies of the same origin the material was taken from a nearby pond and size distribution were practically unvarying over a wide range of concentrations and thus sv can be an accurate measure of microcystis bound chl a and volume concentration of colonies our analysis of in situ measurements in lake dianchi demonstrated that the sv chl a tot ratio varied significantly with chl a tot and in accordance with eqn 7a sv chl a tot chl a tot 0 92 thus a distinct increase in sv chl a tot ratio with chl a tot occurred in the water column due to a concurrent increase in chl a tot and the percentage of microcystis in the total phytoplankton biomass chl a micro chl a tot ratio towards the water surface such a change can be easier to understand taking into account that both gas bearing microcystis and gas free phytoplankton contribute to the chl a tot while the contribution of the second group to sv is negligible this indicates that the observed variations of the sv chl a tot ratio in lake dianchi is biased in contrast the sv chl a micro ratio altered in situ to a lesser extent and in accordance with eqn 8a sv chl a micro chl a micro 0 28 this ratio was less dependent on microcystis biomass in lake dianchi and is in a better agreement with the results obtained in the tank experiments where almost the same ratio was characteristic for a wide range of microcystis concentrations the sv chl a micro ratio measured in the upper part of lake dianchi 7 6e 08 was 8 5 times higher than in the tank 8 9e 09 to which the colonies were delivered from a small pond such a large dissimilarity may be attributed to the difference in gv content across species strains gao et al 2016 mlouka et al 2004 the occurrence of gvs in cells strongly affects microcystis acoustic properties as demonstrated in our tank experiments carried out on colonies with intact and with collapsed gvs the concentration of the gvs in cells depends on available light nutrients and other ambient parameters deacon and walsby 1990 oliver and walsby 1984 pfeifer 2012 and therefore can vary in different water bodies the larger proportion of gvs in colonies makes them more buoyant allowing them to remain in the illuminated upper part of the water column even at a moderate level of turbulence wallace et al 2000 walsby 1994 wu and kong 2009 moreover the higher percentage of larger colonies in lake dianchi compared to the tank pond fig 2 could be also responsible for greater scattering efficiency of the colonies and higher sv chl a micro ratio the latter can be explained as in the rayleigh scattering regime valid for particles that are small enough compared to the wavelengths the scattering cross section increases proportionally to the particle radius to the sixth power section 2 2 the presence of larger colonies in the relatively large and more turbulent lake should be beneficial for the microcystis population as large colonies may overcome the low and even moderate turbulence level more readily than smaller ones and rise more rapidly to the water surface hozumi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 where the higher light intensity supports a higher photosynthetic rate thus the difference in the sv chl a micro ratios could reflect the adaptations of the cyanobacterium populations to specific mixing conditions in different water bodies in shallow lake dianchi the mean sv chl a micro ratio in the upper stratum 7 6e 08 was about twice higher than that in the near bottom stratum 3 8e 08 we also observed a distinct temporal variation in the ratio in the upper layer where the high values of the ratio 6e 08 were detected in a sunny day at low wind disturbance at which colonies could float up and concentrate in the upper 0 5 m layer fig 10b the daytime increase in the sv chl a micro ratio near the water surface can mostly be explained by an increase in the proportion of large particles fig 2 that are capable to rise in the water column in the deeper stratum 1 5 m the low the sv chl a micro ratios 4e 08 remained almost unchanged over the 24 h period our results show that the accumulation of buoyant colonies near the water surface can be monitored by measuring the sv chl a micro ratio we suggest that the upper limit of the ratio detected in the deeper stratum 4e 08 in lake dianchi can be taken as a rough estimate of the early warning threshold for microcystis surface scum formation i e the values exceeding this threshold may indicate accumulation of large buoyant colonies near the water surface with further development of surface scum at proper conditions since the sv chl a micro ratio can be species strain specific and depend on various factors the threshold has to be determined for each case thus the sv chl a micro ratio can be used to predict the microcystis surface scum formation which is a harmful phenomenon considered by the world health organization as a high risk factor chorus et al 2000 4 3 remarks on acoustic quantification of microcystis biomass direct high resolution observations on dynamics and distribution of cyanobacterial biomass in natural waters are limited because of the lack of proper methods allowing remotely and rapidly quantify the biomass of these highly variable organisms in contrast modelling and experimental methods have been largely used to study the role of multiple factors and processes in the formation of the cyanobacterial blooms e g visser et al 1997 hajdu et al 2007 chien et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 the hydroacoustic methodology enables rapid high resolution synoptic scanning of the entire water column and quantification of spatiotemporal changes of microcystis biomass for instance our hydroacoustic observations on microcystis dynamics in lake dianchi fig 10b show that high concentration of microcystis near the water surface occurred during the daytime at warm windless conditions at which the vertical stability of the water column increases studies on lake kinneret have shown that the strengthening of diurnal stratification leads to turbulence reduction in the subsurface layers that in turn facilitate the upward migration of buoyant microcystis colonies hozumi et al 2020 ostrovsky et al 2018 in contrast more uniform vertical distribution of the cyanobacteria during the nighttime in lake dianchi could be caused by the enlarged turbulent mixing due to night cooling of the water surface these findings agree with an experimental study on upward migration of microcystis colonies wu et al 2020 and with direct in situ observations on vertical dynamics of the buoyant colonies at various turbulent conditions in a large lake hozumi et al 2020 remarkedly the vertically integrated microcystis biomass measured at one sampling station on lake dianchi varied by more than one order of magnitude over a 24 h period this suggests the presence of microcystis patches with varying densities and their horizontal transport in the lake thus our acoustic observations on microcystis dynamics in lake dianchi illustrate the great potential of the acoustic technology in the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas bearing cyanobacteria a common disadvantage of existing acoustic methods is the inability to distinguish sound scattering objects therefore parallel measurements for verification of acoustic signals are needed to obtain reliable information on objects of interest for instance concurrent use of acoustic sampling with in situ multi spectral fluoroprobe vertical profiling allowed discrimination of gas bearing cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens from other phytoplankton species hofmann and peeters 2013 measurements of excitation spectra of chlorophyll fluorescence which can be used to differentiate between algal spectral groups beutler et al 2002 and discriminate phytoplankton groups based on their size spectra anglès et al 2008 falkowski et al 1998 hood et al 2006 karp boss et al 2007 can complement acoustic sampling quantification of the relationship between acoustic backscattering signals and biomass proxies should be done with caution our study showed that the relationship between sv and chl a tot can be biased if high volumes of acoustically transparent algae are present in the water as algae will contribute only to the chl a tot but not to sv the variability of the sv chl a micro ratio in different water bodies suggests that the sv chl a micro relationship should be quantified for each specific case in order to estimate the microcystis biomass accurately using the acoustic techniques such a calibration of sv versus microcystis biomass is a simple and quick procedure high frequency adcps can also be used for the semi quantitative assessment of the distribution and dynamics of gas bearing planktonic organisms lorke et al 2004 however these instruments have comparative disadvantages to scientific echosounders such as noisier acoustic signal coarser vertical resolution sv is provided in relative units and the instruments require careful calibration e g deines 1999 the time series measurements of sv could greatly benefit from the concurrent acquisition of other water column parameters e g temperature dissolved oxygen ph and meteorological data e g wind speed solar radiation surface temperature such information has allowed for the investigation of vertical migrations of various aquatic organisms in response to external forcing rubio rodríguez et al 2018 ostrovsky et al 2018 lorke et al 2004 long term acoustic sampling together with concurrent measurement of abiotic and biotic components can be done at one or more fixed stations or during motile surveys from research vessels the use of in situ automatic high frequency monitoring systems the package of different monitoring instruments in combination with a scientific echosounder or adcps enables study of the distribution and migration of aquatic organisms at a high vertical and temporal resolution as well as revealing the seasonal and basin scale changes marce et al 2016 deployment of such monitoring systems at different lake locations can help to obtain detailed lake wide information on harmful cyanobacterial bloom dynamics the motile acoustic surveys permit the study of the horizontal variability of cyanobacteria in spatially heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems and the identification of micro and mesoscale perturbations which influence phytoplankton patchiness due to its simplicity and robustness acoustic quantification of microcystis biomass can be widely used for both monitoring and research purposes thus acoustic observations of cyanobacteria biomass with high spatial and temporal resolution could prove valuable for better understanding the role of various factors and processes influencing the microcystis bloom and surface scum formation in inland water bodies 5 conclusions 5 1 the gas bearing microcystis colonies are strong backscatterers at ultrasound frequencies this property is related to the presence of gas vesicles in cells 5 2 in tank experiment we found a strong logarithmic relationship between the volume backscattering coefficient sv and microcystis biomass b proxies such as chl a concentration and colony volume concentration the sv b ratio remained unchanged over a wide range of biomass concentrations when the same source of microcystis material was used 5 3 our measurements in lake dianchi also reveal strong logarithmic relationships between sv and the microcystis bound chl a concentration chl a micro however the sv chl a micro ratio was not constant 5 4 the biomass calibrated echosounder allowed us to monitor the diurnal spatiotemporal dynamics of microcystis b with high vertical and temporal resolutions the observed changes in vertical distributions of microcystis b were apparently associated with temporal variations in thermal stratification and turbulence level 5 5 in lake dianchi the sv chl a micro ratio varied temporally and vertically with higher values near the water surface our data suggest that the sv chl a micro ratio positively correlates with i the content of free gas in cells and ii the percentage of larger colonies in population 5 6 an increase in b and sv chl a micro ratio at the water surface reflects the accumulation of large buoyant colonies that may forebode the formation of surface scum in conducive weather conditions we argue that monitoring of this ratio may help to determine the early warning threshold for microcystis scum formation 5 7 the proposed acoustic technology for in situ quantification of microcystis biomass can be a powerful tool for accurate monitoring and assessment of this cyanobacterium at high spatiotemporal resolution in water bodies author contributions ilia ostrovsky and lirong song

17763,harmful cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious environmental threat to freshwater lakes and reservoirs investigating the dynamics of toxic bloom forming cyanobacterial genus microcystis is a challenging task due to its huge spatiotemporal heterogeneity the hydroacoustic technology allows for rapid scanning of the water column synoptically and has a significant potential for rapid non invasive in situ quantification of aquatic organisms the aim of this work is to develop a reliable cost effective method for the accurate quantification of the biomass b of gas bearing cyanobacterium microcystis in water bodies using a high frequency scientific echosounder first we showed that gas bearing microcystis colonies are much stronger backscatterers than gas free phytoplanktonic algae then in the tank experiments we found a strong logarithmic relationship between the volume backscattering coefficient sv and microcystis b proxies such as microcystis bound chlorophyll a chl a micro and particle volume concentration the sv b ratio remained unchanged over a wide range of b concentrations when the same source of microcystis material was used our measurements in lake dianchi china also revealed strong logarithmic relationship between sv and chl a micro the biomass calibrated echosounder was used to study the diurnal variability of microcystis b in the lake we found a sharp increase in the cyanobacterium b and sv chl a micro ratio near the water surface during the daytime and more uniform distribution of these parameters during the nighttime we argue that the variations in b and sv chl a micro ratio could be associated with temporal changes in thermal stratification and turbulent mixing our data suggest that the sv chl a micro ratio positively correlates with i the percentage of larger colonies in population and or ii the content of free gas in cells the last properties allow microcystis colonies to attain rapid floating which enables them to concentrate at the water surface at conducive ambient conditions the sv chl a micro ratio can be a new important variable reflecting the ability of microcystis colonies to migrate vertically monitoring of this ratio may help to determine the early warning threshold for microcystis scum formation the proposed acoustic technology for in situ quantification of microcystis biomass can be a powerful tool for accurate monitoring and assessment of this cyanobacterium at high spatiotemporal resolution in water bodies graphical abstract image 1 keywords backscattering signal gas bearing cyanobacterium gas vesicle remote quantification vertical distribution surface scum 1 introduction cyanobacteria blooms have major environmental social and economic impacts in particular microcystis blooms and the associated algal toxin microcystin have been implicated in human and animal illnesses and are causing increasing worldwide concern chorus and bartram 1999 paerl and otten 2013 qin et al 2010 srivastava et al 2013 we lack a comprehensive understanding of the role of different ecological factors in the development of microcystis blooms and as a result the control of such blooms is a challenging task the development of suitable methods for monitoring cyanobacterial blooms for purposes of research and management became an important issue in recent decades anderson 2009 various physical and chemical approaches are used to quantify microcystis biomass including microscopic counting geider et al 1997 srivastava et al 2013 measurements of chlorophyll a chl a concentrations cullen 1982 iriarte et al 2007 yentsch and menzel 1963 laser particle analysers karp boss et al 2007 li et al 2014 the flow cytometer method wang et al 2014 wert et al 2013 and satellite remote sensing kahru 1997 wu et al 2015 despite this there is no satisfactory method for fast and accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal organization of cyanobacterial blooms for instance microscopic counting is a widely used method for identifying phytoplankton species composition however microscopic observations are time consuming and only allow for analysis of a small number of water samples other commonly used methods such as chl a measurement laser particle analysers and flow cytometry measure proxies of microcystis biomass in limited volumes may not be able to distinguish microcystis from other phytoplankton organisms these methods are labour and time intensive thus hampering the rapid monitoring of the microcystis biomass in a dynamic and spatially heterogeneous environment in contrast satellite remote sensing may provide detailed spatial information on phytoplankton distribution over large aquatic areas but it only detects phytopigment densities in the near surface water layer at relatively large time intervals bok et al 2010 kim et al 2010 and is highly dependent on weather conditions kim et al 2018 therefore more accurate methodologies are urgently needed to monitor microcystis variability at a high spatiotemporal resolution in the entire water column over large aquatic basins contrary to the above mentioned methods acoustic remote sensing methods allow quasi synoptic surveys of large volumes of water scientific echosounders provide high resolution data on organism abundance in both space and time and have been widely used to quantify fish zooplankton huber et al 2011 simmonds and maclennan 2005 stanton et al 1994 and gas bubbles ostrovsky 2003 however acoustic methods cannot typically classify individual targets taxonomically small gas bearing fish larvae and zooplankton are strong sound scatterers and thus can be detected with scientific echosounders and acoustic doppler current profilers adcp lorke et al 2004 potiris et al 2018 recent studies showed that spatial and temporal variability of gas containing cyanobacteria could be observed with acoustic devices at ultrasonic frequencies godlewska et al 2018 hofmann and peeters 2013 to date no reliable methods have been developed for in situ acoustic quantification of bloom forming cyanobacteria and monitoring their populations microcystis similar to some other cyanobacteria contain gas vesicles gvs to regulate buoyancy and manage their position in the water column the gvs have a hollow structure and are usually shaped like rods with a diameter of approximately 100 nm the gv shell walls are composed of 2 nm thick protein molecules that make the structure rigid and enable them to sustain pressure collapse of up to 0 5 mpa walsby 1994 a recent study of frequency dependent backscattering of rod shaped gvs from cyanobacterium anabaena flos aquae revealed two resonance peaks 120 and 85 mhz which demonstrate that their acoustic behaviour is different from those of microbubbles yang et al 2017 the gvs are aggregated in gas vacuoles of irregular outline within the cell walsby 1994 while cells form colonies of different sizes and often complex shapes the presence of gas containing structures significantly increases the backscattering properties of planktonic organisms lavery et al 2007 martin et al 1996 stanton et al 1994 the acoustic properties of the microcystis colony are hard to infer from the properties of its components when scatterers are tightly packed together their scattered fields interact at particle separations less than the wavelength e g for 200 khz echosounder at distances 0 75 cm for randomly packed units the face of the cluster behaves as a pressure release surface and sound reflection takes place at this interface clay and medwin 1977 thus a scattering cross section of a small gv containing cell cell containing colony and closely spaced population of colonies do not equal the sum of cross sections of their respective components while much effort has been made to study the physical characteristics of microcystis colonies their backscattering acoustic properties are still unknown echosounder and adcp measurements made during an intense microcystis sp bloom in lake kinneret israel suggested that the presence of gvs in cells make this cyanobacterium acoustically visible which also allows for observing its spatiotemporal variability and vertical migrations ostrovsky et al 2017 2018 to thoroughly examine the possibility to quantify the cyanobacterial biomass with an echosounder we carried out intensive measurements of acoustic backscattering signal at different concentrations of the cyanobacteria in an outdoor tank and a lake the main aims of this study were 1 to investigate the relationship between the acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis and its biomass under controlled experimental conditions and in the field 2 to elaborate a simple cost effective acoustic method for high resolution quantitative in situ monitoring and accurate investigations of the spatiotemporal variability of microcystis in water bodies 3 to demonstrate the advantages of the acoustic technology based on 24 h observations on lake dianchi 2 materials and methods 2 1 measurements design and instrumentation acoustic data were collected with a simrad ey60 scientific echosounder equipped with a 200 khz narrow beam 7 transducer es200 7 the system was used to measure the acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis colonies in an outdoor experimental tank the guanqiao field station wuhan china and lake dianchi kunming china the main purposes of the tank experiments were 1 to evaluate the contribution of gvs to a microcystis colony backscattering signal and 2 to quantify the relationships between the acoustic backscattering signal and microcystis sp abundance over a wide range of biomasses we used chl a concentration and particle volume concentration pvc as common biomass proxies first we compared the acoustic backscattering signal from intact microcystis colonies versus that of colonies with collapsed in cell gvs after exposure to critical collapse pressure in the experimental tank at a given biomass concentration the measurements were carried out on microcystis of chl a concentrations of 53 μg l 1 and 55 μg l 1 for cells with intact and with collapsed gvs respectively from the same source to collapse the gvs in the cells the microcystis collected from the pond were placed in a steel chamber and exposed for 1 min under high pressure of 0 7 mpa that exceeds the critical collapse pressure of gvs this method has been used to study the mechanical properties of microcystis walsby 1991 the gv collapse was verified using a transmission electron microscope ht 770 hitachi japan next we investigated the relationship between the backscattering signal of microcystis containing intact gvs and biomass concentration in the tank experiments we used the microcystis material collected from the same pond in these tests further in lake dianchi we studied the in situ relationship between the backscattering signal and the biomass of phytoplankton with microcystis sp being the predominant species the concurrent acoustic and biological samplings were carried out in the field over 24 h 2 2 acoustic considerations measurements and data processing small aquatic organisms e g plankton aggregate at specific strata and the reflected sound from these organisms is observed as a scattering layer on the echogram of an echosounder iida et al 1996 the volume density n ind m 3 of echo reflecting objects e g fish gas bubbles plankton can be estimated using the echo integration method simmonds and maclennan 2005 ostrovsky et al 2008 macaulay et al 2018 1 n sv σbs where sv is the volume backscattering coefficient m2 m 3 and σbs is the mean backscattering cross section m2 taking the mean weight biovolume of individuals w into account one can relate the biomass concentration b nw of these organisms to sv 2 b sv σbs w the denominator σbs w β is a scaling factor for sv translation into the biomass biovolume if the mean σbs and w are constants at given conditions the denominator in 2 is also constant then the biomass of planktonic organisms is directly proportional to sv iida et al 1996 and the sv b ratio is the constant β with the volume backscattering strength sv db re 1 m 10 log sv the relationship between sv and b takes the following form 3 sv 10 log b 10 log β in practice the linear regression between sv and log b can be calculated assuming that sv a log b c where a and c are the parameters if a is equal or close to 10 then the sv b ratio is the constant if the correlation between these variables is strong and a significantly differs from 10 the sv b ratio varies with b and the power relationship can be used to approximate the relationship between sv and b sv β ba 10 in the last case sv b b a 10 1 in this study the biomass concentration b is represented by chl a concentration or pvc note that the scaling factor β σbs w depends on the echo reflecting properties σbs of the specific target e g microcystis colony and its weight equivalent e g biovolume chl a concentration in turn the σbs may also depend on the amount of gvs per colony biovolume while chl a concentration may vary with species and ambient conditions e g light nutrient availability thus the actual relationship between sv and b may vary with location and time the presence of gas in small planktonic organisms makes them acoustically contrast with a much stronger backscattering signal than gas free organisms hofmann and peeters 2013 therefore one can expect that sv of gas bearing microcystis colonies in the water column should be correlated to their biomass or one of the biomass proxies e g chl a or biovolume concentration ostrovsky et al 2018 for a 200 khz transducer used in this study the wavelength is 7 5 mm which is much larger than the typical diameter of microcystis colonies 40 500 μm in our study see below fig 2 this causes rayleigh or resonant scattering by colonies urick 1967 the σbs for a particle in the rayleigh regime is proportional to the sixth power of the particle diameter and is inversely proportional to the fourth power of wavelength the latter means that larger particles have much greater σbs than smaller ones and that echosounders at higher acoustic frequency have superior sensitivity to smaller particles the higher the frequency of the echosounder the shorter the obtainable range due to increased signal attenuation ostrovsky et al 2008 the nearfield distance i e the distance between the transducer and the closest measurable range ona and mitson 1996 was 0 59 m for a 200 khz transducer at a maximum range of 3 m and pulse duration of 0 128 ms used the near boundary dead zone where sv cannot be assessed was calculated as pulse length multiplied by sound velocity and divided by 2 ona and mitson 1996 was 0 1 m the data were collected at sampling rates of 10 pings s 1 the lower threshold for data collection was set to 100 db a minimum scattering strength of 35 db was chosen for boundary detection bottom or water surface prior to the start of each sampling campaign the echosounder was calibrated with a 13 7 mm diameter standard copper sphere foote 1982 the acoustic data were collected concurrently with water samples taken by siphons for ground truthing and microcystis biomass assessment all collected acoustic data were stored on a computer and later processed using the echoview software version 8 0 myriax pty ltd hobart tasmania australia which automatically compensates the received echo depending on the range r m by the time varied gain tvg a 20 log10 r tvg is applied during the process of echo integration the acoustic data were collected over 5 6 min intervals adjacent to or coinciding with the time of water column sampling for microcystis ground truthing as detailed below 2 3 outdoor tank experiment the experiments were conducted at the guanqiao field station wuhan china in an outdoor plastic cylindrical tank with a 2 m diameter and 2 m height fig 1 on 18th may 2017 the tank was filled with tap water a day before the measurements to allow the chlorine to dissipate the water temperatures during the experiment were 21 24 c a downward oriented transducer was positioned a couple of centimetres below the water surface at the tank centre first we performed acoustic measurements in the tank in pure tap water to determine the background noise caused mainly by the reverberation of the emitted echo signal prior to the introduction of the microcystis colonies we experimentally selected two depths of 1 2 0 1 m and 1 6 0 1 m where the noise level was minimal measurements in these layers allowed us to minimize the acoustic threshold for microcystis detection in the tank the estimated noise level see below was subtracted from the measured backscattering signals obtained for various microcystis concentrations further we measured sv of six microcystis concentrations produced in the tank microcystis used for the experiments were collected with a bolting silk plankton net mesh size 64 μm from a pond located close to the tank coarse debris of organic particles was removed by filtering through a 300 μm mesh microscopic examination showed that microcystis colonies contributed to more than 98 of the total phytoplankton biovolume in our experiments six different concentrations of microcystis colonies were produced by adding the mesh concentrated material in the tank each increasing concentration of microcystis was approximately double the preceding one after each addition of the concentrated microcystis material the water in the tank was mixed to homogeneously disperse the colonies throughout the water column after each mixing procedure the downward oriented transducer was centred so that the acoustic beam was directed along the central tank axis to avoid the possible effect of the enhanced turbulence induced during the water mixing on the backscattering signal orr et al 2000 the acoustic data collection was started 10 min after mixing acoustic data were collected over 6 min 3600 pings the data were binned into 100 ping segments resulting in 36 data points per sampling depth for each cyanobacterium concentration the chl a concentrations and pvc in the tank water serve as the ground truth for acoustic measurements at each microcystis concentration water samples were siphoned via 8 mm silicone tubes positioned along the inner tank wall as far as possible from the acoustic beam thus minimizing possible interference the samples were collected into plastic jars after removal of three volumes of tube water from each sampling depth the collected samples were kept on ice brought to the laboratory and analysed within 2 h after sampling the water samples collected from the tank were analysed for chl a concentration using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer shimadzu uv 1800 the 500 ml water subsamples were filtered through whatman glass microfiber filters grade gf c 1 2 μm chl a was extracted with 5 ml of 90 acetone in darkness at 4 c after 24 h the extracts were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm after extraction the absorbance was measured at 630 663 750 and 645 nm the total chl a was determined using the method described by yentsch and menzel 1963 sample signals were calibrated with a chl a standard sigma aldrich c6144 all measurements were carried out in duplicate laser in situ scattering and transmissometry lisst 200x manufactured by sequoia scientific inc was used for measuring pvcs to calibrate the instrument the background scattering measurements were acquired using deionized water and the resulting plot was compared with the manufacturer s calibration for pvc measurements in the water samples we followed the protocol suggested by karp boss et al 2007 the data were recorded at 1 hz sampling rate in water subsamples for 2 min 120 measurements without stirring to avoid damaging the microcystis colonies and to minimize their possible upward migration the raw data were further analysed at non spherical mode using the lisst sop 200x program and presented as mean pvc μl l 1 the instrument provides pvc in 36 logarithmically increasing size bins ranging from 1 μm to 500 μm the colony size distribution measured with the lisst 200x showed that the diameters of prevailing colonies which contribute the most to the total volume concentration were in the range between 40 μm and 150 μm fig 2a 2 4 field measurements the field data were collected in the shallow eutrophic lake dianchi kunming where microcystis sp was the dominant phytoplankton species at the time of sampling 16 17 july 2017 water depth at the sampling site was 3 2 m acoustic data were collected continuously for 24 h at a rate of 10 pings per second with an upward oriented transducer positioned at the bottom of the lake the level of passive noise without sound transmission was measured and then subtracted from the backscattering signal to reduce ambient noise to obtain accurate sv values from microcystis related echoes the signals from large objects fish and gas bubbles rising from the bottom were automatically removed using the object detection algorithm in the echoview software fig 3 the remaining data were averaged and used to compute the mean sv and standard deviation sd of particulate material mainly gas bearing microcystis colonies the acoustic data were binned into 100 ping time segments and 0 1 m depth segments to match the centres of specific acoustic bins to the water sampling locations the 24 h continuous acoustic sampling in lake dianchi was accompanied by the ground truth measurements that included water sampling of chl a for laboratory analysis the water sampling was started at 10 00 a m on july 16 2017 and continued at 3 h intervals the samples were collected from water depths ranging from 0 2 m to 2 0 m at 0 2 m intervals resulting in ten sampling depths per time the water samples were kept on ice in darkness for 4 h prior to measuring the chl a concentration to compare the acoustic measurements with chl a concentration at each sampling time a 5 min 3000 pings fragment of the acoustic record was selected and processed by the echoview the chl a concentration in lake samples was measured using a multiple excitation wavelength phytoplankton photosynthesis analyzer phyto pam ii walz heinz walz gmbh effeltrich germany the instrument distinguishes four algal groups cyanobacteria green algae diatoms dinoflagellates and phycoerythrin containing algae according to their characteristic absorbance spectra for their different antenna pigments at five excitation wavelengths 440 480 540 590 and 625 nm beecraft et al 2017 reference spectra measured for chlorella vulgaris and cyclotella sp as representatives of the green group chlorophytes and brown group diatoms dinoflagellates chrysophytes cryptophytes signals respectively were used throughout for the blue group most cyanobacteria we used the spectrum of the microscopically defined dominant cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa subsamples of 3 ml each in duplicate were transferred to a dark incubator for in vivo chl a fluorescence measurement the phytowin v2 13 software was then used to translate the recorded fluorescence responses of the various phytoplankton groups into the relative amount of each group in terms of chl a equivalent μg chl a l 1 the total chl a chl a tot concentration was used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass the chl a concentration belonging to the blue group chl a micro was used as a proxy for microcystis biomass an example of particle size distributions measured with the lisst 200x in the near surface water of lake dianchi on 16th july 2017 is presented in fig 2b note that the lisst measurements could overestimate the volume concentration of microcystis colonies as 20 of chl a was attributed to non microcystis phytoplankton see below since microcystis colonies are notably larger than other algae only smaller size bins would be affected fig 2 shows that in lake dianchi the contribution of large 150 μm colonies to the total volume concentration of all colonies particles 31 6 were 21 times higher than in the tank experiments 1 5 because the proportion of smaller microcystis colonies in the lake dianchi water sample could be overestimated the real contribution of the larger colonies could be even higher 3 results 3 1 tank experiment results first we compared the backscattering signals from microcystis colonies containing intact gvs and colonies exposed to high pressure which collapses their gvs the gv collapse was verified by examination under an electron microscope fig 4 a b comparison of the acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis with intact and with collapsed gvs showed a dramatic difference in backscattering signals fig 4 c d the microcystis cells containing intact gvs had a mean sv of 63 9 0 7 db the mean sv for cells with collapsed gvs was much weaker 75 1 0 2 db and was very similar to the mean background noise level in the tank of 76 5 0 2 db fig 5 which hindered the precise estimation of sv for microcystis with collapsed gvs our results show that gvs are the main source of acoustic backscattering signal of gas bearing microcystis in addition we measured the backscattering signals from green algae and diatoms with similar chl a concentration of 50 μg chl a l 1 under the same experimental conditions the estimated sv values of these algae which do not contain free gas in their cells were similar to the background level i e the actual backscattering signal was undetectable under these experimental conditions further we investigated the relationship between the sv of microcystis colonies with intact gvs and microcystis biomass for six concentrations this allowed us to compute regressions between sv and two widely used cyanobacteria biomass proxies chl a concentration and pvc the determined background noise level sv and selected 5 db signal to noise ratio limited the low range of measured microcystis concentrations to 6 μg chl a l 1 and pvc to 9 μl l 1 for the tank measurements the data above these limits are shown in fig 6 the results demonstrate a highly correlated logarithmic relationship between these variables for chl a concentrations ranging from 6 μg chl a l 1 to 107 μg chl a l 1 the empirical relationship between sv and log chl a can be described by the following equation r2 0 973 p 0 001 4 sv 9 86 0 50 log chl a 80 39 0 78 or 4a sv 9 15 10 9 chl a 0 986 0 050 hereafter the regression coefficients are shown as the mean standard error for pvc ranging from 9 μl l 1 to 280 μl l 1 the empirical relationship between sv and pvc can be described by the following equation r2 0 940 p 0 001 5 sv 8 82 0 52 log pvc 81 51 0 97 or 5a sv 7 06 10 9 pvc 0 882 0 050 the power indices in eqn 4a and eqn 5a are 1 this suggests that the relationships between sv and chl a as well as between sv and pvc can be also approximated by linear equations see section 2 2 indicating that the sv chl a and sv pvc ratios do not change significantly with microcystis concentration under experimental conditions 3 2 field measurements in lake dianchi the acoustic sampling was accompanied by the quantification of chl a concentration in water samples using a phyto pam ii that allows us to distinguish between total chl a chl a tot and cyanobacteria bound chl a at the time of our field measurements microcystis was the predominant cyanobacterium species in the lake therefore the last variable can be attributed to microcystis bound chl a concentration chl a micro the chl a tot varied vertically showing maximum values near the water surface and the lowest values near the bottom fig 7 a the percentage of chl a micro relative to chl a tot reached 80 93 in the upper 0 6 m stratum and decreased with depth down to 23 46 close to the bottom fig 7b as a result the chl a micro concentrations were 4 5 times higher in the upper water stratum than near the bottom which is characteristic of the vertical distribution of buoyant cyanobacteria during low water turbulence e g hozumi et al 2020 the relationship between chl a tot and chl a micro computed for the entire water column can be expressed by the following equation r2 0 991 p 0 001 6 chl a tot 13 6 0 6 0 99 0 01 chl a micro the slope coefficient in eqn 6 is 1 thus chl a tot can be presented as a simple sum of chl a micro and a constant of 13 6 μg chl a l 1 which can be attributed to chl a associated with other algae not cyanobacteria this depicts the principal difference between the vertical distributions of microcystis sp and other phytoplankton species in the water column which should be taken into account when analysing the relationship between the backscattering signal from gas bearing microcystis and chl a tot the latter can be illustrated by two in situ relationships sv vs chl a tot and sv vs chl a micro fig 8 for a broad range of chl a tot concentrations 14 μg chl a l 1 to 179 μg chl a l 1 the relationship between sv and chl a tot can be described by the following equation r2 0 834 p 0 001 7 sv 19 16 1 04 log chl a tot 91 20 1 67 or 7a sv 7 58 10 10 chl a tot 1 92 0 10 for a broad range of chl a micro concentrations 4 μg chl a l 1 to 167 μg chl a l 1 the relationship between sv and chl a micro can be described by the following equation r2 0 872 p 0 001 8 sv 12 78 0 59 log chl a micro 78 00 0 84 or 8a sv 1 58 10 8 chl a micro 1 28 0 06 the correlation coefficients were significantly high for both regressions however taking into account that gas bearing microcystis alone could contribute to the acoustic backscattering strength see above only eqn 8 should be viable in contrast eqn 7 is biased due to the presence of acoustically transparent algae that contributed to chl a tot the large difference in the percentage of chl a micro in chl a tot in various strata see above influenced the slope in eqn 7a remarkably the power index in eqn 8a is much closer to one than that in eqn 7a so that the sv chl a micro ratio in lake dianchi just slightly increased with chl a micro i e toward the water surface the low variability of this ratio concurs with the steadiness of the sv chl a ratio in the tank experiments thus our measurements carried out in both tank experiments and field surveys showed a high correlation between backscattering strength versus microcystis bound chl a concentration the results obtained in experimental conditions and in situ suggest that the volume backscattering coefficient per unit of microcystis biomass have little variance at given conditions still the sv values at specific chl a micro concentrations in lake dianchi eqn 8 were 6 9 db higher than those computed for the same concentrations of chl a in tank experiments eqn 4 such a notable difference indicates that acoustic backscattering response per unit of microcystis biomass can vary between locations and may be attributed to site specific or time specific properties of species strains resulting from adaptations to given ambient conditions likewise the difference in regression coefficients at various locations or conditions suggests that specific relationships should be estimated in each case to allow for accurate quantification of the spatiotemporal variability of microcystis biomass based on acoustic measurements examples of echograms and corresponding fragments of vertical distributions of chl a micro concentrations in lake dianchi during two 10 min sampling periods are presented in fig 9 the data show explicit vertical heterogeneity in microcystis distribution in the water column with the highest concentrations in the upper 1 m stratum during both sampling periods at 01 25 the chl a micro concentrations were noticeably lower than at 18 20 in the same strata thus the data illustrates high spatiotemporal variability of microcystis biomass which can be caused by lateral transport of cyanobacterium patches with currents and or vertical migrations of colonies the diurnal dynamics of sv in the water column recorded continuously over 24 h in lake dianchi is shown in fig 10 a the corresponding dynamics of microcystis bound chl a concentrations calculated based on sv using eqn 8 are presented in fig 10b the results show that below 0 6 m the microcystis bound chl a concentration sharply decreased with depth during the daytime such that concentrations of chl a micro near the water surface were 3 6 times higher than near the lake bottom in contrast the microcystis colonies were more uniformly distributed in the water column in the nighttime during the nighttime the near surface chl a micro was much lower compared to the daytime thus our observations revealed large vertical variations and day night differences in microcystis biomass 4 discussion 4 1 acoustic response of microcystis sp the results of the tank experiments showed that the backscattering signal of gas bearing microcystis colonies was much stronger than the signal received from colonies with collapsed gvs this indicates that the gvs are responsible for microcystis strong backscattering response which makes this cyanobacterium acoustically visible at ultrasonic frequencies high acoustic visibility of gas bearing invertebrates to echosounders at ultrasound frequencies has been previously demonstrated for instance for some planktonic organisms such as siphonophora warren 2001 and chaoborus flavicans lorke et al 2004 wood and gartner 2010 showed that the backscattering signal measured with adcp at 614 khz was primarily associated with the presence of the cyanobacterium aphanizomenon flos aquae which has gv containing cells a high acoustic backscattering signal from microcystis was reported at lake kinneret ostrovsky et al 2017 2018 cherin et al 2017 studied the acoustic properties of halobacterium salinarum containing gvs and characterized them as a unique class of biologically derived ultrasound contrast agents to date there are a limited number of publications where gas bearing planktonic organisms were studied using acoustic techniques ostrovsky et al 2017 2018 godlewska et al 2018 our results show that the presence of gas structures in microcystis cells enables us to instrumentally distinguish this cyanobacterium from gas free phytoplankton and to quantify its biomass 4 2 relationship between microcystis biomass and its backscattering signal the high correlation between sv and log b obtained during the tank experiments and field measurements demonstrates that a backscattering signal can be used as a measure of microcystis biomass and enables spatiotemporal variability mapping of this cyanobacterium implementation of acoustic techniques is also suggested for evaluating the spatial distribution of the buoyant cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens hofmann and peeters 2013 with a wide range of biomass concentrations from diluting the concentrated microcystis material analysis of the parameters of the regression equations obtained during controlled tank experiments showed that the slope coefficient in the sv log b regression was equal or close to 10 meaning that sv b ratio was almost unvarying the direct calculations of sv chl a and sv pvc ratios showed very low variability 8 9e 09 0 6e 09 and 4 5e 09 0 4e 09 respectively this indicates that the acoustic properties of microcystis colonies of the same origin the material was taken from a nearby pond and size distribution were practically unvarying over a wide range of concentrations and thus sv can be an accurate measure of microcystis bound chl a and volume concentration of colonies our analysis of in situ measurements in lake dianchi demonstrated that the sv chl a tot ratio varied significantly with chl a tot and in accordance with eqn 7a sv chl a tot chl a tot 0 92 thus a distinct increase in sv chl a tot ratio with chl a tot occurred in the water column due to a concurrent increase in chl a tot and the percentage of microcystis in the total phytoplankton biomass chl a micro chl a tot ratio towards the water surface such a change can be easier to understand taking into account that both gas bearing microcystis and gas free phytoplankton contribute to the chl a tot while the contribution of the second group to sv is negligible this indicates that the observed variations of the sv chl a tot ratio in lake dianchi is biased in contrast the sv chl a micro ratio altered in situ to a lesser extent and in accordance with eqn 8a sv chl a micro chl a micro 0 28 this ratio was less dependent on microcystis biomass in lake dianchi and is in a better agreement with the results obtained in the tank experiments where almost the same ratio was characteristic for a wide range of microcystis concentrations the sv chl a micro ratio measured in the upper part of lake dianchi 7 6e 08 was 8 5 times higher than in the tank 8 9e 09 to which the colonies were delivered from a small pond such a large dissimilarity may be attributed to the difference in gv content across species strains gao et al 2016 mlouka et al 2004 the occurrence of gvs in cells strongly affects microcystis acoustic properties as demonstrated in our tank experiments carried out on colonies with intact and with collapsed gvs the concentration of the gvs in cells depends on available light nutrients and other ambient parameters deacon and walsby 1990 oliver and walsby 1984 pfeifer 2012 and therefore can vary in different water bodies the larger proportion of gvs in colonies makes them more buoyant allowing them to remain in the illuminated upper part of the water column even at a moderate level of turbulence wallace et al 2000 walsby 1994 wu and kong 2009 moreover the higher percentage of larger colonies in lake dianchi compared to the tank pond fig 2 could be also responsible for greater scattering efficiency of the colonies and higher sv chl a micro ratio the latter can be explained as in the rayleigh scattering regime valid for particles that are small enough compared to the wavelengths the scattering cross section increases proportionally to the particle radius to the sixth power section 2 2 the presence of larger colonies in the relatively large and more turbulent lake should be beneficial for the microcystis population as large colonies may overcome the low and even moderate turbulence level more readily than smaller ones and rise more rapidly to the water surface hozumi et al 2020 wu et al 2020 where the higher light intensity supports a higher photosynthetic rate thus the difference in the sv chl a micro ratios could reflect the adaptations of the cyanobacterium populations to specific mixing conditions in different water bodies in shallow lake dianchi the mean sv chl a micro ratio in the upper stratum 7 6e 08 was about twice higher than that in the near bottom stratum 3 8e 08 we also observed a distinct temporal variation in the ratio in the upper layer where the high values of the ratio 6e 08 were detected in a sunny day at low wind disturbance at which colonies could float up and concentrate in the upper 0 5 m layer fig 10b the daytime increase in the sv chl a micro ratio near the water surface can mostly be explained by an increase in the proportion of large particles fig 2 that are capable to rise in the water column in the deeper stratum 1 5 m the low the sv chl a micro ratios 4e 08 remained almost unchanged over the 24 h period our results show that the accumulation of buoyant colonies near the water surface can be monitored by measuring the sv chl a micro ratio we suggest that the upper limit of the ratio detected in the deeper stratum 4e 08 in lake dianchi can be taken as a rough estimate of the early warning threshold for microcystis surface scum formation i e the values exceeding this threshold may indicate accumulation of large buoyant colonies near the water surface with further development of surface scum at proper conditions since the sv chl a micro ratio can be species strain specific and depend on various factors the threshold has to be determined for each case thus the sv chl a micro ratio can be used to predict the microcystis surface scum formation which is a harmful phenomenon considered by the world health organization as a high risk factor chorus et al 2000 4 3 remarks on acoustic quantification of microcystis biomass direct high resolution observations on dynamics and distribution of cyanobacterial biomass in natural waters are limited because of the lack of proper methods allowing remotely and rapidly quantify the biomass of these highly variable organisms in contrast modelling and experimental methods have been largely used to study the role of multiple factors and processes in the formation of the cyanobacterial blooms e g visser et al 1997 hajdu et al 2007 chien et al 2013 zhu et al 2018 the hydroacoustic methodology enables rapid high resolution synoptic scanning of the entire water column and quantification of spatiotemporal changes of microcystis biomass for instance our hydroacoustic observations on microcystis dynamics in lake dianchi fig 10b show that high concentration of microcystis near the water surface occurred during the daytime at warm windless conditions at which the vertical stability of the water column increases studies on lake kinneret have shown that the strengthening of diurnal stratification leads to turbulence reduction in the subsurface layers that in turn facilitate the upward migration of buoyant microcystis colonies hozumi et al 2020 ostrovsky et al 2018 in contrast more uniform vertical distribution of the cyanobacteria during the nighttime in lake dianchi could be caused by the enlarged turbulent mixing due to night cooling of the water surface these findings agree with an experimental study on upward migration of microcystis colonies wu et al 2020 and with direct in situ observations on vertical dynamics of the buoyant colonies at various turbulent conditions in a large lake hozumi et al 2020 remarkedly the vertically integrated microcystis biomass measured at one sampling station on lake dianchi varied by more than one order of magnitude over a 24 h period this suggests the presence of microcystis patches with varying densities and their horizontal transport in the lake thus our acoustic observations on microcystis dynamics in lake dianchi illustrate the great potential of the acoustic technology in the study of the spatiotemporal dynamics of gas bearing cyanobacteria a common disadvantage of existing acoustic methods is the inability to distinguish sound scattering objects therefore parallel measurements for verification of acoustic signals are needed to obtain reliable information on objects of interest for instance concurrent use of acoustic sampling with in situ multi spectral fluoroprobe vertical profiling allowed discrimination of gas bearing cyanobacterium planktothrix rubescens from other phytoplankton species hofmann and peeters 2013 measurements of excitation spectra of chlorophyll fluorescence which can be used to differentiate between algal spectral groups beutler et al 2002 and discriminate phytoplankton groups based on their size spectra anglès et al 2008 falkowski et al 1998 hood et al 2006 karp boss et al 2007 can complement acoustic sampling quantification of the relationship between acoustic backscattering signals and biomass proxies should be done with caution our study showed that the relationship between sv and chl a tot can be biased if high volumes of acoustically transparent algae are present in the water as algae will contribute only to the chl a tot but not to sv the variability of the sv chl a micro ratio in different water bodies suggests that the sv chl a micro relationship should be quantified for each specific case in order to estimate the microcystis biomass accurately using the acoustic techniques such a calibration of sv versus microcystis biomass is a simple and quick procedure high frequency adcps can also be used for the semi quantitative assessment of the distribution and dynamics of gas bearing planktonic organisms lorke et al 2004 however these instruments have comparative disadvantages to scientific echosounders such as noisier acoustic signal coarser vertical resolution sv is provided in relative units and the instruments require careful calibration e g deines 1999 the time series measurements of sv could greatly benefit from the concurrent acquisition of other water column parameters e g temperature dissolved oxygen ph and meteorological data e g wind speed solar radiation surface temperature such information has allowed for the investigation of vertical migrations of various aquatic organisms in response to external forcing rubio rodríguez et al 2018 ostrovsky et al 2018 lorke et al 2004 long term acoustic sampling together with concurrent measurement of abiotic and biotic components can be done at one or more fixed stations or during motile surveys from research vessels the use of in situ automatic high frequency monitoring systems the package of different monitoring instruments in combination with a scientific echosounder or adcps enables study of the distribution and migration of aquatic organisms at a high vertical and temporal resolution as well as revealing the seasonal and basin scale changes marce et al 2016 deployment of such monitoring systems at different lake locations can help to obtain detailed lake wide information on harmful cyanobacterial bloom dynamics the motile acoustic surveys permit the study of the horizontal variability of cyanobacteria in spatially heterogeneous aquatic ecosystems and the identification of micro and mesoscale perturbations which influence phytoplankton patchiness due to its simplicity and robustness acoustic quantification of microcystis biomass can be widely used for both monitoring and research purposes thus acoustic observations of cyanobacteria biomass with high spatial and temporal resolution could prove valuable for better understanding the role of various factors and processes influencing the microcystis bloom and surface scum formation in inland water bodies 5 conclusions 5 1 the gas bearing microcystis colonies are strong backscatterers at ultrasound frequencies this property is related to the presence of gas vesicles in cells 5 2 in tank experiment we found a strong logarithmic relationship between the volume backscattering coefficient sv and microcystis biomass b proxies such as chl a concentration and colony volume concentration the sv b ratio remained unchanged over a wide range of biomass concentrations when the same source of microcystis material was used 5 3 our measurements in lake dianchi also reveal strong logarithmic relationships between sv and the microcystis bound chl a concentration chl a micro however the sv chl a micro ratio was not constant 5 4 the biomass calibrated echosounder allowed us to monitor the diurnal spatiotemporal dynamics of microcystis b with high vertical and temporal resolutions the observed changes in vertical distributions of microcystis b were apparently associated with temporal variations in thermal stratification and turbulence level 5 5 in lake dianchi the sv chl a micro ratio varied temporally and vertically with higher values near the water surface our data suggest that the sv chl a micro ratio positively correlates with i the content of free gas in cells and ii the percentage of larger colonies in population 5 6 an increase in b and sv chl a micro ratio at the water surface reflects the accumulation of large buoyant colonies that may forebode the formation of surface scum in conducive weather conditions we argue that monitoring of this ratio may help to determine the early warning threshold for microcystis scum formation 5 7 the proposed acoustic technology for in situ quantification of microcystis biomass can be a powerful tool for accurate monitoring and assessment of this cyanobacterium at high spatiotemporal resolution in water bodies author contributions ilia ostrovsky and lirong song

three ultrasonic treatments were applied to glass and six to copper ss ms cpvc and hdpe the obtained suspensions 30 ml or 60 ml were used for microbiological and chemical analyses 2 3 microbiological analyses the atp concentration of the biofilm suspension and the feed water was measured by using a bioluminescence assay as described previously magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 biofilm suspensions from copper ms and glass ms were diluted with tap water to eliminate disturbance of the analysis by cu and fe the total cell count tcc in the biofilm suspension was incidentally measured by using acridine orange staining and epifluorescence microscopy hobbie et al 1977 the heterotrophic plate count hpc was determined by using r2a agar plates incubated at 25 c during 10 days the colony

and accumulation of cu and fe on copper ms and ss the effect of copper on biofilm formation was investigated in more detail by exposing copper mild steel ms ss cpvc and glass controls to warm and cold tap water to ensure a clean outer surface of the metallic materials capped pipe segments of about 50 cm length were placed in a 1 detergent solution and shaken overnight at room temperature sample pieces cut from these pipes were extensively washed with tap water see materials and methods copper ms and ss but not cpvc significantly enhanced biofilm formation in comparison with the glass controls in the bbm and the dbm figs 2 and 3 table 1 the biofilm formation rate bfr pg atp cm 2 d was highest on copper ms and glass ms as a result of the rapid bfc increase within 14 days fig 4 with clearly lower values on glass copper ss cpvc glass ss and glass cpvc copper showed similar bfps in the bbm and the dbm but ms had a lower bfp in the bbm table 1 the bfp on glass copper in the bbm was significantly higher than in the dbm but the bfps on glass ms did not differ significantly ss cpvc and the associated glass controls also showed higher bfps in the bbm than in the dbm total cell counts tcc of the biofilms in the bbm n 19 ranged from 1 8 106 cells cm 2 glass copper to 1 2 107 cells cm 2 copper and from 5 8 105 cells cm 2 glass copper to 1 4 107 cells cm 2 ms in the dbm n 15

biofilms 0 10 0 04 fg atp cell 1 hpc values on day 173 ranged from 1 1 103 cfu cm 2 copper bbm to 9 9 105 cfu cm 2 ms dbm and constituted a variable fraction 0 01 12 of the tcc table s4 the cu concentration cuc on copper increased with time and reached maximum levels of 170 μg cm 2 bbm and 70 μg cm 2 dbm after about 100 days fig 2a table s5 the maximum fec about 750 μg fe cm 2 on ms was reached within 15 days indicating that this material corroded more rapidly and stronger than copper fig 2b the fec on glass ms in the bbm increased much slower than on ms but attained a level of approximately 600 μg cm 2 after more than 100 days of exposure fig 5 table s6 the brown coloured glass surfaces including the inner surface of the columns confirmed the relatively strong fe hydr oxide deposition the cuc and fec on ss glass ss cpvc and glass cpvc also increased with exposure time but the average concentrations remained below 1 μg cu cm 2 and 10 μg fe cm 2 in the exposure period fig

glass controls in the bbm and reached a maximum level after about 70 100 days fig 6 for each material and the associated glass control five colonies with the typical legionella appearance grown on bcye agar incubated on day 126 were isolated and analysed by aflp the aflp fingerprint of all 40 isolates was similar to that of l pneumophila sg1 st1 the organism that was present in the biofilm sample inserted in the bbms fig s6 the lgp log cfu cm 2 in the biofilm on copper was significantly higher than on glass copper ms ss and cpvc table 1 the lgp in the biofilm on ms was significantly higher than on ss and cpvc and the lgp on glass ms was significantly higher than on glass ss and glass cpvc the l pneumophila colony count lpc increased more than proportional in relation to the bfc fig 7 the maximum colony counts n 15 on the various materials were significantly related with the bfc values by log lpc 1 77 0 38 log bfc 0 37 0 96 r2 0 88 the 95 confidence intervals show that the slope is not significantly different from 2 which represents a quadratic relationship furthermore the lpc concentrations calculated with log lpc 2 log bfc 1 do not differ significantly from the measured values see fig 7 3 4 predominating biofilm bacteria the trflp patterns of biofilm samples collected on day 173 revealed that the bacterial communities of the biofilms in the bbm and the dbm grouped in two separate clusters fig s7 the biofilms on copper in the bbm and the dbm showed low similarities with those on glass copper and the other materials whereas the biofilms on ms and glass ms showed high similarities the highly similar patterns of the biofilm on glass ss and glass cpvc in the bbm 90 and the dbm 98 indicate that these biofilms reflect the effect of water quality on biofilm formation and demonstrate the reproducibility of the test conditions the predominating bacteria relative abundance ra 2 in the stationary biofilms day 173 on a selection of materials were identified to obtain more information about the impact of metal type and temperature on the bacterial community a relatively low number of otus 97 sequence similarity was observed on copper in the bbm 13 and the dbm 16 the biofilms on ms and glass ss in the dbm contained two to three times more otus than in the bbm table s8 the proteobacteria mainly alphaproteobacteria and the nitrospirae predominated in the bacterial communities of the biofilms in the bbm whereas the biofilms in the dbm were predominated by the alphaproteobacteria and the gammaproteobacteria fig 8 a table s8 the acidobacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes incidentally exceeded 10 ra the alphaproteobacteria in the biofilm on copper in the bbm included reyranella massiliensis 33 ra and a xanthobacteraceae bacterium 42 ra with 99 similarity to rhodoplanes sp strain laus 2 fig 8b table s9 the biofilm community on copper in the dbm was predominated by the alphaproteobacteria 56 ra and the gammaproteobacteria 42 ra mainly members of the betaproteobacteriales table s10 the alphaproteobacteria included a novosphingobium sp 19 5 ra an uncultured rhodobacter sp 17 ra and uncultured members of the xanthobacteraceae 12 ra the gammaproteobacteria on copper included organisms related to an uncultured beggiatoaceae bacterium 24 ra lysobacter 2 1 ra and pseudoxanthomonas 2 1 ra all nitrospirae in the biofilms on ms 72 ra glass ms 54 ra glass ss 19 ra and copper 2 2 ra in the bbm were identified as nitrospira moscoviensis the biofilm on ms in the dbm was predominated by the betaproteobacteriales including the microaerophilic fe ii oxidizing gallionella 6 3 ra and sideroxydans 2 1 ra the nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizing propionivibrio 6 7 ra and the facultative anaerobic fe iii reducing rhodoferax 4 2 ra the strictly anaerobic fe iii reducing geobacter deltaprotebacteria 12 8 ra and members of the acidiferrobacteraceae 8 5 ra fig 8b table s10 obviously anoxic niches existed at the ms surface at 16 c most alphaproteobacteria on glass ss in the bbm were identified as pedomicrobium 32 ra and hyphomicrobium 8 5 ra an uncultured nitrospira sp predominated on ss 10 ra and glass ss 11 ra in the dbm in combination with uncultured pedomicrobium spp and members of the betaproteobacteriales table s10 overall the bacterial communities on copper and ms differed from each other and from those on ss and cpvc and were also affected by temperature 4 discussion 4 1 biofilm formation potential of materials quantification of the biomass production potential bpp of materials in contact with drinking water by measuring the concentration of attached and suspended biomass by atp analysis in batch tests using tap water with a low bacterial growth potential showed bpp levels ranging from 100 pg of atp cm 2 for glass ss and cpvc to values 10 000 pg atp cm 2 for plasticized pvc and natural rubber van der kooij et al 2002 hambsch et al 2014 the elevated biomass production in comparison with glass in these batch tests is caused by the release of biodegradable compounds from the material the elevated bfp on hdpe in the bbm is consistent with the growth promoting properties of this material in the bpp test hambsch et al 2014 ss showed a low bpp and a low bfp whereas copper showed a low bpp hambsch et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2018 and an elevated bfp fig 1 table 1 hence the results of the bpp test do not reveal the growth promoting properties of copper when exposed to intermittently flowing tap water 4 2 relationship between corrosion by products and biofilm formation bacterial growth on copper surfaces exposed to drinking water is a well known phenomenon e g rogers et al 1994a lehtola et al 2004 van der kooij et al 2005 but enhanced biofilm formation is only incidentally reported wingender and flemming 2004 in contrast bacterial growth enhancement by corroding steel exposed to drinking water has been observed in practice in association with regrowth of coliforms lechevallier et al 1996 and red water problems li et al 2010 and under experimental conditions lechevallier et al 1993 rogers et al 1994b camper 2004 chlorine inactivation by corroding iron promotes bacterial growth lechevallier et al 1993 and schwake et al 2016 hypothesized that interrupted corrosion control may lead to a high legionella level however the water used in the present study was treated and distributed without disinfectant copper pipes in a model plumbing system supplied with tap water of the same origin as used in the present study did not enhance biofilm formation in comparison with ss and initially even limited growth of legionella van der kooij et al 2005 the domestic flow pattern applied in the model system included stagnation of about 8 h during the night and the sampled copper pipe segments had been exposed to tap water after passage of 6 m of copper pipe the cu concentration in the water from these copper pipes avg 370 μg cu liter 1 was about 10 times higher than in the water from the ss pipes studies with electrolytically produced cu ions showed that 0 4 mg cu l 1 at 0 01 mg ag l 1 is needed for an effective control of legionella in hot water systems lin et al 2011 the three times h 1 water replacement in the bbm and dbm columns most likely reduced the cu concentration in the water at the copper surface to below the inhibitory level for l pneumophila metal binding by biofilms has been attributed to bacterial exopolymers mittelman and geesey 1985 the linear relationships between the bfc and the cuc 0 6 μg cu cm 2 on glass copper and on ss cpvc and the glass controls 0 1 μg cm 2 in the bbm and the dbm fig s8 indicate binding of cu hydr oxides by the biofilms on glass copper 1 4 μg cu ng atp ss and cpvc 0 15 0 3 μg cu ng atp these biofilms also bound fe hydr oxides fec 5 μg cm 2 10 15 μg fe ng atp fig s9 the different cuc fec and mnc levels on the non corroding materials fig 5 reflect the average concentrations of cu 5 μg l 1 fe 50 μg l 1 and mn 8 μg l 1 in tap water table s1 indicating concentration limited metal binding the similar fecs on copper with an elevated bfp and the non corroding materials fig 5 table 1 confirms such limitation the similarity of the cuc on glass copper and glass ms fig 5 and the high fec on glass ms suggests that copper released less corrosion by products than ms the bfc on copper initially increased rapidly and exceeded the bfcs on glass copper and the non corroding materials ss and cpvc by more than one log unit figs 2a 3 and 4 but did not increase at continuing exposure the bfc on ms and glass ms increased rapidly within 14 days in association with a strong fec increase fig 2b and continued to increase on ms in the dbm in association with the fec the significantly higher stationary bfc bfp on glass ms than on glass ss and glass cpvc table 1 in the dbm may be attributed to the deposition of fe hydr oxides with associated biomass originating from ms however the bfp on glass ms in the bbm did not differ significantly from the bfps on glass ss glass cpvc and glass copper despite the more than the 100 times higher fec table 1 fig 5 indicating substrate limitation of these bfps which on average were 153 55 pg atp cm 2 higher than those in the dbm table 1 these elevated bfps may be attributed by an increased aoc concentration caused by heating of the water to 70 c in the boiler connected to the bbm van der kooij et al 2017 2018 furthermore the significantly elevated bfps on copper and ms in comparison with the glass controls ss and cpvc table 1 reveal an increased availability of growth promoting compounds at the surface of the corroding metals corresponding with an aoc concentration increase of 10 15 μg ac c eq l 1 van der kooij et al 2018 the release of fe hydr oxides with attached biomass likely reduced the bfp on ms and explains downstream fouling and colour problems in distribution systems with corroding iron pipes li et al 2010 quantification of the effect of biomass release by corrosion by products on the bfp of ms and copper was beyond the scope of this study bacterial growth enhancement by corroding ms exposed to treated water has been attributed to humic substances hs that interact with the reactive iron surface camper 2004 but the involved processes are still not understood nom adsorption on fe iii hydr oxides is described in many studies and is explained by ligand exchange resulting in surface complexation of the humic and fulvic acids gu et al 1995 hs also bind to cu ii by ligand exchange hering and morel 1988 but adsorption of hs on cu hydr oxides apparently received little attention dissolved hs the main nom fraction in fresh water recently have been described as supramolecular structures of organic components with different molecular weights which form micelle like aggregates held together by hydrophobic associations charge interactions metal bridging and hydrogen bonds sutton and sposito 2008 irreversible adsorption of large hs molecules gu et al 1995 may hamper microbial utilisation but low molecular weight organic components of hs aggregates sutton and sposito 2008 may become available for bacteria furthermore also certain inorganic compounds produced by corroding metals e g fe ii and h2 are potential energy sources the ecophysiological properties of bacteria predominating in the biofilms were analysed to obtain information about the processes and compounds that affect bacterial growth on corroding copper and ms 4 3 energy sources at the surface of corroding copper the elevated bfps and the differences between the bacterial communities on copper in comparison with those on ss glass ss and cpvc fig 8 fig s7 reveal that specific conditions affected bacterial growth on copper these conditions include the generation of growth promoting compounds but most likely also growth inhibition of certain bacteria by corrosion by products e g free cu ii is toxic to many bacteria at concentrations of 1 μg l 1 zevenhuizen et al 1979 the xanthobacteriaceae bacterium otu 95 that predominated on copper in the bbm 42 ra fig 8b showed 99 sequence similarity with rhodoplanes sp strain laus 2 genbank accession no dq123621 isolated from a warm tap water installation thomas et al 2006 this organism grew very slowly on charcoal yeast extract agar bacteria resembling strain laus 2 also predominated in biofilms on glass and cpvc in bbms supplied with drinking water treated by ozonation and slow sand filtration van der kooij et al 2018 but the ecophysiological characteristics of the organism are not known the type strain of r massiliensis 33 ra on copper was isolated from river water by coculture with acanthamoeba polyphaga and is described as a non motile cytopathogenic microaerophilic bacterium that reduces no3 and can grow on nutrient rich media pagnier et al 2011 r massiliensis predominated also in the biofilms on glass ms and glass ss fig 8b table s9 and on glass and cpvc exposed to treated aerobic groundwater with a low toc concentration 0 3 mg l 1 and a low bfp 100 pg atp cm 2 van der kooij et al 2017 as mentioned above low molecular weight carboxylic acids lmwcas including formate most likely were available in the bbm as a result of heating of the water in the boiler however information about the utilisation of such compounds by r massiliensis is lacking approx one third of all clones retrieved from copper in the dbm were identified to the species level table s10 but the descriptions of novosphingobium aquiterrae 22 ra lee et al 2014 and the other identified species do not provide relevant information in relation to growth in a biofilm the genus rhodobacter that includes h2 and formate utilizing bacteria imhoff 2005 is represented by an uncultured bacterium otu 97 17 ra an uncultured gammaproteobacteria bacterium otu 136 19 5 ra is related to the beggiatoaceae that includes bacteria with the ability to utilize h2 kreutzmann and schulz vogt 2016 a few lmwcas and sulphide in microoxic niches teske and salman 2014 the presence of a synt rophus bacterium 2 4 ra a strictly anaerobic organism indicates anoxic niches at the copper surface this organism can only thrive on certain fatty acids and benzoate in syntrophy with h2 and formate utilizing bacteria jackson et al 1999 rhoads et al 2017 reported the presence of h2 1 4 μg l 1 in a model plumbing system with copper pipes and an aluminium anode that was attributed to deposition corrosion and showed that added h2 promoted bacterial growth however the swedish national council 2009 concluded that h2 formation by corroding copper under anoxic conditions is extremely limited overall bacteria predominating on corroding copper in the bbm and the dbm most likely utilized lmwcas also under micro oxic conditions the role of h2 as energy source at the surface of corroding copper is unclear 4 4 energy sources at the surface of corroding steel 4 4 1 ecophysiological characteristics of nitrospira moscoviensis n moscoviensis is the predominating species in the biofilms on ms glass ms and glass ss in the bbm fig 8a table s8 the type strain of this nitrite oxidizing bacterium was isolated from a corroding iron pipe of a heating system ehrich et al 1995 corroding iron in contact with warm water obviously provides an attractive environment for n moscoviensis which can also utilize h2 formate and pyruvate as sources of energy and or carbon in the presence of oxygen ehrich et al 1995 koch et al 2015 under anoxic conditions the organism reduces nitrate to nitrite and can use h2 and formate as electron donor this metabolic flexibility may have favoured its growth in the biofilms nitrospira predominating on ss and glass ss in the dbm fig 8a showed 99 sequence similarity with nitrospira present on ss in a model distribution system supplied with nonchlorinated drinking water with a low aoc concentration 4 6 μg c liter 1 and nitrite below the detection limit martiny et al 2005 the presence of this organism was attributed to nitrite utilisation although no drop in the low nitrite concentration across the model system was observed the nitrite concentration in the tap water supplied to the bbm and the dbm also was very low 0 2 μm table s1 and the low concentrations of ammonia 2 μm and nitrate 16 μm can only yield low concentrations of nitrite by nitrification and nitrate reduction in the biofilms the nitrite concentration is low in comparison with the km value of 9 μm reported for nitrite oxidation by n moscoviensis at 37 c koch et al 2015 and 6 27 μm nitrite for other nitrospira spp nowka et al 2015 the mixotrophic lifestyle of other nitrospira spp lückner et al 2010 may explain their presence in the biofilms in the dbm fig 8b table s8 4 4 2 fe ii oxidizing and fe iii reducing bacteria the microaerophylic gallionella and sideroxydans can use fe ii and h2 as energy source he et al 2016 moreover gallionella has a mixotrophic lifestyle hallbeck and pedersen 2005 and can utilize acetate tominski et al 2018 the inability of these bacteria to multiply at 37 c hallbeck and pedersen 2005 explains their absence on corroding ms glass ms and glass ss in the bbm the strictly anaerobic fe iii reducing geobacter in the biofilm on ms in the dbm 13 ra demonstrates anoxic conditions at the ms surface geobacter can reduce ferrihydrite by using h2 or a number of lmwcas including formate and a few other compounds e g benzoate ethanol propanol as electron donor coates et al 1996 straub and buchholtz cleven 2001 the facultative anaerobic fe iii reducing bacterium rhodoferax ferrireducens ra 8 5 can use o2 and nitrate as electron acceptor and utilizes lmwcas but not formate and h2 as electron donor finneran et al 2003 propionivibrio 6 4 ra table s10 can use oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptor and fe ii and h2 as electron donor together with a number of lmwcas not formate thrash et al 2010 4 4 3 low molecular weight compounds and h2 as energy sources the properties of the identified bacteria suggest that certain lmwcas including formate are available at the corroding ms surface both in the bbm and the dbm the predominating presence of hyphomicrobiaceae including hyphomicrobium spp oligocarbophilic methylotrophs gliesche et al 2005 and pedomicrobium spp fe and or mn depositing bacteria gebers and reese 1988 in the biofilms on glass ss in the bbm fig 8b table s9 supports this suggestion in addition to the effects of heating lmwcas may be present as the result of adsorption of hs aggregates on ms and interactions of fe ii and fe iii with nom at the oxic anoxic boundaries as has been reported for mn oxides sunda and kleber 1994 sulphate reducing bacteria srb can utilize h2 but were not observed in the biofilms on ms implying that the anoxic conditions did not support sulphate reduction srb also represented only one of about 400 clones collected from red water samples li et al 2010 enning and garrelfs 2014 questioned bacterial utilisation of h2 from corroding ms because newly identified sulphate reducing deltaproteobacteria showed an efficient direct uptake of electrons from metallic iron under anoxic lithotrophic conditions however tang et al 2019 recently confirmed utilisation of h2 as well as direct electron uptake from anaerobically corroding iron by genetically modified geobacter sulfurreducens strains taken together biofilm formation enhancement by corroding ms may be attributed to the growth of mixotrophic anoxic and microaerophilic bacteria that can utilize electrons h2 nitrite fe ii as well as lmwcas including formate 4 5 comparison of copper and ms the analysis of the properties of the predominating bacteria revealed anoxic and micro oxic conditions at the surface of the corroding metals exposed to drinking water that generated additional energy sources by complex processes the large differences between the bacterial communities on copper and ms three shared otus out of 75 may be attributed to the presence of i fe ii as electron donor and ii fe iii as electron acceptor on corroding ms and iii toxic corrosion by products at the copper surface utilisation of h2 from copper is not clear elucidation of the conditions affecting biofilm formation on corroding metals in contact with tap water requires more detailed information about the ecophysiological characteristics of the predominating biofilm bacteria in particular those present on copper 4 6 relationship between biofilm concentration and composition on growth of l pneumophila a quadratic increase of the maximum l pneumophila colony count lpc at increasing bfc fig 7 confirms the earlier derived equation lpc ce bfc2 where ce represents the conversion efficiency van der kooij et al 2018 by using the average atp content of the bacteria in the biofilm 0 06 fg cell 1 also a quadratic relationship between tcc and lpc can be derived fig s10 which is consistent with observations of flemming et al 2014 the elevated lpcs on copper imply that the accumulated corrosion by products were not inhibitory for l pneumophila nor for their host amoebae and prey bacteria the low number of otus in the biofilms on copper leave only a few potential candidates as bacterial prey e g a xanthobacteriaceae bacterium otu 95 and r massiliensis that has been described as amoebae resistant pagnier et al 2011 n moscoviensis the predominant bacterium on ms and glass ms can serve as amoebal prey neubacher et al 2008 but such data are lacking for the other bacteria that predominated on copper and ms 4 7 conclusions this study shows that corroding copper and ms exposed to intermittently flowing tap water 20 min stagnation time significantly promoted biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila at 37 c the maximum colony counts of l pneumophila on the various materials and glass controls showed a quadratic relationship with the associated biofilm concentration the ecophysiological properties of bacterial species predominating on ms indicated that the enhanced biofilm formation is caused by fe ii h2 possibly nitrite and lmwcas lmwcas likely also promoted biofilm formation on copper but the described properties of predominating bacteria did not provide information about growth promoting compounds differences in stagnation time affecting the concentration of toxic cu ions in water at the exposed copper

17764,the information about the impact of copper pipes on the growth of legionella pneumophila in premise plumbing is controversial for this reason pipe segments of copper stainless steel ss mild steel ms polyethylene chlorinated polyvinylchloride cpvc and glass controls were exposed to intermittently flowing 20 min stagnation time nonchlorinated tap water of 37 c or 16 c ambient temperature during six months to study the impact of metals on biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila biofilm concentrations bfc measured as atp on copper were 3 at 37 c to 6 at 16 c times higher than on ss the maximum colony counts of l pneumophila on the materials tested at 37 c showed a quadratic relationship with the associated bfcs with highest values on copper and ms the average cu concentration on the glass control of copper glass copper was more than two log units lower than the fe concentration on glass ms suggesting that copper released less corrosion by products than ms the release of corrosion by products with attached biomass from ms most likely enhanced biofilm formation on glass ms cloning and 16s rna gene sequence analysis of the predominating biofilm bacteria revealed that an uncultured xanthobacteraceae bacterium and reyranella accounted for 75 of the bacterial community on copper at 37 c the nitrite oxidizing nitrospira moscoviensis which can also utilize hydrogen h2 and formate accounted for 50 of the bacterial abundance in the biofilms on ms and glass ms at 37 c the predominating presence of the strictly anaerobic non fermentative fe iii reducing geobacter and the fe ii oxidizing gallionella on ms exposed to tap water of 16 c indicated anoxic niches and the availability of h2 low molecular weight carboxylic acids lmwcas and fe ii at the ms surface lmwcas likely also promoted bacterial growth on copper but the release mechanisms from natural organic matter at the surface of corroding metals are unclear the effects of water stagnation time and flow dynamics on biofilm formation on copper requires further investigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords legionella pneumophila biofilm corroding copper and steel predominating bacteria low molecular weight

systems with galvanized iron pipes l pneumophila did not multiply in small diameter copper pipes with warm tap water fed for 10 days with tap water containing l pneumophila and subsequently flushed two times each week with autoclaved tap water during 250 days schoenen et al 1988 nor on copper coupons in a two stage batch model system rogers et al 1994b moreover electrolytically generated cu ions are effective in the control of l pneumophila in plumbing systems lin et al 2011 however in household plumbing systems with copper pipes significantly higher l pneumophila colony counts were observed than in systems of galvanized steel or synthetic pipes tiefenbrunner et al 1993 mathys et al 2008 furthermore copper pipes of a model plumbing system simulating domestic water use supported biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila although the colony counts initially were below those in pipes of pex and ss van der kooij et al 2005 also flemming et al 2014 and buse et al 2017 reported that l pneumophila multiplied in biofilms in copper pipes after inoculation of the test system studies with the boiler biofilm monitor bbm system showed that biofilm formation with growth of l pneumophila on surfaces of glass and cpvc exposed to intermittently flowing warm tap water without disinfectant was related with the aoc concentration of the water van der kooij et al 2017 2018 however copper pipe segments exposed to warm tap water in the bbm showed significantly more biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila than the glass control unpublished observation fig s1 this effect contrasted with the observations in the model plumbing system van der kooij et al 2005 and results of batch tests where concentrations of biofilm and l pneumophila on copper were not or only slightly higher than on glass ss and cpvc van der kooij et al 2002 van der kooij and veenendaal 2014 therefore biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila on copper under dynamic flow conditions was further studied in the bbm in comparison with ss and mild corrosive steel ms the objectives of the study were to measure i the biofilm formation on these metallic materials in comparison with glass and cpvc exposed to tap water of 37 c or the ambient temperature 16 c ii the growth of l pneumophila in the biofilms at 37 c iii the concentration of corrosion by products cu and fe in the biofilms and iv to obtain information about growth affecting environmental conditions from the ecophysiological characteristics of the bacterial species predominating on copper and ms 2 materials and methods 2 1 tap water tap water used in the investigation originated from a municipal supply annual production 5 106 m3 treating anaerobic groundwater by perforated plate aeration and rapid sand filtration the finished water

segments every 20 min a volume of 1 5 2 l of warm water is supplied to each of the columns during about 20 s by using electric valves this intermittent flow corresponded with a water retention time of

materials varied between 1 3 and 1 7 cm and was measured of each sampled piece for accurate surface calculation prior to exposure the material pieces were flushed with tap water stored in tap water for 24 h and flushed again as described previously van der kooij et al 2003 in the dbm the columns with materials were supplied with tap water with an ambient temperature of 12 17 c median 16 c under the same hydraulic conditions as in the bbm the bbm and the dbm were placed in a dark room to prevent light access the bbm system was inoculated with l pneumophila serogroup sg 1 sequence type st 1 cultured on pieces of silicone tubing in tap water of 37 c kuiper et al 2004 a piece of silicone tubing with 104 105 cfu of this organism and associated microbiota was inserted in the pipe directly after the thermostatic mixing valve one to two weeks after the operational start of the bbm and removed when l pneumophila was observed in the biofilm on the exposed materials every 14 days one cylinder of each material and the glass control was collected from each column and placed in 10 ml of autoclaved tap water contained in a capped glass tube and stored at 6 3 c within 24 h these samples were treated by low energy ultrasound in a water bath branson sonication unit 5050 after each 2 min treatment the water was taken from the tube and replaced by 10 ml of autoclaved tap water three ultrasonic treatments were applied to glass and six to copper ss ms cpvc and hdpe the obtained suspensions 30 ml or 60 ml were used for microbiological and chemical analyses 2 3 microbiological analyses the atp concentration of the biofilm suspension and the feed water was measured by using a bioluminescence assay as described previously magic knezev and van der kooij 2004 biofilm suspensions from copper ms and glass ms were diluted with tap water to eliminate disturbance of the analysis by cu and fe the total cell count tcc in the biofilm suspension was incidentally measured by using acridine orange staining and epifluorescence microscopy hobbie et al 1977 the heterotrophic plate count hpc was determined by using r2a agar plates incubated at 25 c during 10 days the colony counts of legionella were measured by spreading aliquots 0 1 ml of the biofilm suspension or an appropriate decimal dilution in autoclaved tap water over the surface of triplicate plates of buffered charcoal yeast extract bcye agar with antibiotics nen 6265 2007 characteristic colonies were counted after 7 days of incubation at 36 1 c amplified fragment length polymorphism aflp analysis was

about 1050 nucleotides which were subsequently compared with the ncbi genbank database by use of blast for identification to the species level 2 4 chemical analyses the concentrations of cu fe and mn

and accumulation of cu and fe on copper ms and ss the effect of copper on biofilm formation was investigated in more detail by exposing copper mild steel ms ss cpvc and glass controls to warm and cold tap water to ensure a clean outer surface of the metallic materials capped pipe segments of about 50 cm length were placed in a 1 detergent solution and shaken overnight at room temperature sample pieces cut from these pipes were extensively washed with tap water see materials and methods copper ms and ss but not cpvc significantly enhanced biofilm formation in comparison with the glass controls in the bbm and the dbm figs 2 and 3 table 1 the biofilm formation rate bfr pg atp cm 2 d was highest on copper ms and glass ms as a result of the rapid bfc increase within 14 days fig 4 with clearly lower values on glass copper ss cpvc glass ss and glass cpvc copper showed similar bfps in the bbm and the dbm but ms had a lower bfp in the bbm table 1 the bfp on glass copper in the bbm was significantly higher than in the dbm but the bfps on glass ms did not differ significantly ss cpvc and the associated glass controls also showed higher bfps in the bbm than in the dbm total cell counts tcc of the biofilms in the bbm n 19 ranged from 1 8 106 cells cm 2 glass copper to 1 2 107 cells cm 2 copper and from 5 8 105 cells cm 2 glass copper to 1 4 107 cells cm 2 ms in the dbm n 15 and correlated p 10 5 with the atp concentration in the biofilm fig s5 the average atp content of the cells in the bbm biofilms 0 06 0 03 fg atp cell 1 was significantly lower p 10 3 than in the dbm biofilms 0 10 0 04 fg atp cell 1 hpc values on day 173 ranged from 1 1 103 cfu cm 2 copper bbm to 9 9 105 cfu cm 2 ms dbm and constituted a variable fraction 0 01 12 of the tcc table s4 the cu concentration cuc on copper increased with time and reached maximum levels of 170 μg cm 2 bbm and 70 μg cm 2 dbm after about 100 days fig 2a table s5 the maximum fec about 750 μg fe cm 2 on ms was reached within 15 days indicating that this material corroded more rapidly and stronger than copper fig 2b the fec on glass ms in the bbm increased much slower than on ms but attained a level of approximately 600 μg cm 2 after more than 100 days of exposure fig 5 table s6 the brown coloured glass surfaces including the inner surface of the columns confirmed the relatively strong fe hydr oxide deposition the cuc and fec on ss glass ss cpvc and glass cpvc also increased with exposure time but the average concentrations remained below 1 μg cu cm 2 and 10 μg fe cm 2 in the exposure period fig 5 tables s5 and s6 the mn concentrations remained below 1 μg mn cm 2 except for ms in the dbm fig 5 table s7 3 3 growth of l pneumophila in the biofilms l pneumophila multiplied on all materials and glass controls in the bbm and reached a maximum level after about 70 100 days fig 6 for each material and the associated glass control five colonies with the typical legionella appearance grown on bcye agar incubated on day 126 were isolated and analysed by aflp the aflp fingerprint of all 40 isolates was similar to that of l pneumophila sg1 st1 the organism that was present in the biofilm sample inserted in the bbms fig s6 the lgp log cfu cm 2 in the biofilm on copper was significantly higher than on glass copper ms ss and cpvc table 1 the lgp in the biofilm on ms was significantly higher than on ss and cpvc and the lgp on glass ms was significantly higher than on glass ss and glass cpvc the l pneumophila colony count lpc increased more than proportional in relation to the bfc fig 7 the maximum colony counts n 15 on the various materials were significantly related with the bfc values by log lpc 1 77 0 38 log bfc 0 37 0 96 r2 0 88 the 95 confidence intervals show that the slope is not significantly different from 2 which represents a quadratic relationship furthermore the lpc concentrations calculated with log lpc 2 log bfc 1 do not differ significantly from the measured values see fig 7 3 4 predominating biofilm bacteria the trflp patterns of biofilm samples collected on day 173 revealed that the bacterial communities of the biofilms in the bbm and the dbm grouped in two separate clusters fig s7 the biofilms on copper in the bbm and the dbm showed low similarities with those on glass copper and the other materials whereas the biofilms on ms and glass ms showed high similarities the highly similar patterns of the biofilm on glass ss and glass cpvc in the bbm 90 and the dbm 98 indicate that these biofilms reflect the effect of water quality on biofilm formation and demonstrate the reproducibility of the test conditions the predominating bacteria relative abundance ra 2 in the stationary biofilms day 173 on a selection of materials were identified to obtain more information about the impact of metal type and temperature on the bacterial community a relatively low number of otus 97 sequence similarity was observed on copper in the bbm 13 and the dbm 16 the biofilms on ms and glass ss in the dbm contained two to three times more otus than in the bbm table s8 the proteobacteria mainly alphaproteobacteria and the nitrospirae predominated in the bacterial communities of the biofilms in the bbm whereas the biofilms in the dbm were predominated by the alphaproteobacteria and the gammaproteobacteria fig 8 a table s8 the acidobacteria chloroflexi and planctomycetes incidentally exceeded 10 ra the alphaproteobacteria in the biofilm on copper in the bbm included reyranella massiliensis 33 ra and a xanthobacteraceae bacterium 42 ra with 99 similarity to rhodoplanes sp strain laus 2 fig 8b table s9 the biofilm community on copper in the dbm was predominated by the alphaproteobacteria 56 ra and the gammaproteobacteria 42 ra mainly members of the betaproteobacteriales table s10 the alphaproteobacteria included a novosphingobium sp 19 5 ra an uncultured rhodobacter sp 17 ra and uncultured members of the xanthobacteraceae 12 ra the gammaproteobacteria on copper included organisms related to an uncultured beggiatoaceae bacterium 24 ra lysobacter 2 1 ra and pseudoxanthomonas 2 1 ra all nitrospirae in the biofilms on ms 72 ra glass ms 54 ra glass ss 19 ra and copper 2 2 ra in the bbm were identified as nitrospira moscoviensis the biofilm on ms in the dbm was predominated by the betaproteobacteriales including the microaerophilic fe ii oxidizing gallionella 6 3 ra and sideroxydans 2 1 ra the nitrate reducing fe ii oxidizing propionivibrio 6 7 ra and the facultative anaerobic fe iii reducing rhodoferax 4 2 ra the strictly anaerobic fe iii reducing geobacter deltaprotebacteria 12 8 ra and members of the acidiferrobacteraceae 8 5 ra fig 8b table s10 obviously anoxic niches existed at the ms surface at 16 c most alphaproteobacteria on glass ss in the bbm were identified as pedomicrobium 32 ra and hyphomicrobium 8 5 ra an uncultured nitrospira sp predominated on ss 10 ra and glass ss 11 ra in the dbm in combination with uncultured pedomicrobium spp and members of the betaproteobacteriales table s10 overall the bacterial communities on copper and ms differed from each other and from those on ss and cpvc and were also affected by temperature 4 discussion 4 1 biofilm formation potential of materials quantification of the biomass production potential bpp of materials in contact with drinking water by measuring the concentration of attached and suspended biomass by atp analysis in batch tests using tap water with a low bacterial growth potential showed bpp levels ranging from 100 pg of atp cm 2 for glass ss and cpvc to values 10 000 pg atp cm 2 for plasticized pvc and natural rubber van der kooij et al 2002 hambsch et al 2014 the elevated biomass production in comparison with glass in these batch tests is caused by the release of biodegradable compounds from the material the elevated bfp on hdpe in the bbm is consistent with the growth promoting properties of this material in the bpp test hambsch et al 2014 ss showed a low bpp and a low bfp whereas copper showed a low bpp hambsch et al 2014 van der kooij et al 2018 and an elevated bfp fig 1 table 1 hence the results of the bpp test do not reveal the growth promoting properties of copper when exposed to intermittently flowing tap water 4 2 relationship between corrosion by products and biofilm formation bacterial growth on copper surfaces exposed to drinking water is a well known phenomenon e g rogers et al 1994a lehtola et al 2004 van der kooij et al 2005 but enhanced biofilm formation is only incidentally reported wingender and flemming 2004 in contrast bacterial growth enhancement by corroding steel exposed to drinking water has been observed in practice in association with regrowth of coliforms lechevallier et al 1996 and red water problems li et al 2010 and under experimental conditions lechevallier et al 1993 rogers et al 1994b camper 2004 chlorine inactivation by corroding iron promotes bacterial growth lechevallier et al 1993 and schwake et al 2016 hypothesized that interrupted corrosion control may lead to a high legionella level however the water used in the present study was treated and distributed without disinfectant copper pipes in a model plumbing system supplied with tap water of the same origin as used in the present study did not enhance biofilm formation in comparison with ss and initially even limited growth of legionella van der kooij et al 2005 the domestic flow pattern applied in the model system included stagnation of about 8 h during the night and the sampled copper pipe segments had been exposed to tap water after passage of 6 m of copper pipe the cu concentration in the water from these copper pipes avg 370 μg cu liter 1 was about 10 times higher than in the water from the ss pipes studies with electrolytically produced cu ions showed that 0 4 mg cu l 1 at 0 01 mg ag l 1 is needed for an effective control of legionella in hot water systems lin et al 2011 the three times h 1 water replacement in the bbm and dbm columns most likely reduced the cu concentration in the water at the copper surface to below the inhibitory level for l pneumophila metal binding by biofilms has been attributed to bacterial exopolymers mittelman and geesey 1985 the linear relationships between the bfc and the cuc 0 6 μg cu cm 2 on glass copper and on ss cpvc and the glass controls 0 1 μg cm 2 in the bbm and the dbm fig s8 indicate binding of cu hydr oxides by the biofilms on glass copper 1 4 μg cu ng atp ss and cpvc 0 15 0 3 μg cu ng atp these biofilms also bound fe hydr oxides fec 5 μg cm 2 10 15 μg fe ng atp fig s9 the different cuc fec and mnc levels on the non corroding materials fig 5 reflect the average concentrations of cu 5 μg l 1 fe 50 μg l 1 and mn 8 μg l 1 in tap water table s1 indicating concentration limited metal binding the similar fecs on copper with an elevated bfp and the non corroding materials fig 5 table 1 confirms such limitation the similarity of the cuc on glass copper and glass ms fig 5 and the high fec on glass ms suggests that copper released less corrosion by products than ms the bfc on copper initially increased rapidly and exceeded the bfcs on glass copper and the non corroding materials ss and cpvc by more than one log unit figs 2a 3 and 4 but did not increase at continuing exposure the bfc on ms and glass ms increased rapidly within 14 days in association with a strong fec increase fig 2b and continued to increase on ms in the dbm in association with the fec the significantly higher stationary bfc bfp on glass ms than on glass ss and glass cpvc table 1 in the dbm may be attributed to the deposition of fe hydr oxides with associated biomass originating from ms however the bfp on glass ms in the bbm did not differ significantly from the bfps on glass ss glass cpvc and glass copper despite the more than the 100 times higher fec table 1 fig 5 indicating substrate limitation of these bfps which on average were 153 55 pg atp cm 2 higher than those in the dbm table 1 these elevated bfps may be attributed by an increased aoc concentration caused by heating of the water to 70 c in the boiler connected to the bbm van der kooij et al 2017 2018 furthermore the significantly elevated bfps on copper and ms in comparison with the glass controls ss and cpvc table 1 reveal an increased availability of growth promoting compounds at the surface of the corroding metals corresponding with an aoc concentration increase of 10 15 μg ac c eq l 1 van der kooij et al 2018 the release of fe hydr oxides with attached biomass likely reduced the bfp on ms and explains downstream fouling and colour problems in distribution systems with corroding iron pipes li et al 2010 quantification of the effect of biomass release by corrosion by products on the bfp of ms and copper was beyond the scope of this study bacterial growth enhancement by corroding ms exposed to treated water has been attributed to humic substances hs that interact with the reactive iron surface camper 2004 but the involved processes are still not understood nom adsorption on fe iii hydr oxides is described in many studies and is explained by ligand exchange resulting in surface complexation of the humic and fulvic acids gu et al 1995 hs also bind to cu ii by ligand exchange hering and morel 1988 but adsorption of hs on cu hydr oxides apparently received little attention dissolved hs the main nom fraction in fresh water recently have been described as supramolecular structures of organic components with different molecular weights which form micelle like aggregates held together by hydrophobic associations charge interactions metal bridging and hydrogen bonds sutton and sposito 2008 irreversible adsorption of large hs molecules gu et al 1995 may hamper microbial utilisation but low molecular weight organic components of hs aggregates sutton and sposito 2008 may become available for bacteria furthermore also certain inorganic compounds produced by corroding metals e g fe ii and h2 are potential energy sources the ecophysiological properties of bacteria predominating in the biofilms were analysed to obtain information about the processes and compounds that affect bacterial growth on corroding copper and ms 4 3 energy sources at the surface of corroding copper the elevated bfps and the differences between the bacterial communities on copper in comparison with those on ss glass ss and cpvc fig 8 fig s7 reveal that specific conditions affected bacterial growth on copper these conditions include the generation of growth promoting compounds but most likely also growth inhibition of certain bacteria by corrosion by products e g free cu ii is toxic to many bacteria at concentrations of 1 μg l 1 zevenhuizen et al 1979 the xanthobacteriaceae bacterium otu 95 that predominated on copper in the bbm 42 ra fig 8b showed 99 sequence similarity with rhodoplanes sp strain laus 2 genbank accession no dq123621 isolated from a warm tap water installation thomas et al 2006 this organism grew very slowly on charcoal yeast extract agar bacteria resembling strain laus 2 also predominated in biofilms on glass and cpvc in bbms supplied with drinking water treated by ozonation and slow sand filtration van der kooij et al 2018 but the ecophysiological characteristics of the organism are not known the type strain of r massiliensis 33 ra on copper was isolated from river water by coculture with acanthamoeba polyphaga and is described as a non motile cytopathogenic microaerophilic bacterium that reduces no3 and can grow on nutrient rich media pagnier et al 2011 r massiliensis predominated also in the biofilms on glass ms and glass ss fig 8b table s9 and on glass and cpvc exposed to treated aerobic groundwater with a low toc concentration 0 3 mg l 1 and a low bfp 100 pg atp cm 2 van der kooij et al 2017 as mentioned above low molecular weight carboxylic acids lmwcas including formate most likely were available in the bbm as a result of heating of the water in the boiler however information about the utilisation of such compounds by r massiliensis is lacking approx one third of all clones retrieved from copper in the dbm were identified to the species level table s10 but the descriptions of novosphingobium aquiterrae 22 ra lee et al 2014 and the other identified species do not provide relevant information in relation to growth in a biofilm the genus rhodobacter that includes h2 and formate utilizing bacteria imhoff 2005 is represented by an uncultured bacterium otu 97 17 ra an uncultured gammaproteobacteria bacterium otu 136 19 5 ra is related to the beggiatoaceae that includes bacteria with the ability to utilize h2 kreutzmann and schulz vogt 2016 a few lmwcas and sulphide in microoxic niches teske and salman 2014 the presence of a synt rophus bacterium 2 4 ra a strictly anaerobic organism indicates anoxic niches at the copper surface this organism can only thrive on certain fatty acids and benzoate in syntrophy with h2 and formate utilizing bacteria jackson et al 1999 rhoads et al 2017 reported the presence of h2 1 4 μg l 1 in a model plumbing system with copper pipes and an aluminium anode that was attributed to deposition corrosion and showed that added h2 promoted bacterial growth however the swedish national council 2009 concluded that h2 formation by corroding copper under anoxic conditions is extremely limited overall bacteria predominating on corroding copper in the bbm and the dbm most likely utilized lmwcas also under micro oxic conditions the role of h2 as energy source at the surface of corroding copper is unclear 4 4 energy sources at the surface of corroding steel 4 4 1 ecophysiological characteristics of nitrospira moscoviensis n moscoviensis is the predominating species in the biofilms on ms glass ms and glass ss in the bbm fig 8a table s8 the type strain of this nitrite oxidizing bacterium was isolated from a corroding iron pipe of a heating system ehrich et al 1995 corroding iron in contact with warm water obviously provides an attractive environment for n moscoviensis which can also utilize h2 formate and pyruvate as sources of energy and or carbon in the presence of oxygen ehrich et al 1995 koch et al 2015 under anoxic conditions the organism reduces nitrate to nitrite and can use h2 and formate as electron donor this metabolic flexibility may have favoured its growth in the biofilms nitrospira predominating on ss and glass ss in the dbm fig 8a showed 99 sequence similarity with nitrospira present on ss in a model distribution system supplied with nonchlorinated drinking water with a low aoc concentration 4 6 μg c liter 1 and nitrite below the detection limit martiny et al 2005 the presence of this organism was attributed to nitrite utilisation although no drop in the low nitrite concentration across the model system was observed the nitrite concentration in the tap water supplied to the bbm and the dbm also was very low 0 2 μm table s1 and the low concentrations of ammonia 2 μm and nitrate 16 μm can only yield low concentrations of nitrite by nitrification and nitrate reduction in the biofilms the nitrite concentration is low in comparison with the km value of 9 μm reported for nitrite oxidation by n moscoviensis at 37 c koch et al 2015 and 6 27 μm nitrite for other nitrospira spp nowka et al 2015 the mixotrophic lifestyle of other nitrospira spp lückner et al 2010 may explain their presence in the biofilms in the dbm fig 8b table s8 4 4 2 fe ii oxidizing and fe iii reducing bacteria the microaerophylic gallionella and sideroxydans can use fe ii and h2 as energy source he et al 2016 moreover gallionella has a mixotrophic lifestyle hallbeck and pedersen 2005 and can utilize acetate tominski et al 2018 the inability of these bacteria to multiply at 37 c hallbeck and pedersen 2005 explains their absence on corroding ms glass ms and glass ss in the bbm the strictly anaerobic fe iii reducing geobacter in the biofilm on ms in the dbm 13 ra demonstrates anoxic conditions at the ms surface geobacter can reduce ferrihydrite by using h2 or a number of lmwcas including formate and a few other compounds e g benzoate ethanol propanol as electron donor coates et al 1996 straub and buchholtz cleven 2001 the facultative anaerobic fe iii reducing bacterium rhodoferax ferrireducens ra 8 5 can use o2 and nitrate as electron acceptor and utilizes lmwcas but not formate and h2 as electron donor finneran et al 2003 propionivibrio 6 4 ra table s10 can use oxygen and nitrate as electron acceptor and fe ii and h2 as electron donor together with a number of lmwcas not formate thrash et al 2010 4 4 3 low molecular weight compounds and h2 as energy sources the properties of the identified bacteria suggest that certain lmwcas including formate are available at the corroding ms surface both in the bbm and the dbm the predominating presence of hyphomicrobiaceae including hyphomicrobium spp oligocarbophilic methylotrophs gliesche et al 2005 and pedomicrobium spp fe and or mn depositing bacteria gebers and reese 1988 in the biofilms on glass ss in the bbm fig 8b table s9 supports this suggestion in addition to the effects of heating lmwcas may be present as the result of adsorption of hs aggregates on ms and interactions of fe ii and fe iii with nom at the oxic anoxic boundaries as has been reported for mn oxides sunda and kleber 1994 sulphate reducing bacteria srb can utilize h2 but were not observed in the biofilms on ms implying that the anoxic conditions did not support sulphate reduction srb also represented only one of about 400 clones collected from red water samples li et al 2010 enning and garrelfs 2014 questioned bacterial utilisation of h2 from corroding ms because newly identified sulphate reducing deltaproteobacteria showed an efficient direct uptake of electrons from metallic iron under anoxic lithotrophic conditions however tang et al 2019 recently confirmed utilisation of h2 as well as direct electron uptake from anaerobically corroding iron by genetically modified geobacter sulfurreducens strains taken together biofilm formation enhancement by corroding ms may be attributed to the growth of mixotrophic anoxic and microaerophilic bacteria that can utilize electrons h2 nitrite fe ii as well as lmwcas including formate 4 5 comparison of copper and ms the analysis of the properties of the predominating bacteria revealed anoxic and micro oxic conditions at the surface of the corroding metals exposed to drinking water that generated additional energy sources by complex processes the large differences between the bacterial communities on copper and ms three shared otus out of 75 may be attributed to the presence of i fe ii as electron donor and ii fe iii as electron acceptor on corroding ms and iii toxic corrosion by products at the copper surface utilisation of h2 from copper is not clear elucidation of the conditions affecting biofilm formation on corroding metals in contact with tap water requires more detailed information about the ecophysiological characteristics of the predominating biofilm bacteria in particular those present on copper 4 6 relationship between biofilm concentration and composition on growth of l pneumophila a quadratic increase of the maximum l pneumophila colony count lpc at increasing bfc fig 7 confirms the earlier derived equation lpc ce bfc2 where ce represents the conversion efficiency van der kooij et al 2018 by using the average atp content of the bacteria in the biofilm 0 06 fg cell 1 also a quadratic relationship between tcc and lpc can be derived fig s10 which is consistent with observations of flemming et al 2014 the elevated lpcs on copper imply that the accumulated corrosion by products were not inhibitory for l pneumophila nor for their host amoebae and prey bacteria the low number of otus in the biofilms on copper leave only a few potential candidates as bacterial prey e g a xanthobacteriaceae bacterium otu 95 and r massiliensis that has been described as amoebae resistant pagnier et al 2011 n moscoviensis the predominant bacterium on ms and glass ms can serve as amoebal prey neubacher et al 2008 but such data are lacking for the other bacteria that predominated on copper and ms 4 7 conclusions this study shows that corroding copper and ms exposed to intermittently flowing tap water 20 min stagnation time significantly promoted biofilm formation and growth of l pneumophila at 37 c the maximum colony counts of l pneumophila on the various materials and glass controls showed a quadratic relationship with the associated biofilm concentration the ecophysiological properties of bacterial species predominating on ms indicated that the enhanced biofilm formation is caused by fe ii h2 possibly nitrite and lmwcas lmwcas likely also promoted biofilm formation on copper but the described properties of predominating bacteria did not provide information about growth promoting compounds differences in stagnation time affecting the concentration of toxic cu ions in water at the exposed copper
