5785,bioretention systems have become a leading stormwater control measure for mitigating urban hydrology although these systems have performed well in many site scale field studies less investigation has been directed toward effectively modeling these systems this is critical as modeling of bioretention systems provides an avenue for evaluating their effectiveness prior to devoting time and resources into installation many hydrologic models capable of simulating bioretention consist of lumped parameters and simplifications that do not fully account for fundamental hydrologic processes such as soil water interactions drainmod has shown promise for obtaining detailed daily water balances within bioretention systems under continuous simulations one significant advantage of drainmod is that it uses the soil water characteristic curve to account for fluctuations in soil moisture instead of assuming saturation however the model historically only produces daily outputs for this study drainmod was modified to develop drainmod urban which allows high temporal resolution inputs and outputs more closely matching the residence time of runoff in urban systems drainmod urban simulations of a bioretention cell in ohio usa revealed that drainmod urban could effectively produce hydrographs with a cumulative nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 60 for the 12 events that produced drainage over a 7 month monitoring period overflow was also modeled by drainmod urban but additional overflow data are necessary to derive conclusions about model effectiveness in predicting this hydrologic component input parameters previously calibrated for the drainmod model did not translate well to drainmod urban with the top down approach applied in this study nse 0 31 for drainage and nse 1 83 for overflow but the bottom up approach showed that parameters calibrated with drainmod urban nse 0 60 for drainage and nse 0 1 for overflow could be used in drainmod to obtain reasonable drainage volumes 25 6 error compared to measured values this study suggests drainmod urban is an effective tool for modeling bioretention hydrographs and demonstrates the importance of temporal scale in bioretention modeling by illustrating multiple model calibration approaches despite the promising results of this study additional studies are recommended where validation of the model is performed at more sites in particular for events with overflow further sensitivity analysis of input parameters and comparison of drainmod urban to other commonly used bioretention models would inform future modeling efforts keywords bioretention drainmod modeling stormwater urban hydrology 1 introduction changes in stormwater management approaches over the past few decades have led to more sustainable stormwater controls that aspire to restore urban streams and watersheds by returning them to a more natural hydrologic regime fletcher et al 2014 bioretention cells are one of the most popular stormwater controls aiming to reduce urban runoff volumes and peak flows which alter the hydrology of local waterways dietrich et al 2017 however bioretention research has primarily focused on field monitoring studies and laboratory assessments liu et al 2014 davis et al 2009 computational models have been slow to develop for bioretention systems despite the importance of being able to evaluate these systems prior to investment of time money and resources in design and construction further modeling of bioretention allows designers to optimize bioretention cell design and performance provide guidance for design standards and scale local impacts to the larger watershed developing widely available effective models for bioretention systems could lead to increased adoption of these systems elliott and trowsdale 2007 several deficiencies are present in currently utilized bioretention models many existing models applied to bioretention use simplifications that do not adequately represent fundamental hydrologic processes another limitation of current bioretention models is the inability to effectively simulate either underdrains or internal water storage iws zones despite widespread use of these features in field applications brown 2011 additionally early bioretention models lacked long term continuous simulations thus ignoring the effect of antecedent moisture conditions in the soil an important consideration that affects the infiltration and storage capabilities of the system davis et al 2009 heasom et al 2006 further many models use infiltration processes that assume uniform saturation of the media such as the green ampt equation or a constant user input infiltration rate kaykhosravi et al 2018 lee et al 2013 however field measurements confirm bioretention systems are variably saturated and unsaturated during and following rain events brown et al 2013 as an example of the importance of these assumptions in the mathematical bioretention model developed by guo and luu 2015 the hydraulic conductivity and initial soil moisture were the primary calibration parameters which emphasizes the significance of soil moisture accounting in bioretention modeling these shortcomings need to be addressed in order to adequately model the hydrologic processes of bioretention systems drainmod is historically an agricultural drainage model that has shown promise when applied to bioretention systems drainmod overcomes many limitations of other bioretention models by allowing continuous simulation that provides detailed water balances and the ability to model iws zones through its weir settings one major advantage of this model is that it uses the soil water characteristic curve swcc to account for fluctuations in soil moisture such as the drainage volume and upward flux with respect to water table depth this is important for the calculation of infiltration under unsaturated or partially saturated conditions which dominate bioretention operation winston et al 2016 barbu and ballestero 2014 initial studies that evaluated drainmod for bioretention applications showed favorable results winston 2015 hathaway et al 2014 brown et al 2013 brown et al 2013 and brown 2011 were the first to investigate drainmod to model the bioretention hydrology calibration and validation of the model showed good agreement with measured data with nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse ranging from 0 6 to 0 9 for daily drainage overflow and exfiltration of four bioretention cells these initial investigations were followed by winston 2015 who modeled three bioretention cells in ohio usa in drainmod with daily outputs this study obtained excellent agreement between model predictions and measured values with nse ranging from 0 73 to 0 98 for the validation period these studies proved that drainmod with its ability to model iws zones and its improved soil moisture accounting can accurately model long term water balances through a bioretention cell however the biggest disadvantage of drainmod for urban environments is that it aggregates outputs at a daily time step only producing daily volumes of flow within each water balance component it cannot produce hydrographs at a temporal scale that is consistent with the flashy nature of urban catchments and therefore loses some of the temporal dynamics of the system during storm events baffaut et al 2015 such outputs are critical to exploring event based performance of bioretention cells estimating flood mitigation and allowing the model to be incorporated into larger watershed scale models for this study drainmod v 6 1 has been modified to create drainmod urban an enhanced version that allows high temporal resolution inputs and outputs more closely matching the hydrology of urban systems using a bioretention cell previously monitored by winston et al 2016 the objectives of this research were to 1 assess if drainmod urban can produce accurate output hydrographs compared to measured data and 2 compare drainmod and drainmod urban model performance for simulating bioretention hydrology using top down and bottom up approaches to parameterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description data collected at a bioretention cell at ursuline college uc located near cleveland ohio usa was utilized to test the new drainmod urban model initial characterization of the site was performed by winston et al 2016 the cell was originally modeled in drainmod by winston 2015 as summarized below cleveland oh usa has a humid continental climate k√∂ppen dfa kottek et al 2006 with cold winters the uc cell was designed to treat stormwater runoff from a 77 impervious drainage area 3600 m2 made up primarily of parking lot according to the ohio rainwater and land development manual odnr 2006 design guidelines require a bioretention cell to store the water quality volume i e the runoff from 19 mm of rainfall within the ponding zone i e no subsurface or dynamic storage is considered in the design the uc cell was constructed in april may of 2014 with a surface area of 182 m2 6 5 of the impervious contributing area the ponding zone was 30 cm deep exceeding the minimum required water quality capture volume described above the bowl storage is atop a small mulch layer 8 cm followed by a typical bioretention media 87 sand 4 silt 9 clay with a depth of 60 cm fig 1 underneath the bioretention media was a choking sand stone layer 15 cm just above a 30 cm layer of gravel the final gravel layer bedded a 10 cm perforated pvc underdrain pipe with an upturned elbow to create a 60 cm iws zone the design parameters are summarized in table 1 the uc cell was planted with 1450 plugs which were still establishing during the monitoring period and are not expected to greatly affect the hydrology of the system 2 2 data collection data were collected over a 7 month period at 1 minute or 2 minute intervals a u30 weather station onset computer corporation bourne ma was installed at the uc site to collect wind speed wind direction air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation precipitation was measured on site at a 1 minute interval using a 0 254 mm resolution tipping bucket rain gauge davis instruments hayward california soil analysis was performed for the bioretention media to find the ksat and swcc following procedures outlined by klute 1986 the inflow entering the uc cell was diffuse sheet flow therefore it was not feasible to measure inflow using a flume or weir alternatively the us epa s storm water management model swmm v5 1 007 usepa 2015 was used to estimate the inflow hydrographs on a 1 minute time step the default surface runoff method in swmm is a nonlinear reservoir model that incorporates manning s equation for overland flow and accounts for depression storage the infiltration was determined through the green ampt model with estimations of soil properties based on soil texture the outlet of the uc cell was monitored using a 60 degree sharp crested v notch weir and a hobo u20 pressure transducer that collected data every two minutes onset computer corporation bourne ma both drainage and overflow left via the outlet necessitating additional techniques to separate these two hydrologic pathways as described below the internal water level was measured with a shallow monitoring well and a u20 pressure transducer this measurement was used to find the drawdown rate mm hr in the uc cell by observing the change in water level during inter event periods the average drawdown rate was calculated to represent the average combined exfiltration and et releasing water from the cell between storm events modeling in swmm was performed to separate drainage from overflow at uc as described by winston et al 2016 briefly the bioretention cell was represented as a storage unit in swmm with a controlled outlet the discharge from this model was compared to the measured internal water level to create a rating curve the rating curve was then used to predict a drainage hydrograph for each storm event the overflow was determined from the difference of the modeled drainage hydrograph and the measured combined outflow hydrograph 2 3 drainmod processes drainmod is a process based field scale whole system model that simulates the hydrology water quality crop growth and yield for crop production systems on artificially drained shallow water table soils skaggs et al 2012 youssef et al 2005 negm et al 2014 the hydrologic component of the model runs on hourly or daily time steps the outputs of the model are summarized on a daily monthly yearly and ranked bases a detailed description of modeling the various hydrologic processes in drainmod can be found in skaggs et al 2012 in this paper we briefly describe the hydrologic component of drainmod with focus on processes that are relevant to model application to bioretention cells saraswat et al 2015 drainmod simulates field hydrology using a simple water balance approach fig 2 the model conducts a water balance at the soil surface as follows 1 p f Œ¥ s r o where p is the precipitation cm f is infiltration cm Œ¥s is the change in surface storage cm and ro is the runoff cm once the precipitation exceeds infiltration water ponds on the surface and depressional storage is filled in bioretention cells this surface storage refers to the ponding zone which is often designed to hold the water quality volume when the surface storage is full Œ¥s is zero and the resulting surface runoff can be calculated as ro p f in a bioretention cell this process results in overflow the model also conducts another water balance for a soil section midway between drains and extending from the soil surface down to an impermeable layer this water balance describes the available pore space in relation to the infiltrated water entering that soil layer and the drainage seepage and et leaving that layer infiltration is calculated using the green ampt equation which requires coefficients derived from the swcc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity at various water table depths skaggs et al 2012 the subsurface drainage represents the outflow from the underdrain in a bioretention cell when the soil profile is saturated and water is ponded on the surface the model uses equations developed by kirkham 1957 to estimate subsurface drainage rates as drainage and evaporation continue the water table starts to develop an approximately elliptical shape for this condition kirkham s equation is no longer valid and the model uses the steady state hooghoudt equation van schilfgaarde 1974 to estimate subsurface drainage rates considering radial flow near the drains the vertical seepage is calculated using darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer assumptions skaggs et al 2012 which use the following seepage parameters the piezometric head of the aquifer underneath the restrictive layer the thickness of the restrictive layer and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer lastly the soil water distribution in the profile is primarily determined by evapotranspiration and the depth of the root zone when the moisture content of the soil in the root zone is greater than the wilting point the et is equal to potential evapotranspiration pet or maximum possible et if sufficient water is available pet can be estimated in the model using the temperature based thornthwaite method or user defined pet can be entered into the model if the et is limited by the soil water conditions then et is set equal to the upward flux of water as a function of the water table depth which is determined from the swcc water removed from profile through et lowers the water table and changes the soil water content in the unsaturated zone skaggs et al 2012 2 4 drainmod inputs a brief description of model inputs is given in this section drainmod inputs are categorized into drainage design soil weather and crop parameters inputs to the model can be found in table 2 calibration parameters are identified in this section but discussed in more detail in the calibration procedures sections 2 6 and 2 7 2 4 1 drainage design inputs the drainage design parameters of the model are primarily defined by site characteristics such as drainage configuration underdrain diameter drain depth from the surface and ponding depth table 1 the similarities between the hydrologic components of drainmod and bioretention cells can be observed in the two schematics in figs 1 and 2 for further reference brown et al 2013 created a table to show how each design parameter in drainmod compared to features of a bioretention cell the drainage coefficient defines the maximum drainage rate cm day as limited by the hydraulic capacity of the drainage system the initial value of the drainage coefficient was set to the maximum measured drainage rate this value was further adjusted during model calibration to improve drainage predictions table 2 the drainage design parameters also include weir settings for modeling controlled drainage in agricultural applications e g youssef et al 2018 these weir settings allow modeling of an iws zone in a bioretention cell a unique feature among models used for bioretention the vertical seepage parameters include the piezometric head of the aquifer the thickness of the restricting layer and the vertical conductivity of the restricting layer the seepage parameters influence how much inflow is exfiltrated from the system versus how much leaves the cell via drainage or becomes overflow the vertical conductivity of the restricting layer described the exfiltration rate into the underlying soil which was estimated using the average drawdown rate 4 3 mm hr table 1 the other seepage parameters were used as calibration parameters table 2 2 4 2 soil inputs soil inputs were derived from the swcc of the bioretention media and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of each layer each layer of the bioretention cell mulch bioretention media sand and gravel was entered into the model as an individual soil layer the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was measured to be 17 cm hr for the uc bioretention media the ksat of the sand layer was initially estimated at 15 cm hr rawls et al 1998 domenico and schwartz 1990 the ksat of the mulch and gravel layers were estimated at 50 and 200 cm hr respectively both the ksat of the bioretention media and the sand layer were further adjusted during model calibration table 2 2 4 3 weather and crop inputs drainmod requires either daily or hourly precipitation and minimum and maximum daily air temperatures as inputs to the model the model was set to calculate the daily pet using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 the daily pet values estimated by the thornthwaite method were adjusted by monthly correction factors ranging from 0 82 to 2 32 skaggs et al 2012 to account for local conditions and remained the same as used by winston 2015 the crop rooting depth was set to a constant 30 cm year round due to the fact that seedlings were still establishing during the monitoring period although seasonal adjustments are available in the model 2 5 drainmod modifications the code of the hydrologic component of drainmod was modified by the model development team at north carolina state university to better represent the rapid response time of an urban runoff hydrograph shifting from hourly to sub hourly inputs in addition to concerns over the temporal resolution of the model inflow estimations in the model were cumbersome and in need of improvement for urban stormwater applications the original model provided a contributing area runoff function that could be used to estimate the runoff from the drainage area as the input to the bioretention cell however this method required drainage area runoff to be calibrated to the bioretention cell inflow calculated with swmm as mentioned above the inflow modeling was improved in drainmod urban by permitting user defined inputs drainmod urban requires two additional inputs sub hourly precipitation and sub hourly inflow to the bioretention cell sub hourly time steps are defined by the user ranging from 1 minute to an hour this inflow file replaces the contributing area runoff file used in original drainmod to provide more accurate surface runoff entering the system for example instead of calibrating the model to the swmm calculated inflow e g winston 2015 the inflow from swmm was used as a direct input to the model depending on the level of measured data available inflow can be entered directly or estimated by the user s preferred method providing more flexibility and eliminating the inflow calibration step for more information on the contributing area runoff function in drainmod and inflow modifications in drainmod urban see supplementary data the infiltration drainage outflow runoff overflow et and seepage exfiltration outputs have also been modified at sub hourly intervals these output terms represent the terminology used by drainmod while those in parentheses are corresponding terms common to the bioretention field for the remainder of this paper the term drainage refers to flow through the underdrain and overflow will refer to surface runoff leaving the ponding zone of the bioretention cell the improved temporal scale of the outputs can be used to examine the hydrograph of each water balance component which was not possible in the previous applications of drainmod to bioretention cells as drainmod urban was tested through calibration of the uc cell described below model behavior and programming were inspected and appropriate adjustments to the model were made 2 6 original drainmod calibration procedure winston et al 2016 found that 34 out of 50 storm events 68 produced no drainage or overflow i e were completely captured at uc over a 7 month monitoring period events that produced drainage for multiple days were combined to compare with daily outputs from the original drainmod model for this study only events with both measured and predicted flows were evaluated for a better comparison to individual hydrographs created by drainmod urban a total of 12 measured storm events produced drainage herein referred to as drainage events and a subset of four of these events also produced overflow referred to as overflow events the original drainmod was parameterized based on the known design configuration and characteristics of the uc cell described by winston 2015 winston et al 2016 and listed in table 1 the model parameters that could not be measured such as the piezometric head of the contributing aquifer and thickness of the restricting layer were used as calibration parameters ksat was measured at uc but measured ksat values have been shown to vary widely by up to three orders of magnitude with associated high skewness garc√≠a guti√©rrez et al 2018 papanicolaou et al 2015 gwenzi et al 2011 legros 2006 warrick and nielsen 1980 it is also reasonable to use ksat as a calibration parameter due to model sensitivity to this parameter brown 2011 skaggs et al 2012 winston 2015 these parameters were changed to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse parameter and minimize the percent error for the volumes across the 12 events that produced drainage and four events that produced overflow 2 7 drainmod urban calibration procedure 2 7 1 top down and bottom up approaches top down and bottom up approaches have been examined in many hydrological and ecological studies hrachowitz and clark 2017 bhave et al 2014 basu et al 2011 bai et al 2009 sivapalan and young 2006 jarvis 1993 klemes 1983 often these terms are used to describe model function and complexity but here the terms are used to define the project specific calibration strategy across temporal scales saraswat et al 2015 top down has been described as capturing system behavior at a given spatial or temporal scale with limited model complexity then increasing the complexity by shifting to a smaller scale bai et al 2009 the term bottom up is generally defined as determining how a system may function at a given spatial or temporal scale based on its function at a smaller scale jarvis 1993 in this study the temporal scales were varied so that the top down approach started with a broader temporal scale and moved to more specific and the bottom up approach began with a smaller temporal scale and moved to a coarser time step these two approaches were used to investigate the performance of drainmod urban and compare its predictions to the original drainmod fig 3 first drainmod was calibrated to find a satisfactory parameter set for modeling event volumes taken from winston 2015 this parameter set dm table 2 was then applied to drainmod urban in a top down approach next drainmod urban was calibrated to determine a new set of parameters capable of modeling hydrographs at a higher temporal resolution this parameter set dm urban table 2 was then utilized in the original drainmod in a bottom up approach for the initial assessment the volume calibrated design configuration and soil parameters used for the original drainmod simulation of the uc cell taken from winston 2015 were utilized for the drainmod urban simulation the only difference in the inputs for the improved drainmod urban was the measured precipitation and inflow on a 1 minute interval this process highlighted the impact of a more sensitive time resolution essentially can the model be downscaled successfully after calibration at a lower resolution larger time step this is referred to as the top down approach because the model is first calibrated with a longer temporal scale then downscaled to a shorter temporal scale fig 3 next the hydrograph calibration process with drainmod urban was performed at a higher resolution i e one minute time step parameters that were difficult to measure such as the drainage coefficient saturated hydraulic conductivity piezometric head of the aquifer and thickness of the restricting layer were adjusted in drainmod urban to optimize the chosen model performance statistics table 2 the extensive output files were entered into a macro enabled excel spreadsheet to separate into storm events with drainage or overflow create hydrographs for modeled and measured data and calculate statistical metrics next the bottom up approach was applied the new parameters used to match hydrographs in the drainmod urban calibration were applied to the original drainmod volumes for the entire water balance were compared among drainmod and drainmod urban parameter sets 2 7 2 measuring drainmod urban performance legates and mccabe 1999 recommend choosing one goodness of fit test and one absolute error measure with additional supporting information to fully assess model performance moriasi et al 2007 breaks performance statistics into three categories 1 standard regression pearson s correlation coefficient r and the coefficient of determination r2 2 dimensionless goodness of fit index of agreement d nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or e and the respective relative error counterparts d1 and e1 and 3 absolute error index mean absolute error mae mean squared error mse root mean squared error rmse percent bias pbias and the rmse observations standard deviation rsr statistics of these statistics the nse and pbias are widely reported in research leading to more clearly defined performance ranges to determine if model performance is satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 in fact skaggs et al 2012 suggested acceptable good and excellent ranges of nse for drainage in drainmod depending on the temporal scale of the outputs daily monthly or annually thus the cumulative nse and pbias for all drainage and overflow events were optimized to find the hydrograph calibrated parameter set two sets of statistics were generated during the calibration first the cumulative statistics were calculated by combining all events end to end without inter event periods to determine a single nse value for each simulation this was important since nse and pbias fluctuated for each event due to the variability in hydrologic behavior based on storm size duration and intensity as well as antecedent moisture content of the soil next nse was calculated as a continuous metric which included all inter event periods to show how well the model predicts drainage and overflow across the entire simulation period the continuous nse was found to be higher than the cumulative nse due to its ability to accurately predict periods of no drainage or overflow following calibration additional statistics mentioned above were calculated for a more complete analysis of model performance a visual assessment of each drainage and overflow hydrograph was also performed visual graphical techniques are recommended to identify model bias and differences in the shape of the hydrograph including timing and magnitude of peak flows moriasi et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 finally the hydrographs of the calibrated model were also quantitatively evaluated using parameters such as the storm duration time to peak and peak flow in storms with multiple peaks these measures were based on the largest peak 3 results and discussion 3 1 original drainmod model performance the calibrated drainmod model produced high nse values 0 83 for drainage and 0 57 for overflow for the uc bioretention cell these values suggest excellent or very good performance of the model for a perfect model fit nse 1 when comparisons of modeled versus measured data are based on daily event volumes of drainage skaggs et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 overflow was categorized as acceptable performance according to skaggs et al 2012 and satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 3 2 top down approach volume to hydrograph to test the model s ability to predict hydrology at a finer scale 1 minute versus daily the output from drainmod urban using the drainmod calibration parameters was compared to the observed drainage and overflow hydrographs although the calibrated drainmod model showed excellent performance at the daily time scale using these calibration parameters in drainmod urban resulted in poor performance for predicting 1 minute resolution hydrographs fig 4 the individual drainmod urban event nses ranged from 1 74 to 0 56 with a cumulative nse of 0 31 for drainage and a range of 56 5 to 0 64 and a cumulative 1 82 nse for overflow the pbias was also high ranging from 5 to 246 for drainage cumulative pbias 16 7 and from 33 to 539 for overflow cumulative pbias 96 8 these statistics and visual assessment of the hydrographs indicated that following the top down approach the model was not satisfactorily downscaled these results suggested that further calibration of the model was needed as there were fine scale processes not well represented by the model parameters baffaut et al 2015 although it is expected to find reduced model performance at smaller time steps a visual evaluation of the predicted hydrographs also indicated poor performance engel and hoonhout 2007 moriasi et al 2007 some drainage events showed a lack of correlation with the timing and duration of the event while others showed discrepancies in volume and peak flow rates many events were affected by restricted drainage capacity which caused a plateau effect fig 4a reasonable prediction of overflow timing was observed for drainmod urban but much higher peak flows were modeled than measured fig 4b 3 3 drainmod urban model performance 3 3 1 performance summary due to the poor performance of drainmod urban using calibration parameters developed in the lower resolution drainmod model additional calibration was performed to define an adequate parameter set for producing modeled hydrographs similar to those measured calibration parameters were adjusted in drainmod urban until improvement in hydrograph peak flow timing and duration were visually evident fig 5 the individual event nses for drainage hydrographs ranged from 1 75 to 0 80 with a cumulative nse of 0 60 for overflow hydrographs event nses ranged from 1 59 to 0 74 and cumulative nse 0 10 table 4 the continuous nse values that included inter event periods were calculated as nse 0 68 for drainage and nse 0 04 for overflow the nse values in this study indicate a good fit between measured and modeled drainage data especially given the fine temporal scale moriasi et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012 suggested performance ranges of nse for drainmod suggests that an nse 0 60 would be considered good performance at a daily scale and likely better performance at a smaller time scale the pbias was reduced from the initial assessment ranging from 5 to 181 for drainage cumulative pbias 5 2 and from 15 to 60 for overflow cumulative pbias 18 5 the recommended pbias varies depending on the constituent evaluated but for streamflow pbias 10 indicated very good performance and 15 pbias 25 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 3 3 2 statistical analysis the drainmod urban model was assessed using a robust multi criteria method notably the effect of the squared terms in the nse can be reduced to give proper weighting to errors using a modified goodness of fit statistic e1 e1 for drainage appeared smaller than the nse for drainage as expected by legates and mccabe 1999 but the e1 for overflow was larger than the nse for overflow table 3 this was because there are a large number of small values in the tails of the overflow hydrographs and a sharp peak as opposed to drainage hydrographs which have much larger volumes and smoother shapes these small values lower the observed mean used in the denominator of the nse calculation when the denominator is squared it leads to a decreased nse it is therefore suggested that for small overflow events the e1 parameter should be considered for model evaluation instead of the traditional nse unsurprisingly the correlation parameters r and r2 did not fit this model well the large standard deviation for drainage and overflow at a 1 minute timestep in addition to the natural shape of a hydrograph caused large scatter which decreased the correlation between the modeled and measured values table 3 the error indices presented very low error in the model with the highest error coming from the rmse which had the same conflict of squared terms as the nse the index of agreement d showed very good results with a value of 0 93 for drainage and 0 68 for overflow with an optimal value of 1 similar to e1 for drainage d was greater than d1 as expected by legates and mccabe 1999 but for overflow d was less than d1 though it still reached satisfactory model performance 3 3 3 model performance analysis the nse calculated for each event table 4 provided the opportunity to investigate patterns among event performance in the model drainage results showed patterns in performance among volume peak flow and timing duration from this dataset storm intensity rainfall duration and antecedent dry period did not appear to influence the nse of a drainage event overflow model performance related to each of these features is described but more overflow events are needed to verify these observations 3 3 4 drainage volume drainage event volumes from drainmod urban were compared to measured data and those modeled using the original drainmod table 5 the event volumes predicted by drainmod urban were often closer to measured drainage volumes than the event volumes modeled with the original drainmod the cumulative drainage from drainmod and drainmod urban were very similar to measured volumes approximately 6 13 error table 5 the percent error for cumulative drainage predicted by drainmod urban was better than that predicted by drainmod even though drainmod was calibrated to best match predicted and measured volumes of each water balance component therefore drainmod urban does not lose accuracy in modeling drainage volumes but simply adds the benefits of hydrograph production relative to drainmod the drainage events with the smallest measured volumes 15 m3 had the lowest nse values these events corresponded to rainfall less than 25 mm in this case the small drainage events behave similarly to the small overflow hydrographs described above such that there are more small drainage volumes at the tails of the hydrograph and when those are squared in the denominator of the nse the metric itself declines most of the events that performed well nse 0 5 had differences in measured and modeled drainage volumes 6 m3 this is exceptional performance from a volume perspective so it is expected that improvement in the prediction of hydrograph timing duration and peak flow would further improve nse for these events there were three events 1 9 10 that had similar measured drainage 57 65 m3 and the model predicted within 19 m3 for each event with two overpredicting volume nse 0 39 and 0 40 and one underpredicting nse 0 63 the differences in performance of these events despite similar rainfall and drainage characteristics are related to longer drainage duration predicted by the model seen in events 1 and 9 differences in timing and duration are discussed further below event 10 did not have duration mismatch but the model did not pick up the second peak which reduced the drainage predicted leading to the underestimation of volume the evaluation of these events shows that the total volume difference does not affect the nse as much as the difference of volume at each time step which is larger with timing and duration errors 3 3 5 drainage peak flow hydrograph examination showed that peak flow for drainage was overestimated by drainmod urban for 3 of the 12 storms with the maximum difference equal to 3 7 l s table 6 based on visual observation of the drainage hydrographs in events with the worst nse values 3 8 11 12 drainmod urban overpredicted the peak flow the exception is event 12 which was only overestimated for the smaller first of two peaks although these events all had overestimated peak drainage the magnitude of the difference in measured and modeled peaks varied in fact in all drainage events the difference in modeled and measured peak flow ranged from 0 4 to 3 7 l s yet there was no pattern detected to explain changes in peak magnitude prediction from event to event 3 3 6 drainage timing and duration the difference in modeled and measured drainage duration varied from two to 42 min for shorter events 15 hour precipitation duration and up to a 9 hour difference for longer events 15 h of precipitation table 6 from visual analysis the drainage events with the best nse values nse 0 5 had better prediction of timing and duration drainmod urban accurately represented the rising limb of the hydrographs for most events but extended drainage duration predicted by drainmod urban contributed to inaccurate falling limbs compared to measured drainage events that performed in the mid range of nse values 0 3 nse 0 4 showed some duration mismatch although the predicted drainage duration could be longer than measured the modeled drainage time to peak varied no more than one hour from the measured hydrograph in fact half of the events were within 18 min of the measured hydrograph table 6 3 3 7 overflow overflow event volumes from drainmod urban were compared to those measured and those modeled in drainmod table 5 the cumulative overflow volume improved significantly in drainmod urban from a 47 error to only 9 8 error however some of the event volumes were better predicted by drainmod peak flow was overestimated by drainmod urban for all overflow events with the maximum difference equal to 28 8 l s table 7 the differences in peak flow are much larger for overflow than for drainage which is apparent from visual analysis of the hydrographs the nse was noticeably smaller for overflow events and examination of the hydrographs still shows overestimation of peak flows by drainmod urban although the peaks improved with calibration it is important to note that the nse parameter emphasizes matching the peak of the hydrograph tian et al 2016 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 therefore small overflow events can match the timing and duration well but the overestimated peak drastically affects the nse statistic if the exponent in the squared terms are reduced such as the modified goodness of fit statistics d1 and e1 there is less emphasis on errors due to low flows and the statistical measures better replicate low flows in addition to the peak flows tian et al 2016 legates and mccabe 1999 the overflow hydrographs visually showed good agreement for time to peak and duration between the modeled and measured overflow events the difference in duration of overflow ranged from 10 min to 2 8 h at the maximum the time to peak was precisely the same for all overflow events table 7 the small number of overflow events evaluated in this study is not suitable for linking performance and storm characteristics however some overflow performance could be explained by the same patterns seen in the drainage events for example event 10 had the smallest measured overflow volume 5 6 m3 and poor performance nse 0 59 as seen in most small drainage events similarly event 4 which had the best performance of the overflow events nse 0 74 had excellent timing 3 4 bottom up approach hydrograph to volume as noted above the bottom up approach involved scaling up from the drainmod urban temporal resolution to that of the original drainmod using the calibration parameters developed at the 1 minute data resolution following hydrograph calibration in drainmod urban the calibrated input parameters dm urban table 2 were entered in drainmod to assess the event volumes produced at a daily time step using the bottom up approach for comparison the percent error and nse were calculated for the two parameter sets dm and dm urban from table 2 used in the original drainmod table 8 for drainage the performance of the drainmod urban parameters declined slightly with a larger percent error but the nse remained the same for overflow the percent error and nse both improved with the drainmod urban parameters this indicates that while the top down calibration approach was unsuccessful as noted above the bottom up approach provided nearly the same or better results as those reported by calibrating the original drainmod at a daily time step in short calibration parameters developed by drainmod do not produce acceptable hydrographs when analyzed at a higher resolution in drainmod urban conversely calibration parameters from drainmod urban can be used in a lower resolution daily drainmod with minimal loss of performance in comparison to merely calibrating drainmod volumes at a daily resolution 4 conclusions when calibration parameters generated using drainmod daily outputs nse 0 83 pbias 0 57 were evaluated with drainmod urban at a 1 minute time step top down approach errors in hydrograph duration shape and peak flows were exhibited in addition to lower model performance metrics drainage nse 0 31 pbias 16 7 this comparison indicated that the model required further hydrograph calibration to improve drainmod urban performance and accurately represent measured hydrographs nse values for the hydrographs from drainmod urban were promising drainage nse 0 60 pbias 5 2 given the complexity of bioretention system hydrology and the high temporal resolution this outcome was supported by both statistical standards and visual assessment of volume peak flow timing and duration of each hydrograph when the calibration parameters for this enhanced drainmod urban model were utilized in the lower resolution drainmod model bottom up approach the results were excellent showing improved performance over the original drainmod parameters calibrated to total volumes this study shows the strong influence of scale in model performance when a very accurate long term continuous simulation bioretention model was disaggregated to a finer time scale performance suffered if calibration parameter sets were not updated when long term water balances are desired this is not critical but becomes essential when accurate drainage hydrographs are desired example applications include understanding storm specific performance or understanding how bioretention functions when combined at the watershed scale that is when there is a need to understand how individual site scale hydrographs are combined at the system level furthermore drainage and overflow hydrographs could be useful for understanding effects on hydrology and other stormwater controls downstream of the bioretention cell heasom et al 2006 drainmod urban has demonstrated strong potential for modeling hydrographs that accurately predict measured data more studies need to be conducted with larger datasets to improve statistical conclusions especially for overflow events future work can be performed to analyze the sensitivity of calibration and other input parameters in drainmod urban especially soil parameters that currently require extensive laboratory testing drainmod urban also needs to be compared to other common bioretention models with respect to representation of fundamental hydrologic processes a discussion of whether the complexity of inputs required by drainmod urban leads to improved accuracy or if models with simpler inputs can provide similar results is warranted e g particularly for planning exercises ultimately drainmod urban is well suited to modeling the flashy

5785,bioretention systems have become a leading stormwater control measure for mitigating urban hydrology although these systems have performed well in many site scale field studies less investigation has been directed toward effectively modeling these systems this is critical as modeling of bioretention systems provides an avenue for evaluating their effectiveness prior to devoting time and resources into installation many hydrologic models capable of simulating bioretention consist of lumped parameters and simplifications that do not fully account for fundamental hydrologic processes such as soil water interactions drainmod has shown promise for obtaining detailed daily water balances within bioretention systems under continuous simulations one significant advantage of drainmod is that it uses the soil water characteristic curve to account for fluctuations in soil moisture instead of assuming saturation however the model historically only produces daily outputs for this study drainmod was modified to develop drainmod urban which allows high temporal resolution inputs and outputs more closely matching the residence time of runoff in urban systems drainmod urban simulations of a bioretention cell in ohio usa revealed that drainmod urban could effectively produce hydrographs with a cumulative nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 60 for the 12 events that produced drainage over a 7 month monitoring period overflow was also modeled by drainmod urban but additional overflow data are necessary to derive conclusions about model effectiveness in predicting this hydrologic component input parameters previously calibrated for the drainmod model did not translate well to drainmod urban with the top down approach applied in this study nse 0 31 for drainage and nse 1 83 for overflow but the bottom up approach showed that parameters calibrated with drainmod urban nse 0 60 for drainage and nse 0 1 for overflow could be used in drainmod to obtain reasonable drainage volumes 25 6 error compared to measured values this study suggests drainmod urban is an effective tool for modeling bioretention hydrographs and demonstrates the importance of temporal scale in bioretention modeling by illustrating multiple model calibration approaches despite the promising results of this study additional studies are recommended where validation of the model is performed at more sites in particular for events with overflow further sensitivity analysis of input parameters and comparison of drainmod urban to other commonly used bioretention models would inform future modeling efforts keywords bioretention drainmod modeling stormwater urban hydrology 1 introduction changes in stormwater management approaches over the past few decades have led to more sustainable stormwater controls that aspire to restore urban streams and watersheds by returning them to a more natural hydrologic regime fletcher et al 2014 bioretention cells are one of the most popular stormwater controls aiming to reduce urban runoff volumes and peak flows which alter the hydrology of local waterways dietrich et al 2017 however bioretention research has primarily focused on field monitoring studies and laboratory assessments liu et al 2014 davis et al 2009 computational models have been slow to develop for bioretention systems despite the importance of being able to evaluate these systems prior to investment of time money and resources in design and construction further modeling of bioretention allows designers to optimize bioretention cell design and performance provide guidance for design standards and scale local impacts to the larger watershed developing widely available effective models for bioretention systems could lead to increased adoption of these systems elliott and trowsdale 2007 several deficiencies are present in currently utilized bioretention models many existing models applied to bioretention use simplifications that do not adequately represent fundamental hydrologic processes another limitation of current bioretention models is the inability to effectively simulate either underdrains or internal water storage iws zones despite widespread use of these features in field applications brown 2011 additionally early bioretention models lacked long term continuous simulations thus ignoring the effect of antecedent moisture conditions in the soil an important consideration that affects the infiltration and storage capabilities of the system davis et al 2009 heasom et al 2006 further many models use infiltration processes that assume uniform saturation of the media such as the green ampt equation or a constant user input infiltration rate kaykhosravi et al 2018 lee et al 2013 however field measurements confirm bioretention systems are variably saturated and unsaturated during and following rain events brown et al 2013 as an example of the importance of these assumptions in the mathematical bioretention model developed by guo and luu 2015 the hydraulic conductivity and initial soil moisture were the primary calibration parameters which emphasizes the significance of soil moisture accounting in bioretention modeling these shortcomings need to be addressed in order to adequately model the hydrologic processes of bioretention systems drainmod is historically an agricultural drainage model that has shown promise when applied to bioretention systems drainmod overcomes many limitations of other bioretention models by allowing continuous simulation that provides detailed water balances and the ability to model iws zones through its weir settings one major advantage of this model is that it uses the soil water characteristic curve swcc to account for fluctuations in soil moisture such as the drainage volume and upward flux with respect to water table depth this is important for the calculation of infiltration under unsaturated or partially saturated conditions which dominate bioretention operation winston et al 2016 barbu and ballestero 2014 initial studies that evaluated drainmod for bioretention applications showed favorable results winston 2015 hathaway et al 2014 brown et al 2013 brown et al 2013 and brown 2011 were the first to investigate drainmod to model the bioretention hydrology calibration and validation of the model showed good agreement with measured data with nash sutcliffe efficiencies nse ranging from 0 6 to 0 9 for daily drainage overflow and exfiltration of four bioretention cells these initial investigations were followed by winston 2015 who modeled three bioretention cells in ohio usa in drainmod with daily outputs this study obtained excellent agreement between model predictions and measured values with nse ranging from 0 73 to 0 98 for the validation period these studies proved that drainmod with its ability to model iws zones and its improved soil moisture accounting can accurately model long term water balances through a bioretention cell however the biggest disadvantage of drainmod for urban environments is that it aggregates outputs at a daily time step only producing daily volumes of flow within each water balance component it cannot produce hydrographs at a temporal scale that is consistent with the flashy nature of urban catchments and therefore loses some of the temporal dynamics of the system during storm events baffaut et al 2015 such outputs are critical to exploring event based performance of bioretention cells estimating flood mitigation and allowing the model to be incorporated into larger watershed scale models for this study drainmod v 6 1 has been modified to create drainmod urban an enhanced version that allows high temporal resolution inputs and outputs more closely matching the hydrology of urban systems using a bioretention cell previously monitored by winston et al 2016 the objectives of this research were to 1 assess if drainmod urban can produce accurate output hydrographs compared to measured data and 2 compare drainmod and drainmod urban model performance for simulating bioretention hydrology using top down and bottom up approaches to parameterization 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description data collected at a bioretention cell at ursuline college uc located near cleveland ohio usa was utilized to test the new drainmod urban model initial characterization of the site was performed by winston et al 2016 the cell was originally modeled in drainmod by winston 2015 as summarized below cleveland oh usa has a humid continental climate k√∂ppen dfa kottek et al 2006 with cold winters the uc cell was designed to treat stormwater runoff from a 77 impervious drainage area 3600 m2 made up primarily of parking lot according to the ohio rainwater and land development manual odnr 2006 design guidelines require a bioretention cell to store the water quality volume i e the runoff from 19 mm of rainfall within the ponding zone i e no subsurface or dynamic storage is considered in the design the uc cell was constructed in april may of 2014 with a surface area of 182 m2 6 5 of the impervious contributing area the ponding zone was 30 cm deep exceeding the minimum required water quality capture volume described above the bowl storage is atop a small mulch layer 8 cm followed by a typical bioretention media 87 sand 4 silt 9 clay with a depth of 60 cm fig 1 underneath the bioretention media was a choking sand stone layer 15 cm just above a 30 cm layer of gravel the final gravel layer bedded a 10 cm perforated pvc underdrain pipe with an upturned elbow to create a 60 cm iws zone the design parameters are summarized in table 1 the uc cell was planted with 1450 plugs which were still establishing during the monitoring period and are not expected to greatly affect the hydrology of the system 2 2 data collection data were collected over a 7 month period at 1 minute or 2 minute intervals a u30 weather station onset computer corporation bourne ma was installed at the uc site to collect wind speed wind direction air temperature relative humidity and solar radiation precipitation was measured on site at a 1 minute interval using a 0 254 mm resolution tipping bucket rain gauge davis instruments hayward california soil analysis was performed for the bioretention media to find the ksat and swcc following procedures outlined by klute 1986 the inflow entering the uc cell was diffuse sheet flow therefore it was not feasible to measure inflow using a flume or weir alternatively the us epa s storm water management model swmm v5 1 007 usepa 2015 was used to estimate the inflow hydrographs on a 1 minute time step the default surface runoff method in swmm is a nonlinear reservoir model that incorporates manning s equation for overland flow and accounts for depression storage the infiltration was determined through the green ampt model with estimations of soil properties based on soil texture the outlet of the uc cell was monitored using a 60 degree sharp crested v notch weir and a hobo u20 pressure transducer that collected data every two minutes onset computer corporation bourne ma both drainage and overflow left via the outlet necessitating additional techniques to separate these two hydrologic pathways as described below the internal water level was measured with a shallow monitoring well and a u20 pressure transducer this measurement was used to find the drawdown rate mm hr in the uc cell by observing the change in water level during inter event periods the average drawdown rate was calculated to represent the average combined exfiltration and et releasing water from the cell between storm events modeling in swmm was performed to separate drainage from overflow at uc as described by winston et al 2016 briefly the bioretention cell was represented as a storage unit in swmm with a controlled outlet the discharge from this model was compared to the measured internal water level to create a rating curve the rating curve was then used to predict a drainage hydrograph for each storm event the overflow was determined from the difference of the modeled drainage hydrograph and the measured combined outflow hydrograph 2 3 drainmod processes drainmod is a process based field scale whole system model that simulates the hydrology water quality crop growth and yield for crop production systems on artificially drained shallow water table soils skaggs et al 2012 youssef et al 2005 negm et al 2014 the hydrologic component of the model runs on hourly or daily time steps the outputs of the model are summarized on a daily monthly yearly and ranked bases a detailed description of modeling the various hydrologic processes in drainmod can be found in skaggs et al 2012 in this paper we briefly describe the hydrologic component of drainmod with focus on processes that are relevant to model application to bioretention cells saraswat et al 2015 drainmod simulates field hydrology using a simple water balance approach fig 2 the model conducts a water balance at the soil surface as follows 1 p f Œ¥ s r o where p is the precipitation cm f is infiltration cm Œ¥s is the change in surface storage cm and ro is the runoff cm once the precipitation exceeds infiltration water ponds on the surface and depressional storage is filled in bioretention cells this surface storage refers to the ponding zone which is often designed to hold the water quality volume when the surface storage is full Œ¥s is zero and the resulting surface runoff can be calculated as ro p f in a bioretention cell this process results in overflow the model also conducts another water balance for a soil section midway between drains and extending from the soil surface down to an impermeable layer this water balance describes the available pore space in relation to the infiltrated water entering that soil layer and the drainage seepage and et leaving that layer infiltration is calculated using the green ampt equation which requires coefficients derived from the swcc and the saturated hydraulic conductivity at various water table depths skaggs et al 2012 the subsurface drainage represents the outflow from the underdrain in a bioretention cell when the soil profile is saturated and water is ponded on the surface the model uses equations developed by kirkham 1957 to estimate subsurface drainage rates as drainage and evaporation continue the water table starts to develop an approximately elliptical shape for this condition kirkham s equation is no longer valid and the model uses the steady state hooghoudt equation van schilfgaarde 1974 to estimate subsurface drainage rates considering radial flow near the drains the vertical seepage is calculated using darcy s law and the dupuit forchheimer assumptions skaggs et al 2012 which use the following seepage parameters the piezometric head of the aquifer underneath the restrictive layer the thickness of the restrictive layer and the vertical hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer lastly the soil water distribution in the profile is primarily determined by evapotranspiration and the depth of the root zone when the moisture content of the soil in the root zone is greater than the wilting point the et is equal to potential evapotranspiration pet or maximum possible et if sufficient water is available pet can be estimated in the model using the temperature based thornthwaite method or user defined pet can be entered into the model if the et is limited by the soil water conditions then et is set equal to the upward flux of water as a function of the water table depth which is determined from the swcc water removed from profile through et lowers the water table and changes the soil water content in the unsaturated zone skaggs et al 2012 2 4 drainmod inputs a brief description of model inputs is given in this section drainmod inputs are categorized into drainage design soil weather and crop parameters inputs to the model can be found in table 2 calibration parameters are identified in this section but discussed in more detail in the calibration procedures sections 2 6 and 2 7 2 4 1 drainage design inputs the drainage design parameters of the model are primarily defined by site characteristics such as drainage configuration underdrain diameter drain depth from the surface and ponding depth table 1 the similarities between the hydrologic components of drainmod and bioretention cells can be observed in the two schematics in figs 1 and 2 for further reference brown et al 2013 created a table to show how each design parameter in drainmod compared to features of a bioretention cell the drainage coefficient defines the maximum drainage rate cm day as limited by the hydraulic capacity of the drainage system the initial value of the drainage coefficient was set to the maximum measured drainage rate this value was further adjusted during model calibration to improve drainage predictions table 2 the drainage design parameters also include weir settings for modeling controlled drainage in agricultural applications e g youssef et al 2018 these weir settings allow modeling of an iws zone in a bioretention cell a unique feature among models used for bioretention the vertical seepage parameters include the piezometric head of the aquifer the thickness of the restricting layer and the vertical conductivity of the restricting layer the seepage parameters influence how much inflow is exfiltrated from the system versus how much leaves the cell via drainage or becomes overflow the vertical conductivity of the restricting layer described the exfiltration rate into the underlying soil which was estimated using the average drawdown rate 4 3 mm hr table 1 the other seepage parameters were used as calibration parameters table 2 2 4 2 soil inputs soil inputs were derived from the swcc of the bioretention media and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat of each layer each layer of the bioretention cell mulch bioretention media sand and gravel was entered into the model as an individual soil layer the saturated hydraulic conductivity ksat was measured to be 17 cm hr for the uc bioretention media the ksat of the sand layer was initially estimated at 15 cm hr rawls et al 1998 domenico and schwartz 1990 the ksat of the mulch and gravel layers were estimated at 50 and 200 cm hr respectively both the ksat of the bioretention media and the sand layer were further adjusted during model calibration table 2 2 4 3 weather and crop inputs drainmod requires either daily or hourly precipitation and minimum and maximum daily air temperatures as inputs to the model the model was set to calculate the daily pet using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 the daily pet values estimated by the thornthwaite method were adjusted by monthly correction factors ranging from 0 82 to 2 32 skaggs et al 2012 to account for local conditions and remained the same as used by winston 2015 the crop rooting depth was set to a constant 30 cm year round due to the fact that seedlings were still establishing during the monitoring period although seasonal adjustments are available in the model 2 5 drainmod modifications the code of the hydrologic component of drainmod was modified by the model development team at north carolina state university to better represent the rapid response time of an urban runoff hydrograph shifting from hourly to sub hourly inputs in addition to concerns over the temporal resolution of the model inflow estimations in the model were cumbersome and in need of improvement for urban stormwater applications the original model provided a contributing area runoff function that could be used to estimate the runoff from the drainage area as the input to the bioretention cell however this method required drainage area runoff to be calibrated to the bioretention cell inflow calculated with swmm as mentioned above the inflow modeling was improved in drainmod urban by permitting user defined inputs drainmod urban requires two additional inputs sub hourly precipitation and sub hourly inflow to the bioretention cell sub hourly time steps are defined by the user ranging from 1 minute to an hour this inflow file replaces the contributing area runoff file used in original drainmod to provide more accurate surface runoff entering the system for example instead of calibrating the model to the swmm calculated inflow e g winston 2015 the inflow from swmm was used as a direct input to the model depending on the level of measured data available inflow can be entered directly or estimated by the user s preferred method providing more flexibility and eliminating the inflow calibration step for more information on the contributing area runoff function in drainmod and inflow modifications in drainmod urban see supplementary data the infiltration drainage outflow runoff overflow et and seepage exfiltration outputs have also been modified at sub hourly intervals these output terms represent the terminology used by drainmod while those in parentheses are corresponding terms common to the bioretention field for the remainder of this paper the term drainage refers to flow through the underdrain and overflow will refer to surface runoff leaving the ponding zone of the bioretention cell the improved temporal scale of the outputs can be used to examine the hydrograph of each water balance component which was not possible in the previous applications of drainmod to bioretention cells as drainmod urban was tested through calibration of the uc cell described below model behavior and programming were inspected and appropriate adjustments to the model were made 2 6 original drainmod calibration procedure winston et al 2016 found that 34 out of 50 storm events 68 produced no drainage or overflow i e were completely captured at uc over a 7 month monitoring period events that produced drainage for multiple days were combined to compare with daily outputs from the original drainmod model for this study only events with both measured and predicted flows were evaluated for a better comparison to individual hydrographs created by drainmod urban a total of 12 measured storm events produced drainage herein referred to as drainage events and a subset of four of these events also produced overflow referred to as overflow events the original drainmod was parameterized based on the known design configuration and characteristics of the uc cell described by winston 2015 winston et al 2016 and listed in table 1 the model parameters that could not be measured such as the piezometric head of the contributing aquifer and thickness of the restricting layer were used as calibration parameters ksat was measured at uc but measured ksat values have been shown to vary widely by up to three orders of magnitude with associated high skewness garc√≠a guti√©rrez et al 2018 papanicolaou et al 2015 gwenzi et al 2011 legros 2006 warrick and nielsen 1980 it is also reasonable to use ksat as a calibration parameter due to model sensitivity to this parameter brown 2011 skaggs et al 2012 winston 2015 these parameters were changed to maximize the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse parameter and minimize the percent error for the volumes across the 12 events that produced drainage and four events that produced overflow 2 7 drainmod urban calibration procedure 2 7 1 top down and bottom up approaches top down and bottom up approaches have been examined in many hydrological and ecological studies hrachowitz and clark 2017 bhave et al 2014 basu et al 2011 bai et al 2009 sivapalan and young 2006 jarvis 1993 klemes 1983 often these terms are used to describe model function and complexity but here the terms are used to define the project specific calibration strategy across temporal scales saraswat et al 2015 top down has been described as capturing system behavior at a given spatial or temporal scale with limited model complexity then increasing the complexity by shifting to a smaller scale bai et al 2009 the term bottom up is generally defined as determining how a system may function at a given spatial or temporal scale based on its function at a smaller scale jarvis 1993 in this study the temporal scales were varied so that the top down approach started with a broader temporal scale and moved to more specific and the bottom up approach began with a smaller temporal scale and moved to a coarser time step these two approaches were used to investigate the performance of drainmod urban and compare its predictions to the original drainmod fig 3 first drainmod was calibrated to find a satisfactory parameter set for modeling event volumes taken from winston 2015 this parameter set dm table 2 was then applied to drainmod urban in a top down approach next drainmod urban was calibrated to determine a new set of parameters capable of modeling hydrographs at a higher temporal resolution this parameter set dm urban table 2 was then utilized in the original drainmod in a bottom up approach for the initial assessment the volume calibrated design configuration and soil parameters used for the original drainmod simulation of the uc cell taken from winston 2015 were utilized for the drainmod urban simulation the only difference in the inputs for the improved drainmod urban was the measured precipitation and inflow on a 1 minute interval this process highlighted the impact of a more sensitive time resolution essentially can the model be downscaled successfully after calibration at a lower resolution larger time step this is referred to as the top down approach because the model is first calibrated with a longer temporal scale then downscaled to a shorter temporal scale fig 3 next the hydrograph calibration process with drainmod urban was performed at a higher resolution i e one minute time step parameters that were difficult to measure such as the drainage coefficient saturated hydraulic conductivity piezometric head of the aquifer and thickness of the restricting layer were adjusted in drainmod urban to optimize the chosen model performance statistics table 2 the extensive output files were entered into a macro enabled excel spreadsheet to separate into storm events with drainage or overflow create hydrographs for modeled and measured data and calculate statistical metrics next the bottom up approach was applied the new parameters used to match hydrographs in the drainmod urban calibration were applied to the original drainmod volumes for the entire water balance were compared among drainmod and drainmod urban parameter sets 2 7 2 measuring drainmod urban performance legates and mccabe 1999 recommend choosing one goodness of fit test and one absolute error measure with additional supporting information to fully assess model performance moriasi et al 2007 breaks performance statistics into three categories 1 standard regression pearson s correlation coefficient r and the coefficient of determination r2 2 dimensionless goodness of fit index of agreement d nash sutcliffe efficiency nse or e and the respective relative error counterparts d1 and e1 and 3 absolute error index mean absolute error mae mean squared error mse root mean squared error rmse percent bias pbias and the rmse observations standard deviation rsr statistics of these statistics the nse and pbias are widely reported in research leading to more clearly defined performance ranges to determine if model performance is satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 in fact skaggs et al 2012 suggested acceptable good and excellent ranges of nse for drainage in drainmod depending on the temporal scale of the outputs daily monthly or annually thus the cumulative nse and pbias for all drainage and overflow events were optimized to find the hydrograph calibrated parameter set two sets of statistics were generated during the calibration first the cumulative statistics were calculated by combining all events end to end without inter event periods to determine a single nse value for each simulation this was important since nse and pbias fluctuated for each event due to the variability in hydrologic behavior based on storm size duration and intensity as well as antecedent moisture content of the soil next nse was calculated as a continuous metric which included all inter event periods to show how well the model predicts drainage and overflow across the entire simulation period the continuous nse was found to be higher than the cumulative nse due to its ability to accurately predict periods of no drainage or overflow following calibration additional statistics mentioned above were calculated for a more complete analysis of model performance a visual assessment of each drainage and overflow hydrograph was also performed visual graphical techniques are recommended to identify model bias and differences in the shape of the hydrograph including timing and magnitude of peak flows moriasi et al 2007 legates and mccabe 1999 finally the hydrographs of the calibrated model were also quantitatively evaluated using parameters such as the storm duration time to peak and peak flow in storms with multiple peaks these measures were based on the largest peak 3 results and discussion 3 1 original drainmod model performance the calibrated drainmod model produced high nse values 0 83 for drainage and 0 57 for overflow for the uc bioretention cell these values suggest excellent or very good performance of the model for a perfect model fit nse 1 when comparisons of modeled versus measured data are based on daily event volumes of drainage skaggs et al 2012 moriasi et al 2007 overflow was categorized as acceptable performance according to skaggs et al 2012 and satisfactory according to moriasi et al 2007 3 2 top down approach volume to hydrograph to test the model s ability to predict hydrology at a finer scale 1 minute versus daily the output from drainmod urban using the drainmod calibration parameters was compared to the observed drainage and overflow hydrographs although the calibrated drainmod model showed excellent performance at the daily time scale using these calibration parameters in drainmod urban resulted in poor performance for predicting 1 minute resolution hydrographs fig 4 the individual drainmod urban event nses ranged from 1 74 to 0 56 with a cumulative nse of 0 31 for drainage and a range of 56 5 to 0 64 and a cumulative 1 82 nse for overflow the pbias was also high ranging from 5 to 246 for drainage cumulative pbias 16 7 and from 33 to 539 for overflow cumulative pbias 96 8 these statistics and visual assessment of the hydrographs indicated that following the top down approach the model was not satisfactorily downscaled these results suggested that further calibration of the model was needed as there were fine scale processes not well represented by the model parameters baffaut et al 2015 although it is expected to find reduced model performance at smaller time steps a visual evaluation of the predicted hydrographs also indicated poor performance engel and hoonhout 2007 moriasi et al 2007 some drainage events showed a lack of correlation with the timing and duration of the event while others showed discrepancies in volume and peak flow rates many events were affected by restricted drainage capacity which caused a plateau effect fig 4a reasonable prediction of overflow timing was observed for drainmod urban but much higher peak flows were modeled than measured fig 4b 3 3 drainmod urban model performance 3 3 1 performance summary due to the poor performance of drainmod urban using calibration parameters developed in the lower resolution drainmod model additional calibration was performed to define an adequate parameter set for producing modeled hydrographs similar to those measured calibration parameters were adjusted in drainmod urban until improvement in hydrograph peak flow timing and duration were visually evident fig 5 the individual event nses for drainage hydrographs ranged from 1 75 to 0 80 with a cumulative nse of 0 60 for overflow hydrographs event nses ranged from 1 59 to 0 74 and cumulative nse 0 10 table 4 the continuous nse values that included inter event periods were calculated as nse 0 68 for drainage and nse 0 04 for overflow the nse values in this study indicate a good fit between measured and modeled drainage data especially given the fine temporal scale moriasi et al 2007 skaggs et al 2012 suggested performance ranges of nse for drainmod suggests that an nse 0 60 would be considered good performance at a daily scale and likely better performance at a smaller time scale the pbias was reduced from the initial assessment ranging from 5 to 181 for drainage cumulative pbias 5 2 and from 15 to 60 for overflow cumulative pbias 18 5 the recommended pbias varies depending on the constituent evaluated but for streamflow pbias 10 indicated very good performance and 15 pbias 25 is considered satisfactory moriasi et al 2007 3 3 2 statistical analysis the drainmod urban model was assessed using a robust multi criteria method notably the effect of the squared terms in the nse can be reduced to give proper weighting to errors using a modified goodness of fit statistic e1 e1 for drainage appeared smaller than the nse for drainage as expected by legates and mccabe 1999 but the e1 for overflow was larger than the nse for overflow table 3 this was because there are a large number of small values in the tails of the overflow hydrographs and a sharp peak as opposed to drainage hydrographs which have much larger volumes and smoother shapes these small values lower the observed mean used in the denominator of the nse calculation when the denominator is squared it leads to a decreased nse it is therefore suggested that for small overflow events the e1 parameter should be considered for model evaluation instead of the traditional nse unsurprisingly the correlation parameters r and r2 did not fit this model well the large standard deviation for drainage and overflow at a 1 minute timestep in addition to the natural shape of a hydrograph caused large scatter which decreased the correlation between the modeled and measured values table 3 the error indices presented very low error in the model with the highest error coming from the rmse which had the same conflict of squared terms as the nse the index of agreement d showed very good results with a value of 0 93 for drainage and 0 68 for overflow with an optimal value of 1 similar to e1 for drainage d was greater than d1 as expected by legates and mccabe 1999 but for overflow d was less than d1 though it still reached satisfactory model performance 3 3 3 model performance analysis the nse calculated for each event table 4 provided the opportunity to investigate patterns among event performance in the model drainage results showed patterns in performance among volume peak flow and timing duration from this dataset storm intensity rainfall duration and antecedent dry period did not appear to influence the nse of a drainage event overflow model performance related to each of these features is described but more overflow events are needed to verify these observations 3 3 4 drainage volume drainage event volumes from drainmod urban were compared to measured data and those modeled using the original drainmod table 5 the event volumes predicted by drainmod urban were often closer to measured drainage volumes than the event volumes modeled with the original drainmod the cumulative drainage from drainmod and drainmod urban were very similar to measured volumes approximately 6 13 error table 5 the percent error for cumulative drainage predicted by drainmod urban was better than that predicted by drainmod even though drainmod was calibrated to best match predicted and measured volumes of each water balance component therefore drainmod urban does not lose accuracy in modeling drainage volumes but simply adds the benefits of hydrograph production relative to drainmod the drainage events with the smallest measured volumes 15 m3 had the lowest nse values these events corresponded to rainfall less than 25 mm in this case the small drainage events behave similarly to the small overflow hydrographs described above such that there are more small drainage volumes at the tails of the hydrograph and when those are squared in the denominator of the nse the metric itself declines most of the events that performed well nse 0 5 had differences in measured and modeled drainage volumes 6 m3 this is exceptional performance from a volume perspective so it is expected that improvement in the prediction of hydrograph timing duration and peak flow would further improve nse for these events there were three events 1 9 10 that had similar measured drainage 57 65 m3 and the model predicted within 19 m3 for each event with two overpredicting volume nse 0 39 and 0 40 and one underpredicting nse 0 63 the differences in performance of these events despite similar rainfall and drainage characteristics are related to longer drainage duration predicted by the model seen in events 1 and 9 differences in timing and duration are discussed further below event 10 did not have duration mismatch but the model did not pick up the second peak which reduced the drainage predicted leading to the underestimation of volume the evaluation of these events shows that the total volume difference does not affect the nse as much as the difference of volume at each time step which is larger with timing and duration errors 3 3 5 drainage peak flow hydrograph examination showed that peak flow for drainage was overestimated by drainmod urban for 3 of the 12 storms with the maximum difference equal to 3 7 l s table 6 based on visual observation of the drainage hydrographs in events with the worst nse values 3 8 11 12 drainmod urban overpredicted the peak flow the exception is event 12 which was only overestimated for the smaller first of two peaks although these events all had overestimated peak drainage the magnitude of the difference in measured and modeled peaks varied in fact in all drainage events the difference in modeled and measured peak flow ranged from 0 4 to 3 7 l s yet there was no pattern detected to explain changes in peak magnitude prediction from event to event 3 3 6 drainage timing and duration the difference in modeled and measured drainage duration varied from two to 42 min for shorter events 15 hour precipitation duration and up to a 9 hour difference for longer events 15 h of precipitation table 6 from visual analysis the drainage events with the best nse values nse 0 5 had better prediction of timing and duration drainmod urban accurately represented the rising limb of the hydrographs for most events but extended drainage duration predicted by drainmod urban contributed to inaccurate falling limbs compared to measured drainage events that performed in the mid range of nse values 0 3 nse 0 4 showed some duration mismatch although the predicted drainage duration could be longer than measured the modeled drainage time to peak varied no more than one hour from the measured hydrograph in fact half of the events were within 18 min of the measured hydrograph table 6 3 3 7 overflow overflow event volumes from drainmod urban were compared to those measured and those modeled in drainmod table 5 the cumulative overflow volume improved significantly in drainmod urban from a 47 error to only 9 8 error however some of the event volumes were better predicted by drainmod peak flow was overestimated by drainmod urban for all overflow events with the maximum difference equal to 28 8 l s table 7 the differences in peak flow are much larger for overflow than for drainage which is apparent from visual analysis of the hydrographs the nse was noticeably smaller for overflow events and examination of the hydrographs still shows overestimation of peak flows by drainmod urban although the peaks improved with calibration it is important to note that the nse parameter emphasizes matching the peak of the hydrograph tian et al 2016 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 therefore small overflow events can match the timing and duration well but the overestimated peak drastically affects the nse statistic if the exponent in the squared terms are reduced such as the modified goodness of fit statistics d1 and e1 there is less emphasis on errors due to low flows and the statistical measures better replicate low flows in addition to the peak flows tian et al 2016 legates and mccabe 1999 the overflow hydrographs visually showed good agreement for time to peak and duration between the modeled and measured overflow events the difference in duration of overflow ranged from 10 min to 2 8 h at the maximum the time to peak was precisely the same for all overflow events table 7 the small number of overflow events evaluated in this study is not suitable for linking performance and storm characteristics however some overflow performance could be explained by the same patterns seen in the drainage events for example event 10 had the smallest measured overflow volume 5 6 m3 and poor performance nse 0 59 as seen in most small drainage events similarly event 4 which had the best performance of the overflow events nse 0 74 had excellent timing 3 4 bottom up approach hydrograph to volume as noted above the bottom up approach involved scaling up from the drainmod urban temporal resolution to that of the original drainmod using the calibration parameters developed at the 1 minute data resolution following hydrograph calibration in drainmod urban the calibrated input parameters dm urban table 2 were entered in drainmod to assess the event volumes produced at a daily time step using the bottom up approach for comparison the percent error and nse were calculated for the two parameter sets dm and dm urban from table 2 used in the original drainmod table 8 for drainage the performance of the drainmod urban parameters declined slightly with a larger percent error but the nse remained the same for overflow the percent error and nse both improved with the drainmod urban parameters this indicates that while the top down calibration approach was unsuccessful as noted above the bottom up approach provided nearly the same or better results as those reported by calibrating the original drainmod at a daily time step in short calibration parameters developed by drainmod do not produce acceptable hydrographs when analyzed at a higher resolution in drainmod urban conversely calibration parameters from drainmod urban can be used in a lower resolution daily drainmod with minimal loss of performance in comparison to merely calibrating drainmod volumes at a daily resolution 4 conclusions when calibration parameters generated using drainmod daily outputs nse 0 83 pbias 0 57 were evaluated with drainmod urban at a 1 minute time step top down approach errors in hydrograph duration shape and peak flows were exhibited in addition to lower model performance metrics drainage nse 0 31 pbias 16 7 this comparison indicated that the model required further hydrograph calibration to improve drainmod urban performance and accurately represent measured hydrographs nse values for the hydrographs from drainmod urban were promising drainage nse 0 60 pbias 5 2 given the complexity of bioretention system hydrology and the high temporal resolution this outcome was supported by both statistical standards and visual assessment of volume peak flow timing and duration of each hydrograph when the calibration parameters for this enhanced drainmod urban model were utilized in the lower resolution drainmod model bottom up approach the results were excellent showing improved performance over the original drainmod parameters calibrated to total volumes this study shows the strong influence of scale in model performance when a very accurate long term continuous simulation bioretention model was disaggregated to a finer time scale performance suffered if calibration parameter sets were not updated when long term water balances are desired this is not critical but becomes essential when accurate drainage hydrographs are desired example applications include understanding storm specific performance or understanding how bioretention functions when combined at the watershed scale that is when there is a need to understand how individual site scale hydrographs are combined at the system level furthermore drainage and overflow hydrographs could be useful for understanding effects on hydrology and other stormwater controls downstream of the bioretention cell heasom et al 2006 drainmod urban has demonstrated strong potential for modeling hydrographs that accurately predict measured data more studies need to be conducted with larger datasets to improve statistical conclusions especially for overflow events future work can be performed to analyze the sensitivity of calibration and other input parameters in drainmod urban especially soil parameters that currently require extensive laboratory testing drainmod urban also needs to be compared to other common bioretention models with respect to representation of fundamental hydrologic processes a discussion of whether the complexity of inputs required by drainmod urban leads to improved accuracy or if models with simpler inputs can provide similar results is warranted e g particularly for planning exercises ultimately drainmod urban is well suited to modeling the flashy

5786,controlled column tracer test ctt experiments become indispensable tools in understanding the physical chemical and biochemical behaviors of solute transport in the subsurface especially for parameter estimation purpose here we find that previous ctt models perform well in calibration when interpreting experimental data under multiple flow rates but not well in prediction probably because they have not taken into consideration of the boundary effect mixing effect and scale effect concurrently in this study new mathematic models and analytical solutions have been developed where the mixing effect has been considered in the pre inlet reservoir and two scale dependent models linear asymptotic and exponential are employed to describe the dispersivity a series of new controlled laboratory experiments and finite difference numerical simulations have also been conducted to test the new models the results show that the newly proposed model performs better than previous models when interpreting breakthrough curves of ctt both scale effect and mixing effect play important roles in the transport processes the long standing controversy of boundary conditions at the inlet of the column has been resolved by considering the linear asymptotic or the exponentially scale dependent dispersivity models and the mixing effect of the pre inlet reservoir specifically such new models effectively eliminate the problem of simultaneously satisfying the mass flux continuity and the resident concentration continuity at the inlet of the column the danckwerts condition commonly used in previous studies for describing the boundary condition at the column exit is found to be a special case of this study when the after outlet reservoir is absent keywords reactive transport column test mixing effect parameter estimation 1 introduction 1 1 background the controlled column tracer test ctt experiment has been widely used to estimate flow and transport parameters of tested porous medium e g porosity dispersivity reaction rates and so on a standard procedure to obtain these values is best fitting the observed breakthrough curves btcs at a given location usually at the exit of a column with solutions of proper mathematical models describing the transport process delgado 2006 gelhar et al 1992 khan and jury 1990 to date many mathematic models have been developed to interpret ctt under various conditions for instance 1 with different types of boundary conditions schwartz et al 1999 2 with or without mixing effect novakowski 1992a novakowski 1992b and 3 with or without the scale effect gao et al 2010 yates 1992 you and zhan 2013 however performance of these models may be satisfactory in calibration when interpreting the experimental data while prediction capability of these models is still poor and sometimes totally unreliable this problem happens in the new experiment of this study that will be described in details later and has also been reported by many others in previous investigations garrard et al 2017 zaheer et al 2017 one possible explanation for this problem is because some previous ctt models fail to describe the most relevant mechanisms involved in the transport process a classical mathematical model of interpreting ctt results in a homogenous porous media is one dimensional 1d with a semi infinite domain and is based on the following assumptions using resident concentration denoted as cr continuity at the inlet boundary a constant dispersivity a constant concentration at the inlet boundary and a zero concentration in the infinite boundary where cr is mass of solute within a fixed unit volume of porous media ml 3 numerous studies reported that such a mathematical model did not always perform well in interpreting ctt results probably because it had not considered the boundary mixing and scale effects concurrently chang and chen 2003 pacheco 2013 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 subsequently this classical model was extended by considering either one or two of the aforementioned three effects and such extended models will be briefly reviewed in the following sections 1 2 models related to inlet boundary condition in the aforementioned classical model it assumes that the resident concentration is continuous at the inlet boundary geiger et al 2010 1 c r z 0 c 0 where z is the coordinate along the flow direction with z 0 at the inlet l and c 0 is the concentration in the pre inlet reservoir ml 3 eq 1 is found not satisfying the mass balance requirement at the inlet as the dispersive transport effect is not considered to consider both advective and dispersive transport processes at the inlet eq 1 is modified as follows parker and van genuchten 1984 2 c r d l v c r z z 0 c 0 where d l is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient along the flow direction l2t 1 v is groundwater flow velocity lt 1 unfortunately eq 2 at the inlet boundary will result in the discontinuity of resident concentration at the inlet because of the use of a non zero dispersion coefficient dl inside the column near the inlet and a zero dispersion coefficient outside the column in the pre inlet reservoir parker and van genuchten 1984 pearson 1959 the difference of btcs under eqs 1 and 2 is obvious for the small peclet number cases or dispersion dominated transport cases novakowski 1992a to answer the question which boundary conditions of eqs 1 and 2 work better many experiments have been conducted and most of them demonstrated that eq 2 performed better than eq 1 in fitting between the observed and computed btcs e g novakowski 1992b schwartz et al 1999 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 and so on actually many recent studies showed that eq 1 also worked well to interpret the experimental data especially for the small peclet number cases e g geiger et al 2010 fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 and so on besides experimental studies khaleel et al 2002 employed a numerical modeling approach to investigate the boundary conditions and recommended eq 2 being used as inlet boundary while eq 1 being used to describe solute transport across a sharp interface between two different porous materials however harvey and gorelick 2000 and leblanc et al 1991 found that eq 1 failed to interpret the asymmetry of the solute arrival time at the outlet when reversing the flow direction they pointed out that the probability of particles crossing the interface might be different when flow direction was changed on the other hand garabedian et al 1991 established a pore scale model to investigate the solute transport boundary value problems using lattice boltzmann approach and concluded that the solution of the pore scale model matched the analytical solutions for either eq 1 or eq 2 in a word the controversy of choosing the inlet boundary condition in ctt has still not been resolved meanwhile the resident concentration continuity rcc and the mass flux continuity mfc could not be satisfied concurrently at the inlet boundary no matter to eq 1 or eq 2 pearson 1959 proposed a piecewise linear function to describe the dispersion coefficient near the inlet making the dispersion coefficient value to be zero at the inlet of the column to satisfy both rcc and mfc requirements however he did not provide a sound physical explanation on why the dispersion coefficient behaved in such a fashion an issue that will be revisited in details in this study 1 3 models related to mixing effect the mixing effect in both column inlet and column outlet is usually overlooked in many previous models as for the inlet boundary c 0 is assumed to be constant and equal to the concentration of the injection tracer from the schematic diagram of ctt as shown in fig 1 one can see that the experimental equipment composes of 1 two elevated tanks filled with tracer free water and tracer included solute respectively 2 probes gtcon 400c to detect the solute conductivity in the column the full scale is 1999 Œºs cm and the detected error is about 1 Œºs cm the maximum measured value is about 1800 Œºs cm in this study thus the detected error might be negligible for the results 3 a data collection personal computer connected with probes 4 a column filled with tested materials sands 5 a pre inlet reservoir below the tested material and an after outlet reservoir above the tested material the elevated water tank is used to saturate the tested material and to produce a steady flow field across the column after that the tracer is injected to the column through an inlet pipe the purpose of the pre inlet reservoir is to provide a buffer region to completely mix the injected tracer before delivering it to the test material in the column the after outlet reservoir is used to mix the solute leaving the column but it is optional and is often absent in many experimental setup before entering into the column the tracer will experience a mixing process in the pre inlet reservoir a process that has been considered by a few investigators before but mostly overlooked by others 1 4 models related to outlet boundary condition as for the treatment of the exit boundary of column a zero concentration in the infinite boundary has been widely used such an exit boundary condition seems baseless as the column length is always finite and sometime quite short e g less than 0 5 m jia et al 2017 wang et al 2013 for a finite column the danckwerts condition or the zero resident concentration gradient condition has been widely applied for the exit boundary danckwerts 1953 and it states that c r z z l 0 where l is the column length l the danckwerts condition is obtained by assuming that the dispersion coefficient is 0 in the after outlet reservoir and resident concentration continuity is remained at the outlet boundary as well similar to the pre inlet boundary of the column the danckwerts condition does not consider the mixing effect in the after outlet reservoir which was addressed by novakowski 1992a 1 5 models related to scale effect the values of dispersivity might be scale dependent and could increase with tracer travel distance or time pacheco et al 2015 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 a phenomenon that has been observed in field scale transport dagan 1988 gelhar et al 1992 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 pickens and grisak 1981b and in laboratory scale ctt gao et al 2010 huang et al 1995 among other factors the scale dependence of dispersivity is often regarded as a consequence of using fickian transport theory to describe transport in a heterogeneous system gelhar et al 1992 pacheco et al 2015 recently fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 investigated the scale effect on dispersivity in both small less than 1 m and large greater than 1 m scale laboratory experiments and field much greater than 1 m experiments they concluded that even for small scale sub meter laboratory experiments the scale effect usually prevailed and was recommended in the modeling exercises fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 to quantify the scale dependent dispersivity there are four types of functions are widely used including linear exponential parabolic and asymptotic ones as summarized by pickens and grisak 1981a up to date many analytical solutions associated with these four types of dispersivity functions have been developed yates 1990 and gao et al 2010 employed the linear model to describe the scale effect of dispersivity logan 1996 and yates 1992 derived analytical solutions based on the exponential function for the scale dependent dispersivity huang et al 1996 gao et al 2012 and sharma and abgaze 2015 presented analytical solutions with the asymptotic scale dependent dispersivity functions the studies of bharati et al 2017 assumed that dispersivity followed a parabolic function a point to note about studies of gao et al 2010 and you and zhan 2013 is that they both used the ctt data from huang et al 1995 in which the columns were very long from a laboratory experimental point of view 12 5 m in length in contrast in most ctts reported so far the column lengths were usually much shorter sometimes less than 1 m in this study we will conduct new column tests using an even shorter column e g 37 cm of length 1 6 objective of this study based on the literature review mentioned above we find that the boundary effect the mixing effect and the scale effect have not been considered simultaneously in previous models this might be the main reason why the previous models performed well in calibration when interpreting the experimental data but did not perform well in prediction the objectives of this study are as follows first to develop new models and solutions considering the boundary effect mixing effect and scale effect concurrently second to conduct a series of new ctt experiments under multiple flow rates specifically the points of observation for making btcs can be either at the outlet of the column or inside the column third to test the new models and previous models using the new experimental data of this study 2 new models of solute transport in a ctt and solutions 2 1 mathematic models based on the coordinate system shown in fig 1 the z axis is upward and vertical and the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the bottom of the column in a homogeneous sand column the governing equation of solute transport with a linear sorption isotherm and a first order reaction or decay could be written as follows 3 z d l c r z v c r z Œº c r r c r t 4 c r z t t 0 0 5 v c in v c r z t d l c r z z 0 6 v c out v c r z t d l c out z z 0 where c in and c out represent the concentrations ml 3 of solute at inlet and outlet bounds of the column respectively r 1 f œÅ b k d Œ∏ is a constant retardation factor dimensionless where k d is the equilibrium distribution coefficient l3m 1 œÅ b is the bulk density ml 3 and Œ∏ is porosity dimensionless Œº is the first order biodegradation or radioactive decay coefficient or the first order reaction rate t 1 t is time t eq 4 represents the initial condition implying that the column is free of solute at the beginning eqs 5 and 6 are the statements of mass conservation at the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively dispersion coefficient can be calculated by the following equation 7 d l Œ± l v d 0 where Œ± l is the dispersivity l d 0 is the diffusion coefficient in the porous media l2t 1 which is much smaller than the mechanical dispersion Œ± l v in this study the linear asymptotic model for the scale dependent dispersivity is pickens and grisak 1981a pickens and grisak 1981b you and zhan 2013 8 Œ± l z Œª z 0 z l 0 Œ± 0 l 0 z l where Œ± 0 is the asymptotic dispersivity l Œª represents the growing rate of dispersivity dimensionless and Œª Œ± 0 l 0 l 0 is the distance where Œ± l l 0 Œ± 0 the exponential model of the scale dependent dispersivity is 9 Œ± l z Œ± 0 1 e b z l where b is a positive constant dimensionless by checking eqs 8 and 9 one may find that the dispersivity is equal to zero when z 0 such a condition ensures that both rcc and mfc are satisfied at z 0 namely the problem of concurrently satisfying rcc and mfc at the inlet boundary in previous studies liang et al 2018 parker and van genuchten 1984 pearson 1959 will be eliminated by using a linear or exponential scale dependent dispersivity in this study two types of tracer injections will be included continuous injection and instantaneous injection as for the continuous injection considering the mixing process in the pre inlet reservoir see fig 1 one can have the following relationship after considering the mass conservation in the pre inlet reservoir novakowski 1992a 10 c in t t 0 0 11 v in d c in dt q c 0 qc in where v in œÄ r 2 b in is the volume of the pre inlet cylindrical reservoir l3 r is the radius of the reservoir l b in is the height of the pre inlet reservoir l c in is the resident concentration in the pre inlet reservoir ml 3 c 0 is a constant and represents the concentration of the tracer before entering the pre inlet reservoir or before mixing ml 3 q is the total discharge l3t 1 that enters the reservoir from the inlet pipe and is also the flow rate entering the column from the reservoir so that the total water volume in the pre inlet reservoir remains constant l3 t 1 and q œÄ r 2 q œÄ r 2 Œ∏ v Œæ v where q is darcian velocity in the column lt 1 Œ∏ is the porosity of the media in the column dimensionless and Œæ œÄ r 2 Œ∏ l2 as for the instantaneous source at the inlet bound the tracer concentration in the pre inlet reservoir is novakowski 1992a 12 c in t t 0 c 1 13 v in d c in dt qc in where c 1 is a constant and represents the initial resident concentration of the pre inlet reservoir ml 3 the instantaneous source case implies that a finite mass of tracer enters the pre inlet reservoir instantaneously and is completely mixed with the ambient tracer free water there resulting in an initial concentration of c 1 in the pre inlet reservoir eq 13 similar to eq 11 is a statement of mass conservation for the pre inlet reservoir considering the tracer mixing process in the after outlet reservoir one has 14a v out c out t œÄ r 2 f z q c out where v out œÄ r 2 b out is the volume of the after outlet cylindrical reservoir l3 b out is the height of the after outlet

t z because of rcc at the outlet boundary one has c out c r l t considering the relationship between total discharge q and q e g q œÄ r 2 q above eq 14a is simplified into novakowski 1992a 14b v out c r l t t Œæ d l c r l t z eq 14b is a mass conservation statement for the after outlet reservoir eqs 10 14 are the generalization of the boundary conditions used in previous studies and they incorporate many previously used boundary conditions as special cases for instance when v in 0 or b in 0 meaning that there is no pre inlet reservoir eq 11 becomes c in c 0 which is constant when b out 0 or v out 0 eq 14b reduces to the well known danckwerts boundary condition c r z z l 0 it is interesting to see that the widely used danckwerts condition in previous studies is only valid when the after outlet reservoir is absent a point that has been largely overlooked in previous investigations one point to note is that some investigators argued that the resident concentration could also be discontinuous at the outlet boundary for instance novakowski 1992a stated that the discontinuous boundary condition performed somewhat better than the continuous boundary condition in this study we prefer to maintain the continuous resident concentration at the outlet boundary such as eq 14 based on a few considerations first the model of using the continuous resident concentration at the outlet boundary is mathematically more rigorous second it acknowledges the influence of the outlet boundary on the column test in contrast the model with the discontinuous outlet boundary uses a semi infinite column assumption novakowski 1992a novakowski 1992b thus completely ignores the influence of the outlet boundary or the after outlet reservoir on the column test third our new experiments which will be reported below demonstrate that the model with the continuous boundary condition works the best to interpret the experimental data when the sampling location inside the column is far from the outlet 2 2 analytical solutions in this study the laplace transform method will be employed to derive the analytical solutions based on two commonly used scale dependent dispersivity models the linear asymptotic model and the exponential model to facilitate the analysis we will define dimensionless parameters as follows c d c r c 0 c in d c in c 0 c out d c out c 0 z d z l t d tv rl b in d b in l b out d b out l l 0 d l 0 l d 0 d d l lv p e l Œ± p e 0 l Œ± 0 Œº d Œº l v where the subscript d denotes the dimensionless terms hereinafter and pe stands for peclet number such dimensionless parameters only work for the continuous tracer injection and c 0 should be changed to c 1 for the instantaneous tracer injection case c d represents the relative concentration which is also equal to the ratio of the measured electronic conductivity between the solute and the injected tracer 2 2 1 linear asymptotic model of dispersivity the detailed derivations of the following solutions in

in real time domain using analytical inverse laplace transform techniques therefore numerical inverse laplace methods will be employed several numerical methods are available to conduct the inverse laplace transforms including the stehfest method gaver 1966 stehfest 1970a stehfest 1970b the schapery method schapery 1962 the fourier series method dubner and abate 1968 the zakian method halsted and brown 1972 zakian 1969 and so on however many studies demonstrated that not all methods worked for problems related to solute transport hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2007 the stehfest method has been tested in numerous previous investigations e g moench and ogata 1981 chen 1985 zhan et al 2009a zhan et al 2009b wang and zhan 2013 and wang and zhan 2015 and its accuracy and computational efficiency are found to be acceptable in this study the stehfest method will be used to inverse the laplace solutions into the real time solutions the limitation of this method is that numerical oscillation could not be ignored when the peclet number is greater than 1000 wang and zhan 2015 and the accuracy of the numerical inversion will be further checked using a high resolution finite difference solution developed by the authors 2 3 numerical solutions although many previous studies have demonstrated the robustness of the stehfest method for problems related to solute transport it is still necessary to test the accuracy of this method for the problem of concern here in this study two types of models will be employed to compare with the solutions obtained from the stehfest method a high resolution finite difference numerical simulation and a closed form analytical solution e g the ogata banks model which is a special case of this study to suppress the numerical errors like the numerical dispersion and the artificial oscillation in the modeling a non uniform grid system is applied similar to chang and chen 2003 mathias and wen 2015 zhu et al 2019 and zhu and wen 2019 the grid space is sufficiently small near the inlet and outlet boundaries and it increases with distance from these two boundaries the finite difference scheme of eq 3 is c i t 1 r 1 z i 1 2 z i 1 2 Œ± l v d 0 i 1 2 c i 1 c i z i 1 z i Œ± l v d 0 i 1 2 c i c i 1 z i z i 1 v c i 1 c i z i 1 z i Œº c i i 2 3 n 1 where n represents the total number of nodes c i is the concentration at node i the partial differential equation reduces to the ordinary differential equation which could be solved by matlab s ode solver e g ode15 the parameters used in the numerical modeling are mainly adopted from previous studies for instance the spatial information of column is from the experiment of jia et al 2017 the other parameters are from the studies of you and zhan 2013 the porous media with a porosity of Œ∏ 0 37 could be gravel coarse sand or medium sand morris and johnson 1967 fig 2 a and 2b show the comparison of btcs between the numerical and the newly developed solutions based on the stehfest method it is quite obvious that the stehfest method works very well for the problem of this study by comparing the solution of this study and the ogata banks model the difference between them is also negligible as shown in fig s1 in section 3 of supplementary materials 3 experiments 3 1 preparations to test the robustness of the newly developed solutions and to investigate the influence of boundary mixing and scale effects on solute transport concurrently the authors have conducted new laboratory column tests sodium chloride nacl will be used as a conservative tracer to exclude the influence of other factors like biochemical reactions and sorption absorption processes in many previous studies the scale effect has been observed in long columns sometime more than 10 m in length like in huang et al 1995 and garrard et al 2017 those column tests are very time consuming and expensive thus are uncommonly seen most often the column tests are conducted with column lengths less than 1 m now the question we try to answer becomes is the scale dependence of dispersivity clearly visible in a column whose length is in sub meter scale to serve this purpose we choose a short column with 37 cm in length to see if the scale effect of solute transport can be observed or not the experimental setup is schematically shown in fig 1 which includes a vertical acrylic column with an inner radius of 7 cm two reservoirs above and below the sand column which are connected with the outlet and inlet of the columns respectively water flows upward in the column there are two perforated plates placed between the lower reservoir and column and between the upper reservoir and column respectively the heights of two reservoirs above and below the sand column are 5 cm and 6 cm respectively two identical elevated water tanks with the same constant head are connected with a single inlet pipe using valve 1 and valve 2 in fig 1 with one tank containing deionized water and the other containing a pre prepared solute of a constant nacl concentration of 6 g l a flow rate meter is installed to monitor the flow rate entering the pre inlet reservoir such an experimental setup is similar to that used in jia et al 2017 who investigated the production of hydroxyl radicals near the groundwater table as for the porous media used in the column we choose well sorted washed coarse sands with grain sizes ranging from 0 08 cm to 0 1 cm and it is relatively uniform the use of coarse sands is to avoid the possible anomalous transport phenomenon like early arrivals and long tails of btcs that is sometimes seen in fine materials such as fine sands silts and clays zaheer et al 2017 the tracer concentration is calculated using electric conductivity measured by two probes placed at z 8 cm and z 24 cm inside the column and close to the wall e g 1 cm away from the wall the dimensions of probes are small enough for not disturbing the flow and transport field the probes are connected with a personal computer to continuously record the measured concentrations 3 2 description of experimental procedures the experimental procedures are as follows the first step is packing sieved homogeneous sands into the column similar to the column test experiments of huang et al 1995 we firstly completely mix sands and slightly wet them before packing after that the column is packed with prepared sands slowly from the bottom at the locations of z 8 cm and z 24 cm the probes are installed during packing the second step is saturating the sand filled column to minimize the possible air bubbles entrapped in the porous media the column is slowly saturated from bottom to top over a 12 h period this is done by opening valve 1 keeping valve 2 closed as shown in fig 1 to let the tracer free deionized water enter the column from the pre inlet or lower reservoir after fully saturating the sand column we allow water to flow through the saturated sands for three more days to remove any entrapped air the third step is to establish a steady state flow field by fully opening valve 1 to allow deionized water entering the column with a constant flow rate different flow rates can be produced by adjusting the elevation of the water tanks the fourth step is introduction of a continuous source which is implemented by completely closing valve 1 and fully opening valve 2 simultaneously and transport time t is recorded from this moment the flow rate remains the same during this process as the two water tanks are identical the solute entering the pre inlet reservoir is completely mixed using a mixer similarly the solute entering the after outlet reservoir is also completely mixed using a mixer when the solute electrical conductivity in the after outlet reservoir becomes invariant with time one can close valve 2 to terminate the experiment above procedures can be repeated under different flow rates 3 3 data analysis in this study we mainly focus on transport experiment on a coarse sand column under different flow rates the use of multiple flow rates enables us to check the linearity of dispersion coefficient d l and the flow rate which was assumed in most previous studies but was also challenged by a number of investigators who proposed nonlinear relationships between them bharati et al 2017 freeze and cherry 1979 meanwhile the dispersivity is constant for a specific porous media and btcs with different flow rates could be used to evaluate the solutions to serve this purpose the total flow rates of 0 187 œÄ r 2 cm3 s 0 265 œÄ r 2 cm3 s and 0 325 œÄ r 2 cm3 s are used in our column tests and the linear relationship of d l and the flow rate has been confirmed the specific discharges or darcian velocities associated with aforementioned three flow rates are 0 187 cm s 0 265 cm s and 0 325 cm s respectively a point to note is the determination of the staring time for the observed btcs as demonstrated in fig 1 the tracer needs time t 0 to enter the pre inlet reservoir from valve 2 and t 0 l 0 v 0 where l 0 is the length of the inlet pipe from valve 2 to the pre inlet reservoir and v 0 is the flow velocity in the inlet pipe in another word the staring time for btcs is t t 0 now we will use these observed btcs obtained from these column experiments to test the robustness of the newly developed model as the flow rate can be measured one could only calibrate the parameters of dispersivity to test the robustness of the new models in prediction the observed btc at z 8 cm is firstly used for calibration and the estimated parameters are used to predict btc at z 24 cm results demonstrate that the fitting of the observed btcs by the solutions of this study is very well under different experimental conditions as shown in fig 3 a 3c legends of lam and em represent the linear asymptotic dispersivity model and the exponential dispersivity model respectively the estimated parameters are listed in tables 1a and 1b to test the performance of previous models in calibration and prediction of solute transport the solution without mixing effects are employed to best fit the observed btcs e g you and zhan 2013 using the similar best fitting processes in fig 3a 3c assuming that the flow velocity is given the fitting by you and zhan 2013 is found to be unacceptable when only calibrating the dispersivity 4 discussions 4 1 performance of the models in interpreting the experimental data 4 1 1 models without mixing effect as shown in section 3 3 the model without mixing effect could not interpret the experimental data when flow rate is specific in this section we try to use the model of you and zhan 2013 again to best fit the observed btcs as a curiosity when calibrating two sets of parameters including dispersivity and flow rate instead of only calibrating the dispersivity such a best fitting exercise may actually happen when the flow rate is not given surprisingly we find that the fitting is satisfactory as shown in fig 3a 3c however by checking the estimated parameters listed in tables 1a and 1b one may find that the estimated flow velocities vary with locations in each of the three sets of experimental data and the values at z 8 cm and z 24 cm are different from the measured velocities which contradicts the fact that the flow rate in each set of experiment is constant therefore such a satisfactory best fitting in fig 3a 3c is purely an artifact rather than a true reflection of physics this exercise indicates that sometimes a mathematical model established on the basis of an inappropriate conceptual model may still best fit the experimental data but the calibrated parameters are physically unacceptable therefore cautions should be taken to inspect the mixing effects of the pre inlet reservoir for interpreting column tests experimental data which is grossly overlooked in numerous previous studies 4 1 2 models without scale effect to test the influence of the scale effect on solute transport in such a short column the solution of novakowski 1992a is used to best fit the btcs with different flow rates as shown in fig 4 in the model of novakowski 1992a the resident concentrations are discontinuous at both inlet and outlet and the scale effect is neglected the estimated dispersivity and porosity are 5 cm and 0 30 respectively the estimated porosity is smaller than 0 37 which is more close to the reality meanwhile the fitting between the observed and computed btc by novakowski 1992a is good for fig 4a but not for other cases therefore the scale effect could not be ignored similar conclusions has been obtained by you and zhan 2013 4 2 analysis of mixing effect and scale effect 4 2 1 mixing effect on btcs the pre inlet reservoir is needed and works as a buffer zone before delivering the tracer into the column three sets of reservoir dimensions are used to investigate the mixing effect on solute transport b in 3 cm 6 cm and 9 cm the special case of b in 0 cm no inlet reservoir is also presented as a reference fig 5 a and 5b show btcs and the residence time distributions rtds for different b in values respectively rtd represents the first order temporal derivative of the resident concentration versus time at a given location which has been widely used to analyze the anomalous solute transport in porous media particularly the fronts and tails of btcs danckwerts 1953 wang and zhan 2013 comparing fig 5a and 5b one can see that the influence of the pre inlet reservoir dimensions on both btcs and rtds are not negligible the values of btcs decrease with increasing b in and this is because a larger reservoir could reduce the concentration at the inlet boundary due to a stronger mixing effect when b in 0 such a mixing effect disappears and the solutions reduces to those of you and zhan 2013 fig 5b shows that the peak value of rtd decreases with increasing b in while the time corresponding to the peak value increases with increasing b in in the discussion about the mixing effect on solute transport the scale dependent dispersivity is described by the linear asymptotic model we have also conducted similar analysis using the exponential dispersivity model and come with the same conclusions as above 4 2 2 scale effect on btcs in this study two types of models exponential and linear asymptotic models are used to describe the scale effect of dispersivity the linear asymptotic model contains two parameters of l 0 and Œª while the exponential model has one parameter of b to investigate the scale effect on solute transport two sets of Œª three sets of l 0 and three sets of b are introduced for the purpose of comparison fig 6 a and 6b show btcs and rtds for different Œª respectively the location of z 5 cm is within the region in which dispersivity is still linearly changing with distance while the point of z 15 cm is located within the region in which the dispersivity has reached a constant several observations could be made from these two figures firstly the influence of Œª is not negligible and it becomes larger with increasing distance secondly btcs are greater for larger Œª values at the early stage and become smaller with time going this is because a larger Œª results in a larger dispersivity for a constant l 0 at a specific location thirdly the peak values of rtds decrease with increasing Œª fig 7 a and 7b show btcs and rtds for different l 0 respectively l 0 represents the dimension of the region within which the dispersivity linearly changes with distance these two figures demonstrate that a larger l 0 makes both btc and peak values of rtd smaller this is because a larger l 0 could result in a larger dispersivity for a specific Œª as for the exponential model three sets of b are used for the purpose of comparison b 1 3 and 9 fig 8 a and 8b show btcs and rtds for different b btcs increase with increasing b at the early stage while they decrease with increasing b at the late stage the peak values of rtd decrease with increasing b in summary btcs and rtds are sensitive to the scale dependent parameters e g Œª and l 0 for the linear asymptotic model and b for the exponential model when interpreting the experimental data these parameters need to be taken into account 4 3 applicability of new models the new ctt models of this study are 1d in nature and the scale effect is assumed to be spatially dependent cautions should be taken when one attempts to use these models to solve problems in the regional scale due to the following reasons firstly transport in a regional scale aquifer is most likely three dimensional 3d in nature rather than 1d secondly parameters related to reactive transport have scale effect in time and space pacheco et al 2015 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 therefore the estimated transport values obtained from ctt experiments in laboratory scale often could not represent the transport values in regional scale thirdly transport in a heterogeneity aquifer may not be properly described by the fick s law based advection dispersion equation ade model this is particularly true when the aquifer heterogeneity is relatively strong such as those found in made site harvey and gorelick 2000 and cape code site garabedian et al 1991 leblanc et al 1991 however despite of above mentioned limitations the application of new models should not be underestimated for instance laboratory controlled ctt experiments are ones of the most effective methods for investigating transport mechanisms this is because the experimental conditions can be precisely controlled meanwhile such experiments are much easier to conduct inexpensive and require much less time in contrast field experiments in a regional scale are expensive and last for months and years to complete and often have a lot of uncertainties in terms of initial and boundary conditions involved and field heterogeneities encountered as for functions related to scale dependency pacheco 2013 found that the relationship between dispersivity and scale could be logarithmic or linear for some region scale aquifers a number of other studies also addressed the scale dependency functions for flow and transport fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 geiger et al 2010 khaleel et al 2002 nevertheless given the complex of aquifer heterogeneity some investigators argue that it is not always advisable to use an ade based model coupled with a scale dependent dispersivity function and suggest to seek advanced and often time more complex model tools such as fractional advection dispersion model benson et al 2000 continuous time random walk model berkowitz et al 2006 etc however whether or not the performance of those advanced models is better than the scale dependent ade model is an unsettled debate among the hydrogeological community up to present in our opinion the scale dependent ade model still has its merit in describing subsurface transport under certain circumstances and should not be overlooked such an approach certainly works for the ctt experiments conducted in this study 5 conclusions in this study new models of the ctt experiments are established by taking into account the boundary effect the mixing effect and scale effect concurrently and the associated analytical solutions are developed to test the new models a series of laboratory controlled experiments and the finite difference numerical simulations are conducted the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the new mathematical model is versatile in interpreting ctt data as it properly considers a fully coupled three components of the pre inlet reservoir the sand column and the after outlet reservoir based on a mass balance principle this general model encompasses many previous models as special cases 2 this study demonstrates that both the scale effect and the mixing effect are important for solute transport in short column tests and should not be ignored the mixing effect in the pre inlet reservoir could reduce the concentration of btcs 3 btcs and rtds are sensitive with the scale dependent parameters e g Œª and l 0 for the linear asymptotic model and b for the exponential model 4 the controversy of boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the column is resolved by considering the linear asymptotic or the exponential dispersivity models and the mixing effect of the pre inlet and after outlet reservoirs as they eliminated the problem of concurrently satisfying the mass flux continuity and resident concentration continuity at the inlet of the column the danckwerts condition commonly used in previous studies for describing the boundary condition at the column exit is a special case of this study when the after outlet reservoir is absent credit authorship contribution statement quanrong wang conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation methodology project administration

5786,controlled column tracer test ctt experiments become indispensable tools in understanding the physical chemical and biochemical behaviors of solute transport in the subsurface especially for parameter estimation purpose here we find that previous ctt models perform well in calibration when interpreting experimental data under multiple flow rates but not well in prediction probably because they have not taken into consideration of the boundary effect mixing effect and scale effect concurrently in this study new mathematic models and analytical solutions have been developed where the mixing effect has been considered in the pre inlet reservoir and two scale dependent models linear asymptotic and exponential are employed to describe the dispersivity a series of new controlled laboratory experiments and finite difference numerical simulations have also been conducted to test the new models the results show that the newly proposed model performs better than previous models when interpreting breakthrough curves of ctt both scale effect and mixing effect play important roles in the transport processes the long standing controversy of boundary conditions at the inlet of the column has been resolved by considering the linear asymptotic or the exponentially scale dependent dispersivity models and the mixing effect of the pre inlet reservoir specifically such new models effectively eliminate the problem of simultaneously satisfying the mass flux continuity and the resident concentration continuity at the inlet of the column the danckwerts condition commonly used in previous studies for describing the boundary condition at the column exit is found to be a special case of this study when the after outlet reservoir is absent keywords reactive transport column test mixing effect parameter estimation 1 introduction 1 1 background the controlled column tracer test ctt experiment has been widely used to estimate flow and transport parameters of tested porous medium e g porosity dispersivity reaction rates and so on a standard procedure to obtain these values is best fitting the observed breakthrough curves btcs at a given location usually at the exit of a column with solutions of proper mathematical models describing the transport process delgado 2006 gelhar et al 1992 khan and jury 1990 to date many mathematic models have been developed to interpret ctt under various conditions for instance 1 with different types of boundary conditions schwartz et al 1999 2 with or without mixing effect novakowski 1992a novakowski 1992b and 3 with or without the scale effect gao et al 2010 yates 1992 you and zhan 2013 however performance of these models may be satisfactory in calibration when interpreting the experimental data while prediction capability of these models is still poor and sometimes totally unreliable this problem happens in the new experiment of this study that will be described in details later and has also been reported by many others in previous investigations garrard et al 2017 zaheer et al 2017 one possible explanation for this problem is because some previous ctt models fail to describe the most relevant mechanisms involved in the transport process a classical mathematical model of interpreting ctt results in a homogenous porous media is one dimensional 1d with a semi infinite domain and is based on the following assumptions using resident concentration denoted as cr continuity at the inlet boundary a constant dispersivity a constant concentration at the inlet boundary and a zero concentration in the infinite boundary where cr is mass of solute within a fixed unit volume of porous media ml 3 numerous studies reported that such a mathematical model did not always perform well in interpreting ctt results probably because it had not considered the boundary mixing and scale effects concurrently chang and chen 2003 pacheco 2013 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 subsequently this classical model was extended by considering either one or two of the aforementioned three effects and such extended models will be briefly reviewed in the following sections 1 2 models related to inlet boundary condition in the aforementioned classical model it assumes that the resident concentration is continuous at the inlet boundary geiger et al 2010 1 c r z 0 c 0 where z is the coordinate along the flow direction with z 0 at the inlet l and c 0 is the concentration in the pre inlet reservoir ml 3 eq 1 is found not satisfying the mass balance requirement at the inlet as the dispersive transport effect is not considered to consider both advective and dispersive transport processes at the inlet eq 1 is modified as follows parker and van genuchten 1984 2 c r d l v c r z z 0 c 0 where d l is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient along the flow direction l2t 1 v is groundwater flow velocity lt 1 unfortunately eq 2 at the inlet boundary will result in the discontinuity of resident concentration at the inlet because of the use of a non zero dispersion coefficient dl inside the column near the inlet and a zero dispersion coefficient outside the column in the pre inlet reservoir parker and van genuchten 1984 pearson 1959 the difference of btcs under eqs 1 and 2 is obvious for the small peclet number cases or dispersion dominated transport cases novakowski 1992a to answer the question which boundary conditions of eqs 1 and 2 work better many experiments have been conducted and most of them demonstrated that eq 2 performed better than eq 1 in fitting between the observed and computed btcs e g novakowski 1992b schwartz et al 1999 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 and so on actually many recent studies showed that eq 1 also worked well to interpret the experimental data especially for the small peclet number cases e g geiger et al 2010 fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 and so on besides experimental studies khaleel et al 2002 employed a numerical modeling approach to investigate the boundary conditions and recommended eq 2 being used as inlet boundary while eq 1 being used to describe solute transport across a sharp interface between two different porous materials however harvey and gorelick 2000 and leblanc et al 1991 found that eq 1 failed to interpret the asymmetry of the solute arrival time at the outlet when reversing the flow direction they pointed out that the probability of particles crossing the interface might be different when flow direction was changed on the other hand garabedian et al 1991 established a pore scale model to investigate the solute transport boundary value problems using lattice boltzmann approach and concluded that the solution of the pore scale model matched the analytical solutions for either eq 1 or eq 2 in a word the controversy of choosing the inlet boundary condition in ctt has still not been resolved meanwhile the resident concentration continuity rcc and the mass flux continuity mfc could not be satisfied concurrently at the inlet boundary no matter to eq 1 or eq 2 pearson 1959 proposed a piecewise linear function to describe the dispersion coefficient near the inlet making the dispersion coefficient value to be zero at the inlet of the column to satisfy both rcc and mfc requirements however he did not provide a sound physical explanation on why the dispersion coefficient behaved in such a fashion an issue that will be revisited in details in this study 1 3 models related to mixing effect the mixing effect in both column inlet and column outlet is usually overlooked in many previous models as for the inlet boundary c 0 is assumed to be constant and equal to the concentration of the injection tracer from the schematic diagram of ctt as shown in fig 1 one can see that the experimental equipment composes of 1 two elevated tanks filled with tracer free water and tracer included solute respectively 2 probes gtcon 400c to detect the solute conductivity in the column the full scale is 1999 Œºs cm and the detected error is about 1 Œºs cm the maximum measured value is about 1800 Œºs cm in this study thus the detected error might be negligible for the results 3 a data collection personal computer connected with probes 4 a column filled with tested materials sands 5 a pre inlet reservoir below the tested material and an after outlet reservoir above the tested material the elevated water tank is used to saturate the tested material and to produce a steady flow field across the column after that the tracer is injected to the column through an inlet pipe the purpose of the pre inlet reservoir is to provide a buffer region to completely mix the injected tracer before delivering it to the test material in the column the after outlet reservoir is used to mix the solute leaving the column but it is optional and is often absent in many experimental setup before entering into the column the tracer will experience a mixing process in the pre inlet reservoir a process that has been considered by a few investigators before but mostly overlooked by others 1 4 models related to outlet boundary condition as for the treatment of the exit boundary of column a zero concentration in the infinite boundary has been widely used such an exit boundary condition seems baseless as the column length is always finite and sometime quite short e g less than 0 5 m jia et al 2017 wang et al 2013 for a finite column the danckwerts condition or the zero resident concentration gradient condition has been widely applied for the exit boundary danckwerts 1953 and it states that c r z z l 0 where l is the column length l the danckwerts condition is obtained by assuming that the dispersion coefficient is 0 in the after outlet reservoir and resident concentration continuity is remained at the outlet boundary as well similar to the pre inlet boundary of the column the danckwerts condition does not consider the mixing effect in the after outlet reservoir which was addressed by novakowski 1992a 1 5 models related to scale effect the values of dispersivity might be scale dependent and could increase with tracer travel distance or time pacheco et al 2015 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 a phenomenon that has been observed in field scale transport dagan 1988 gelhar et al 1992 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 pickens and grisak 1981b and in laboratory scale ctt gao et al 2010 huang et al 1995 among other factors the scale dependence of dispersivity is often regarded as a consequence of using fickian transport theory to describe transport in a heterogeneous system gelhar et al 1992 pacheco et al 2015 recently fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 investigated the scale effect on dispersivity in both small less than 1 m and large greater than 1 m scale laboratory experiments and field much greater than 1 m experiments they concluded that even for small scale sub meter laboratory experiments the scale effect usually prevailed and was recommended in the modeling exercises fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 to quantify the scale dependent dispersivity there are four types of functions are widely used including linear exponential parabolic and asymptotic ones as summarized by pickens and grisak 1981a up to date many analytical solutions associated with these four types of dispersivity functions have been developed yates 1990 and gao et al 2010 employed the linear model to describe the scale effect of dispersivity logan 1996 and yates 1992 derived analytical solutions based on the exponential function for the scale dependent dispersivity huang et al 1996 gao et al 2012 and sharma and abgaze 2015 presented analytical solutions with the asymptotic scale dependent dispersivity functions the studies of bharati et al 2017 assumed that dispersivity followed a parabolic function a point to note about studies of gao et al 2010 and you and zhan 2013 is that they both used the ctt data from huang et al 1995 in which the columns were very long from a laboratory experimental point of view 12 5 m in length in contrast in most ctts reported so far the column lengths were usually much shorter sometimes less than 1 m in this study we will conduct new column tests using an even shorter column e g 37 cm of length 1 6 objective of this study based on the literature review mentioned above we find that the boundary effect the mixing effect and the scale effect have not been considered simultaneously in previous models this might be the main reason why the previous models performed well in calibration when interpreting the experimental data but did not perform well in prediction the objectives of this study are as follows first to develop new models and solutions considering the boundary effect mixing effect and scale effect concurrently second to conduct a series of new ctt experiments under multiple flow rates specifically the points of observation for making btcs can be either at the outlet of the column or inside the column third to test the new models and previous models using the new experimental data of this study 2 new models of solute transport in a ctt and solutions 2 1 mathematic models based on the coordinate system shown in fig 1 the z axis is upward and vertical and the origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the bottom of the column in a homogeneous sand column the governing equation of solute transport with a linear sorption isotherm and a first order reaction or decay could be written as follows 3 z d l c r z v c r z Œº c r r c r t 4 c r z t t 0 0 5 v c in v c

dispersivity l d 0 is the diffusion coefficient in the porous media l2t 1 which is much smaller than the mechanical dispersion Œ± l v in this study the linear asymptotic model for the scale dependent dispersivity is pickens and grisak 1981a pickens and grisak 1981b you and zhan 2013 8 Œ± l z Œª z 0 z l 0 Œ± 0 l 0 z l where Œ± 0 is the asymptotic dispersivity l Œª represents the growing rate of

dimensionless by checking eqs 8 and 9 one may find that the dispersivity is equal to zero when z 0 such a condition ensures that both rcc and mfc are satisfied at z 0 namely the problem of concurrently satisfying rcc and mfc at the inlet boundary in previous studies liang et al 2018 parker and van genuchten 1984 pearson 1959 will be eliminated by using a linear or exponential scale dependent dispersivity in this study two types of tracer injections will be included continuous injection and instantaneous injection as for the continuous injection considering the mixing process in the pre inlet reservoir see fig 1 one can have the following relationship after considering the mass conservation in the pre inlet reservoir novakowski 1992a 10 c in t t 0 0 11 v in d c in dt q c 0 qc

resulting in an initial concentration of c 1 in the pre inlet reservoir eq 13 similar to eq 11 is a statement of mass conservation for the pre inlet reservoir considering the tracer mixing process in

incorporate many previously used boundary conditions as special cases for instance when v in 0 or b in 0 meaning that there is no pre inlet reservoir eq 11 becomes c in c 0 which is constant when b out 0 or v out 0 eq 14b reduces to the well known danckwerts boundary condition c r z z l 0 it is interesting to see that the widely used danckwerts condition in previous studies is only valid when the after outlet reservoir is absent a point that has been largely overlooked in previous investigations one point to note is that some investigators argued that the resident concentration could also be discontinuous at the outlet boundary for instance novakowski 1992a stated that the discontinuous boundary condition performed somewhat better than the continuous boundary condition in this study we prefer to maintain the continuous resident concentration at the outlet boundary such as eq 14 based on a few considerations first the model of using the continuous resident concentration at the outlet boundary is mathematically more rigorous second it acknowledges the influence of the outlet boundary on the column test in contrast the model with the discontinuous outlet boundary uses a semi infinite column assumption novakowski 1992a novakowski 1992b thus completely ignores the influence of the outlet boundary or the after outlet reservoir on the column test third our new experiments which will be reported below demonstrate that the model with the continuous boundary condition works the best to interpret the experimental data when the sampling location inside the column is far from the outlet 2 2 analytical solutions in this study the laplace transform method will be employed to derive the analytical solutions based on two commonly used scale dependent dispersivity models the linear asymptotic model and the exponential model to facilitate the analysis we will define dimensionless parameters as follows c d c r c 0 c in d c in c 0 c out d c out c 0 z d z l t d tv rl b in

parameters only work for the continuous tracer injection and c 0 should be changed to c 1 for the instantaneous tracer injection case c d represents the relative concentration which is also equal to the ratio of the measured electronic conductivity between the solute and the injected tracer 2 2 1 linear asymptotic model of dispersivity the detailed derivations of the following solutions in

in real time domain using analytical inverse laplace transform techniques therefore numerical inverse laplace methods will be employed several numerical methods are available to conduct the inverse laplace transforms including the stehfest method gaver 1966 stehfest 1970a stehfest 1970b the schapery method schapery 1962 the fourier series method dubner and abate 1968 the zakian method halsted and brown 1972 zakian 1969 and so on however many studies demonstrated that not all methods worked for problems related to solute transport hassanzadeh and pooladi darvish 2007 the stehfest method has been tested in numerous previous investigations e g moench and ogata 1981 chen 1985 zhan et al 2009a zhan et al 2009b wang and zhan 2013 and wang and zhan 2015 and its accuracy and computational efficiency are found to be acceptable in this study the stehfest method will be used to inverse the laplace solutions into the real time solutions the limitation of this method is that numerical oscillation could not be ignored when the peclet number is greater than 1000 wang and zhan 2015 and the accuracy of the numerical inversion will be further checked using a high resolution finite difference solution developed by the authors 2 3 numerical solutions although many previous studies have demonstrated the robustness of the stehfest method for problems related to solute transport it is still necessary to test the accuracy of this method for the problem of concern here in this study two types of models will be employed to compare with the solutions obtained from the stehfest method a high resolution finite difference numerical simulation and a closed form analytical solution e g the ogata banks model which is a special case of this study to suppress the numerical errors like the numerical dispersion and the artificial oscillation in the modeling a non uniform grid system is applied similar to chang and chen 2003 mathias and wen 2015 zhu et al 2019 and zhu and wen 2019 the grid space is sufficiently small near the inlet and outlet boundaries and it increases with distance from these two boundaries the finite difference scheme of eq 3 is c i t 1 r 1 z i 1 2 z i 1 2 Œ± l v d 0 i 1 2 c i 1 c i z i 1 z i Œ± l v d 0 i 1 2 c i c i 1 z i z i 1 v c i 1 c i z i 1 z i Œº c i i 2 3 n 1 where n represents the total number of nodes c i is the concentration at node i the partial differential equation reduces to the ordinary differential equation which could be solved by matlab s ode solver e g ode15 the parameters used in the numerical modeling are mainly adopted from previous studies for instance the spatial information of column is from the experiment of jia et al 2017 the other parameters are from the studies of you and zhan 2013 the porous media with a porosity of Œ∏ 0 37 could be gravel coarse sand or medium sand morris and johnson 1967 fig 2 a and 2b show the comparison of btcs between the numerical and the newly developed solutions based on the stehfest method it is quite obvious that the stehfest method works very well for the problem of this study by comparing the solution of this study and the ogata banks model the difference between them is also negligible as shown in fig s1 in section 3 of supplementary materials 3 experiments 3 1 preparations to test the robustness of the newly developed solutions and to investigate the influence of boundary mixing and scale effects on solute transport concurrently the authors have conducted new laboratory column tests sodium chloride nacl will be used as a conservative tracer to exclude the influence of other factors like biochemical reactions and sorption absorption processes in many previous studies the scale effect has been observed in long columns sometime more than 10 m in length like in huang et al 1995 and garrard et al 2017 those column tests are very time consuming and expensive thus are uncommonly seen most often the column tests are conducted with column lengths less than 1 m now the question we try to answer becomes is the scale dependence of dispersivity clearly visible in a column whose length is in sub meter scale to serve this purpose we choose a short column with 37 cm in length to see if the scale effect of solute transport can be observed or not the experimental setup is schematically shown in fig 1 which includes a vertical acrylic column with an inner radius of 7 cm two reservoirs above and below the sand column which are connected with the outlet and inlet of the columns respectively water flows upward in the column there are two perforated plates placed between the lower reservoir and column and between the upper reservoir and column respectively the heights of two reservoirs above and below the sand column are 5 cm and 6 cm respectively two identical elevated water tanks with the same constant head are connected with a single inlet pipe using valve 1 and valve 2 in fig 1 with one tank containing deionized water and the other containing a pre prepared solute of a constant nacl concentration of 6 g l a flow rate meter is installed to monitor the flow rate entering the pre inlet reservoir such an experimental setup is similar to that used in jia et al 2017 who investigated the production of hydroxyl radicals near the groundwater table as for the porous media used in the column we choose well sorted washed coarse sands with grain sizes ranging from 0 08 cm to 0 1 cm and it is relatively uniform the use of coarse sands is to avoid the possible anomalous transport phenomenon like early arrivals and long tails of btcs that is sometimes seen in fine materials such as fine sands silts and clays zaheer et al 2017 the tracer concentration is calculated using electric conductivity measured by two probes placed at z 8 cm and z 24 cm inside the column and close to the wall e g 1 cm away from the wall the dimensions of probes are small enough for not disturbing the flow and transport field the probes are connected with a personal computer to continuously record the measured concentrations 3 2 description of experimental procedures the experimental procedures are as follows the first step is packing sieved homogeneous sands into the column similar to the column test experiments of huang et al 1995 we firstly completely mix sands and slightly wet them before packing after that the column is packed with prepared sands slowly from the bottom at the locations of z 8 cm and z 24 cm the probes are installed during packing the second step is saturating the sand filled column to minimize the possible air bubbles entrapped in the porous media the column is slowly saturated from bottom to top over a 12 h period this is done by opening valve 1 keeping valve 2 closed as shown in fig 1 to let the tracer free deionized water enter the column from the pre inlet or lower reservoir after fully saturating the sand column we allow water to flow through the saturated sands for three more days to remove any entrapped air the third step is to establish a steady state flow field by fully opening valve 1 to allow deionized water entering the column with a constant flow rate different flow rates can be produced by adjusting the elevation of the water tanks the fourth step is introduction of a continuous source which is implemented by completely closing valve 1 and fully opening valve 2 simultaneously and transport time t is recorded from this moment the flow rate remains the same during this process as the two water tanks are identical the solute entering the pre inlet reservoir is completely mixed using a mixer similarly the solute entering the after outlet reservoir is also completely mixed using a mixer when the solute electrical conductivity in the after outlet reservoir becomes invariant with time one can close valve 2 to terminate the experiment above procedures can be repeated under different flow rates 3 3 data analysis in this study we mainly focus on transport experiment on a coarse sand column under different flow rates the use of multiple flow rates enables us to check the linearity of dispersion coefficient d l and the flow rate which was assumed in most previous studies but was also challenged by a number of investigators who proposed nonlinear relationships between them bharati et al 2017 freeze and cherry 1979 meanwhile the dispersivity is constant for a specific porous media and btcs with different flow rates could be used to evaluate the solutions to serve this purpose the total flow rates of 0 187 œÄ r 2 cm3 s 0 265 œÄ r 2 cm3 s and 0 325 œÄ r 2 cm3 s are used in our column tests and the linear relationship of d l and the flow rate has been confirmed the specific discharges or darcian velocities associated with aforementioned three flow rates are 0 187 cm s 0 265 cm s and 0 325 cm s respectively a point to note is the determination of the staring time for the observed btcs as demonstrated in fig 1 the tracer needs time t 0 to enter the pre inlet reservoir from valve 2 and t 0 l 0 v 0 where l 0 is the length of the inlet pipe from valve 2 to the pre inlet reservoir and v 0 is the flow velocity in the inlet pipe in another word the staring time for btcs is t t 0 now we will use these observed btcs obtained from these column experiments to test the robustness of the newly developed model as the flow rate can be measured one could only calibrate the parameters of dispersivity to test the robustness of the new models in prediction the observed btc at z 8 cm is firstly used for calibration and the estimated parameters are used to predict btc at z 24 cm results demonstrate that the fitting of the observed btcs by the solutions of this study is very well under different experimental conditions as shown in fig 3 a 3c legends of lam and em represent the linear asymptotic dispersivity model and the exponential dispersivity model respectively the estimated parameters are listed in tables 1a and 1b to test the performance of previous models in calibration and prediction of solute transport the solution without mixing effects are employed to best fit the observed btcs e g you and zhan 2013 using the similar best fitting processes in fig 3a 3c assuming that the flow velocity is given the fitting by you and zhan 2013 is found to be unacceptable when only calibrating the dispersivity 4 discussions 4 1 performance of the models in interpreting the experimental data 4 1 1 models without mixing effect as shown in section 3 3 the model without mixing effect could not interpret the experimental data when flow rate is specific in this section we try to use the model of you and zhan 2013 again to best fit the observed btcs as a curiosity when calibrating two sets of parameters including dispersivity and flow rate instead of only calibrating the dispersivity such a best fitting exercise may actually happen when the flow rate is not given surprisingly we find that the fitting is satisfactory as shown in fig 3a 3c however by checking the estimated parameters listed in tables 1a and 1b one may find that the estimated flow velocities vary with locations in each of the three sets of experimental data and the values at z 8 cm and z 24 cm are different from the measured velocities which contradicts the fact that the flow rate in each set of experiment is constant therefore such a satisfactory best fitting in fig 3a 3c is purely an artifact rather than a true reflection of physics this exercise indicates that sometimes a mathematical model established on the basis of an inappropriate conceptual model may still best fit the experimental data but the calibrated parameters are physically unacceptable therefore cautions should be taken to inspect the mixing effects of the pre inlet reservoir for interpreting column tests experimental data which is grossly overlooked in numerous previous studies 4 1 2 models without scale effect to test the influence of the scale effect on solute transport in such a short column the solution of novakowski 1992a is used to best fit the btcs with different flow rates as shown in fig 4 in the model of novakowski 1992a the resident concentrations are discontinuous at both inlet and outlet and the scale effect is neglected the estimated dispersivity and porosity are 5 cm and 0 30 respectively the estimated porosity is smaller than 0 37 which is more close to the reality meanwhile the fitting between the observed and computed btc by novakowski 1992a is good for fig 4a but not for other cases therefore the scale effect could not be ignored similar conclusions has been obtained by you and zhan 2013 4 2 analysis of mixing effect and scale effect 4 2 1 mixing effect on btcs the pre inlet reservoir is needed and works as a buffer zone before delivering the tracer into the column three sets of reservoir dimensions are used to investigate the mixing effect on solute transport b in 3 cm 6 cm and 9 cm the special case of b in 0 cm no inlet reservoir is also presented as a reference fig 5 a and 5b show btcs and the residence time distributions rtds for different b in values respectively rtd represents the first order temporal derivative of the resident concentration versus time at a given location which has been widely used to analyze the anomalous solute transport in porous media particularly the fronts and tails of btcs danckwerts 1953 wang and zhan 2013 comparing fig 5a and 5b one can see that the influence of the pre inlet reservoir dimensions on both btcs and rtds are not negligible the values of btcs decrease with increasing b in and this is because a larger reservoir could reduce the concentration at the inlet boundary due to a stronger mixing effect when b in 0 such a mixing effect disappears and the solutions reduces to those of you and zhan 2013 fig 5b shows that the peak value of rtd decreases with increasing b in while the time corresponding to the peak value increases with increasing b in in the discussion about the mixing effect on solute transport the scale dependent dispersivity is described by the linear asymptotic model we have also conducted similar analysis using the exponential dispersivity model and come with the same conclusions as above 4 2 2 scale effect on btcs in this study two types of models exponential and linear asymptotic models are used to describe the scale effect of dispersivity the linear asymptotic model contains two parameters of l 0 and Œª while the exponential model has one parameter of b to investigate the scale effect on solute transport two sets of Œª three sets of l 0 and three sets of b are introduced for the purpose of comparison fig 6 a and 6b show btcs and rtds for different Œª respectively the location of z 5 cm is within the region in which dispersivity is still linearly changing with distance while the point of z 15 cm is located within the region in which the dispersivity has reached a constant several observations could be made from these two figures firstly the influence of Œª is not negligible and it becomes larger with increasing distance secondly btcs are greater for larger Œª values at the early stage and become smaller with time going this is because a larger Œª results in a larger dispersivity for a constant l 0 at a specific location thirdly the peak values of rtds decrease with increasing Œª fig 7 a and 7b show btcs and rtds for different l 0 respectively l 0 represents the dimension of the region within which the dispersivity linearly changes with distance these two figures demonstrate that a larger l 0 makes both btc and peak values of rtd smaller this is because a larger l 0 could result in a larger dispersivity for a specific Œª as for the exponential model three sets of b are used for the purpose of comparison b 1 3 and 9 fig 8 a and 8b show btcs and rtds for different b btcs increase with increasing b at the early stage while they decrease with increasing b at the late stage the peak values of rtd decrease with increasing b in summary btcs and rtds are sensitive to the scale dependent parameters e g Œª and l 0 for the linear asymptotic model and b for the exponential model when interpreting the experimental data these parameters need to be taken into account 4 3 applicability of new models the new ctt models of this study are 1d in nature and the scale effect is assumed to be spatially dependent cautions should be taken when one attempts to use these models to solve problems in the regional scale due to the following reasons firstly transport in a regional scale aquifer is most likely three dimensional 3d in nature rather than 1d secondly parameters related to reactive transport have scale effect in time and space pacheco et al 2015 pacheco and van der weijden 2014 therefore the estimated transport values obtained from ctt experiments in laboratory scale often could not represent the transport values in regional scale thirdly transport in a heterogeneity aquifer may not be properly described by the fick s law based advection dispersion equation ade model this is particularly true when the aquifer heterogeneity is relatively strong such as those found in made site harvey and gorelick 2000 and cape code site garabedian et al 1991 leblanc et al 1991 however despite of above mentioned limitations the application of new models should not be underestimated for instance laboratory controlled ctt experiments are ones of the most effective methods for investigating transport mechanisms this is because the experimental conditions can be precisely controlled meanwhile such experiments are much easier to conduct inexpensive and require much less time in contrast field experiments in a regional scale are expensive and last for months and years to complete and often have a lot of uncertainties in terms of initial and boundary conditions involved and field heterogeneities encountered as for functions related to scale dependency pacheco 2013 found that the relationship between dispersivity and scale could be logarithmic or linear for some region scale aquifers a number of other studies also addressed the scale dependency functions for flow and transport fernandez garcia and gomez hernandez 2007 geiger et al 2010 khaleel et al 2002 nevertheless given the complex of aquifer heterogeneity some investigators argue that it is not always advisable to use an ade based model coupled with a scale dependent dispersivity function and suggest to seek advanced and often time more complex model tools such as fractional advection dispersion model benson et al 2000 continuous time random walk model berkowitz et al 2006 etc however whether or not the performance of those advanced models is better than the scale dependent ade model is an unsettled debate among the hydrogeological community up to present in our opinion the scale dependent ade model still has its merit in describing subsurface transport under certain circumstances and should not be overlooked such an approach certainly works for the ctt experiments conducted in this study 5 conclusions in this study new models of the ctt experiments are established by taking into account the boundary effect the mixing effect and scale effect concurrently and the associated analytical solutions are developed to test the new models a series of laboratory controlled experiments and the finite difference numerical simulations are conducted the following conclusions can be drawn from this study 1 the new mathematical model is versatile in interpreting ctt data as it properly considers a fully coupled three components of the pre inlet reservoir the sand column and the after outlet reservoir based on a mass balance principle this general model encompasses many previous models as special cases 2 this study demonstrates that both the scale effect and the mixing effect are important for solute transport in short column tests and should not be ignored the mixing effect in the pre inlet reservoir could reduce the concentration of btcs 3 btcs and rtds are sensitive with the scale dependent parameters e g Œª and l 0 for the linear asymptotic model and b for the exponential model 4 the controversy of boundary conditions at the inlet and outlet of the column is resolved by considering the linear asymptotic or the exponential dispersivity models and the mixing effect of the pre inlet and after outlet reservoirs as they eliminated the problem of concurrently satisfying the mass flux continuity and resident concentration continuity at the inlet of the column the danckwerts condition commonly used in previous studies for describing the boundary condition at the column exit is a special case of this study when the after outlet reservoir is absent credit authorship contribution statement quanrong wang conceptualization data curation formal analysis funding acquisition investigation methodology project administration

5787,budyko s treatment of the long term water balance of watersheds was based on the competition between water availability and energy supply it assumes in the long term that precipitation is the only source of water availability for evapotranspiration while the changes in soil water storage are negligible for arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables however groundwater also can supply crop water demand in addition to irrigation and precipitation in this study we present a new budyko formula considering seasonal groundwater uptake and soil water storage changes estimated by aver yanov s equation and abcd model respectively the use of groundwater depths rather than the variation of groundwater levels makes it more reasonable to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption for the application of the budyko equation in unsteady state areas equivalent precipitation was designed to take the place of precipitation as water availability with the newly defined water availability the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index was described successfully by budyko curves otherwise the points exceeded budyko domain with only precipitation and irrigation considered furthermore for agricultural irrigation areas the variation of seasonal œâ is supposed to be affected by vegetation coverage denoted by ndvi overall it is possible to estimate regional actual seasonal and annual evapotranspiration for irrigation areas with shallow groundwater using the extended budyko models this new method can play significant role in water management in arid and semiarid agricultural regions keywords budyko hypothesis unsteady state conditions irrigation districts shallow groundwater uptake soil water storage change 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important component of hydrological cycle and it links catchment water balance with energy balance accurate estimation of evapotranspiration is required in water resources management and climate change impact studies the long term evapotranspiration can be estimated using the budyko framework budyko 1958 1974 which has been widely used to determine the partitions of available water into evapotranspiration and streamflow gao et al 2017a istanbulluoglu et al 2012 koppa and gebremichael 2017 lhomme and moussa 2016 yao et al 2016 compared with other evapotranspiration models the strengths of the budyko approach include simplicity and minimal model inputs only precipitation p and potential evaporation e 0 some parameter free functions have been derived to determine the partition of available water based on the initial budyko formula in which the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation et p is determined as a function of aridity index e 0 p budyko 1958 1974 these works focused on the impact of regional variation of climate factors and largely ignored spatial variability between watersheds which led to more theoretical studies trying to understand how catchments characteristics influence the proportioning of available water and evapotranspiration during the past decades efforts have been made to introduce parameters into the budyko framework to determine the partitioning of available water into evapotranspiration and streamflow and tried to relate the model parameters to catchment characteristics milly 1993 zhang et al 2001 for example fu 1981 proposed an equation containing a single dimensionless parameter œâ which determines the shape of budyko curves zhang et al 2004 found an average œâ of 2 84 for forested catchments while an average œâ of 2 55 for grassland with œâ ranging between 1 7 and 5 they argued that the forested catchments with deeper roots could extract more water from soil than grassland catchments and so it can be expected that the actual evapotranspiration and the value of œâ would be higher in forested catchments for the same e 0 p based on the data from 26 major global river basins li et al 2013 showed that œâ is linearly positively correlated with the long term averaged annual vegetation coverage choudhury 1999 developed an empirical equation with parameter n introduced which is found to be related closely to œâ in form of œâ n 0 72 yang et al 2008b using a combination of a steady state eco hydrological model with an analytical carbon cost benefit model for plant rooting depth zhang et al 2018 derived an analytical expression between leaf area index lai change and parameter n chen et al 2013 further added a new parameter of œÜ into turc pike equation and found the relation between seasonal values of parameters with ndvi in dry and wet seasons the regional pattern of annual water energy balance has also been found to be closely correlated with the relative infiltration capacity relative soil water storage and the average slope of the catchments yang et al 2007 the budyko approach is based on two assumptions the first one assumes the basins are natural and closed then the precipitation is the only source of water for evapotranspiration and runoff however various studies have shown that the hydrological cycle in many basins have been changed due to human induced land cover change inter basin water transfers and climate change donohue et al 2007 gudmundsson et al 2016 ning et al 2016 wang and stephenson 2018 yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in many regions the amount of actual et exceeds local precipitation such as in arid zone irrigation areas or in arid areas with shallow groundwater cheng et al 2011 du et al 2016 wang and zhou 2016 in such areas a large proportion of et comes directly from shallow unconfined aquifers cohen et al 2006 scott et al 2006 steinwand et al 2006 even accounting for 5 33 of the total et kleidon and heimann 2000 york et al 2002 in irrigation areas the irrigation water must be taken into account in the water balance calculation han et al 2011 the second assumption in the budyko approach is that the water storage change at large basin and over long time scale is negligible attempts to apply the budyko approach to smaller spatial and temporal scales however have concentrated on the roles of soil moisture and shallow groundwater in the water balance which increased the complexity of model and data analysis zhang et al 2008 previous studies highlighted the significance of soil water storage change and groundwater contribution in hydrological processes istanbulluoglu et al 2012 sposito 2017 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2008a particularly for watersheds in arid areas wang and alimohammadi 2012 using et obtained from three common approaches i e observations water balance equations with water storage change considered or not condon and maxwell 2017 concluded that groundwater surface water interactions will affect the budyko relationships to investigate the effect of groundwater dependent evaporation into the budyko framework wang and zhou 2016 assumed that the evapotranspiration in zone with shallow groundwater was proportional to groundwater storage and potential evaporation with the long term measured data of soil moisture and groundwater levels in illinois wang 2012 computed the soil moisture storage change as the difference of total soil water content between two consecutive years while groundwater storage change was converted from the variation of groundwater depths by multiplying the specific yield furthermore the effective precipitation was defined as the difference between precipitation and water storage change these studies showed that the consideration of soil water and groundwater improved the performance of budyko curves at annual scale however because of the limitation of data availability on long term soil moisture and groundwater it s difficult to determine the water storage change in practice in this work the hetao irrigation district was selected as the case study area to examine the applicability of the budyko framework for estimating evapotranspiration from areas with shallow groundwater tables and water storage changes we aim to 1 assess soil water storage change and shallow groundwater uptake over variable timescales then 2 modify the boundary conditions of the budyko framework to accommodate other water sources and 3 analyze the influences on the seasonal variation of parameter œâ in fu s equation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid located in the upstream of the yellow river basin in inner mongolia is the third largest irrigation district in china there are five subdistricts from west to east yigan irrigation district ygid jiefangzha irrigation district jid yongji irrigation district yjid yichang irrigation district ycid and wulate irrigation district wid as an important grain production region the hid covers an area of 10 68 103 km2 of which more than 60 are irrigated land based on available datasets jid yjid ycid and wid were selected as the study area which were divided further into 10 specified subordinate basins according to the boundaries of the main water delivery canals and drainage ditches throughout the hid fig 1 the ten basins are named after the main control canals table 1 with a mean annual precipitation of 170 mm and pan evaporation of 2300 mm the study area is classified as a typical arid and semiarid continental climate zone the average annual temperature is 8 8 while the minimum and maximum temperatures are 12 3 in january and 23 8 in july respectively suffered from severe water shortage the agricultural production in the hid is dependent on flood irrigation with water diverted from the yellow river after the introduction of mandated reduction in water allocation since 2003 the mean annual amount of irrigation water for the hid is around 4 7 billion m3 the mass water diversion for irrigation events results in shallow groundwater depth ranging from 1 to 2 5 m within one year fig 2 depicts the detailed process of seasonal groundwater dynamic during the year the hid is a closed basin with a small slope of 0 02 from southwest to northeast the darcy velocity 0 002 0 005 cm day estimated from the small hydraulic gradient of 0 01 0 025 indicates that the magnitude of horizontal flow exchange between the hid and surrounding areas can be negligible compared with that of the vertical flow exchange xu et al 2010 the vertical movements including infiltration and evaporation become the main behaviors of water flow exchange yu et al 2010 four periods are identified during the year according to the water table variations the first period thawing period is from mid march to late april at the beginning of which the soil zone is frozen and then groundwater is recharged by the infiltration of thawing water from upper layers as the temperature rises meanwhile the first irrigation event accelerates the increase rate of groundwater table the second period crop growing period is from early may to late september the capillary upward movement of groundwater to meet crop water demand and drainage induce an obvious decline in groundwater levels the third period autumn irrigation period is from late september to late october or early november when irrigation the amount of irrigation water accounts for 1 3 of the total is used to flush accumulated salt from the soil surface due to strong evaporation and to prepare for the next season s crop which causes a rapid rise in the water table the fourth period freezing period is from early november to next mid march during when the continuous decline of groundwater level is mainly caused by the upward movement of groundwater to supply upper freezing zone 2 1 1 data description a total of 228 observation wells have been installed over the whole district to monitor the groundwater level variation every 5 days from 1990 to 2013 based on geographical information system gis inverse distance weighting idw interpolation and spatial analyst methods were applied to capture the mean monthly values of groundwater levels for 10 subordinate basins the monthly data of precipitation 1990 2013 water diversion for irrigation through main canals 1990 2013 pan evaporation 20 cm pan 1990 2013 of 10 subordinate basins and annual drainage data of four subdistricts 2000 2013 were measured and provided by the hetao irrigation district administration to conduct the analysis of budyko hypothesis on regional scale the irrigation amount was estimated by water diversion divided by the whole cover area including the irrigated and non irrigated lands the monthly et over period of 2000 2013 estimated by sebal model in our previous study were used as the actual et to calibrate the parameters of abcd model chen et al 2018 the outputs of sebal model were fitted well by the measured results obtained from field experiment data with r 2 of 0 57 and mre of 12 95 the annual values were calculated as the sum of monthly data the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is derived from mod13a2 downloaded from the nasa data center at https reverb echo nasa gov more detailed information about the data

to capture the inaccessible data with explicit structure and easy obtainment of input parameters abcd model proposed by thomas 1981 was applied in this study as shown in the initial structure chart

groundwater uptake et gwi and supposed to be included in available water as well chen et al 2018 chen et al 2016 gao et al 2017b liu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 thus the water balance in eq 1 can be re expressed as follow with shallow groundwater uptake introduced fig 3b 4 p i i i e t gwi e t i d r i g r i Œ¥ s i and the modified available water is determined as 5 w i p i i i et gwi s i 1 the

annual drainage of four subdistricts owing to the level difference between drain water and groundwater was used for calibration with the area weighed values of simulated base flow from abcd model in addition the monthly et i was compared with the outputs of sebal model the optimal values of four parameters were obtained by minimizing the values of root mean square error rmse between simulated and observed results using the data from 2010 to 2013 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r 2 were applied to evaluate the fitness of abcd model 2 1 3 extended budyko formula fu s equation in the general budyko formula the evapotranspiration ratio e t p can be expressed as a function of aridity index e 0 p 13 et p f e 0 p where et is the actual evapotranspiration mm e 0 is the potential evaporation mm converted from 20 cm pan evaporation multiplied by a constant of 0 55 in this study chen et al 2018 ren et al 2002 and p is the local precipitation mm with a dimensionless parameter œâ introduced to reflect the comprehensive effects of basin characteristics on et i e vegetation soil and topography fu s equation fu 1981 was adopted in this study 14 et p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p œâ 1 œâ to apply fu s equation under the unsteady state conditions wherein the natural hydrological processes have been disturbed by human activities the equivalent precipitation p e is used as the proxy for water availability du et al 2016 han et al 2011 zhang et al 2001 the denominators of evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index are substituted by equivalent precipitation as well derived from equation 4 applicable for upper soil layer with soil moisture change Œ¥ s i considered the monthly p ei can be described as follow chen et al 2013 wang 2012 15 p ei p i i i e t gwi Œ¥ s i the monthly groundwater uptake et gwi is calculated by the modified aver yanov s phreatic evaporation equation which was proved to perform well in estimating

root length cheng 1993 e pani is the monthly water surface evaporation measured by pan evaporation mm h i is the mean monthly groundwater depth m h max is the critical groundwater depth at which the phreatic evaporation will vanish m and n is a dimensionless empirical coefficient related to soil texture ranging from 1 to 3 groundwater uptake is expected to occur mainly during crop growing period under the control of shallow groundwater and strong potential evaporation compared with the insignificant impact at multiple annual scale change of soil water storage at annual scale still deserves attention yokoo et al 2008 the annual p e is calculated as the accumulation of monthly precipitation irrigation and water storage change the significance of groundwater and soil water in annual and monthly water balance will be tested in section 3 3 results 3 1 calibration of abcd model the calibrated abcd model performed well in estimating the values of et compared with that of sebal model with rmse of 12 52 mm nse of 0 93 and r 2 of 0 97 while the points of simulated baseflow and measured drainage fell around 1 1 line with rmse of 15 64 mm nse of 0 37 and r 2 of 0 73 fig 4 according to the calibration accuracy it s reasonable to believe that the other simulated components of abcd model were accurate 3 2 change of soil water storage and groundwater uptake 3 2 1 monthly scale to examine the role of water storage change including soil moisture change and groundwater uptake in the monthly water balance of the hid the variation of Œ¥ s i and e t gwi were tested respectively as shown in fig 5 according to the application of irrigation events the whole year was divided into irrigation period may to october and fallow period november to subsequent april during the early irrigation period from may to july the soil moisture increased and the mean values of Œ¥ s i were positive with a range from 15 to 60 mm mon accounting for 20 to 40 of total water availability by august when the break of irrigation events lasted for about 20 days the moisture stored in vadose layers before was consumed by strong active crop growth leading to the negative values of Œ¥ s i during the late irrigation period september and october soil moisture storage increased again with the heavy autumn flood irrigation and the values of Œ¥ s i peaked at around 120 mm mon in october fig 5a1 over the same period the mean values of e t gwi increased from may and peaked in june at around 50 mm mon and then decreased gradually as the groundwater levels kept declining fig 5a2 during the fallow period the mean values of Œ¥ s i ranged from 15 to 77 mm mon and groundwater uptake was less than 15 mm mon for the low evaporative demand in march and april the strong wind induced strong evapotranspiration and accelerated the consumption rate of soil water and groundwater fig 5b 3 2 2 annual scale as shown in fig 6 a the mean annual values of soil moisture storage change in different areas floating near zero indicated that the soil moisture storage change can be negligible for a long enough time scale however the magnitude of annual soil water carryover ranging from 200 to 200 mm suggested that soil water plays an important role in annual water balance the soil water storage in northeast changed in larger ranges which can be attributed to the sensitivity of soil moisture to the shallow groundwater tables gao et al 2017b han et al 2015 liu et al 2016 meanwhile the annual groundwater uptake varied from 150 to 300 mm and accounted to around one third of the total water supply furthermore the groundwater consumption is obviously dependent on the depth of groundwater for the shallower groundwater depths in the northeast of the hid ycid and wid the amount of groundwater uptake was 77 7 mm yr more than that in jid and yjid fig 6b 3 3 extended budyko formula 3 3 1 monthly budyko formula to indicate the role of water storage change in the variability of et firstly we test the original budyko formula in which water storage is neglected fig 7 a obviously the evapotranspiration ratio increased linearly with the increasing aridity index while most of the points fell above the energy water limit boundary line of budyko space these results imply that the actual et was more than the amount of water availability i p indicating the total of irrigation and precipitation was insufficient to support crop water demand it is noticed that the values of et i p during crop growing period was generally less than 3 over the fallow period however the maximum of et i p values could reach up to 200 because of the very little water availability e g 0 1 mm after introducing the shallow groundwater uptake and storage change of soil water into water availability the points of improved evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index are shown in fig 7b as a response to the effect of water storage change the modified points of data tended to move downward for smaller values of evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index as compared with the original budyko curves plotted well in the original budyko domains as expected the scattering data showing a clear seasonal characteristic is attributed to the integrated influence of catchment property the fitted values of monthly œâ for each basin obtained by minimizing the values of rmse between the budyko modelled et p e and the estimated ones are listed in table 2 the values of œâ within one year increased progressively from fallow period to crop growing period and reached its peak in may with average ranging from 1 93 to 3 86 fig 8 during april to september with high aridity index most of water availability was evaporated directly because of the active crop growth resulting in larger values of evapotranspiration ratio and œâ during fallow period including freezing period and thawing period however the water storage change is focused on the interaction between groundwater and soil water storage the negligible evapotranspiration from bare land after harvesting is responsible for the small values of evapotranspiration ratio and œâ 3 3 2 annual budyko formula at annual scale the response of et i p to e 0 i p tended to behave as linear curves rather than the budyko curves while assuming water storage was negligible fig 9 a with the values of e 0 i p varying from 1 to 2 5 most of the points under arid conditions exceeded the water limit boundary represented by et i p 1 revealing the exitance of external water resource for crop water consumption using the newly defined equivalent precipitation as the proxy of water availability the points of newly defined aridity index shift along the vertical direction with a range of 0 5 to 2 while the data of evapotranspiration ratio falling in the region limited by water and energy boundary fig 9b the balance between water availability and energy supply can be explained well by budyko relationship due to the location proximity of subordinate basins there was no significant difference between annual values of œâ by minimizing the values of rmse the match value of œâ in the hid is 3 24 4 discussion 4 1 linear relationship between e t i p and e 0 i p as can be seen from figs 7a and 9a the obvious linear relationships between et i p and e 0 i p were captured on both monthly and annual scales for the agricultural irrigation districts the buffering effect of soil water storage and the adaption of crops to climate are responsible for the strong linear relationship cheng et al 2011 after each irrigation event part of irrigation water infiltrates downward to uplift the soil water storage at the same time the crops grow faster by accelerating the rate of transpiration huxman et al 2004 when the crops are suffering from water stress caused by drought however the soil water impounded in vadose zone under wet conditions compensates the water deficit for crop growth meanwhile the crops tend to extract groundwater by deep root uptake to offset the negative influence of water deficit on production the responses of soil water storage and crops to water availability work effectively to reduce the gap between actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration further resulting in the linear relationship between et i p and e 0 i p 4 2 influence factors on seasonal variation of œâ the parameter œâ in fu s equation is regarded as the indicator to reflect the synthetical influence of basin characteristics on et fu 1981 many attempts applied in myriad basins have been made to determine the relation between potential influence factors and œâ caracciolo et al 2018 han et al 2011 li et al 2013 yang et al 2007 yang and yang 2011 yang et al 2008a yang et al 2008b without regard to the static factors i e soil properties terrain etc the proportion of irrigated land to total lands is supposed to affect the variation of œâ among districts and the seasonal variation of œâ in irrigation district was expected to be related with monthly vegetation coverage denoted by ndvi herein different from our expectation ndvi seems to be less responsible for monthly œâ to investigate the reasons the diverse responses of et components i e canopy interception evaporation soil evaporation and plant transpiration to water availability should be taken into account gerrits et al 2009 yuan et al 2010 as a consequence of the rough flood irrigation the evaporation from open water surface and intercepted water within canopy contribute instantly to total et at potential evaporation rate lankreijer et al 1999 likewise water stored in shallow soil layer enters into atmosphere as water vapor after being recharged heitman et al 2008 meanwhile the water availability only influences plant transpiration indirectly by regulating soil moisture and air humidity heitman et al 2008 both immediate reactions to water availability weakened the role of tardive plant transpiration in evaporating consumption even though during the late crop growing period with lush vegetation the result was similar to the study of li et al 2013 who found that the controlling impact of vegetation on the curve shape parameter œâ was diminished in small catchments with areas less than 50 000 km2 the diverse responses of et components and scale dependence of vegetation influence highlighted the significance of hydrothermal changes in water energy balance in addition the different crop water consumption of various crops under same ndvi is also responsible for the weak relationship 4 3 estimation of equivalent precipitation for the long term hydrological process of natural and closed catchments the original budyko frameworks use the precipitation as the only water resource for evapotranspiration and runoff when extended into irrigation districts with shallow groundwater at finer scales however the contribution of soil water storage change and groundwater should be considered as the constitutes of water availability to model the seasonal variability of et based on budyko framework chen et al 2013 calculated the effective precipitation by subtracting changes of soil water and groundwater from precipitation similarly yang et al 2008a used the available water estimated as the sum of precipitation external water and initial soil water storage to simulate regional evapotranspiration in the arid and semi arid area although there are some downward water flux and recharge to groundwater when irrigation is applied almost there are groundwater uptakes at monthly scale in present study considering that the downward recharge to groundwater is difficult to estimate when applying budyko equation in an irrigation district where usually only soil water content and groundwater levels are observed a new calculation method is proposed to estimate water storage change from different perspective in this case the water balance equation is conducted for the upper vadose zone and the upward movement of shallow groundwater is regarded as one of recharge components responsible for the variation of soil water storage change this design separates the recharge and discharge of groundwater which is more consistent with the water availability concept in boundary conditions of the original budyko framework the use of groundwater depth in aver yanov s equation makes it more practical to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption than the use of variation of groundwater levels with the application of irrigation events the fraction of irrigation water serving as infiltration to recharge groundwater may cause repetitive accounting of water availability while considering groundwater uptake separately in fact more than 80 of total annual groundwater uptake occurred during crop growing period april to september when the groundwater table presented a continuously declining trend fig 10 based on the long term groundwater level observation data every five days over period of 1990 2013 the observed rise in groundwater table after each irrigation event ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 m most of irrigation water tends to evaporate before infiltrating to groundwater due to the heavy crop water demand and strong evaporation we estimated the potential errors in groundwater uptake caused by the infiltration of irrigation and rise in groundwater depth as shown in fig 11 even if the groundwater level increased by 0 15 m the mean increase of groundwater uptake accounted for less than 10 of total water supply furthermore the application of averaged values of groundwater levels offsets the effect of errors to an extent over the period of october and november the shallow groundwater depth caused by autumn irrigation only produced 15 of the total amount groundwater uptake while the groundwater uptake from january to march was less than 5 of total fig 10 these results make it acceptable to neglect the double counting of water and regard groundwater uptake as a new component in water availability independent on irrigation and precipitation in this study 5 conclusions aiming to improve the original budyko formula s shortcoming to seasonal and annual water balance of unsteady condition we present a new extended budyko formula to capture the soil water storage change and groundwater contribution to et equivalent precipitation is defined and suggested to be used in boundary conditions as the substitution of local precipitation compared with the previous studies the input of groundwater depth in aver yanov s equation is more practical than the use of groundwater level differences when estimating seasonal groundwater consumption for arid irrigation areas although the role of soil water storage change is almost negligible over multi annual scales it still contributes to annual water balance as well as shallow groundwater the consideration of water storage change in water balance obviously improved the performance of budyko formula under unsteady state conditions for the irrigated agricultural area the performance of extended budyko formula depends on seasonal œâ which is determined by various crop types and crop planting patterns in the future study seasonal œâ change and the driven factors will be considered credit authorship contribution statement hang chen methodology validation formal analysis writing

5787,budyko s treatment of the long term water balance of watersheds was based on the competition between water availability and energy supply it assumes in the long term that precipitation is the only source of water availability for evapotranspiration while the changes in soil water storage are negligible for arid irrigation areas with shallow water tables however groundwater also can supply crop water demand in addition to irrigation and precipitation in this study we present a new budyko formula considering seasonal groundwater uptake and soil water storage changes estimated by aver yanov s equation and abcd model respectively the use of groundwater depths rather than the variation of groundwater levels makes it more reasonable to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption for the application of the budyko equation in unsteady state areas equivalent precipitation was designed to take the place of precipitation as water availability with the newly defined water availability the relationship between evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index was described successfully by budyko curves otherwise the points exceeded budyko domain with only precipitation and irrigation considered furthermore for agricultural irrigation areas the variation of seasonal œâ is supposed to be affected by vegetation coverage denoted by ndvi overall it is possible to estimate regional actual seasonal and annual evapotranspiration for irrigation areas with shallow groundwater using the extended budyko models this new method can play significant role in water management in arid and semiarid agricultural regions keywords budyko hypothesis unsteady state conditions irrigation districts shallow groundwater uptake soil water storage change 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important component of hydrological cycle and it links catchment water balance with energy balance accurate estimation of evapotranspiration is required in water resources management and climate change impact studies the long term evapotranspiration can be estimated using the budyko framework budyko 1958 1974 which has been widely used to determine the partitions of available water into evapotranspiration and streamflow gao et al 2017a istanbulluoglu et al 2012 koppa and gebremichael 2017 lhomme and moussa 2016 yao et al 2016 compared with other evapotranspiration models the strengths of the budyko approach include simplicity and minimal model inputs only precipitation p and potential evaporation e 0 some parameter free functions have been derived to determine the partition of available water based on the initial budyko formula in which the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation et p is determined as a function of aridity index e 0 p budyko 1958 1974 these works focused on the impact of regional variation of climate factors and largely ignored spatial variability between watersheds which led to more theoretical studies trying to understand how catchments characteristics influence the proportioning of available water and evapotranspiration during the past decades efforts have been made to introduce parameters into the budyko framework to determine the partitioning of available water into evapotranspiration and streamflow and tried to relate the model parameters to catchment characteristics milly 1993 zhang et al 2001 for example fu 1981 proposed an equation containing a single dimensionless parameter œâ which determines the shape of budyko curves zhang et al 2004 found an average œâ of 2 84 for forested catchments while an average œâ of 2 55 for grassland with œâ ranging between 1 7 and 5 they argued that the forested catchments with deeper roots could extract more water from soil than grassland catchments and so it can be expected that the actual evapotranspiration and the value of œâ would be higher in forested catchments for the same e 0 p based on the data from 26 major global river basins li et al 2013 showed that œâ is linearly positively correlated with the long term averaged annual vegetation coverage choudhury 1999 developed an empirical equation with parameter n introduced which is found to be related closely to œâ in form of œâ n 0 72 yang et al 2008b using a combination of a steady state eco hydrological model with an analytical carbon cost benefit model for plant rooting depth zhang et al 2018 derived an analytical expression between leaf area index lai change and parameter n chen et al 2013 further added a new parameter of œÜ into turc pike equation and found the relation between seasonal values of parameters with ndvi in dry and wet seasons the regional pattern of annual water energy balance has also been found to be closely correlated with the relative infiltration capacity relative soil water storage and the average slope of the catchments yang et al 2007 the budyko approach is based on two assumptions the first one assumes the basins are natural and closed then the precipitation is the only source of water for evapotranspiration and runoff however various studies have shown that the hydrological cycle in many basins have been changed due to human induced land cover change inter basin water transfers and climate change donohue et al 2007 gudmundsson et al 2016 ning et al 2016 wang and stephenson 2018 yokoo et al 2008 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 in many regions the amount of actual et exceeds local precipitation such as in arid zone irrigation areas or in arid areas with shallow groundwater cheng et al 2011 du et al 2016 wang and zhou 2016 in such areas a large proportion of et comes directly from shallow unconfined aquifers cohen et al 2006 scott et al 2006 steinwand et al 2006 even accounting for 5 33 of the total et kleidon and heimann 2000 york et al 2002 in irrigation areas the irrigation water must be taken into account in the water balance calculation han et al 2011 the second assumption in the budyko approach is that the water storage change at large basin and over long time scale is negligible attempts to apply the budyko approach to smaller spatial and temporal scales however have concentrated on the roles of soil moisture and shallow groundwater in the water balance which increased the complexity of model and data analysis zhang et al 2008 previous studies highlighted the significance of soil water storage change and groundwater contribution in hydrological processes istanbulluoglu et al 2012 sposito 2017 tang et al 2017 wang et al 2009 yang et al 2008a particularly for watersheds in arid areas wang and alimohammadi 2012 using et obtained from three common approaches i e observations water balance equations with water storage change considered or not condon and maxwell 2017 concluded that groundwater surface water interactions will affect the budyko relationships to investigate the effect of groundwater dependent evaporation into the budyko framework wang and zhou 2016 assumed that the evapotranspiration in zone with shallow groundwater was proportional to groundwater storage and potential evaporation with the long term measured data of soil moisture and groundwater levels in illinois wang 2012 computed the soil moisture storage change as the difference of total soil water content between two consecutive years while groundwater storage change was converted from the variation of groundwater depths by multiplying the specific yield furthermore the effective precipitation was defined as the difference between precipitation and water storage change these studies showed that the consideration of soil water and groundwater improved the performance of budyko curves at annual scale however because of the limitation of data availability on long term soil moisture and groundwater it s difficult to determine the water storage change in practice in this work the hetao irrigation district was selected as the case study area to examine the applicability of the budyko framework for estimating evapotranspiration from areas with shallow groundwater tables and water storage changes we aim to 1 assess soil water storage change and shallow groundwater uptake over variable timescales then 2 modify the boundary conditions of the budyko framework to accommodate other water sources and 3 analyze the influences on the seasonal variation of parameter œâ in fu s equation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the hetao irrigation district hid located in the upstream of the yellow river basin in inner mongolia is the third largest irrigation district in china there are five subdistricts from west to east yigan irrigation district ygid jiefangzha irrigation district jid yongji irrigation district yjid yichang irrigation district ycid and wulate irrigation district wid as an important grain production region the hid covers an area of 10 68 103 km2 of which more than 60 are irrigated land based on available datasets jid yjid ycid and wid were selected as the study area which were divided further into 10 specified subordinate basins according to the boundaries of the main water delivery canals and drainage ditches throughout the hid fig 1 the ten basins are named after the main control canals table 1 with a mean annual precipitation of 170 mm and pan evaporation of 2300 mm the study area is classified as a typical arid and semiarid continental climate zone the average annual temperature is 8 8 while the minimum and maximum temperatures are 12 3 in january and 23 8 in july respectively suffered from severe water shortage the agricultural production in the hid is dependent on flood irrigation with water diverted from the yellow river after the introduction of mandated reduction in water allocation since 2003 the mean annual amount of irrigation water for the hid is around 4 7 billion m3 the mass water diversion for irrigation events results in shallow groundwater depth ranging from 1 to 2 5 m within one year fig 2 depicts the detailed process of seasonal groundwater dynamic during the year the hid is a closed basin with a small slope of 0 02 from southwest to northeast the darcy velocity 0 002 0 005 cm day estimated from the small hydraulic gradient of 0 01 0 025 indicates that the magnitude of horizontal flow exchange between the hid and surrounding areas can be negligible compared with that of the vertical flow exchange xu et al 2010 the vertical movements including infiltration and evaporation become the main behaviors of water flow exchange yu et al 2010 four periods are identified during the year according to the water table variations the first period thawing period is from mid march to late april at the beginning of which the soil zone is frozen and then groundwater is recharged by the infiltration of thawing water from upper layers as the temperature rises meanwhile the first irrigation event accelerates the increase rate of groundwater table the second period crop growing period is from early may to late september the capillary upward movement of groundwater to meet crop water demand and drainage induce an obvious decline in groundwater levels the third period autumn irrigation period is from late september to late october or early november when irrigation the amount of irrigation water accounts for 1 3 of the total is used to flush accumulated salt from the soil surface due to strong evaporation and to prepare for the next season s crop which causes a rapid rise in the water table the fourth period freezing period is from early november to next mid march during when the continuous decline of groundwater level is mainly caused by the upward movement of groundwater to supply upper freezing zone 2 1 1 data description a total of 228 observation wells have been installed over the whole district to monitor the groundwater level variation every 5 days from 1990 to 2013 based on geographical information system gis inverse distance weighting idw interpolation and spatial analyst methods were applied to capture the mean monthly values of groundwater levels for 10 subordinate basins the monthly data of precipitation 1990 2013 water diversion for irrigation through main canals 1990 2013 pan evaporation 20 cm pan 1990 2013 of 10 subordinate basins and annual drainage data of four subdistricts 2000 2013 were measured and provided by the hetao irrigation district administration to conduct the analysis of budyko hypothesis on regional scale the irrigation amount was estimated by water diversion divided by the whole cover area including the irrigated and non irrigated lands the monthly et over period of 2000 2013 estimated by sebal model in our previous study were used as the actual et to calibrate the parameters of abcd model chen et al 2018 the outputs of sebal model were fitted well by the measured results obtained from field experiment data with r 2 of 0 57 and mre of 12 95 the annual values were calculated as the sum of monthly data the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is derived from mod13a2 downloaded from the nasa data center at https reverb echo nasa gov more detailed information about the data processing can be found in the study of chen et al 2018 2 1 2 monthly water balance model abcd model when the soil water cannot be obtained directly various monthly water balance models were designed to capture the inaccessible data with explicit structure and easy obtainment of input parameters abcd model proposed by thomas 1981 was applied in this study as shown in the initial structure chart

groundwater uptake et gwi and supposed to be included in available water as well chen et al 2018 chen et al 2016 gao et al 2017b liu et al 2016 wang et al 2016 thus the water balance in eq 1 can be re expressed as follow with shallow groundwater uptake introduced fig 3b 4 p i i i e t gwi e t i d r i g r i Œ¥ s i and the modified available water is determined as 5 w i p i i i et gwi s i 1 the

annual drainage of four subdistricts owing to the level difference between drain water and groundwater was used for calibration with the area weighed values of simulated base flow from abcd model in addition the monthly et i was compared with the outputs of sebal model the optimal values of four parameters were obtained by minimizing the values of root mean square error rmse between simulated and observed results using the data from 2010 to 2013 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r 2 were applied to evaluate the fitness of abcd model 2 1 3 extended budyko formula fu s equation in the general budyko formula the evapotranspiration ratio e t p can be expressed as a function of aridity index e 0 p 13 et p f e 0 p where et is the actual evapotranspiration mm e 0 is the potential evaporation mm converted from 20 cm pan evaporation multiplied by a constant of 0 55 in this study chen et al 2018 ren et al 2002 and p is the local precipitation mm with a dimensionless parameter œâ introduced to reflect the comprehensive effects of basin characteristics on et i e vegetation soil and topography fu s equation fu 1981 was adopted in this study 14 et p 1 e 0 p 1 e 0 p œâ 1 œâ to apply fu s equation under the unsteady state conditions wherein the natural hydrological processes have been disturbed by human activities the equivalent precipitation p e is used as the proxy for water availability du et al 2016 han et al 2011 zhang et al 2001 the denominators of evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index are substituted by equivalent precipitation as well derived from equation 4 applicable for upper soil layer with soil moisture change Œ¥ s i considered the monthly p ei can be described as follow chen et al 2013 wang 2012 15 p ei p i i i e t gwi Œ¥ s i the monthly groundwater uptake et gwi is calculated by the modified aver yanov s phreatic evaporation equation which was proved to perform well in estimating

root length cheng 1993 e pani is the monthly water surface evaporation measured by pan evaporation mm h i is the mean monthly groundwater depth m h max is the critical groundwater depth at which the phreatic evaporation will vanish m and n is a dimensionless empirical coefficient related to soil texture ranging from 1 to 3 groundwater uptake is expected to occur mainly during crop growing period under the control of shallow groundwater and strong potential evaporation compared with the insignificant impact at multiple annual scale change of soil water storage at annual scale still deserves attention yokoo et al 2008 the annual p e is calculated as the accumulation of monthly precipitation irrigation and water storage change the significance of groundwater and soil water in annual and monthly water balance will be tested in section 3 3 results 3 1 calibration of abcd model the calibrated abcd model performed well in estimating the values of et compared with that of sebal model with rmse of 12 52 mm nse of 0 93 and r 2 of 0 97 while the points of simulated baseflow and measured drainage fell around 1 1 line with rmse of 15 64 mm nse of 0 37 and r 2 of 0 73 fig 4 according to the calibration accuracy it s reasonable to believe that the other simulated components of abcd model were accurate 3 2 change of soil water storage and groundwater uptake 3 2 1 monthly scale to examine the role of water storage change including soil moisture change and groundwater uptake in the monthly water balance of the hid the variation of Œ¥ s i and e t gwi were tested respectively as shown in fig 5 according to the application of irrigation events the whole year was divided into irrigation period may to october and fallow period november to subsequent april during the early irrigation period from may to july the soil moisture increased and the mean values of Œ¥ s i were positive with a range from 15 to 60 mm mon accounting for 20 to 40 of total water availability by august when the break of irrigation events lasted for about 20 days the moisture stored in vadose layers before was consumed by strong active crop growth leading to the negative values of Œ¥ s i during the late irrigation period september and october soil moisture storage increased again with the heavy autumn flood irrigation and the values of Œ¥ s i peaked at around 120 mm mon in october fig 5a1 over the same period the mean values of e t gwi increased from may and peaked in june at around 50 mm mon and then decreased gradually as the groundwater levels kept declining fig 5a2 during the fallow period the mean values of Œ¥ s i ranged from 15 to 77 mm mon and groundwater uptake was less than 15 mm mon for the low evaporative demand in march and april the strong wind induced strong evapotranspiration and accelerated the consumption rate of soil water and groundwater fig 5b 3 2 2 annual scale as shown in fig 6 a the mean annual values of soil moisture storage change in different areas floating near zero indicated that the soil moisture storage change can be negligible for a long enough time scale however the magnitude of annual soil water carryover ranging from 200 to 200 mm suggested that soil water plays an important role in annual water balance the soil water storage in northeast changed in larger ranges which can be attributed to the sensitivity of soil moisture to the shallow groundwater tables gao et al 2017b han et al 2015 liu et al 2016 meanwhile the annual groundwater uptake varied from 150 to 300 mm and accounted to around one third of the total water supply furthermore the groundwater consumption is obviously dependent on the depth of groundwater for the shallower groundwater depths in the northeast of the hid ycid and wid the amount of groundwater uptake was 77 7 mm yr more than that in jid and yjid fig 6b 3 3 extended budyko formula 3 3 1 monthly budyko formula to indicate the role of water storage change in the variability of et firstly we test the original budyko formula in which water storage is neglected fig 7 a obviously the evapotranspiration ratio increased linearly with the increasing aridity index while most of the points fell above the energy water limit boundary line of budyko space these results imply that the actual et was more than the amount of water availability i p indicating the total of irrigation and precipitation was insufficient to support crop water demand it is noticed that the values of et i p during crop growing period was generally less than 3 over the fallow period however the maximum of et i p values could reach up to 200 because of the very little water availability e g 0 1 mm after introducing the shallow groundwater uptake and storage change of soil water into water availability the points of improved evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index are shown in fig 7b as a response to the effect of water storage change the modified points of data tended to move downward for smaller values of evapotranspiration ratio and aridity index as compared with the original budyko curves plotted well in the original budyko domains as expected the scattering data showing a clear seasonal characteristic is attributed to the integrated influence of catchment property the fitted values of monthly œâ for each basin obtained by minimizing the values of rmse between the budyko modelled et p e and the estimated ones are listed in table 2 the values of œâ within one year increased progressively from fallow period to crop growing period and reached its peak in may with average ranging from 1 93 to 3 86 fig 8 during april to september with high aridity index most of water availability was evaporated directly because of the active crop growth resulting in larger values of evapotranspiration ratio and œâ during fallow period including freezing period and thawing period however the water storage change is focused on the interaction between groundwater and soil water storage the negligible evapotranspiration from bare land after harvesting is responsible for the small values of evapotranspiration ratio and œâ 3 3 2 annual budyko formula at annual scale the response of et i p to e 0 i p tended to behave as linear curves rather than the budyko curves while assuming water storage was negligible fig 9 a with the values of e 0 i p varying from 1 to 2 5 most of the points under arid conditions exceeded the water limit boundary represented by et i p 1 revealing the exitance of external water resource for crop water consumption using the newly defined equivalent precipitation as the proxy of water availability the points of newly defined aridity index shift along the vertical direction with a range of 0 5 to 2 while the data of evapotranspiration ratio falling in the region limited by water and energy boundary fig 9b the balance between water availability and energy supply can be explained well by budyko relationship due to the location proximity of subordinate basins there was no significant difference between annual values of œâ by minimizing the values of rmse the match value of œâ in the hid is 3 24 4 discussion 4 1 linear relationship between e t i p and e 0 i p as can be seen from figs 7a and 9a the obvious linear relationships between et i p and e 0 i p were captured on both monthly and annual scales for the agricultural irrigation districts the buffering effect of soil water storage and the adaption of crops to climate are responsible for the strong linear relationship cheng et al 2011 after each irrigation event part of irrigation water infiltrates downward to uplift the soil water storage at the same time the crops grow faster by accelerating the rate of transpiration huxman et al 2004 when the crops are suffering from water stress caused by drought however the soil water impounded in vadose zone under wet conditions compensates the water deficit for crop growth meanwhile the crops tend to extract groundwater by deep root uptake to offset the negative influence of water deficit on production the responses of soil water storage and crops to water availability work effectively to reduce the gap between actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration further resulting in the linear relationship between et i p and e 0 i p 4 2 influence factors on seasonal variation of œâ the parameter œâ in fu s equation is regarded as the indicator to reflect the synthetical influence of basin characteristics on et fu 1981 many attempts applied in myriad basins have been made to determine the relation between potential influence factors and œâ caracciolo et al 2018 han et al 2011 li et al 2013 yang et al 2007 yang and yang 2011 yang et al 2008a yang et al 2008b without regard to the static factors i e soil properties terrain etc the proportion of irrigated land to total lands is supposed to affect the variation of œâ among districts and the seasonal variation of œâ in irrigation district was expected to be related with monthly vegetation coverage denoted by ndvi herein different from our expectation ndvi seems to be less responsible for monthly œâ to investigate the reasons the diverse responses of et components i e canopy interception evaporation soil evaporation and plant transpiration to water availability should be taken into account gerrits et al 2009 yuan et al 2010 as a consequence of the rough flood irrigation the evaporation from open water surface and intercepted water within canopy contribute instantly to total et at potential evaporation rate lankreijer et al 1999 likewise water stored in shallow soil layer enters into atmosphere as water vapor after being recharged heitman et al 2008 meanwhile the water availability only influences plant transpiration indirectly by regulating soil moisture and air humidity heitman et al 2008 both immediate reactions to water availability weakened the role of tardive plant transpiration in evaporating consumption even though during the late crop growing period with lush vegetation the result was similar to the study of li et al 2013 who found that the controlling impact of vegetation on the curve shape parameter œâ was diminished in small catchments with areas less than 50 000 km2 the diverse responses of et components and scale dependence of vegetation influence highlighted the significance of hydrothermal changes in water energy balance in addition the different crop water consumption of various crops under same ndvi is also responsible for the weak relationship 4 3 estimation of equivalent precipitation for the long term hydrological process of natural and closed catchments the original budyko frameworks use the precipitation as the only water resource for evapotranspiration and runoff when extended into irrigation districts with shallow groundwater at finer scales however the contribution of soil water storage change and groundwater should be considered as the constitutes of water availability to model the seasonal variability of et based on budyko framework chen et al 2013 calculated the effective precipitation by subtracting changes of soil water and groundwater from precipitation similarly yang et al 2008a used the available water estimated as the sum of precipitation external water and initial soil water storage to simulate regional evapotranspiration in the arid and semi arid area although there are some downward water flux and recharge to groundwater when irrigation is applied almost there are groundwater uptakes at monthly scale in present study considering that the downward recharge to groundwater is difficult to estimate when applying budyko equation in an irrigation district where usually only soil water content and groundwater levels are observed a new calculation method is proposed to estimate water storage change from different perspective in this case the water balance equation is conducted for the upper vadose zone and the upward movement of shallow groundwater is regarded as one of recharge components responsible for the variation of soil water storage change this design separates the recharge and discharge of groundwater which is more consistent with the water availability concept in boundary conditions of the original budyko framework the use of groundwater depth in aver yanov s equation makes it more practical to estimate seasonal groundwater consumption than the use of variation of groundwater levels with the application of irrigation events the fraction of irrigation water serving as infiltration to recharge groundwater may cause repetitive accounting of water availability while considering groundwater uptake separately in fact more than 80 of total annual groundwater uptake occurred during crop growing period april to september when the groundwater table presented a continuously declining trend fig 10 based on the long term groundwater level observation data every five days over period of 1990 2013 the observed rise in groundwater table after each irrigation event ranged from 0 01 to 0 1 m most of irrigation water tends to evaporate before infiltrating to groundwater due to the heavy crop water demand and strong evaporation we estimated the potential errors in groundwater uptake caused by the infiltration of irrigation and rise in groundwater depth as shown in fig 11 even if the groundwater level increased by 0 15 m the mean increase of groundwater uptake accounted for less than 10 of total water supply furthermore the application of averaged values of groundwater levels offsets the effect of errors to an extent over the period of october and november the shallow groundwater depth caused by autumn irrigation only produced 15 of the total amount groundwater uptake while the groundwater uptake from january to march was less than 5 of total fig 10 these results make it acceptable to neglect the double counting of water and regard groundwater uptake as a new component in water availability independent on irrigation and precipitation in this study 5 conclusions aiming to improve the original budyko formula s shortcoming to seasonal and annual water balance of unsteady condition we present a new extended budyko formula to capture the soil water storage change and groundwater contribution to et equivalent precipitation is defined and suggested to be used in boundary conditions as the substitution of local precipitation compared with the previous studies the input of groundwater depth in aver yanov s equation is more practical than the use of groundwater level differences when estimating seasonal groundwater consumption for arid irrigation areas although the role of soil water storage change is almost negligible over multi annual scales it still contributes to annual water balance as well as shallow groundwater the consideration of water storage change in water balance obviously improved the performance of budyko formula under unsteady state conditions for the irrigated agricultural area the performance of extended budyko formula depends on seasonal œâ which is determined by various crop types and crop planting patterns in the future study seasonal œâ change and the driven factors will be considered credit authorship contribution statement hang chen methodology validation formal analysis writing

5788,springs are the natural discharge points of groundwater they are of considerable value for drinking water supply and some springs are of historical and tourism value however increasing industrial and urban expansion has led to serious problems of overdraft of groundwater resources which in turn had caused the disappearance of springs globally thus the protection of springs while at the same time allowing for the use of local groundwater resources is an important task of water resources management in this study we propose a new multi objective simulation and optimization s o model to find an optimal extraction strategy which balances the competitive relationship between spring outflow and groundwater extraction in the newly developed model the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are taken as the decision variables and maximization of groundwater extraction and maximization of spring outflow are taken as the two objective functions baotu spring which is located in northern china has been famous since the shang dynasty 1600 bce however baotu spring has been drying up since the 1990s due to over extraction of the local groundwater thus we take baotu spring as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model simultaneously a multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea the multi objective fast harmony search algorithm mofhs which is coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow code modflow is adopted to search the pareto optimal solutions the optimal extraction strategies the optimization results of baotu spring field during the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 show that more groundwater resources could be extracted without threatening the sustainable outflow of baotu spring and black tiger spring the optimization results for different hydrological years show that climate variability mainly in precipitation is an important factor when choosing the optimal extraction strategy the optimization results of baotu spring in northern china show that the newly developed model is a promising tool to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies which can protect springs while maximizing the

groundwater is one of the major resources for drinking water supply irrigation and industry richey et al 2015 khosraxi et al 2018 a spring is a natural discharge point of groundwater and plays a vital role in groundwater circulation systems elhatip and g√ºnay 1998 oraseanu and mather 2000 labat et al 2002 birk et al 2004 obolewski et al 2016 liu et al 2018 some springs have played a significant role in human history and cultural development e g qian et al 2006 sato et al 2015 generally a spring field refers to the independent hydrogeological unit where springs are located e g wang et al 2009 sun et al 2014 gao 2016 in this hydrogeological unit the outflow of springs is directly affected by other discharges such as groundwater extraction by wells therefore if the groundwater is over drafted in a spring field the outflow of the spring will decrease or even stop completely with the rapid increase of population and the development of industry water demand is continuously growing especially in dry areas where groundwater is the main water resource over extraction of groundwater is common e g wu and xu 2005 zhang et al 2017 the baotu spring in jinan shandong province is a very famous tourist attraction in china historically baotu spring can be dated back to the shang dynasty some 3500 years ago anonymous spring and autumn annals since then baotu spring has repeatedly been mentioned in the traditional chinese literature however because of the overdraft of groundwater resources for human consumption baotu spring has suffered from frequent drying up since 1972 between 1999 and 2002 baotu spring seized flowing for approximately 926 days liu et al 2018 the local government has taken a series of actions to protect baotu spring including such as importing water from the yellow and yangtze rivers and the artificial recharge the water imported from other watersheds has already become a main source of water supply in jinan city covering about 44 of the total water use in 2017 jwrb and jurwab 2017 especially in recent years the groundwater abstraction at mount la and dayang village in the baotu spring field has been stopped the question remains whether the exploitation of groundwater in the baotu spring field should be stopped completely or could still be allowed within a reasonable rate adapted to varying hydrological conditions some researchers have focused on how to ensure the outflow of springs while maximizing the sustainable groundwater extraction in the spring field e g qian et al 2006 kang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however most of these previous studies only analyzed the relationship between groundwater abstraction and outflow of springs zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 or considered only one single objective and determined the optimal extraction strategy simply based on comparing a few cases wang and zhang 1999 qian et al 2006 kang et al 2011 in order to get a comprehensive series of optimal groundwater extraction strategies while keeping a sustainable outflow of springs under changing environmental conditions the multi objective simulation and optimization s o method is adopted in this study in recent decades many multi objective s o methods have been successfully applied to solve groundwater management problems in many different fields reed et al 2013 maier et al 2014 maier et al 2019

et al 2017 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 alizadeh et al 2017 the main idea of the multi objective s o method is to find satisfactory groundwater extraction strategies by coupling the multi objective optimization model with the groundwater simulation model therefore there are two major parts in a multi objective s o model the groundwater simulation model and the multi objective optimization model generally the groundwater simulation model describes the state and character of the groundwater flow while the multi objective optimization model with constraints describes the optimization problem we present a new multi objective s o model of groundwater management in a spring field the main purpose of the newly developed model is to balance the competitive relationship between spring protection and groundwater extraction furthermore we take baotu spring field in northern china as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly proposed model comparing with the ga based optimization algorithm the multi objective fast harmony search algorithm mofhs luo et al 2012 does not need the encoding process of the decision variables which will save a lot of calculation time thus the mofhs is more suitable for solving optimization problems with continuous decision variables based on the advantages in finding the pareto optimal solutions of continuous variable optimization problems e g extraction rates of groundwater wells in this study the mofhs is used to find the pareto optimal solutions the optimal extraction strategies of the newly developed multi objective s o model a brief introduction of mofhs is given in section 2 3 below in the following section 2 an overview over the newly developed multi objective s o model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field is given then the numerical simulation model and the multi objective optimization model of baotu spring field are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively an analysis of the optimization results is given in section 5 at the end the conclusion of our research is summarized and the future research directions are given 2 overview over the multi objective s o model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field 2 1 groundwater flow simulation model generally a groundwater flow simulation model is used to calculate the state variables the groundwater head values in this study for the multi objective s o model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field in this study the three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow simulator modflow harbaugh and mcdonald 1996 is adopted to solve the groundwater flow equation in order to be conveniently called by the main optimization program the modflow simulator is changed into subroutine form 2 2 multi objective optimization model of spring protection and sustainable management of

2 p 4 l i x i u i i 1 2 n where y y 1 y 2 y k y yi fi x represents the ith objective function among k objectives y represents the objective function space x x 1 x 2 x n x x represents a n dimensional decision variable vector representing a solution x is the set of all feasible solutions which are constrained by m inequality and p equality constraints li and ui represent the lower and upper bounds of the ith decision variable xi respectively the objective functions and constraints are usually determined by managers for instance minimization of remediation cost and remaining mass of pollutants in aquifers are often taken as the objective functions of multi objective optimal design of groundwater remediation systems singh and minsker 2008 luo et al 2012 yang et al 2013 the constraint conditions include the total number of wells the minimal values of hydraulic head at special locations and the maximal solute concentration in certain areas singh and minsker 2008 luo et al 2012 yang et al 2013 in this study maximizing the extraction of groundwater from different groundwater wells while maximizing the outflow of springs are taken as the objective functions the warning groundwater level at the outlet point of a spring the maximum extraction ability of groundwater wells and the basic water demands constitute the constraint conditions accordingly the two objective functions can be mathematically expressed as 5 maximize f 1 i 1 u k 1 v p i k t k 6 maximize f 2 j 1 w q j where f 1 f 2 are the objective functions for the total amount of extraction and spring outflow respectively u is the total number of the groundwater wells v is the total number of the extraction periods management periods w is the total number of springs pi k is the extraction amount of the ith groundwater well in the kth period tk is the length of the kth period and qj is the total amount of outflow from the jth spring the constraints can be mathematically formulated as 7 h j h j l j 1 w p i min p i k p i max i 1 u k 1 v i 1 u p i k q b k 1 v where hj l is the warning groundwater level for the jth spring w is the number of springs pi min is the minimum amount of water extracted from the ith groundwater well representing the basic groundwater demand pi max is the maximum extraction capacity of the ith groundwater well determined by its maximum pumping capacity and qb is the basic water demand for daily life in the study area 2 3 solution by optimization algorithms the multiple objectives in the s o model are usually conflicting with each other dev 1995 compared with the best solution of a single objective optimization problem the pareto optimal solutions non dominated solutions are usually used to describe the optimal solutions of the multi objective optimization model dev 1995 a pareto optimal solution can be mathematically defined as if x x and if and only if there is no x x satisfying f x f x then x is a pareto optimal solution in the decision variable space x generally in order to find the pareto optimal solutions the original optimization model should be transformed into an unconstrained form by adding penalties to the objective functions if they violate the constraint conditions reed et al 2000 in this study the mofhs is used which has demonstrated its superiority in solving multi objective groundwater management problems luo et al 2012 the main process of the mofhs based multi objective s o model of sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field is shown in fig 1 and described as follows step 1 initialization of the mofhs and the multi objective optimization problem the initial setting of the mofhs algorithm includes setting the control parameters of the mofhs the objective functions the constraint conditions and the stopping criterion of the mofhs the initial population of the mofhs is also set in the first step the initial setting of the optimization problem includes establishment of the multi objective optimization model and the groundwater simulation model of the study area luo et al 2012 step 2 computation of the state variables groundwater levels in this study of the study area by calling the modflow simulator in this study the calculated groundwater levels are then used to judge whether the present extraction strategy can satisfy the constraints step 3 calculation of the objective function values the total amount of groundwater extraction and the total amount of spring flow in the study area of every individual in the present population step 4 ranking of the objective functions by pareto ranking and the selection of the best solutions by elitist selection technologies deb et al 2002 luo et al 2012 step 5 generalization of the new population according to the best individual based on the harmony memory consideration and pitch adjustment rules luo et al 2012 the number of individuals in the new population is the same as that in the initial population step 6 evaluation of the stopping criterion usually the maximally allowed number of the evolutionary generations is taken as the stopping criterion of evolutionary algorithms luo et al 2011 luo et al 2012 if the iteration process reaches the termination criterion the iteration process of mofhs will stop and lead to the output of the pareto optimal solutions the optimal groundwater extraction strategies in this study 3 numerical simulation of groundwater flow in baotu spring field 3 1 background baotu spring field is located in shandong province china see fig 2 based on the previous studies and hydrogeological survey works the contact zone between the older metamorphic rock complex and younger magmatic intrusion mainly along the yellow river and the xiaoqing river is considered as the northern boundary of the spring field the dongwu fault and the mashan fault see fig 2 which are considered as water barriers qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 are taken as the eastern and western boundaries of the spring field the watershed in the southern mountains is taken as the southern boundary of the spring field the baotu spring field thus covers an area of approximately 1486 km2 jurwab 2008 wang et al 2009 from the southern part to the northern part of baotu spring field there are mountains hilly land piedmont inclined plain as well as the yellow river alluvial plain qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 wang et al 2009 the terrain of the study field is high in the south and low in the north which ranges from 26 m above sea level m a s l to 700 m a s l liu et al 2018 the climatic condition of baotu spring field is a typical warm temperature continental monsoon climate the annual mean precipitation is approximately 648 mm and the precipitation is seasonally varying jwrb and jurwab 2017 the wet season lasts from june to september and accounts for 70 of the annual precipitation jurwab 2008 the annual mean potential evaporation of baotu spring field is about 1530 mm which is larger than the annual precipitation jurwab 2008 the relative differences between the precipitation and potential evaporation increase from the southern part to the northern part of the study area jurwab 2008 the yellow river xiaoqing river yufu river and beidasha river are the four major rivers flowing in the study area see fig 2 3 2 geological and hydrological conditions of baotu spring field the tectonic unit of baotu spring field is part of the northern edge of the doming structure in tai mountain the northern wing of the lu zhongnan anticline jurwab 2008 wang et al 2009 the strata in the field include archaean cambrian ordovician and quaternary sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks there are six active faults in the study field including wenzu dongwu qianfoshan chaomidian mashan and ganggou faults which are approximately parallel and aligned with the north south direction jurwab 2008 the hydrogeological conditions of the baotu spring field are complex the main aquifers in the field are quaternary porous aquifers and cambrian ordovician fractured karst aquifers the quaternary porous aquifers are mainly distributed in the yufu river and the beidasha river alluvial fans and the thicknesses of the aquifers are approximately 10 30 m qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 kang et al 2011 the cambrian ordovician fractured karst water is abundant in areas where the fractures and the karst are well connected the most important recharge of baotu spring field is precipitation in the southern mountain areas where the cambrian and ordovician rocks dominate the infiltration of precipitation constitutes the main source of groundwater recharge qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 kang et al 2011 other sources of recharge in baotu spring field include the leakage of rivers and reservoirs and lateral inflows the deep fractured karst aquifer is further recharged by the leakage from the upper quaternary aquifers the direction of groundwater flow is mainly from southeast to northwest and controlled by terrain and faults when the groundwater flow arrives at the northern part of the field the flow is upward due to the blockage by the igneous rocks in the north finally the upward flow reaches the surface and generates the famous jinan spring series such as the baotu spring and the black tiger spring the direction of groundwater flow and the location of baotu spring are shown in fig 2 under natural conditions spring flow is the main discharge of the local groundwater system however because of the rapid urbanization of jinan extraction of groundwater is nowadays the main discharge process which has led to a dramatic decline and even drying up of the spring flow phreatic evaporation in regions of shallow groundwater tables is another way of discharge for the groundwater system 3 3 hydrogeological conceptual model and mathematical model of the groundwater flow in baotu spring field the domain of the hydrogeological conceptual model of groundwater flow in baotu spring field is congruent with the study area therefore the eastern and western boundaries of the conceptual model are dongwu and mashan faults respectively the southern boundary is the lowest part of the middle cambrian zhangxia formation and the northern boundary is on the top of the limestone bed located 600 m below the ground jurwab 2008 based on the hydrogeological conditions of baotu spring field the conceptual model includes three layers the first layer is an unconfined aquifer consisting of the holocene and late pleistocene loose sediments the second layer is an aquitard consisting of quaternary clay the distribution of the second layer is congruent with the first layer the third layer consists of the confined unconfined fractured karst aquifers of cambrian and ordovician ages qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 the boundary conditions for the three layers are set as shown in fig 3 jurwab 2008 the zonation of the hydrogeological parameters is also shown in fig 3 jurwab 2008 kang et al 2011 the recharge infiltration ratios are set according to the jurwab 2008 and kang et al 2011 previous studies revealed that the fractured karst in baotu spring field is well developed and has a uniform water table qian et al 2006 kang et al 2011 therefore in this study the equivalent porous medium model is used as the hydrogeological conceptual model of baotu spring field and a three dimensional transient flow model is used to simulate the groundwater flow in the study area the mathematical model of groundwater flow in the study area can be stated as 8 k h w Œº s h t x y z œâ t 0 h x y z 0 h 0 x y z œâ k n h n Œ≥ 1 0 x y z Œ≥ 1 t 0 h r h œÉ k n h n Œ≥ 2 x y z Œ≥ 2 t 0 where k represents the hydraulic conductivity t represents time h x y z t represents the hydraulic head at time t h 0 x y z represents the initial head Œº s represents the specific storage coefficient and w represents the source and sink items the value of w is the combination of precipitation recharge by irrigation recharge by seepage from reservoirs evapotranspiration from groundwater and the well discharge from the aquifer in this study œâ represents the scale of the study area Œ≥1 and Œ≥3 represent impervious and third type boundaries respectively kn represents the hydraulic conductivity in the direction normal to the boundary surface œÉ represents the thickness of the third type boundary and h r represents the specified head value of the third type boundary 3 4 model identification and verification in this study the mathematical model of groundwater flow in baotu spring field was numerically solved by modflow and the hydrogeological parameters the hydraulic conductivity the specific yield or specific storage of aquifers of the simulation model were identified by the fast harmony search algorithm fhs as in luo et al 2011 the identification period is from 1 october 2012 to 30 september 2013 and the verification period is from 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014 the observation values of groundwater head were provided by the water conservancy research institute of shandong province unpublished data different from other parts of the baotu spring field the temporal variation of groundwater head values in the southern mountain area is significantly larger than that in the northern plain the maximum variation of observed groundwater levels in baotu spring field was about 95 m in 2014 therefore the traditional method of calibration which uses the root mean square error rmse as the objective function to identify hydrogeological parameters would lead to unsatisfactory results after several attempts minimization of the sum of square of relative errors ssre was taken as the objective function during the model identification stage the mathematical form of the model identification objective in this study is as follows 9 obj min i 1 n j 1 m h cal i j h obs i j max h obs i min h obs i where i denotes the ith observation point j denotes the jth observation period n is the total number of observation points m is the total number of observation periods h cal i j is the simulated head value at the ith point in the jth period h obs i j is the observed head value at the ith point in the jth period and max h obs i j and min h obs i j are the maximum and the minimum head values at the ith point over the whole observation period fig 4 shows the observed and computed values of groundwater levels at three observation points baotu spring black tiger spring and j65 see fig 2 the computed values fit the observed water levels well fig 4 in the identification period the maximum absolute errors between the computed and observed values are 0 34 m 0 36 m and 0 31 m at baotu spring black tiger spring and j65 respectively in the verification period the maximum absolute errors between the computed and observed values are 0 36 m 0 37 m and 0 39 m at baotu spring black tiger spring and j65 respectively thus the identified hydrogeological parameters seem reasonable and can be used as the input parameters of the numerical simulation model of groundwater flow in baotu spring field 4 multi objective optimization model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in baotu spring field the multi objective optimization model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in baotu spring field is the same as described in eqs 5 7 the optimization model aims at maximizing both the groundwater extraction and spring outflow in baotu spring field therefore the first objective of the optimization model is to maximize the total amount of groundwater extracted by the groundwater wells including qiaozili cold village ancient city mount emei dayang village and mount la during the management period the location of the six groundwater wells is shown in fig 2 the second objective of the optimization model is to maximize the total amount of the spring outflow including baotu and black tiger springs the constraints include the warning water level 27 5 m a s l at the outlet point of baotu spring the maximum extraction capacity of every groundwater well and the basic water demand q b which is set to 16 104m3 d in our optimization process the decision variables are the amounts of groundwater extracted from different groundwater wells generally the hydrological year in jinan is from july to the following june with the wet season from july to september and the dry season from march to june jurwab 2008 thus the optimization model in this study includes three management periods the first management period is from july to october the second management period is from november to the following february and the third management period is from march to june the period from july 2013 to june 2014 was taken as the total management period in this study thus there are 18 decision variables pumping rates of six groundwater wells in each of three different management periods which correspond to pi k in eq 7 the maximum and minimum values of pi k are presented in table 1 5 optimization results and the sustainable groundwater management strategies based on the multi objective s o framework presented in fig 1 the established multi objective optimization model coupled with the numerical simulation model of groundwater flow was used to find the optimal extracting strategies in baotu spring field the optimization results for the period between july 2013 and june 2014 were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method the optimization results for different hydrological years can provide the water managers with the best optimal exploitation strategies 5 1 optimization results of the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 fig 5 shows the pareto optimal solutions based on the mofhs during the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 the maximum and minimum values of the total groundwater extraction by wells are 1 00 108m3 y and 0 72 108m3 y respectively the maximum and minimum values of spring outflow are 0 51 108m3 y and 0 45 108m3 y respectively every green point in fig 5 represents a pareto optimal solution an optimal groundwater extraction strategy which satisfies all the constraint conditions the water managers can choose one of them as the preferred strategy for instance the pareto solution shown as a red star can be selected as the extraction strategy between july 2013 and june 2014 table 2 shows the extraction distribution of the six groundwater wells during the three management periods for the selected solution compared with the actual extraction in the study field about 0 29 108m3 between july 2013 and june 2014 the total exploitation of the selected solution about 0 90 108m3 is much bigger that is to say more of the groundwater resource can be exploited without the danger of the springs drying up during the three management periods between july 2013 and june 2014 from table 2 it can also be summarized that the extraction is mainly concentrated in qiaozili cold village ancient city and mount emei whereas dayang village only provides a little groundwater during the third management period the exploitation of mount la is equal to zero during all three management periods the reason for the small extraction of dayang village and zero extraction of mount la is because of their close hydraulic connection with the springs which is consistent with previous studies jurwab 2008 in this situation the imported water can be delivered to dayang village and mount la by the public water pipe network to satisfy the basic demand of daily life in order to further analyze the relationship between groundwater extraction of different groundwater wells and outflow of springs the statistics of extraction from different groundwater wells for all pareto optimal solutions green points shown in fig 5 are given in fig 6 rearranged in ascending order by the total extraction amounts it is clear that the extraction of qiaozili cold village ancient city and mount emei almost reach the maximum pumping capacity for all of the pareto optimal solutions while the situations of dayang village and mount la are different the extractions of dayang village and mount la increase parallel to the increasing total extraction which indicates that the differences among different pareto optimal solutions are mainly due to the extractions of dayang village and mount la that is to say dayang village and mount la are the most sensitive groundwater wells for the pareto optimal solutions and these two wells have a decisive influence on the outflow of the springs in order to further study the relationship of extraction during different management periods the distribution of the total extraction during different management periods of the pareto optimal solutions green points shown in fig 5 is given in fig 7 it shows that the total extraction in the first management period is small this is because that the first management period is a groundwater level recovery period with low initial groundwater levels in the study area although the precipitation is abundant the risk of springs drying up would increase if the extraction was increased in this management period therefore the total extraction in the first management period is the lowest the total extraction in the second period lies between the values of the first and the third management periods the reason is that there is a certain amount of groundwater storage after the first management period thus the total extraction in the second management period can be larger than during the first management period considering that the groundwater level in the third management period should satisfy the constraint conditions above the warning level the total extraction is lower than during the third management period comparatively the total extraction in the third management period is mainly located in the top region of fig 7 this is because that there is not only extra recharge e g artificial recharge for the groundwater system during the third period but also more precipitation than in the second management period therefore the extraction rate in the third management period is the largest among three management periods the optimization results of the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 demonstrate that the proposed methodology can find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies in baotu spring field while guaranteeing the sustainable outflow of the springs furthermore comparing with the actual groundwater exploitation during the optimization period there is more groundwater available than is extracted under the preselected extraction strategy 5 2 optimization results under different hydrological years in order to find the pareto optimal solutions which satisfy the conditions for different hydrological years the proposed multi objective s o model is rerun for different hydrological years table 3 shows the precipitation of different typical hydrological years based on the precipitation data from 1960 to 2014 in baotu spring field the optimization results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that at the same extraction level the outflow of springs is increasing from low flow year to high flow year that is because precipitation is the major recharge of the aquifer in the study field fig 8 also indicates that the ranges of the objective functions are increasing from low flow years to high flow years that is to say there is a wider range of extracting strategies from which water managers can select in high flow years compared with normal and low flow years the maximum and minimum values of the objective functions under different hydrological years can be found in table 4 generally the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are varying in different hydrogeological years therefore the outflow of springs may not always be the maximum under a selected optimal extraction strategy taking the total extraction equaling to 0 76 108m3 y as an example the black line in fig 8 the detailed exploitation of different groundwater wells in different hydrological years is shown in table 5 it can be seen that the extraction in the normal flow year is almost equal to the one in the high flow year however the situation in the low flow year is different and the exploitation at dayang village and mount la is nearly 0 in this case the exploitation of mount emei must be increased to ensure the maximization of the total exploitation in normal and high flow years dayang village can provide a certain amount of groundwater during the third management period based on the above analysis the hydrological situation is an important factor in selecting the optimal extraction strategy for the purpose of spring protection water managers can select the best extraction strategy from the overlapping part the pink part of fig 8 for different hydrological years in the overlapping area every pareto optimal solution satisfies the constraint conditions under different hydrological years to further demonstrate the reliability of the pareto optimal solutions in the pink area of fig 8 the extraction strategies for a low flow year in the overlapping area are recalculated for a high and normal flow year respectively the red and blue triangles in fig 8 represent the calculation results the results show that with the increase of extraction the gaps between the recalculated results and the high and normal flow year of spring outflow are increasing this means the spring outflow may not always be the maximum for different hydrological years thus to be safe the extraction objective equaling to 0 71 108m3 y the red star in fig 8 which has the smallest gap among the outflow of springs can be selected as the best extraction strategy in baotu spring field the detailed distribution of extraction of different groundwater wells is shown in table 6 however it needs to be emphasized that the initial conditions for the optimization process play a vital role in the optimal extraction strategies the optimization results under different hydrological years in our study are based on the hydrological conditions in june 2013 if we want to predict the optimal extraction strategy in the future the initial hydrological conditions must be determined first then the pareto optimal solution at the lower left corner of the overlapping part of the pareto front under different hydrological years i e the red star in fig 8 can be selected as the final extraction strategy with the lowest risk 6 conclusion and future research in this study we focused on the solution of the problem of drying up of springs with the help of optimal design of the local groundwater extraction strategy based on the framework of a multi objective s o method we established a new multi objective s o model in a spring field to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies the main purpose is to maximize the groundwater extraction while protecting the springs the mofhs algorithm coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow simulator modflow was used to find the pareto optimal solutions the optimization results for the three management periods between july 2013 and june 2014 demonstrate that the newly developed model can provide decision makers with a series of pareto optimal solutions which satisfy all constraints the optimization results for different hydrologic years indicate that climatic variability precipitation is an important influencing factor when choosing the best extraction strategy water managers can select the best solution from the lower left corner of the overlapping part of the pareto front under different hydrological years for baotu spring field it is important to note that the optimization results in this study are based on the limited data collected by our research team however the proposed multi objective s o model of groundwater management in a spring field is an open system if there are new data in the future the model can be rerun to find more precise pareto optimal solutions in addition if the proposed model is used to solve the spring protection problems in other spring fields only the groundwater flow simulation model and the constraint conditions need to be changed according to the study areas besides we did not consider the strong spatial variability of the fractured karst aquifer system in baotu spring field in our study in order to get more accurate predictions of the groundwater system the spatial variability of the fractured karst aquifers should be considered in the future studies accordingly the computational burden of the multi objective s o model for the field application will increase dramatically when considering the parameter uncertainty related to aquifer heterogeneity by stochastic methods new efficient calculation methods such as parallel computing and surrogate model methods could be introduced in our study we only optimized the compromise relationship between groundwater extraction and the outflow of springs in a spring field efficient reallocation of the extracted groundwater resources combined with the imported surface water should be studied in the future credit authorship contribution statement qiankun luo

5788,springs are the natural discharge points of groundwater they are of considerable value for drinking water supply and some springs are of historical and tourism value however increasing industrial and urban expansion has led to serious problems of overdraft of groundwater resources which in turn had caused the disappearance of springs globally thus the protection of springs while at the same time allowing for the use of local groundwater resources is an important task of water resources management in this study we propose a new multi objective simulation and optimization s o model to find an optimal extraction strategy which balances the competitive relationship between spring outflow and groundwater extraction in the newly developed model the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are taken as the decision variables and maximization of groundwater extraction and maximization of spring outflow are taken as the two objective functions baotu spring which is located in northern china has been famous since the shang dynasty 1600 bce however baotu spring has been drying up since the 1990s due to over extraction of the local groundwater thus we take baotu spring as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly developed model simultaneously a multi objective evolutionary algorithm moea the multi objective fast harmony search algorithm mofhs which is coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow code modflow is adopted to search the pareto optimal solutions the optimal extraction strategies the optimization results of baotu spring field during the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 show that more groundwater resources could be extracted without threatening the sustainable outflow of baotu spring and black tiger spring the optimization results for different hydrological years show that climate variability mainly in precipitation is an important factor when choosing the optimal extraction strategy the optimization results of baotu spring in northern china show that the newly developed model is a promising tool to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies which can protect springs while maximizing the extraction of groundwater resources in a spring field keywords groundwater management spring protection simulation and optimization multi objective optimization mofhs baotu spring 1 introduction groundwater is one of the major resources for drinking water supply irrigation and industry richey et al 2015 khosraxi et al 2018 a spring is a natural discharge point of groundwater and plays a vital role in groundwater circulation systems elhatip and g√ºnay 1998 oraseanu and mather 2000 labat et al 2002 birk et al 2004 obolewski et al 2016 liu et al 2018 some springs have played a significant role in human history and cultural development e g qian et al 2006 sato et al 2015 generally a spring field refers to the independent hydrogeological unit where springs are located e g wang et al 2009 sun et al 2014 gao 2016 in this hydrogeological unit the outflow of springs is directly affected by other discharges such as groundwater extraction by wells therefore if the groundwater is over drafted in a spring field the outflow of the spring will decrease or even stop completely with the rapid increase of population and the development of industry water demand is continuously growing especially in dry areas where groundwater is the main water resource over extraction of groundwater is common e g wu and xu 2005 zhang et al 2017 the baotu spring in jinan shandong province is a very famous tourist attraction in china historically baotu spring can be dated back to the shang dynasty some 3500 years ago anonymous spring and autumn annals since then baotu spring has repeatedly been mentioned in the traditional chinese literature however because of the overdraft of groundwater resources for human consumption baotu spring has suffered from frequent drying up since 1972 between 1999 and 2002 baotu spring seized flowing for approximately 926 days liu et al 2018 the local government has taken a series of actions to protect baotu spring including such as importing water from the yellow and yangtze rivers and the artificial recharge the water imported from other watersheds has already become a main source of water supply in jinan city covering about 44 of the total water use in 2017 jwrb and jurwab 2017 especially in recent years the groundwater abstraction at mount la and dayang village in the baotu spring field has been stopped the question remains whether the exploitation of groundwater in the baotu spring field should be stopped completely or could still be allowed within a reasonable rate adapted to varying hydrological conditions some researchers have focused on how to ensure the outflow of springs while maximizing the sustainable groundwater extraction in the spring field e g qian et al 2006 kang et al 2011 zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however most of these previous studies only analyzed the relationship between groundwater abstraction and outflow of springs zhang et al 2017 liu et al 2018 or considered only one single objective and determined the optimal extraction strategy simply based on comparing a few cases wang and zhang 1999 qian et al 2006 kang et al 2011 in order to get a comprehensive series of optimal groundwater extraction strategies while keeping a sustainable outflow of springs under changing environmental conditions the multi objective simulation and optimization s o method is adopted in this study in recent decades many multi objective s o methods have been successfully applied to solve groundwater management problems in many different fields reed et al 2013 maier et al 2014 maier et al 2019 including optimal design of groundwater remediation system erickson et al 2002 luo et al 2012 2014 yang et al 2017 ouyang et al 2017 optimal design of a long term groundwater monitoring network reed

et al 2017 rajabi and ketabchi 2017 alizadeh et al 2017 the main idea of the multi objective s o method is to find satisfactory groundwater extraction strategies by coupling the multi objective optimization model with the groundwater simulation model therefore there are two major parts in a multi objective s o model the groundwater simulation model and the multi objective optimization model generally the groundwater simulation model describes the state and character of the groundwater flow while the multi objective optimization model with constraints describes the optimization problem we present a new multi objective s o model of groundwater management in a spring field the main purpose of the newly developed model is to balance the competitive relationship between spring protection and groundwater extraction furthermore we take baotu spring field in northern china as a case study to demonstrate the applicability of the newly proposed model comparing with the ga based optimization algorithm the multi objective fast harmony search algorithm mofhs luo et al 2012 does not need the encoding process of the decision variables which will save a lot of calculation time thus the mofhs is more suitable for solving optimization problems with continuous decision variables based on the advantages in finding the pareto optimal solutions of continuous variable optimization problems e g extraction rates of groundwater wells in this study the mofhs is used to find the pareto optimal solutions the optimal extraction strategies of the newly developed multi objective s o model a brief introduction of mofhs is given in section 2 3 below in the following section 2 an overview over the newly developed multi objective s o model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field is given then the numerical simulation model and the multi objective optimization model of baotu spring field are presented in sections 3 and 4 respectively an analysis of the optimization results is given in section 5 at the end the conclusion of our research is summarized and the future research directions are given 2 overview over the multi objective s o model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field 2 1 groundwater flow simulation model generally a groundwater flow simulation model is used to calculate the state variables the groundwater head values in this study for the multi objective s o model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field in this study the three dimensional finite difference groundwater flow simulator modflow harbaugh and mcdonald 1996 is adopted to solve the groundwater flow equation in order to be conveniently called by the main optimization program the modflow simulator is changed into subroutine form 2 2 multi objective optimization model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field a multi objective optimization problem rao 1991 can be mathematically described as 1 maximum y f x f 1 x f 2 x f k x subject to 2 g i x 0 i 1 2 m 3 h i x 0 i 1 2 p 4 l i x i u i i 1 2 n where y y 1 y 2 y k y yi fi x represents the ith objective function among k objectives y represents the objective function space x x 1 x 2 x n x x represents a n dimensional decision variable vector representing a solution x is the set of all feasible solutions which are constrained by m inequality and p equality constraints li and ui represent the lower and upper bounds of the ith decision variable xi respectively the objective functions and constraints are usually determined by managers for instance minimization of remediation cost and remaining mass of pollutants in aquifers are often taken as the objective functions of multi objective optimal design of groundwater remediation systems singh and minsker 2008 luo et al 2012 yang et al 2013 the constraint conditions include the total number of wells the minimal values of hydraulic head at special locations and the maximal solute concentration in certain areas singh and minsker 2008 luo et al 2012 yang et al 2013 in this study maximizing the extraction of groundwater from different groundwater wells while maximizing the outflow of springs are taken as the objective functions the warning groundwater level at the outlet point of a spring the maximum extraction ability of groundwater wells and the basic water demands constitute the constraint conditions accordingly the two objective functions can be mathematically expressed as 5 maximize f 1 i 1 u k 1 v p i k t k 6 maximize f 2 j 1 w q j where f 1 f 2 are the objective functions for the total amount of extraction and spring outflow respectively u is the total number of the groundwater wells v is the total number of the extraction periods management periods w is the total number of springs pi k is the extraction amount of the ith groundwater well in the kth period tk is the length of the kth period and qj is the total amount of outflow from the jth spring the constraints can be mathematically formulated as 7 h j h j l j 1 w p i min p i k p i max i 1 u k 1 v i 1 u p i k q b k 1 v where hj l is the warning groundwater level for the jth spring w is the number of springs pi min is the minimum amount of water extracted from the ith groundwater well representing the basic groundwater demand pi max is the maximum extraction capacity of the ith groundwater well determined by its maximum pumping capacity and qb is the basic water demand for daily life in the study area 2 3 solution by optimization algorithms the multiple objectives in the s o model are usually conflicting with each other dev 1995 compared with the best solution of a single objective optimization problem the pareto optimal solutions non dominated solutions are usually used to describe the optimal solutions of the multi objective optimization model dev 1995 a pareto optimal solution can be mathematically defined as if x x and if and only if there is no x x satisfying f x f x then x is a pareto optimal solution in the decision variable space x generally in order to find the pareto optimal solutions the original optimization model should be transformed into an unconstrained form by adding penalties to the objective functions if they violate the constraint conditions reed et al 2000 in this study the mofhs is used which has demonstrated its superiority in solving multi objective groundwater management problems luo et al 2012 the main process of the mofhs based multi objective s o model of sustainable management of groundwater resources in a spring field is shown in fig 1 and described as follows step 1 initialization of the mofhs and the multi objective optimization problem the initial setting of the mofhs algorithm includes setting the control parameters of the mofhs the objective functions the constraint conditions and the stopping criterion of the mofhs the initial population of the mofhs is also set in the first step the initial setting of the optimization problem includes establishment of the multi objective optimization model and the groundwater simulation model of the study area luo et al 2012 step 2 computation of the state variables groundwater levels in this study of the study area by calling the modflow simulator in this study the calculated groundwater levels are then used to judge whether the present extraction strategy can satisfy the constraints step 3 calculation of the objective function values the total amount of groundwater extraction and the total amount of spring flow in the study area of every individual in the present population step 4 ranking of the objective functions by pareto ranking and the selection of the best solutions by elitist selection technologies deb et al 2002 luo et al 2012 step 5 generalization of the new population according to the best individual based on the harmony memory consideration and pitch adjustment rules luo et al 2012 the number of individuals in the new population is the same as that in the initial population step 6 evaluation of the stopping criterion usually the maximally allowed number of the evolutionary generations is taken as the stopping criterion of evolutionary algorithms luo et al 2011 luo et al 2012 if the iteration process reaches the termination criterion the iteration process of mofhs will stop and lead to the output of the pareto optimal solutions the optimal groundwater extraction strategies in this study 3 numerical simulation of groundwater flow in baotu spring field 3 1 background baotu spring field is located in shandong province china see fig 2 based on the previous studies and hydrogeological survey works the contact zone between the older metamorphic rock complex and younger magmatic intrusion mainly along the yellow river and the xiaoqing river is considered as the northern boundary of the spring field the dongwu fault and the mashan fault see fig 2 which are considered as water barriers qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 are taken as the eastern and western boundaries of the spring field the watershed in the southern mountains is taken as the southern boundary of the spring field the baotu spring field thus covers an area of approximately 1486 km2 jurwab 2008 wang et al 2009 from the southern part to the northern part of baotu spring field there are mountains hilly land piedmont inclined plain as well as the yellow river alluvial plain qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 wang et al 2009 the terrain of the study field is high in the south and low in the north which ranges from 26 m above sea level m a s l to 700 m a s l liu et al 2018 the climatic condition of baotu spring field is a typical warm temperature continental monsoon climate the annual mean precipitation is approximately 648 mm and the precipitation is seasonally varying jwrb and jurwab 2017 the wet season lasts from june to september and accounts for 70 of the annual precipitation jurwab 2008 the annual mean potential evaporation of baotu spring field is about 1530 mm which is larger than the annual precipitation jurwab 2008 the relative differences between the precipitation and potential evaporation increase from the southern part to the northern part of the study area jurwab 2008 the yellow river xiaoqing river yufu river and beidasha river are the four major rivers flowing in the study area see fig 2 3 2 geological and hydrological conditions of baotu spring field the tectonic unit of baotu spring field is part of the northern edge of the doming structure in tai mountain the northern wing of the lu zhongnan anticline jurwab 2008 wang et al 2009 the strata in the field include archaean cambrian ordovician and quaternary sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks there are six active faults in the study field including wenzu dongwu qianfoshan chaomidian mashan and ganggou faults which are approximately parallel and aligned with the north south direction jurwab 2008 the hydrogeological conditions of the baotu spring field are complex the main aquifers in the field are quaternary porous aquifers and cambrian ordovician fractured karst aquifers the quaternary porous aquifers are mainly distributed in the yufu river and the beidasha river alluvial fans and the thicknesses of the aquifers are approximately 10 30 m qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 kang et al 2011 the cambrian ordovician fractured karst water is abundant in areas where the fractures and the karst are well connected the most important recharge of baotu spring field is precipitation in the southern mountain areas where the cambrian and ordovician rocks dominate the infiltration of precipitation constitutes the main source of groundwater recharge qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 kang et al 2011 other sources of recharge in baotu spring field include the leakage of rivers and reservoirs and lateral inflows the deep fractured karst aquifer is further recharged by the leakage from the upper quaternary aquifers the direction of groundwater flow is mainly from southeast to northwest and controlled by terrain and faults when the groundwater flow arrives at the northern part of the field the flow is upward due to the blockage by the igneous rocks in the north finally the upward flow reaches the surface and generates the famous jinan spring series such as the baotu spring and the black tiger spring the direction of groundwater flow and the location of baotu spring are shown in fig 2 under natural conditions spring flow is the main discharge of the local groundwater system however because of the rapid urbanization of jinan extraction of groundwater is nowadays the main discharge process which has led to a dramatic decline and even drying up of the spring flow phreatic evaporation in regions of shallow groundwater tables is another way of discharge for the groundwater system 3 3 hydrogeological conceptual model and mathematical model of the groundwater flow in baotu spring field the domain of the hydrogeological conceptual model of groundwater flow in baotu spring field is congruent with the study area therefore the eastern and western boundaries of the conceptual model are dongwu and mashan faults respectively the southern boundary is the lowest part of the middle cambrian zhangxia formation and the northern boundary is on the top of the limestone bed located 600 m below the ground jurwab 2008 based on the hydrogeological conditions of baotu spring field the conceptual model includes three layers the first layer is an unconfined aquifer consisting of the holocene and late pleistocene loose sediments the second layer is an aquitard consisting of quaternary clay the distribution of the second layer is congruent with the first layer the third layer consists of the confined unconfined fractured karst aquifers of cambrian and ordovician ages qian et al 2006 jurwab 2008 the boundary conditions for the three layers are set as shown in fig 3 jurwab 2008 the zonation of the hydrogeological parameters is also shown in fig 3 jurwab 2008 kang et al 2011 the recharge infiltration ratios are set according to the jurwab 2008 and kang et al 2011 previous studies revealed that the fractured karst in baotu spring field is well developed and has a uniform water table qian et al 2006 kang et al 2011 therefore in this study the equivalent porous medium model is used as the hydrogeological conceptual model of baotu spring field and a three dimensional transient flow model is used to simulate the groundwater flow in the study area the mathematical model of groundwater flow in the study area can be stated as 8 k h w Œº s h t x y z œâ t 0 h x y z 0 h 0 x y z œâ k n h n Œ≥ 1 0 x y z Œ≥ 1 t 0 h r h œÉ k n h n Œ≥ 2 x y z Œ≥ 2 t 0 where k represents the hydraulic conductivity t represents time h x y z t represents the hydraulic head at time t h 0 x y z represents the initial head Œº s represents the specific storage coefficient and w represents the source and sink items the value of w is the combination of precipitation recharge by irrigation recharge by seepage from reservoirs evapotranspiration from groundwater and the well discharge from the aquifer in this study œâ represents the scale of the study area Œ≥1 and Œ≥3 represent impervious and third type boundaries respectively kn represents the hydraulic conductivity in the direction normal to the boundary surface œÉ represents the thickness of the third type boundary and h r represents the specified head value of the third type boundary 3 4 model identification and verification in this study the mathematical model of groundwater flow in baotu spring field was numerically solved by modflow and the hydrogeological parameters the hydraulic conductivity the specific yield or specific storage of aquifers of the simulation model were identified by the fast harmony search algorithm fhs as in luo et al 2011 the identification period is from 1 october 2012 to 30 september 2013 and the verification period is from 1 october 2013 to 30 september 2014 the observation values of groundwater head were provided by the water conservancy research institute of shandong province unpublished data different from other parts of the baotu spring field the temporal variation of groundwater head values in the southern mountain area is significantly larger than that in the northern plain the maximum variation of observed groundwater levels in baotu spring field was about 95 m in 2014 therefore the traditional method of calibration which uses the root mean square error rmse as the objective function to identify hydrogeological parameters would lead to unsatisfactory results after several attempts minimization of the sum of square of relative errors ssre was taken as the objective function during the model identification stage the mathematical form of the model identification objective in this study is as follows 9 obj min i 1 n j 1 m h cal i j h obs i j max h obs i min h obs i where i denotes the ith observation point j denotes the jth observation period n is the total number of observation points m is the total number of observation periods h cal i j is the simulated head value at the ith point in the jth period h obs i j is the observed head value at the ith point in the jth period and max h obs i j and min h obs i j are the maximum and the minimum head values at the ith point over the whole observation period fig 4 shows the observed and computed values of groundwater levels at three observation points baotu spring black tiger spring and j65 see fig 2 the computed values fit the observed water levels well fig 4 in the identification period the maximum absolute errors between the computed and observed values are 0 34 m 0 36 m and 0 31 m at baotu spring black tiger spring and j65 respectively in the verification period the maximum absolute errors between the computed and observed values are 0 36 m 0 37 m and 0 39 m at baotu spring black tiger spring and j65 respectively thus the identified hydrogeological parameters seem reasonable and can be used as the input parameters of the numerical simulation model of groundwater flow in baotu spring field 4 multi objective optimization model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in baotu spring field the multi objective optimization model of spring protection and sustainable management of groundwater resources in baotu spring field is the same as described in eqs 5 7 the optimization model aims at maximizing both the groundwater extraction and spring outflow in baotu spring field therefore the first objective of the optimization model is to maximize the total amount of groundwater extracted by the groundwater wells including qiaozili cold village ancient city mount emei dayang village and mount la during the management period the location of the six groundwater wells is shown in fig 2 the second objective of the optimization model is to maximize the total amount of the spring outflow including baotu and black tiger springs the constraints include the warning water level 27 5 m a s l at the outlet point of baotu spring the maximum extraction capacity of every groundwater well and the basic water demand q b which is set to 16 104m3 d in our optimization process the decision variables are the amounts of groundwater extracted from different groundwater wells generally the hydrological year in jinan is from july to the following june with the wet season from july to september and the dry season from march to june jurwab 2008 thus the optimization model in this study includes three management periods the first management period is from july to october the second management period is from november to the following february and the third management period is from march to june the period from july 2013 to june 2014 was taken as the total management period in this study thus there are 18 decision variables pumping rates of six groundwater wells in each of three different management periods which correspond to pi k in eq 7 the maximum and minimum values of pi k are presented in table 1 5 optimization results and the sustainable groundwater management strategies based on the multi objective s o framework presented in fig 1 the established multi objective optimization model coupled with the numerical simulation model of groundwater flow was used to find the optimal extracting strategies in baotu spring field the optimization results for the period between july 2013 and june 2014 were used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method the optimization results for different hydrological years can provide the water managers with the best optimal exploitation strategies 5 1 optimization results of the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 fig 5 shows the pareto optimal solutions based on the mofhs during the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 the maximum and minimum values of the total groundwater extraction by wells are 1 00 108m3 y and 0 72 108m3 y respectively the maximum and minimum values of spring outflow are 0 51 108m3 y and 0 45 108m3 y respectively every green point in fig 5 represents a pareto optimal solution an optimal groundwater extraction strategy which satisfies all the constraint conditions the water managers can choose one of them as the preferred strategy for instance the pareto solution shown as a red star can be selected as the extraction strategy between july 2013 and june 2014 table 2 shows the extraction distribution of the six groundwater wells during the three management periods for the selected solution compared with the actual extraction in the study field about 0 29 108m3 between july 2013 and june 2014 the total exploitation of the selected solution about 0 90 108m3 is much bigger that is to say more of the groundwater resource can be exploited without the danger of the springs drying up during the three management periods between july 2013 and june 2014 from table 2 it can also be summarized that the extraction is mainly concentrated in qiaozili cold village ancient city and mount emei whereas dayang village only provides a little groundwater during the third management period the exploitation of mount la is equal to zero during all three management periods the reason for the small extraction of dayang village and zero extraction of mount la is because of their close hydraulic connection with the springs which is consistent with previous studies jurwab 2008 in this situation the imported water can be delivered to dayang village and mount la by the public water pipe network to satisfy the basic demand of daily life in order to further analyze the relationship between groundwater extraction of different groundwater wells and outflow of springs the statistics of extraction from different groundwater wells for all pareto optimal solutions green points shown in fig 5 are given in fig 6 rearranged in ascending order by the total extraction amounts it is clear that the extraction of qiaozili cold village ancient city and mount emei almost reach the maximum pumping capacity for all of the pareto optimal solutions while the situations of dayang village and mount la are different the extractions of dayang village and mount la increase parallel to the increasing total extraction which indicates that the differences among different pareto optimal solutions are mainly due to the extractions of dayang village and mount la that is to say dayang village and mount la are the most sensitive groundwater wells for the pareto optimal solutions and these two wells have a decisive influence on the outflow of the springs in order to further study the relationship of extraction during different management periods the distribution of the total extraction during different management periods of the pareto optimal solutions green points shown in fig 5 is given in fig 7 it shows that the total extraction in the first management period is small this is because that the first management period is a groundwater level recovery period with low initial groundwater levels in the study area although the precipitation is abundant the risk of springs drying up would increase if the extraction was increased in this management period therefore the total extraction in the first management period is the lowest the total extraction in the second period lies between the values of the first and the third management periods the reason is that there is a certain amount of groundwater storage after the first management period thus the total extraction in the second management period can be larger than during the first management period considering that the groundwater level in the third management period should satisfy the constraint conditions above the warning level the total extraction is lower than during the third management period comparatively the total extraction in the third management period is mainly located in the top region of fig 7 this is because that there is not only extra recharge e g artificial recharge for the groundwater system during the third period but also more precipitation than in the second management period therefore the extraction rate in the third management period is the largest among three management periods the optimization results of the management period from july 2013 to june 2014 demonstrate that the proposed methodology can find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies in baotu spring field while guaranteeing the sustainable outflow of the springs furthermore comparing with the actual groundwater exploitation during the optimization period there is more groundwater available than is extracted under the preselected extraction strategy 5 2 optimization results under different hydrological years in order to find the pareto optimal solutions which satisfy the conditions for different hydrological years the proposed multi objective s o model is rerun for different hydrological years table 3 shows the precipitation of different typical hydrological years based on the precipitation data from 1960 to 2014 in baotu spring field the optimization results are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that at the same extraction level the outflow of springs is increasing from low flow year to high flow year that is because precipitation is the major recharge of the aquifer in the study field fig 8 also indicates that the ranges of the objective functions are increasing from low flow years to high flow years that is to say there is a wider range of extracting strategies from which water managers can select in high flow years compared with normal and low flow years the maximum and minimum values of the objective functions under different hydrological years can be found in table 4 generally the extraction rates of different groundwater wells are varying in different hydrogeological years therefore the outflow of springs may not always be the maximum under a selected optimal extraction strategy taking the total extraction equaling to 0 76 108m3 y as an example the black line in fig 8 the detailed exploitation of different groundwater wells in different hydrological years is shown in table 5 it can be seen that the extraction in the normal flow year is almost equal to the one in the high flow year however the situation in the low flow year is different and the exploitation at dayang village and mount la is nearly 0 in this case the exploitation of mount emei must be increased to ensure the maximization of the total exploitation in normal and high flow years dayang village can provide a certain amount of groundwater during the third management period based on the above analysis the hydrological situation is an important factor in selecting the optimal extraction strategy for the purpose of spring protection water managers can select the best extraction strategy from the overlapping part the pink part of fig 8 for different hydrological years in the overlapping area every pareto optimal solution satisfies the constraint conditions under different hydrological years to further demonstrate the reliability of the pareto optimal solutions in the pink area of fig 8 the extraction strategies for a low flow year in the overlapping area are recalculated for a high and normal flow year respectively the red and blue triangles in fig 8 represent the calculation results the results show that with the increase of extraction the gaps between the recalculated results and the high and normal flow year of spring outflow are increasing this means the spring outflow may not always be the maximum for different hydrological years thus to be safe the extraction objective equaling to 0 71 108m3 y the red star in fig 8 which has the smallest gap among the outflow of springs can be selected as the best extraction strategy in baotu spring field the detailed distribution of extraction of different groundwater wells is shown in table 6 however it needs to be emphasized that the initial conditions for the optimization process play a vital role in the optimal extraction strategies the optimization results under different hydrological years in our study are based on the hydrological conditions in june 2013 if we want to predict the optimal extraction strategy in the future the initial hydrological conditions must be determined first then the pareto optimal solution at the lower left corner of the overlapping part of the pareto front under different hydrological years i e the red star in fig 8 can be selected as the final extraction strategy with the lowest risk 6 conclusion and future research in this study we focused on the solution of the problem of drying up of springs with the help of optimal design of the local groundwater extraction strategy based on the framework of a multi objective s o method we established a new multi objective s o model in a spring field to find the optimal groundwater extraction strategies the main purpose is to maximize the groundwater extraction while protecting the springs the mofhs algorithm coupled with the commonly used groundwater flow simulator modflow was used to find the pareto optimal solutions the optimization results for the three management periods between july 2013 and june 2014 demonstrate that the newly developed model can provide decision makers with a series of pareto optimal solutions which satisfy all constraints the optimization results for different hydrologic years indicate that climatic variability precipitation is an important influencing factor when choosing the best extraction strategy water managers can select the best solution from the lower left corner of the overlapping part of the pareto front under different hydrological years for baotu spring field it is important to note that the optimization results in this study are based on the limited data collected by our research team however the proposed multi objective s o model of groundwater management in a spring field is an open system if there are new data in the future the model can be rerun to find more precise pareto optimal solutions in addition if the proposed model is used to solve the spring protection problems in other spring fields only the groundwater flow simulation model and the constraint conditions need to be changed according to the study areas besides we did not consider the strong spatial variability of the fractured karst aquifer system in baotu spring field in our study in order to get more accurate predictions of the groundwater system the spatial variability of the fractured karst aquifers should be considered in the future studies accordingly the computational burden of the multi objective s o model for the field application will increase dramatically when considering the parameter uncertainty related to aquifer heterogeneity by stochastic methods new efficient calculation methods such as parallel computing and surrogate model methods could be introduced in our study we only optimized the compromise relationship between groundwater extraction and the outflow of springs in a spring field efficient reallocation of the extracted groundwater resources combined with the imported surface water should be studied in the future credit authorship contribution statement qiankun luo

5789,co seismic and post seismic groundwater response to the sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm along with other teleseismic earthquakes are analyzed in nine water pressure monitoring wells with high sampling rates 40 sps the largest event of the swarm mw 4 6 caused significant water level oscillations of 0 216 bar 2 16 m and sustained water level drop of 0 121 bar 1 21 m the response of groundwater to this event and two other distant large events include co seismic oscillations co seismic undrained sustained change and post seismic drained change in addition the proximity of the earthquake swarm to high resolution monitoring wells provides an opportunity to analyze the changes in the oscillations amplitudes of most events the ratio of the water level to ground motion acceleration amplitudes increased after the mw 4 6 event suggesting that the aquifer poro elastic properties have changed these co seismic amplitude changes are more sensitive measure than the water level response to earth tides that showed no significant change in the phase and amplitude associated with any of the events the maximum amplitude of the oscillations is correlated to the amount of drained response suggested to be caused by activation of a nearby fault and drainage of water between aquifers the undrained behavior is related to poro elastic properties changes within the aquifer and depends on the duration of the oscillations details of the groundwater high sampling rate can shed light on deformation processes that were described previously as step like changes keywords hydroseismograms monitoring wells sustained water level change permeability changes tidal analysis 1 introduction pore pressure oscillations have been shown to correlate with seismic waves and earth tides brodsky et al 2003 cooper et al 1965 kitagawa et al 2011 liu et al 1989 roeloffs 1996 the aquifer fluid pressure fluctuates due to expansion and contraction induced by any stress variations including propagation of seismic waves hsieh et al 1987 in some setups the borehole aquifer system shows a large amplification associated with ground motions generated by earthquakes he and singh 2019 yan et al 2014 2016 permeability changes induced by earthquake have been widely documented kinoshita et al 2015 liao et al 2015 manga et al 2012 petitta et al 2018 rojstaczer et al 1995 changes in permeability are often quantified by calculating the response of the groundwater levels to earth tides with respect to earthquakes elkhoury et al 2006 shi et al 2019 shi et al 2015 2018 zhang et al 2019 in these studies both phase shift and amplitude ratio significantly changed after great earthquakes however there was no detectible change in the phase and amplitude in response to smaller earthquakes mw 6 water level changes induced by earthquake include oscillations and sustained water level changes in response to the propagation of the seismic waves ingebritsen and manga 2019 the sustained water level changes include short term undrained behavior seconds to minutes that reflects changes in the rock properties brodsky et al 2003 wang et al 2001 and longer period hours and days drained behavior associated with groundwater flow amoruso et al 2011 ben zion et al 1990 chia et al 2001 hosono et al 2018 liu et al 2018 shalev et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2009 suggested that s waves may generate shear stress large enough to create damage and enhance the permeability of aquifers enhanced permeability can cause either positive or negative changes in the water level depending on the location of the well with respect to water levels and gradients in the reservoir shi et al 2015 hosono et al 2019 postulated that sudden groundwater drawdown after the mw 7 0 2016 kumamoto earthquake are associated with water migration through open cracks along crustal ruptures the amplitude of the oscillating water level in response to earthquakes depends on the magnitude of the earthquake the distance of the monitoring well from the earthquake poro elastic properties of the aquifer and the geometry of the well cooper et al 1965 the seismic energy density that combines the magnitude and distance is used to relate the variety of hydrologic responses wang and chia 2008 wang and manga 2011 weingarten and ge 2014 showed that for the same seismic energy density the hydrological response was different depending on the frequency content of seismic waves shalev et al 2016a showed that the amplitude of the water level fluctuations reflects the poro elastic properties of the aquifer and these properties might change during the propagation of seismic waves through poro elastic media due to compaction and dilatation the goal of this work is to show that the amplitude response of the water level oscillations to earthquakes changes after a large or close earthquakes high seismic energy we demonstrate this behavior as reflected by the sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm 2 sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm during july and august 2018 the sea of galilee lake kinneret region experienced a seismic swarm consisting of 103 events with magnitude 1 9 mw 4 6 wetzler et al 2019 the seismicity initiated in july 2 2018 with mw 2 3 event followed by mw 4 2 and 4 6 earthquakes fig 1 the majority of the seismicity at the sea of galilee is located to the north west section of the lake about 7 km long 3 km wide and up to 10 km focal depths wetzler et al 2019 suggested that this swarm was triggered by enhanced groundwater extraction from several wells located 10 km west of the sea of galilee here we study the effect of this swarm on the water level change in distant wells located outside the basin table 1 and fig 1 water pressure is monitored using keller druck pa 33x and pa 36xw transmitters in the artesian and open wells respectively these transmitters have an accuracy of 2 10 4 bar 2 mm and resolution of 2 10 5 bar 0 2 mm temperature dependency and

these components should dominate the local rock water interaction at the vicinity of the well events reference locations were obtained by a relocation process following the consistent methodology shown by wetzler and kurzon 2016 3 results oscillations of water pressure induced by seismic waves radiated from events of the 2018 sea of galilee swarm were recorded by all nine wells equipped with the monitoring systems see fig 1 for locations the amplitude of the water level oscillations hydroseismograms due to the seismic events was different at each well depending on the epicentral distance of the wells direction to the event event site azimuth and on the confinement of the aquifers fig 2 however only one well gom√® 1 showed significantly high oscillations in most cases an order of magnitude higher than the rest of the wells gom√® 1 well is located 0 1 km west of the western boundary fault of the hula pull apart basin see garfunkel 1981 for the internal structure of the dead sea transform area this 396 meter deep well was drilled down to the kurnub sandstone group that is confined by a 70 meter thick clay layer the amplitude of the pressure oscillations hydroseismograms in fig 2 in gom√® 1 well were above 0 2 bar 2 m whereas the largest oscillations in the rest of the wells were 0 06 bar 10 cm therefore changes in the aquifers properties sustained effect is observed only in the gom√® 1 well see below smaller response in other wells is not enough to cause any observable sustained effect the frequency of the water level oscillations was affected by the poro elastic properties of the aquifer and by the natural frequency of the borehole cooper et al 1965 he et al 2017 it is possible to calculate the averaged p wave velocity dominating the region by picking the arrival times on each of the hydroseismograms at each of the wells fig 3 this provides a very reasonable estimate of 6 km s the most significant hydrological effects occurred on the 4th of july event mw 4 6 in the gom√® 1 well based on the response of water pressure to deviatoric deformation shalev et al 2016b suggested that gom√® 1 is located within highly fractured rocks during the propagation of the seismic waves through gom√® 1 the recorded water pressure oscillations reached a maximum amplitude of 0 216 bar fig 4 a and a sustained co seismic pressure drop of 2 4 10 3 bar fig 4b the rich data recorded in the wells during the one minute co seismic response and the similarity between the water pressure and the ground motion acceleration data can only be studied due to the high sampling rate fig 4c in the literature similar hydraulic behavior is usually reported as step like pressure change increase or decrease and is not resolved by detailed observations except for cases of long period waves originating from tele seismic earthquakes blanchard and byerly 1935 he et al 2017 the yiftach seismic station and gom√® 1 well are located very close to each other fig 1 at similar epicentral distances 31 and 33 5 km respectively and azimuths for the last six years the water pressure at gom√® 1 has been showing annual fluctuations of winter related increase and summer related decrease fig 5 a three main abrupt disturbances are related to the 2013 mw7 7 pakistan 2017 mw 7 3 iraq iran and 2018 mw 4 6 sea of galilee earthquakes all these earthquakes produced large co seismic oscillations and post seismic sustained changes the entire july august 2018 swarm was recorded in this well including some remote earthquakes fig 5b c the wave induced pressure oscillations were recorded for all events with mw 2 5 occurring in the sea of galilee but only the mw 4 6 earthquake produced sustained water level changes ground motion acceleration data from yiftach station and water pressure oscillation at gom√® 1 well show a good correlation between the maximum amplitudes of these signals the susceptibility of groundwater pressure to the ground motion acceleration wave amplitude is roughly constant with small change after the strongest mw 4 6 event fig 6 the ratio between these amplitudes for two groups of events before and after mw 4 6 event is approximated by linear regression resulting in different slopes 1 05 10 9 bar nm sec2 before the event to 1 08 10 9 bar nm sec2 after the event the accuracy of the regression is very high with r squared above 0 98 see fig 6 the two strongest events before and after mw 4 6 with the best signal to noise ratio provide the most reliable constrain for estimating the change in the slope fig 7 presents the results of the tidal analyses of the six years record from the gom√® 1 well fig 5a the phases and amplitudes of the tidal responses of the water level were calculated with baytap08 program doan et al 2006 tamura et al 1991 the data were divided into 30 day spans with an overlap of 23 days values of the calculated phase shift and the amplitude response of the water level to the m2 tide component are slightly noisy variations associated with the mw 4 6 sea of galilee and two strong remote earthquakes are below the sensitivity of the tidal analyses and are not recognized fig 7 the impact of these earthquakes on the water level changes is summarized in table 2 it includes amplitude of oscillations undrained sustained change during the propagation of the seismic wave and drained sustained change that continues days to months after the earthquake 4 discussion high resolution water level monitoring systems installed in nine wells provide a unique opportunity to study the aquifer response to remote and local earthquakes although the magnitudes of the july 4th 2018 mw 4 6 earthquake and events of the entire swarm were not large their impact on nearby aquifers were recorded by all the monitoring systems the recorded hydroseismograms fig 2 show that the water pressure oscillations were induced by the propagation of seismic waves comparison of the seismic and water pressure records fig 4c demonstrates significant effect of the s waves which cannot be explained in the framework of linear poro elasticity this theory e g wang 2000 predicts that the fluid pressure is affected only by the volumetric strain and ignores any coupling between shear and volumetric components dilation dilatancy volume change under shear loading was first described by reynolds 1885 who invented the term and it was observed in many laboratory experiments including measurements in fractured rocks and granular media lockner et al 1992 david a lockner and stanchits 2002 lyakhovsky et al 2015 paterson 1978 schmitt and zoback 1992 schock and louis 1982 skempton 1954 formulated a poro elastic law in which both volumetric and deviatoric stress components affect pore pressure shalev et al 2016b modified the original skempton relation and connect the pore pressure change Œ¥ p f volumetric strain Œµ v and deviatoric strain Œµ d Œµ 1 Œµ 3 2 1 Œ¥ p f b k u Œµ v n Œµ d where b is the skempton coefficients k u is the undrained bulk modulus wang 2000 and n is the shear strain coupling coefficient shalev et al 2016a related between the n value and the level of damage of the aquifer rocks around the well and found that for gom√® 1 well n 8 5 gpa correlating with damage of 0 9 this was done based on the comparison between water well response and seismograms for the mw 7 7 september 24 2013 pakistan earthquake the presented results show that after the mw 4 6 earthquake the slope of the linear regression between groundwater pressure oscillations and ground accelerations slightly increases fig 6 we suggest here that this change reflects a small change in the poro elastic properties of the aquifer and estimate the new n value and damage level to proceed with this estimation we use strain perturbation caused by the seismic waves which is the ground motion velocities divided by the wave velocity of the considered phase i e body p and s waves or surface waves shearer 2009 the largest amplitude of the ground acceleration data recorded for all events at the yiftach seismic station corresponds to the body s wave phase therefore the proxy for the deviatoric strain is the acceleration amplitude a a divided by the typical frequency f and the s wave velocity vs 2 Œµ d a a f v s during the oscillations induced by the propagation of the shear wave linear poro elasticity predicts that pore pressure changes associated with the volumetric strain are negligible substituting 2 into 1 we can express n value as 3 n Œ¥ p f ca a where c is the frequency dependent coefficient that relates strain to acceleration amplitude since the magnitude range of the earthquakes is small we assume the same typical frequency for all events fig 7 with this assumption using the same c value in 3 for all small events the relative n value change is equal to the change of the slope of the linear regression between the pore pressure to acceleration for the two groups before and after the mw 4 6 event 4 n 1 n 2 Œ¥ p f 1 a a 1 Œ¥ p f 2 a a 2 the pressure acceleration amplitude ratio separately estimated for two groups of events fig 6 is increased from 1 05e to 9 bar nm sec2 to 1 08e 9 bar nm sec2 therefore the effect that the mw 4 6 earthquake had on the n value is calculated by n 1 n 2 1 08 e 9 1 05 e 9 1 03 this means that after the mw 4 6 earthquake the shear strain coupling coefficient increased by 3 from n 8 5 gpa to n 8 7 gpa this new value correlates with damage change of the order 4 0 10 3 shalev et al 2016a only gom√® 1 well showed significantly high oscillations induced by the largest mw 4 6 event order of magnitude higher than most of the wells small responses in gom√® 1 to other events as well as responses of other wells even to the largest mw 4 6 event were not enough to record any observable sustained water level change and resolve any change in the aquifers properties shalev et al 2016a connected the damage accumulation permeability increase and compaction porosity and permeability decrease of the aquifer rocks induced by the seismic shaking with the undrained sustained water level change their model predicts that for a highly damaged zone as in gom√® 1 well the damage accumulation dominates the compaction effect and leads to permeability enhancement and sustained water level drop this change depends on the amplitude frequency and duration of the strain oscillations the mw 4 6 earthquake was the only event in the seismic swarm that was strong enough to produce the observable sustained drop about 2 4 10 3 bar table 2 due to relatively large shaking amplitude and in spite of its short duration the presented data show that the amplitudes of the pressure oscillations induced by strong remote earthquakes mw 7 3 in iraq iran border and mw7 7 in pakistan were about five times lower but the duration of the shaking were significantly longer table 2 long shaking duration leads to even larger undrained sustained decrease the undrained short term response of water levels is followed by the drained response of water levels and it is suggested to occur because of permeability enhancement of nearby faults that create shortcuts between aquifers the deformation mechanism that creates the water level increase or decrease during the drained and undrained response are different the undrained mechanism includes inelastic deformation brodsky et al 2003 wang et al 2001 within the aquifer whereas the drained mechanism includes deformation along a nearby fault slip that connects between aquifers e g hosono et al 2018 sibson 2007 stanislavsky and garven 2003 the slip along the fault depends mostly on the maximum force that acted on the fault and less on the duration we hypothesize that one or several small faults were activated or dynamically triggered during the propagation of the seismic waves in the area of the well the permeability in the local activated fault increased and allowed for significant drainage of the water from the over pressurized aquifer which is monitored by the gom√® 1 well 5 conclusions water levels from nine wells in israel show strong oscillations caused by travelling seismic waves of the sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm one well exhibits a sustained water level change in response to the largest event of the swarm mw 4 6 similar to the previous two remote teleseismic earthquakes in these three earthquakes it is possible to quantify three characteristics of the water level response maximum amplitude of the water level oscillations undrained sustained change of the average water level during the propagation of the seismic waves and drained sustained change that continues for days or even months after the earthquakes the maximum amplitudes of the water level oscillations correlate with the drain changes but not with the undrained changes due to the different deformation mechanisms that are responsible for the drained and undrained behavior the drained change is suggested to be caused by activation of a nearby fault and drainage of water from this aquifer to a different aquifer with lower pressure the amount of slip on the fault is related to the maximum amplitudes that increases the permeability on the fault the undrained behavior is related to poro elastic properties changes induced by the seismic wave during the propagation of seismic waves the rocks may be damaged fractured whenever the strain is above the yield condition the increased damage depends on the duration in which the strain is above yield conditions since the duration of the mw 4 6 is much smaller the sustained water level changes are small as well the water pressure ground acceleration amplitude ratio of the 2018 sea of galilee swarm was changed after the mw 4 6 event the sustained water pressure change and the change in the amplitude ratio are explained by changes in the poroelastic hydraulic properties of the aquifer records of nearby large seismic events are needed to confirm this

5789,co seismic and post seismic groundwater response to the sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm along with other teleseismic earthquakes are analyzed in nine water pressure monitoring wells with high sampling rates 40 sps the largest event of the swarm mw 4 6 caused significant water level oscillations of 0 216 bar 2 16 m and sustained water level drop of 0 121 bar 1 21 m the response of groundwater to this event and two other distant large events include co seismic oscillations co seismic undrained sustained change and post seismic drained change in addition the proximity of the earthquake swarm to high resolution monitoring wells provides an opportunity to analyze the changes in the oscillations amplitudes of most events the ratio of the water level to ground motion acceleration amplitudes increased after the mw 4 6 event suggesting that the aquifer poro elastic properties have changed these co seismic amplitude changes are more sensitive measure than the water level response to earth tides that showed no significant change in the phase and amplitude associated with any of the events the maximum amplitude of the oscillations is correlated to the amount of drained response suggested to be caused by activation of a nearby fault and drainage of water between aquifers the undrained behavior is related to poro elastic properties changes within the aquifer and depends on the duration of the oscillations details of the groundwater high sampling rate can shed light on deformation processes that were described previously as step like changes keywords hydroseismograms monitoring wells sustained water level change permeability changes tidal analysis 1 introduction pore pressure oscillations have been shown to correlate with seismic waves and earth tides brodsky et al 2003 cooper et al 1965 kitagawa et al 2011 liu et al 1989 roeloffs 1996 the aquifer fluid pressure fluctuates due to expansion and contraction induced by any stress variations including propagation of seismic waves hsieh et al 1987 in some setups the borehole aquifer system shows a large amplification associated with ground motions generated by earthquakes he and singh 2019 yan et al 2014 2016 permeability changes induced by earthquake have been widely documented kinoshita et al 2015 liao et al 2015 manga et al 2012 petitta et al 2018 rojstaczer et al 1995 changes in permeability are often quantified by calculating the response of the groundwater levels to earth tides with respect to earthquakes elkhoury et al 2006 shi et al 2019 shi et al 2015 2018 zhang et al 2019 in these studies both phase shift and amplitude ratio significantly changed after great earthquakes however there was no detectible change in the phase and amplitude in response to smaller earthquakes mw 6 water level changes induced by earthquake include oscillations and sustained water level changes in response to the propagation of the seismic waves ingebritsen and manga 2019 the sustained water level changes include short term undrained behavior seconds to minutes that reflects changes in the rock properties brodsky et al 2003 wang et al 2001 and longer period hours and days drained behavior associated with groundwater flow amoruso et al 2011 ben zion et al 1990 chia et al 2001 hosono et al 2018 liu et al 2018 shalev et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2009 suggested that s waves may generate shear stress large enough to create damage and enhance the permeability of aquifers enhanced permeability can cause either positive or negative changes in the water level depending on the location of the well with respect to water levels and gradients in the reservoir shi et al 2015 hosono et al 2019 postulated that sudden groundwater drawdown after the mw 7 0 2016 kumamoto earthquake are associated with water migration through open cracks along crustal ruptures the amplitude of the oscillating water level in response to earthquakes depends on the magnitude of the earthquake the distance of the monitoring well from the earthquake poro elastic properties of the aquifer and the geometry of the well cooper et al 1965 the seismic energy density that combines the magnitude and distance is used to relate the variety of hydrologic responses wang and chia 2008 wang and manga 2011 weingarten and ge 2014 showed that for the same seismic energy density the hydrological response was different depending on the frequency content of seismic waves shalev et al 2016a showed that the amplitude of the water level fluctuations reflects the poro elastic properties of the aquifer and these properties might change during the propagation of seismic waves through poro elastic media due to compaction and dilatation the goal of this work is to show that the amplitude response of the water level oscillations to earthquakes changes after a large or close earthquakes high seismic energy we demonstrate this behavior as reflected by the sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm 2 sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm during july and august 2018 the sea of galilee lake kinneret region experienced a seismic swarm consisting of 103 events with magnitude 1 9 mw 4

west section of the lake about 7 km long 3 km wide and up to 10 km focal depths wetzler et al 2019 suggested that this swarm was triggered by enhanced groundwater extraction from several wells located 10 km west of the sea of galilee here we study the effect of this swarm on the water level change in distant wells located outside the basin table 1 and fig 1 water pressure is monitored using keller

found that for gom√® 1 well n 8 5 gpa correlating with damage of 0 9 this was done based on the comparison between water well response and seismograms for the mw 7 7 september 24 2013 pakistan earthquake the presented results show that after the mw 4 6 earthquake the slope of the linear regression between groundwater pressure oscillations and ground accelerations slightly increases fig 6 we suggest here that this change reflects a small change in the poro elastic properties of the aquifer and estimate the new n value and damage level to proceed with this estimation we use strain perturbation caused by the seismic waves which is the ground motion velocities divided by the wave velocity of the considered phase i e body p and s waves or surface waves shearer 2009 the largest

therefore the effect that the mw 4 6 earthquake had on the n value is calculated by n 1 n 2 1 08 e 9 1 05 e 9 1 03 this means that after the mw 4 6 earthquake the shear strain coupling coefficient increased by 3 from n 8 5 gpa to n 8 7 gpa this new value correlates with damage change of the order 4 0 10 3 shalev et al 2016a only gom√® 1 well showed significantly high oscillations induced by the largest mw 4 6 event order of magnitude higher than most of the wells small responses in gom√® 1 to other events as well as responses of other wells even to the largest mw 4 6 event were not enough to record any observable sustained water level change and resolve any change in the aquifers properties shalev et al 2016a connected the damage accumulation permeability increase and compaction porosity and permeability decrease of the aquifer rocks induced by the seismic shaking with the undrained sustained water level change their model predicts that for a highly damaged zone as in gom√® 1 well the damage accumulation dominates the compaction effect and leads to permeability enhancement and sustained water level drop this change depends on the amplitude frequency and duration of the strain oscillations the mw 4 6 earthquake was the only event in the seismic swarm that was strong enough to produce the observable sustained drop about 2 4 10 3 bar table 2 due to relatively large shaking amplitude and in spite of its short duration the presented data show that the amplitudes of the pressure oscillations induced by strong remote earthquakes mw 7 3 in iraq iran border and mw7 7 in pakistan were about five times lower but the duration of the shaking were significantly longer table 2 long shaking duration leads to even larger undrained sustained decrease the undrained short term response of water levels is followed by the drained response of water levels and it is suggested to occur because of permeability enhancement of nearby faults that create shortcuts between aquifers the deformation mechanism that creates the water level increase or decrease during the drained and undrained response are different the undrained mechanism includes inelastic deformation brodsky et al 2003 wang et al 2001 within the aquifer whereas the drained mechanism includes deformation along a nearby fault slip that connects between aquifers e g hosono et al 2018 sibson 2007 stanislavsky and garven 2003 the slip along the fault depends mostly on the maximum force that acted on the fault and less on the duration we hypothesize that one or several small faults were activated or dynamically triggered during the propagation of the seismic waves in the area of the well the permeability in the local activated fault increased and allowed for significant drainage of the water from the over pressurized aquifer which is monitored by the gom√® 1 well 5 conclusions water levels from nine wells in israel show strong oscillations caused by travelling seismic waves of the sea of galilee 2018 seismic swarm one well exhibits a sustained water level change in response to the largest event of the swarm mw 4 6 similar to the previous two remote teleseismic earthquakes in these three earthquakes it is possible to quantify three characteristics of the water level response maximum amplitude of the water level oscillations undrained sustained change of the average water level during the propagation of the seismic waves and drained sustained change that continues for days or even months after the earthquakes the maximum amplitudes of the water level oscillations correlate with the drain changes but not with the undrained changes due to the different deformation mechanisms that are responsible for the drained and undrained behavior the drained change is suggested to be caused by activation of a nearby fault and drainage of water from this aquifer to a different aquifer with lower pressure the amount of slip on the fault is related to the maximum amplitudes that increases the permeability on the fault the undrained behavior is related to poro elastic properties changes induced by the seismic wave during the propagation of seismic waves the rocks may be damaged fractured whenever the strain is above the yield condition the increased damage depends on the duration in which the strain is above yield conditions since the duration of the mw 4 6 is much smaller the sustained water level changes are small as well the water pressure ground acceleration amplitude ratio of the 2018 sea of galilee swarm was changed after the mw 4 6 event the sustained water pressure change and the change in the amplitude ratio are explained by changes in the poroelastic hydraulic properties of the aquifer records of nearby large seismic events are needed to confirm this
