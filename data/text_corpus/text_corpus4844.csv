24220,flows of different elements among cities can affect urban organizational structures leading to specific links between and roles for cities within urban agglomerations previous studies have mainly focused on flows produced by specific elements in a single urban agglomeration and they cannot reveal differences in organizational structures affected by multiple elements among different urban agglomerations therefore we selected 18 typical urban agglomerations in china and explored their structural characteristics under comprehensive effects of four elements economy resources population and technology with gravity model and social network analysis guangdong hong kong macao urban agglomeration had a maximum flow intensity of 5 15 this concentration range was the largest from 0 65 to 3 75 indicating that more elements flowed internally shandong peninsula urban agglomeration had the largest network density at 0 412 the lowest efficiency at 0 567 and the lowest hierarchy at 0 000 showing that intercity relationships within sp were the tightest among the18 urban agglomerations geographical proximity and topological structure of subgroups proved that connections among subgroups were not complex and cities of different provinces lacked close interactions furthermore most of the key cities with high centrality indexes were municipalities directly under the central government or provincial capitals these cities played important roles in networks and were distributed into main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups this paper provides a unified analytical framework aimed at urban agglomerations that accounts for flows of multiple types of elements and explores urban organizational structures and our results could provide scientific guidance for promoting the coordinated and sustainable development of urban agglomerations keywords urban agglomeration structural characteristics city flow gravity model network analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accelerated urbanization has led to the emergence of urban agglomeration which can combine the advantages of individual cities and form a tighter spatial organization fang and yu 2017 according to a report by the national bureau of statistics of china in 2019 china s urban agglomerations only occupied china s land area at a proportion of 28 44 but contained 77 90 of population and produced 90 18 of economic development nbs 2019 urban agglomeration is increasingly becoming the core that leads and supports the regional sustainable development many factors necessary for production including human capital economy resources and advanced technology affecting and reshaping internal organizational structures of urban agglomerations zhang et al 2020a however there are differences in the flow intensity of different necessary elements which have resulted in unbalanced opportunities in space and different urban interaction degree among cities and this would form different structural features of urban agglomerations in the report rising of super city clusters envision an urban future for all bcg and cdrf 2018 it referred that wuhan guangzhou high speed railway did have benefit on elements circulation and resource allocation in the past 10 years population inflow of changsha and wuhan increased 431 and 280 respectively while population outflow of xianning increased by 38 it is urgent to account for flows of multiple elements and clarify the structure and functional characteristics of urban agglomerations and this consensus will provide guidance for the rational distribution of elements and balanced and coordinated regional development traditional studies were based on city attributes and neglected collaboration and interaction between cities meijers 2007 li and wei 2010 zheng et al 2020 ge et al 2021 the network analysis method regards the urban agglomeration as an interlocking system in which cities are regarded as nodes and play various roles and the connections between nodes are theoretically closer in the network kudva and ye 2017 in many network analysis methods social network analysis sna su and yu 2019 is mature and can reveal the organizational structure of urban agglomerations from the network as a whole city clusters and nodes sna has been applied to study economic flow tong et al 2020 resource flow bai et al 2020 and technological innovation flow liu et al 2021 most of these studies focused on specific urban agglomerations such as jing jin ji urban agglomeration zhang et al 2020b yangtze river delta urban agglomeration lin et al 2021 and cheng yu urban agglomeration song et al 2019 there were also studies focusing on the comparison of urban agglomeration networks based on specific element flow such as economic flow sun et al 2019 or focusing on the integration of multiple elements in individual urban agglomerations zhao et al 2021 the difficulty of successfully using the network analysis method lies in building relationships between cities yuan and han 2021 the granger causality test and the gravity model are two methods for building intercity relationships the granger causality test can explore whether two attribute variables have one way or two way cause effect xu and lin 2015 shujah ur rahman et al 2019 but time variable need to be considered and two attribute variables must have stable time series zhang et al 2020c luo et al 2021 however the gravity model does not need to consider time impact and is widely used to calculate of the correlation strength between cities furthermore the results for different urban agglomerations can be compared the gravity model has been applied to account for the flow of a single element such as economic yu et al 2020 resource liu et al 2020 population zhang et al 2020a and technology innovation yuan and han 2021 however few studies have integrated different types of elements into inter city relationships and did not adequately consider technology level and resource endowment different from previous studies our research built an analysis framework considering four elements flows including technology resources economy and population which could more comprehensively and accurately measure the internal organizational structure of urban agglomerations then this framework was applied to 18 typical urban agglomerations in china to compare their structural characteristics we found internal connections among structural characteristics at different scales and summarized common laws and differences in organizational structures finally based on the accounting results we proposed targeted suggestions for improving the organizational structures of china s urban agglomerations corresponding to the above contents the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provided our analysis framework and data sources section 3 describes our main findings from three scales of overall urban agglomerations subgroups and city nodes respectively in section 4 effectiveness and strengths are discussed and suggestions for improving organizational structures are proposed the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 our goal was to provide scientific guidance for promoting rational distribution of elements and balanced regional development and our result would also have strong implications for future urban agglomeration development strategies 2 methodology and data 2 1 framework the accounting framework and logical relationships between different methods and scales were shown in fig 1 first we used the improved gravity model to calculate the urban flow intensity of comprehensive elements and the calculation results were named gravity values after that the gravity values were used to decide whether the interaction between any two cities existed and we constructed the urban agglomeration networks which took cities as nodes and urban interactions as paths then we used sna method to analyze structures of urban agglomeration networks from different scales overall analysis was used to describe the overall structure of urban agglomeration network subgroup analysis was used to further reflect the agglomerating characteristics of several cities within the network centrality analysis was aimed at cities the smallest unit in the network to analyze the position and importance of each city more specific details about the methods could be seen at section 2 2 and 2 3 2 2 calculations of gravity value the gravity value was the calculation result of gravity model and attribute data related to different types of elements needed to be collected before calculation in this research four kinds of elements were considered at the same time economic level resource endowment urbanization level and technological development level which could represent economic flow resource flow population flow and technological innovation flow respectively we selected typical indicators xij to calculate four kinds of elements in each city and table 1 listed their selection criteria and data sources specifically these indicators were standardized and uniformly convert into positive data and we took their average value ai as the value of corresponding elements we regarded four elements as the same weight referring to previous researches zhao et al 2021 and obtained the city quality through eqs 2 1 2 1 m i a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 1 4 where mi denotes the quality of city i a1 a2 a3 a4 represents the value of element of economic level resource endowment urbanization level and technological development level respectively in order to identify the contribution of different cities to the urban flow intensity we used the relative size of m and calculate the gravity value as follows 2 2 r i j m i m i m j m i m j r i j 2 2 3 r j i m j m i m j m i m j r i j 2 where ri j denotes the gravity value i e urban flow intensity of comprehensive elements pointing from city i to city j rj i is the same rij denotes the distance between cities and is defined as the spherical distance between two municipal governments in each city which is calculated using the longitude and latitude of two cities based on gravity values between two cities we could further measure the influence of cities within the urban agglomeration through the eqs 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 2 4 p i j 1 n r i j 2 5 n i j 1 n r j i 2 6 i n f l u e n c e p i n i where pi denotes the sum of urban flow sent to other cities within the urban agglomeration of city i ni denotes the sum of urban flow received from other cities within the urban agglomeration of city i influence represents the effect of city i if influence 0 it indicates that city i plays a role of radiation and driving if influence 0 it indicates that city i depends on the driving effect of other cities 2 3 identification of organizational structure within urban agglomerations social network analysis sna can systematically reveal structural characteristics of the urban agglomeration before analyzing the urban agglomeration network it is necessary to obtain the relation matrix with i rows and i columns we carried out binary processing to obtain the relation matrix when comparing each gravity value with the average of all gravity values if the value was greater than the average it was defined as 1 and this meant that there existed an interaction between two cities if the value was less than the average it was defined as 0 and this meant there was no association between two cities then we constructed different urban agglomeration networks in which nodes were cities and paths were urban interactions according to the relation matrix overall analysis can reveal overall structure of the urban agglomeration network the connection degree between any two nodes in the network reflects its scale which is most concerned by researchers and network density can reflect this feature network efficiency can reflect to what extent redundant lines exist in the network a network with a higher efficiency implies fewer redundant lines moreover more one way associations in a network mean a stricter hierarchical structure network hierarchy can measure the asymmetrical reachability between points in a network the calculation method and the corresponding meaning of each index were shown in table 2 in general the lower density the higher efficiency and the lower hierarchy indicate a more balanced path distribution within the urban agglomeration network subgroup analysis is aimed at intermediate scale between urban agglomeration network and city nodes subgroups are spontaneously formed by several cities with similar structures we used concor convergence of iterated correlations to identify subgroups with the maximum depth of splits as 2 and the convergence criteria as 0 2 the number of subgroups is related to the size of network david and yang 2012 su and yu 2019 and at most four subgroups could be identified the topological structure of urban subgroups is formed based on links between subgroups which are more concise than those between cities this paper used α density standard song et al 2019 to identify topological structure of subgroups the reticular topological structure means that four subgroups link from nose to tail the annular topological structure means that there exist three subgroups linking from nose to tail the linear topological structure means that there are not any three subgroups linking from nose to tail fig s1 listed examples of these three topological structures in addition if the network could be divided into four subgroups their different functions could be furthermore expressed according to the ratio of the number of connections within and between the subgroups wasserman and faust 1994 city is the smallest unit of urban agglomeration network and different cities play different roles in the network nodes are connected directly or indirectly in the social network so different indexes should be used to reflect the ability of a single city to possess power in the network from different standards david and yang 2012 degree centrality betweenness centrality and closeness centrality can reflect the status and role of cities from the ability to directly occupy the elements transmit the elements and not be controlled by other nodes respectively in general the greater the centrality indexes are the higher the status in the urban agglomeration is and the more crucial the position in the network is table 2 showed calculation method and corresponding meaning of each index 2 4 study areas and data sources national new type urbanization strategy 2014 2020 clearly pointed out china s urban agglomerations under construction due to data availability our research scope focused on prefecture level cities of 18 china s urban agglomerations which was shown in fig 2 the specific information about 18 urban agglomerations and their prefecture level cities included were listed in table s1 the time section of all related statistical data was 2018 due to data privacy individual data was replaced by similar years such as 2017 or 2019 for the index of primary energy production it needed to be converted by different types of primary energy and the accounting method could be seen in supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 overall characteristics of different urban agglomerations the gravity values demonstrated significant differences in different urban agglomerations fig 3 the average gravity value of guangdong hong kong macao urban agglomeration ghkm was the largest 5 15 which was 64 38 times that of the smallest for urban agglomeration along the yellow river in ningxia yrn 0 08 because the economic level a1 as 2 66 times the average of all cities and the urbanization level a3 2 58 times the average of all cities of ghkm were the largest of the corresponding elements among 18 urban agglomerations and the average distance between cities of ghkm 91 10 km fig s3 was the lowest for urban agglomeration in central basin of shanxi cbx the concentration range of gravity values that is the distribution range of gravity values from lower to upper quartiles and the same below was 0 10 0 72 which was ranked second only to ghkm 0 65 3 75 due to its great resource endowment a2 2 74 times the average of all cities and small average distance between cities 150 88 km even though some urban agglomerations had the same number of cities there were still significant differences in gravity values fig 3 beibu gulf urban agglomeration bg had the same number of cities as ghkm but its concentration range of gravity values 0 01 0 13 and average gravity value 0 31 were both much lower than those of ghkm this result occurred because the average distance between cities of bg 143 79 km was greater and the economic level a1 0 60 times the average of all cities and urbanization level a3 0 49 times the average of all cities of bg were much lower a similar phenomenon existed in urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the yangtze river mryr and yangtze river delta urban agglomeration yrd the concentration range of gravity values of mryr 0 01 0 10 was less than that of yrd 0 05 0 38 and the average gravity value of mryr 0 23 was also less than that of yrd 0 53 this result occurred because the economic development level and urbanization level of yrd were 1 99 times and 2 33 times that of mryr respectively and the distance between cities 228 73 km was much smaller urban agglomerations had differences not only in the distribution of the urban flow intensity but also in their network structures fig 4 for the 18 urban agglomerations their values of network density were distributed in the range of 0 000 0 500 and their values of network efficiency were distributed in the range of 0 500 1 000 fig 4 and therefore the density was relatively low and efficiency was relatively high shandong peninsula urban agglomeration sp had the highest density 0 412 and the lowest efficiency 0 567 and the central plains urban agglomeration cp performed second only to sp in density 0 232 and efficiency 0 773 in addition their values of network hierarchy were 0 000 indicating that there were no obvious hierarchy structure these overall indicators demonstrated that the distribution of flows within sp and cp networks were more balanced than those of other networks for guanzhong plain urban agglomeration gp urban agglomeration in central guizhou cg urban agglomeration in central yunnan cey lanzhou xining urban agglomeration lx cbx and yrn their values of network efficiency were 1 000 because the number of cities and internal redundant paths were relatively small while their network values of density varied due to their different proportions of internal direct interactions similarly the overall structures of urban agglomeration networks with the same number of cities also differed greatly fig 4 the network density of bg 0 083 was lower than that of ghkm 0 182 and its network efficiency 0 750 was also lower than that of ghkm 0 833 indicating that their network density and network efficiency showed the same changing direction the network hierarchy of bg 0 500 was lower than that of ghkm 0 707 which indicated that most nodes within ghkm were not bidirectionally accessible in contrast the network density and network efficiency of yrd and mryr changed in opposite directions the network density of yrd 0 188 was higher than that of mryr 0 115 but the network efficiency of yrd 0 766 was lower than that of mryr 0 887 which indicated that the flow distribution within yrd was more balanced than that within mryr the network hierarchy of yrd 0 166 was significantly smaller than that of mryr 0 574 3 2 structural and functional characteristics of subgroups within different urban agglomeration networks subgroups within different urban agglomerations showed similar structural and functional characteristics but also had different performances cities in most subgroups were located adjacent to each other fig 5 especially for urban agglomerations with a large number of cities e g cp mryr yrd the topological structures fig 5 of subgroups within china s urban agglomerations were all presented as linear topological structures showing that the links of subgroups were not complicated from the perspective of interactions between subgroups fig 5 only sp had links between any two of four subgroups indicating that the interactions of subgroups in the sp were intensive which was consistent with the results of section 3 1 on overall network analysis in contrast there were no links between any two of the four subgroups in urban agglomeration on the west side of the straits wss in addition yrd and mryr had one subgroup plate4 belonging to anhui province and two subgroups plate1 plate2 concentrating in hubei and jiangxi province respectively with no links between subgroups indicating that for cities in different provinces relatively weak interactions existed this result was due to the long distances between cities and incomplete interprovincial circulation mechanisms there were also subgroups within jing jin ji urban agglomeration jjj cheng yu urban agglomeration cy harbin changchun megalopolis hc urban agglomeration in central and southern liaoning csl and ghkm plate1 of jjj plate2 of cy plate4 of hc plate3 plate4 of csl plate2 of ghkm respectively that were not related to other subgroups but cities in these subgroups were concentrated in the same province this result showed that the interactions of cities located in the same province were concentrated in several cities and good interactions among other cities were lacking for the links that subgroups generated and were accepted by themselves i e self feedbacks the number of subgroups with self feedback within each urban agglomeration was different fig 5 among the 18 urban agglomerations 12 urban agglomerations had a higher proportion of self feedback than that of inter subgroup links especially for cy cp and yrd self feedback existed in all four subgroups showing that relationships among cities within the same subgroup were closer for the remaining 6 urban agglomerations the proportion of self feedback was equal to or lower than that of intersubgroup links among them hu bao e yu urban agglomeration hbey gp yrn and cg had no self feedback within any subgroups therefore in these 6 urban agglomerations the relationships among cities located in different subgroups were closer moreover subgroups also differed greatly in their functional positioning table s4 when forming topological structures cities within the isolated subgroups plate4 of yrd plate3 plate4 of csl plate3 of wss lacked interactions with cities located in other subgroups hence more policy supports should be given to these isolated subgroups in the future to promote element flow in the subgroups functioning as bidirectional spillover or main spillover most cities with high positive influence influence pi ni were gathered for example cities with pi ni greater than 0 in jjj were beijing influence 14 34 tianjin influence 8 27 and handan influence 0 55 the first two of which were located within the bidirectional spillover subgroup plate1 and the third of which was within the main spillover subgroup plate4 this phenomenon also appeared in other urban agglomerations combining the geographical proximity of city distribution within subgroups it could be concluded that cities with a larger positive influence and their surrounding cities were mainly clustered in main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups furthermore this situation indicated that cities with a strong ability to send elements had a limited ability to drive city development and only neighboring cities could receive more benefits while cities located at farther away were less influenced it should be noted that there were 8 urban agglomerations with only two or three subgroups in which functions of their subgroups were not analyzed in this paper due to the limitations of the assessment methods 3 3 status and rank of different cities within urban agglomeration networks for each urban agglomeration some cities had betweenness centrality of 0 fig 6 which also had lower degree and closeness centrality and therefore could not control comprehensive flow they were subordinate to the corresponding urban agglomeration network however from the perspective of the proportion of cities with betweenness centrality of 0 cp and sp had only three cities with betweenness centrality of 0 and their corresponding proportions were the lowest this result indicated that there were more cities in cp and sp that served as bridges in the networks so that flows of elements were distributed in a more balanced manner than in other urban agglomerations cities had different status in their urban agglomeration network and centrality indexes could indicate their roles fig s4 in cbx the betweenness centrality of each city was 0 because only taiyuan and jinzhong interacted and no third city could act as a bridge in csl lx cey gp yrn and cg there was only one city with a betweenness centrality greater than 0 in each urban agglomeration and its degree and closeness centrality values reached the maximum e g shenyang in csl xi an in gp therefore only one city acted as the center of the network in hbey and bg there were two cities with the same betweenness centrality more than 0 and their degree and closeness centrality were also the maximum values in the corresponding urban agglomeration network e g baotou and ordos in the hbey nanning and qinzhou in the bg respectively so they were core cities in the other nine urban agglomerations jjj cy yrd mryr hc sp wss ghkm and cp cities located in the bidirectional spillover and main spillover subgroups had greater degree centrality due to their average ranks being much higher than those of the other subgroups indicating that the bidirectional spillover and main spillover were at the center furthermore we identified key cities and edge cities in nine urban agglomeration networks based on the rank of three centralities table 3 cities upper 25 were cores of networks with influences pi ni mostly greater than 0 most of them were located in subgroups functioning as bidirectional spillover or main spillover rarely in other subgroups for example nanjing in yrd was in the subgroup that acted as main benefit and xinxiang in cp was in the broker subgroup for cities below 75 their betweenness centrality were all 0 and closeness centrality of several cities were 0 indicating that these cities were easy to control compared with cities upper 25 cities below 75 were scattered within subgroups with different functions and most of their influences pi ni were less than 0 therefore cities below 75 should receive more attention from government departments to strengthen their element flows 4 discussion and policy implications 4 1 discussion in this paper we constructed a systematic framework to evaluate flows of four different types of elements economy resources population and technology and explored organizational structures of urban agglomerations our framework was applied in 18 typical urban agglomerations in china previous studies related to multiple urban agglomerations have focused on the flow of economy zhao et al 2021 and environmental materials dong and li 2022 compared with the study of zheng et al 2020 this paper identified quantitative contribution of four elements on the intensity of urban interaction and therefore our results could more accurately reflect closeness and the distribution of roles of cities providing new insights for understanding urban agglomeration structures furthermore our study showed that the structural characteristics of urban agglomerations in sp are well performed on all three scales in practical urban planning the scope of sp was consistent with the administrative area of shandong province and scopes of remaining 17 urban agglomerations were clusters of cities in at least two provinces or of several cities within single province this proved that provincial administrative had significant meaning in china s urbanization processes and the relationships between cities within a province were closer than those between cities in different provinces in recent years urban agglomeration in china is a more advanced organizational form than provinces fang and yu 2017 so cities in different provinces need to strengthen cooperation to promote material and information exchange in future processes of urban agglomeration construction as the element flow constructed in this paper was virtual the model should be validated generally speaking our model could better reflect flows of elements and structural characteristics for urban agglomerations which had more than four cities specific verification methods and results were provided in supplementary materials previous studies related to urban organizational structure mainly focused on some national urban agglomerations zhang et al 2020b lin et al 2021 yang et al 2022 and limitations of cases made their results unable to globally reflect differences and common laws existing in urban agglomerations in china the diversity of research areas and uniformity of accounting framework made our research provide more comprehensive and systematic guidance to promote regional equity and improve internal organizational structure of urban agglomerations taking jjj and yrd as examples they are both national urban agglomerations and important regional growth poles in china but average flow intensity of yrd was 1 33 times that of jjj and the concentration range of yrd is much larger than that of jjj however from the perspective of internal organizational structure they had similarities cities with more flows sending outside were all municipalities directly under the central government and the comprehensive flow with them as starting points ranked top 50 in the research of zhao et al 2021 it confirmed the prominent positions of municipalities directly under the central government in the development of urban agglomerations by studying jjj and yrd however it caused surrounding cities in a backward development trend for a long time scholars have studied urban development patterns of jjj zhang et al 2020b and yrd lin et al 2021 in different periods which showed that the competitiveness of these big cities would be further improved due to snowball effect resulting no other centers in urban agglomerations in fact they had urban diseases such as resource shortage and environmental pollution in our study different urban agglomerations in china were analyzed and cities with policy inclination such as talent support and resource introduction were found out therefore our work was useful in alleviating urban diseases of large cities and promoting sustainable development in addition sna method was used to analyze organizational structures of urban agglomerations and the concept of subgroup is also the feature of sna david and yang 2012 song et al 2019 through analysis of subgroup interactions it could be found that cities with closer interactions were mostly located in a single province although urban agglomeration is the main form of new urbanization fang et al 2020 it has not been implemented for a long time as a national strategy and provincial administrative division had a far reaching impact in china other researches related to subgroups also confirmed the prominent position of provincial administrative division song et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a through analysis of subgroup function we could find that functions of subgroups were not completely equivalent to functions of inner cities but inner cities still had some common characteristics cities which had strong abilities to send elements mostly existed in main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups and only surrounding cities were easy to become a part of subgroups compared with previous studies zhang et al 2020c 2021a there were differences in specific cities within subgroups and this was caused by different types of accounting elements but the overall distribution of subgroups was consistent on the premise of unchanged number of cities this similarity also showed the rationality of our framework constructed in this paper there were significant gaps in positions of cities cities with high centrality indexes were municipalities directly under the central government provincial capitals special economic zones etc they were supported by more policies and had stronger abilities to control elements accordingly they played key roles in urban agglomerations this conclusion was consistent with previous researches for example zhang et al 2021b studied development pattern changes of cey based on night light data and kunming always had highest spatial connection intensity and degree centrality in the study of mryr urban development pattern based on tourism economic data gan et al 2021 the centrality of wuhan and changsha were significantly higher than that of other cities in the research of lx tong et al 2020 lanzhou had greatest degree and betweenness centrality however cities with lower centrality needed more policy support and guidance to strengthen communication and cooperation with other cities 4 2 policy implications based on the results and the actual situation of urban agglomeration development some suggestions were proposed to promote rational distribution of elements and improve organizational structures of urban agglomerations first in future urban agglomeration construction elements should be introduced to key planning areas of urban agglomerations which have the potential to drive more cities to enhance urban element flow compared to a single city according to subgroup analysis our results showed that there were great differences in the development of cities and the impact scopes of cities with large influence were limited many urban agglomerations have established development zones that cover key cities with high central indexes and this helps facilitate the diffusion of elements across the whole urban agglomeration for example beijing and tianjin two core cities in jjj drove 76 of the elements flow of the whole urban agglomeration but their impact scopes were mainly concentrated in adjacent areas which limited the optimization of the organizational structure of the beijing tianjin hebei region the xiong an new area covers two core cities and if governments introduce necessary elements distributing in xiong an new area it is not only beneficial to surrounding baoding cangzhou and langfang but also can strengthen connections between cities in the southern jjj and cities in the northern jjj with the assistance of utilizing strong capital and advanced technology of beijing and tianjin second governments should strengthen the overall coordination of different provinces not only by improving the infrastructure network but also by improving collaborative management mechanisms of elements in urban agglomerations urban agglomerations with a large number of cities have been developing for a long period of time and in early stages they were called economic zones economic belts or metropolitan circles mostly containing provincial capitals and adjacent cities ndrc 2015 2016 he et al 2017 our results related to linkages between subgroups showed that existence of provincial administrative boundaries hindered urban cross regional collaboration capello et al 2018 and the integrated flow of elements neal 2011 the formation of urban agglomeration networks makes it possible to manage cities across different provinces governments designing at the top level should work together and make their decisions effective for the urban agglomeration as a whole and provincial government should establish an information sharing platform disclosing collaboration and its effectiveness timely and provinces with poor cooperation performance should be accountable in addition infrastructure network construction in urban agglomerations is the basis for promoting production and living elements flowing such as transportation network bai et al 2020 and logistics network sun et al 2019 which can reduce time and economic costs of cross provincial transactions improve material flow efficiency and facilitate elements to transfer to marginal cities moreover governments can set up special agencies in the government departments which aimed at a certain element for cross regional collaborative management of urban agglomerations third cities should take active measures to promote exchanges of different elements by utilizing their own potential advantages different cities played different roles in the network according to our results economically developed cities often played key roles in the element flow network and their enterprises always had more advanced high and new technologies in order to encourage high and new tech industries to transfer to marginal cities economically developed cities can formulate incentive policies to provide more favorable living support for relevant individuals cities in marginal positions have more land resources and they can construct commercial corridors and industrial parks and formulate transaction preferential and tax relief policies to attract excellent enterprises and talents developing in marginal cities in order to realize more balanced flows of elements in urban agglomerations 5 conclusion based on improved gravity model and social network analysis a comprehensive framework was constructed to evaluate characteristics of flows integrating economy population resources and technology in china s 18 urban agglomerations and their organizational structures the results were convenient for comparative analysis and law summary and our accounting framework can be extended to the time dimension in the future to evaluate the development of urban agglomerations at different stages there was heterogeneity of comprehensive flows among 18 urban agglomerations for ghkm the concentration range of gravity values and their average value were both the largest for yrn the concentration range of gravity values and their average value were both lowest at overall network scale different urban agglomeration structures had some common characteristics the network density of 18 urban agglomerations were relatively low from 0 000 to 0 500 and the network efficiency were relatively high from 0 500 to 0 100 sp had the highest density the lowest efficiency and the lowest hierarchy there were also common structural characteristics of subgroups and status of cities within 18 urban agglomerations subgroups in each urban agglomeration network had a linear topological structure subgroup distribution had geographical proximity and main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups concentrated on cities with positive influence and their surrounding cities most of cities which had positive influence were municipalities directly under the central government provincial capitals and special economic zones and their values of degree centrality betweenness centrality and closeness centrality were at the top within corresponding urban agglomeration and played key roles in the network conversely cities with relatively lower centrality indexes were at the edges of urban agglomeration network and they called for more attention to enhance its element flows this paper also inevitably had limitations our analysis could only be carried out for prefecture level cities due to statistical data availability and this ignored the impact of some autonomous prefectures and county level cities on structural characteristics flows of elements can be studied more carefully and thoroughly in the future with more detailed statistical data in addition the construction scale of different urban agglomerations was different and compared to actual flows our model constructed more matched the urban agglomerations with the number of cities more than 5 at 95 confidence level in the future other accounting frameworks and methods based on element flow should be explored to improve the confidence level credit authorship contribution statement wen ma conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis data curation visualization writing original draft writing review

24220,flows of different elements among cities can affect urban organizational structures leading to specific links between and roles for cities within urban agglomerations previous studies have mainly focused on flows produced by specific elements in a single urban agglomeration and they cannot reveal differences in organizational structures affected by multiple elements among different urban agglomerations therefore we selected 18 typical urban agglomerations in china and explored their structural characteristics under comprehensive effects of four elements economy resources population and technology with gravity model and social network analysis guangdong hong kong macao urban agglomeration had a maximum flow intensity of 5 15 this concentration range was the largest from 0 65 to 3 75 indicating that more elements flowed internally shandong peninsula urban agglomeration had the largest network density at 0 412 the lowest efficiency at 0 567 and the lowest hierarchy at 0 000 showing that intercity relationships within sp were the tightest among the18 urban agglomerations geographical proximity and topological structure of subgroups proved that connections among subgroups were not complex and cities of different provinces lacked close interactions furthermore most of the key cities with high centrality indexes were municipalities directly under the central government or provincial capitals these cities played important roles in networks and were distributed into main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups this paper provides a unified analytical framework aimed at urban agglomerations that accounts for flows of multiple types of elements and explores urban organizational structures and our results could provide scientific guidance for promoting the coordinated and sustainable development of urban agglomerations keywords urban agglomeration structural characteristics city flow gravity model network analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction accelerated urbanization has led to the emergence of urban agglomeration which can combine the advantages of individual cities and form a tighter spatial organization fang and yu 2017 according to a report by the national bureau of statistics of china in 2019 china s urban agglomerations only occupied china s land area at a proportion of 28 44 but contained 77 90 of population and produced 90 18 of economic development nbs 2019 urban agglomeration is increasingly becoming the core that leads and supports the regional sustainable development many factors necessary for production including human capital economy resources and advanced technology affecting and reshaping internal organizational structures of urban agglomerations zhang et al 2020a however there are differences in the flow intensity of different necessary elements which have resulted in unbalanced opportunities in space and different urban interaction degree among cities and this would form different structural features of urban agglomerations in the report rising of super city clusters envision an urban future for all bcg and cdrf 2018 it referred that wuhan guangzhou high speed railway did have benefit on elements circulation and resource allocation in the past 10 years population inflow of changsha and wuhan increased 431 and 280 respectively while population outflow of xianning increased by 38 it is urgent to account for flows of multiple elements and clarify the structure and functional characteristics of urban agglomerations and this consensus will provide guidance for the rational distribution of elements and balanced and coordinated regional development traditional studies were based on city attributes and neglected collaboration and interaction between cities meijers 2007 li and wei 2010 zheng et al 2020 ge et al 2021 the network analysis method regards the urban agglomeration as an interlocking system in which cities are regarded as nodes and play various roles and the connections between nodes are theoretically closer in the network kudva and ye 2017 in many network analysis methods social network analysis sna su and yu 2019 is mature and can reveal the organizational structure of urban agglomerations from the network as a whole city clusters and nodes sna has been applied to study economic flow tong et al 2020 resource flow bai et al 2020 and technological innovation flow liu et al 2021 most of these studies focused on specific urban agglomerations such as jing jin ji urban agglomeration zhang et al 2020b yangtze river delta urban agglomeration lin et al 2021 and cheng yu urban agglomeration song et al 2019 there were also studies focusing on the comparison of urban agglomeration networks based on specific element flow such as economic flow sun et al 2019 or focusing on the integration of multiple elements in individual urban agglomerations zhao et al 2021 the difficulty of successfully using the network analysis method lies in building relationships between cities yuan and han 2021 the granger causality test and the gravity model are two methods for building intercity relationships the granger causality test can explore whether two attribute variables have one way or two way cause effect xu and lin 2015 shujah ur rahman et al 2019 but time variable need to be considered and two attribute variables must have stable time series zhang et al 2020c luo et al 2021 however the gravity model does not need to consider time impact and is widely used to calculate of the correlation strength between cities furthermore the results for different urban agglomerations can be compared the gravity model has been applied to account for the flow of a single element such as economic yu et al 2020 resource liu et al 2020 population zhang et al 2020a and technology innovation yuan and han 2021 however few studies have integrated different types of elements into inter city relationships and did not adequately consider technology level and resource endowment different from previous studies our research built an analysis framework considering four elements flows including technology resources economy and population which could more comprehensively and accurately measure the internal organizational structure of urban agglomerations then this framework was applied to 18 typical urban agglomerations in china to compare their structural characteristics we found internal connections among structural characteristics at different scales and summarized common laws and differences in organizational structures finally based on the accounting results we proposed targeted suggestions for improving the organizational structures of china s urban agglomerations corresponding to the above contents the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 provided our analysis framework and data sources section 3 describes our main findings from three scales of overall urban agglomerations subgroups and city nodes respectively in section 4 effectiveness and strengths are discussed and suggestions for improving organizational structures are proposed the paper ends with conclusions in section 5 our goal was to provide scientific guidance for promoting rational distribution of elements and balanced regional development and our result would also have strong implications for future urban agglomeration development strategies 2 methodology and data 2 1 framework the accounting framework and logical relationships between different methods and scales were shown in fig 1 first we used the improved gravity model to calculate the urban flow intensity of comprehensive elements and the calculation results were named gravity values after that the gravity values were used to decide whether the interaction between any two cities existed and we constructed the urban agglomeration networks which took cities as nodes and urban interactions as paths then we used sna method to analyze structures of urban agglomeration networks from different scales overall analysis was used to describe the overall structure of urban agglomeration network subgroup analysis was used to further reflect the agglomerating characteristics of several cities within the network centrality analysis was aimed at cities the smallest unit in the network to analyze the position and importance of each city more specific details about the methods could be seen at section 2 2 and 2 3 2 2 calculations of gravity value the gravity value was the calculation result of gravity model and attribute data related to different types of elements needed to be collected before calculation in this research four kinds of elements were considered at the same time economic level resource endowment urbanization level and technological development level which could represent economic flow resource flow population flow and technological innovation flow respectively we selected typical indicators xij to calculate four kinds of elements in each city and table 1 listed their selection criteria and data sources specifically these indicators were standardized and uniformly convert into positive data and we took their average value ai as the value of corresponding elements we regarded four elements as the same weight referring to previous researches zhao et al 2021 and obtained the city quality through eqs 2 1 2 1 m i a 1 a 2 a 3 a 4 1 4 where mi denotes the quality of city i a1 a2 a3 a4 represents the value of element of economic level resource endowment urbanization level and technological development level respectively in order to identify the contribution of different cities to the urban flow intensity we used the relative size of m and calculate the gravity value as follows 2 2 r i j m i m i m j m i m j r i j 2 2 3 r j i m j m i m j m i m j r i j 2 where ri j denotes the gravity value i e urban flow intensity of comprehensive elements pointing from city i to city j rj i is the same rij denotes the distance between cities and is defined as the spherical distance between two municipal governments in each city which is calculated using the longitude and latitude of two cities based on gravity values between two cities we could further measure the influence of cities within the urban agglomeration through the eqs 2 4 2 5 and 2 6 2 4 p i j 1 n r i j 2 5 n i j 1 n r j i 2 6 i n f l u e n c e p i n i where pi denotes the sum of urban flow sent to other cities within the urban agglomeration of city i ni denotes the sum of urban flow received from other cities within the urban agglomeration of city i influence represents the effect of city i if influence 0 it indicates that city i plays a role of radiation and driving if influence 0 it indicates that city i depends on the driving effect of other cities 2 3 identification of organizational structure within urban agglomerations social network analysis sna can systematically reveal structural characteristics of the urban agglomeration before analyzing the urban agglomeration network it is necessary to obtain the relation matrix with i rows and i columns we carried out binary processing to obtain the relation matrix when comparing each gravity value with the average of all gravity values if the value was greater than the average it was defined as 1 and this meant that there existed an interaction between two cities if the value was less than the average it was defined as 0 and this meant there was no association between two cities then we constructed different urban agglomeration networks in which nodes were cities and paths were urban interactions according to the relation matrix overall analysis can reveal overall structure of the urban agglomeration network the connection degree between any two nodes in the network reflects its scale which is most concerned by researchers and network density can reflect this feature network efficiency can reflect to what extent redundant lines exist in the network a network with a higher efficiency implies fewer redundant lines moreover more one way associations in a network mean a stricter hierarchical structure network hierarchy can measure the asymmetrical reachability between points in a network the calculation method and the corresponding meaning of each index were shown in table 2 in general the lower density the higher efficiency and the lower hierarchy indicate a more balanced path distribution within the urban agglomeration network subgroup analysis is aimed at intermediate scale between urban agglomeration network and city nodes subgroups are spontaneously formed by several cities with similar structures we used concor convergence of iterated correlations to identify subgroups with the maximum depth of splits as 2 and the convergence criteria as 0 2 the number of subgroups is related to the size of network david and yang 2012 su and yu 2019 and at most four subgroups could be identified the topological structure of urban subgroups is formed based on links between subgroups which are more concise than those between cities this paper used α density standard song et al 2019 to identify topological structure of subgroups the reticular topological structure means that four subgroups link from nose to tail the annular topological structure means that there exist three subgroups linking from nose to tail the linear topological structure means that there are not any three subgroups linking from nose to tail fig s1 listed examples of these three topological structures in addition if the network could be divided into four subgroups their different functions could be furthermore expressed according to the ratio of the number of connections within and between the subgroups wasserman and faust 1994 city is the smallest unit of urban agglomeration network and different cities play different roles in the network nodes are connected directly or indirectly in the social network so different indexes should be used to reflect the ability of a single city to possess power in the network from different standards david and yang 2012 degree centrality betweenness centrality and closeness centrality can reflect the status and role of cities from the ability to directly occupy the elements transmit the elements and not be controlled by other nodes respectively in general the greater the centrality indexes are the higher the status in the urban agglomeration is and the more crucial the position in the network is table 2 showed calculation method and corresponding meaning of each index 2 4 study areas and data sources national new type urbanization strategy 2014 2020 clearly pointed out china s urban agglomerations under construction due to data availability our research scope focused on prefecture level cities of 18 china s urban agglomerations which was shown in fig 2 the specific information about 18 urban agglomerations and their prefecture level cities included were listed in table s1 the time section of all related statistical data was 2018 due to data privacy individual data was replaced by similar years such as 2017 or 2019 for the index of primary energy production it needed to be converted by different types of primary energy and the accounting method could be seen in supplementary materials 3 results 3 1 overall characteristics of different urban agglomerations the gravity values demonstrated significant differences in different urban agglomerations fig 3 the average gravity value of guangdong hong kong macao urban agglomeration ghkm was the largest 5 15 which was 64 38 times that of the smallest for urban agglomeration along the yellow river in ningxia yrn 0 08 because the economic level a1 as 2 66 times the average of all cities and the urbanization level a3 2 58 times the average of all cities of ghkm were the largest of the corresponding elements among 18 urban agglomerations and the average distance between cities of ghkm 91 10 km fig s3 was the lowest for urban agglomeration in central basin of shanxi cbx the concentration range of gravity values that is the distribution range of gravity values from lower to upper quartiles and the same below was 0 10 0 72 which was ranked second only to ghkm 0 65 3 75 due to its great resource endowment a2 2 74 times the average of all cities and small average distance between cities 150 88 km even though some urban agglomerations had the same number of cities there were still significant differences in gravity values fig 3 beibu gulf urban agglomeration bg had the same number of cities as ghkm but its concentration range of gravity values 0 01 0 13 and average gravity value 0 31 were both much lower than those of ghkm this result occurred because the average distance between cities of bg 143 79 km was greater and the economic level a1 0 60 times the average of all cities and urbanization level a3 0 49 times the average of all cities of bg were much lower a similar phenomenon existed in urban agglomeration in the middle reaches of the yangtze river mryr and yangtze river delta urban agglomeration yrd the concentration range of gravity values of mryr 0 01 0 10 was less than that of yrd 0 05 0 38 and the average gravity value of mryr 0 23 was also less than that of yrd 0 53 this result occurred because the economic development level and urbanization level of yrd were 1 99 times and 2 33 times that of mryr respectively and the distance between cities 228 73 km was much smaller urban agglomerations had differences not only in the distribution of the urban flow intensity but also in their network structures fig 4 for the 18 urban agglomerations their values of network density were distributed in the range of 0 000 0 500 and their values of network efficiency were distributed in the range of 0 500 1 000 fig 4 and therefore the density was relatively low and efficiency was relatively high shandong peninsula urban agglomeration sp had the highest density 0 412 and the lowest efficiency 0 567 and the central plains urban agglomeration cp performed second only to sp in density 0 232 and efficiency 0 773 in addition their values of network hierarchy were 0 000 indicating that there were no obvious hierarchy structure these overall indicators demonstrated that the distribution of flows within sp and cp networks were more balanced than those of other networks for guanzhong plain urban agglomeration gp urban agglomeration in central guizhou cg urban agglomeration in central yunnan cey lanzhou xining urban agglomeration lx cbx and yrn their values of network efficiency were 1 000 because the number of cities and internal redundant paths were relatively small while their network values of density varied due to their different proportions of internal direct interactions similarly the overall structures of urban agglomeration networks with the same number of cities also differed greatly fig 4 the network density of bg 0 083 was lower than that of ghkm 0 182 and its network efficiency 0 750 was also lower than that of ghkm 0 833 indicating that their network density and network efficiency showed the same changing direction the network hierarchy of bg 0 500 was lower than that of ghkm 0 707 which indicated that most nodes within ghkm were not bidirectionally accessible in contrast the network density and network efficiency of yrd and mryr changed in opposite directions the network density of yrd 0 188 was higher than that of mryr 0 115 but the network efficiency of yrd 0 766 was lower than that of mryr 0 887 which indicated that the flow distribution within yrd was more balanced than that within mryr the network hierarchy of yrd 0 166 was significantly smaller than that of mryr 0 574 3 2 structural and functional characteristics of subgroups within different urban agglomeration networks subgroups within different urban agglomerations showed similar structural and functional characteristics but also had different performances cities in most subgroups were located adjacent to each other fig 5 especially for urban agglomerations with a large number of cities e g cp mryr yrd the topological structures fig 5 of subgroups within china s urban agglomerations were all presented as linear topological structures showing that the links of subgroups were not complicated from the perspective of interactions between subgroups fig 5 only sp had links between any two of four subgroups indicating that the interactions of subgroups in the sp were intensive which was consistent with the results of section 3 1 on overall network analysis in contrast there were no links between any two of the four subgroups in urban agglomeration on the west side of the straits wss in addition yrd and mryr had one subgroup plate4 belonging to anhui province and two subgroups plate1 plate2 concentrating in hubei and jiangxi province respectively with no links between subgroups indicating that for cities in different provinces relatively weak interactions existed this result was due to the long distances between cities and incomplete interprovincial circulation mechanisms there were also subgroups within jing jin ji urban agglomeration jjj cheng yu urban agglomeration cy harbin changchun megalopolis hc urban agglomeration in central and southern liaoning csl and ghkm plate1 of jjj plate2 of cy plate4 of hc plate3 plate4 of csl plate2 of ghkm respectively that were not related to other subgroups but cities in these subgroups were concentrated in the same province this result showed that the interactions of cities located in the same province were concentrated in several cities and good interactions among other cities were lacking for the links that subgroups generated and were accepted by themselves i e self feedbacks the number of subgroups with self feedback within each urban agglomeration was different fig 5 among the 18 urban agglomerations 12 urban agglomerations had a higher proportion of self feedback than that of inter subgroup links especially for cy cp and yrd self feedback existed in all four subgroups showing that relationships among cities within the same subgroup were closer for the remaining 6 urban agglomerations the proportion of self feedback was equal to or lower than that of intersubgroup links among them hu bao e yu urban agglomeration hbey gp yrn and cg had no self feedback within any subgroups therefore in these 6 urban agglomerations the relationships among cities located in different subgroups were closer moreover subgroups also differed greatly in their functional positioning table s4 when forming topological structures cities within the isolated subgroups plate4 of yrd plate3 plate4 of csl plate3 of wss lacked interactions with cities located in other subgroups hence more policy supports should be given to these isolated subgroups in the future to promote element flow in the subgroups functioning as bidirectional spillover or main spillover most cities with high positive influence influence pi ni were gathered for example cities with pi ni greater than 0 in jjj were beijing influence 14 34 tianjin influence 8 27 and handan influence 0 55 the first two of which were located within the bidirectional spillover subgroup plate1 and the third of which was within the main spillover subgroup plate4 this phenomenon also appeared in other urban agglomerations combining the geographical proximity of city distribution within subgroups it could be concluded that cities with a larger positive influence and their surrounding cities were mainly clustered in main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups furthermore this situation indicated that cities with a strong ability to send elements had a limited ability to drive city development and only neighboring cities could receive more benefits while cities located at farther away were less influenced it should be noted that there were 8 urban agglomerations with only two or three subgroups in which functions of their subgroups were not analyzed in this paper due to the limitations of the assessment methods 3 3 status and rank of different cities within urban agglomeration networks for each urban agglomeration some cities had betweenness centrality of 0 fig 6 which also had lower degree and closeness centrality and therefore could not control comprehensive flow they were subordinate to the corresponding urban agglomeration network however from the perspective of the proportion of cities with betweenness centrality of 0 cp and sp had only three cities with betweenness centrality of 0 and their corresponding proportions were the lowest this result indicated that there were more cities in cp and sp that served as bridges in the networks so that flows of elements were distributed in a more balanced manner than in other urban agglomerations cities had different status in their urban agglomeration network and centrality indexes could indicate their roles fig s4 in cbx the betweenness centrality of each city was 0 because only taiyuan and jinzhong interacted and no third city could act as a bridge in csl lx cey gp yrn and cg there was only one city with a betweenness centrality greater than 0 in each urban agglomeration and its degree and closeness centrality values reached the maximum e g shenyang in csl xi an in gp therefore only one city acted as the center of the network in hbey and bg there were two cities with the same betweenness centrality more than 0 and their degree and closeness centrality were also the maximum values in the corresponding urban agglomeration network e g baotou and ordos in the hbey nanning and qinzhou in the bg respectively so they were core cities in the other nine urban agglomerations jjj cy yrd mryr hc sp wss ghkm and cp cities located in the bidirectional spillover and main spillover subgroups had greater degree centrality due to their average ranks being much higher than those of the other subgroups indicating that the bidirectional spillover and main spillover were at the center furthermore we identified key cities and edge cities in nine urban agglomeration networks based on the rank of three centralities table 3 cities upper 25 were cores of networks with influences pi ni mostly greater than 0 most of them were located in subgroups functioning as bidirectional spillover or main spillover rarely in other subgroups for example nanjing in yrd was in the subgroup that acted as main benefit and xinxiang in cp was in the broker subgroup for cities below 75 their betweenness centrality were all 0 and closeness centrality of several cities were 0 indicating that these cities were easy to control compared with cities upper 25 cities below 75 were scattered within subgroups with different functions and most of their influences pi ni were less than 0 therefore cities below 75 should receive more attention from government departments to strengthen their element flows 4 discussion and policy implications 4 1 discussion in this paper we constructed a systematic framework to evaluate flows of four different types of elements economy resources population and technology and explored organizational structures of urban agglomerations our framework was applied in 18 typical urban agglomerations in china previous studies related to multiple urban agglomerations have focused on the flow of economy zhao et al 2021 and environmental materials dong and li 2022 compared with the study of zheng et al 2020 this paper identified quantitative contribution of four elements on the intensity of urban interaction and therefore our results could more accurately reflect closeness and the distribution of roles of cities providing new insights for understanding urban agglomeration structures furthermore our study showed that the structural characteristics of urban agglomerations in sp are well performed on all three scales in practical urban planning the scope of sp was consistent with the administrative area of shandong province and scopes of remaining 17 urban agglomerations were clusters of cities in at least two provinces or of several cities within single province this proved that provincial administrative had significant meaning in china s urbanization processes and the relationships between cities within a province were closer than those between cities in different provinces in recent years urban agglomeration in china is a more advanced organizational form than provinces fang and yu 2017 so cities in different provinces need to strengthen cooperation to promote material and information exchange in future processes of urban agglomeration construction as the element flow constructed in this paper was virtual the model should be validated generally speaking our model could better reflect flows of elements and structural characteristics for urban agglomerations which had more than four cities specific verification methods and results were provided in supplementary materials previous studies related to urban organizational structure mainly focused on some national urban agglomerations zhang et al 2020b lin et al 2021 yang et al 2022 and limitations of cases made their results unable to globally reflect differences and common laws existing in urban agglomerations in china the diversity of research areas and uniformity of accounting framework made our research provide more comprehensive and systematic guidance to promote regional equity and improve internal organizational structure of urban agglomerations taking jjj and yrd as examples they are both national urban agglomerations and important regional growth poles in china but average flow intensity of yrd was 1 33 times that of jjj and the concentration range of yrd is much larger than that of jjj however from the perspective of internal organizational structure they had similarities cities with more flows sending outside were all municipalities directly under the central government and the comprehensive flow with them as starting points ranked top 50 in the research of zhao et al 2021 it confirmed the prominent positions of municipalities directly under the central government in the development of urban agglomerations by studying jjj and yrd however it caused surrounding cities in a backward development trend for a long time scholars have studied urban development patterns of jjj zhang et al 2020b and yrd lin et al 2021 in different periods which showed that the competitiveness of these big cities would be further improved due to snowball effect resulting no other centers in urban agglomerations in fact they had urban diseases such as resource shortage and environmental pollution in our study different urban agglomerations in china were analyzed and cities with policy inclination such as talent support and resource introduction were found out therefore our work was useful in alleviating urban diseases of large cities and promoting sustainable development in addition sna method was used to analyze organizational structures of urban agglomerations and the concept of subgroup is also the feature of sna david and yang 2012 song et al 2019 through analysis of subgroup interactions it could be found that cities with closer interactions were mostly located in a single province although urban agglomeration is the main form of new urbanization fang et al 2020 it has not been implemented for a long time as a national strategy and provincial administrative division had a far reaching impact in china other researches related to subgroups also confirmed the prominent position of provincial administrative division song et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a through analysis of subgroup function we could find that functions of subgroups were not completely equivalent to functions of inner cities but inner cities still had some common characteristics cities which had strong abilities to send elements mostly existed in main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups and only surrounding cities were easy to become a part of subgroups compared with previous studies zhang et al 2020c 2021a there were differences in specific cities within subgroups and this was caused by different types of accounting elements but the overall distribution of subgroups was consistent on the premise of unchanged number of cities this similarity also showed the rationality of our framework constructed in this paper there were significant gaps in positions of cities cities with high centrality indexes were municipalities directly under the central government provincial capitals special economic zones etc they were supported by more policies and had stronger abilities to control elements accordingly they played key roles in urban agglomerations this conclusion was consistent with previous researches for example zhang et al 2021b studied development pattern changes of cey based on night light data and kunming always had highest spatial connection intensity and degree centrality in the study of mryr urban development pattern based on tourism economic data gan et al 2021 the centrality of wuhan and changsha were significantly higher than that of other cities in the research of lx tong et al 2020 lanzhou had greatest degree and betweenness centrality however cities with lower centrality needed more policy support and guidance to strengthen communication and cooperation with other cities 4 2 policy implications based on the results and the actual situation of urban agglomeration development some suggestions were proposed to promote rational distribution of elements and improve organizational structures of urban agglomerations first in future urban agglomeration construction elements should be introduced to key planning areas of urban agglomerations which have the potential to drive more cities to enhance urban element flow compared to a single city according to subgroup analysis our results showed that there were great differences in the development of cities and the impact scopes of cities with large influence were limited many urban agglomerations have established development zones that cover key cities with high central indexes and this helps facilitate the diffusion of elements across the whole urban agglomeration for example beijing and tianjin two core cities in jjj drove 76 of the elements flow of the whole urban agglomeration but their impact scopes were mainly concentrated in adjacent areas which limited the optimization of the organizational structure of the beijing tianjin hebei region the xiong an new area covers two core cities and if governments introduce necessary elements distributing in xiong an new area it is not only beneficial to surrounding baoding cangzhou and langfang but also can strengthen connections between cities in the southern jjj and cities in the northern jjj with the assistance of utilizing strong capital and advanced technology of beijing and tianjin second governments should strengthen the overall coordination of different provinces not only by improving the infrastructure network but also by improving collaborative management mechanisms of elements in urban agglomerations urban agglomerations with a large number of cities have been developing for a long period of time and in early stages they were called economic zones economic belts or metropolitan circles mostly containing provincial capitals and adjacent cities ndrc 2015 2016 he et al 2017 our results related to linkages between subgroups showed that existence of provincial administrative boundaries hindered urban cross regional collaboration capello et al 2018 and the integrated flow of elements neal 2011 the formation of urban agglomeration networks makes it possible to manage cities across different provinces governments designing at the top level should work together and make their decisions effective for the urban agglomeration as a whole and provincial government should establish an information sharing platform disclosing collaboration and its effectiveness timely and provinces with poor cooperation performance should be accountable in addition infrastructure network construction in urban agglomerations is the basis for promoting production and living elements flowing such as transportation network bai et al 2020 and logistics network sun et al 2019 which can reduce time and economic costs of cross provincial transactions improve material flow efficiency and facilitate elements to transfer to marginal cities moreover governments can set up special agencies in the government departments which aimed at a certain element for cross regional collaborative management of urban agglomerations third cities should take active measures to promote exchanges of different elements by utilizing their own potential advantages different cities played different roles in the network according to our results economically developed cities often played key roles in the element flow network and their enterprises always had more advanced high and new technologies in order to encourage high and new tech industries to transfer to marginal cities economically developed cities can formulate incentive policies to provide more favorable living support for relevant individuals cities in marginal positions have more land resources and they can construct commercial corridors and industrial parks and formulate transaction preferential and tax relief policies to attract excellent enterprises and talents developing in marginal cities in order to realize more balanced flows of elements in urban agglomerations 5 conclusion based on improved gravity model and social network analysis a comprehensive framework was constructed to evaluate characteristics of flows integrating economy population resources and technology in china s 18 urban agglomerations and their organizational structures the results were convenient for comparative analysis and law summary and our accounting framework can be extended to the time dimension in the future to evaluate the development of urban agglomerations at different stages there was heterogeneity of comprehensive flows among 18 urban agglomerations for ghkm the concentration range of gravity values and their average value were both the largest for yrn the concentration range of gravity values and their average value were both lowest at overall network scale different urban agglomeration structures had some common characteristics the network density of 18 urban agglomerations were relatively low from 0 000 to 0 500 and the network efficiency were relatively high from 0 500 to 0 100 sp had the highest density the lowest efficiency and the lowest hierarchy there were also common structural characteristics of subgroups and status of cities within 18 urban agglomerations subgroups in each urban agglomeration network had a linear topological structure subgroup distribution had geographical proximity and main spillover and bidirectional spillover subgroups concentrated on cities with positive influence and their surrounding cities most of cities which had positive influence were municipalities directly under the central government provincial capitals and special economic zones and their values of degree centrality betweenness centrality and closeness centrality were at the top within corresponding urban agglomeration and played key roles in the network conversely cities with relatively lower centrality indexes were at the edges of urban agglomeration network and they called for more attention to enhance its element flows this paper also inevitably had limitations our analysis could only be carried out for prefecture level cities due to statistical data availability and this ignored the impact of some autonomous prefectures and county level cities on structural characteristics flows of elements can be studied more carefully and thoroughly in the future with more detailed statistical data in addition the construction scale of different urban agglomerations was different and compared to actual flows our model constructed more matched the urban agglomerations with the number of cities more than 5 at 95 confidence level in the future other accounting frameworks and methods based on element flow should be explored to improve the confidence level credit authorship contribution statement wen ma conceptualization methodology investigation formal analysis data curation visualization writing original draft writing review

24221,accurate estimation of carbon storage of forest ecosystem has significant implication for mitigating global warming in order to get accurate estimation of carbon storage of forest ecosystem at the regional scale and temporal dynamics in the qinling mountains this study established a dynamic estimation model fcm model for forest carbon storage at tree stand scale according to the data of forest growth and degradation characteristics of aibes chensiensis and constructed a regional and temporal estimation model geo fcm model based on fcm model and aibes chensiensis spatial distribution data from 3s technology the results showed that carbon density of aibes chensiensis forest at tree age of 80 years from fcm model were 245 56 t ha 1 which was similar to the measured carbon densities from field investigation the simulation process of the fcm model could well reflect the growth characteristic of aibes chensiensis the simulated result of geo fcm model showed carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in study region were 5 23 105 t in year 2018 with the average carbon density of 222 26 t ha 1 and increased to 5 60 105 t in year 2028 along with tree growth its carbon storage increased 7 11 compared to the state of year 2018 the constructed model provided a robust method to estimate forest carbon storage of different tree species at different age stages at the regional scale which can provide an important reference for forest management and selection of plantation tree species keywords forest ecosystem regional carbon storage fcm model aibes chensiensis the qinling mountains data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction global warming has become a key problem that needs to be solved urgently which was caused by the significant increasing of co2 concentration in the atmosphere closely related to human activities ipcc 2013 forest ecosystem plays an important role in the global carbon cycle as the largest photosynthetic unit in terrestrial ecosystems which could effectively reduce the co2 concentration in the atmosphere through photosynthesis more than 90 of the co2 exchange between terrestrial plants and the atmosphere is completed by forests fang et al 2001 forest ecosystem also stored huge amount of carbon accounting for about 40 of the total carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems dixon et al 1994 studies showed that forest ecosystem has always been a stable carbon sink with great positive significance for carbon sequestration pan 2011 forest ecosystems could easily be disturbed by human activities the deforestation would not only greatly reduce carbon sequestration capacity but also release stored soil organic carbon which lead to forest ecosystem being a contributor to global warming woodwell et al 1978 lu et al 2018 therefore forest ecosystems could be a carbon sink for mitigating climate change or a carbon source for enhancing global warming the role of forest ecosystem in climate change needs to be further clarified thus accurate estimation of carbon storage of forest ecosystem has significant implications for mitigating global warming in countries with advanced forestry technologies such as the united states lal 2005 tian et al 2015 domke et al 2017 canada liu 1997 bhatti et al 2002 sage 2019 europe neumann et al 2016 rodríguez martín et al 2016 and russia krankina et al 1996 filipchuk et al 2018 a great deal of researches have been conducted on estimation of forest ecosystem carbon storage china has also conducted extensive researches in this field since the 1950s fang et al 1998 2001 zhang et al 2013 tang et al 2018 after decades efforts methods for forest carbon storage estimation can be mainly divided into three basic types 1 inventory based estimation 2 satellite based estimation and 3 process based estimation piao et al 2009 average biomass method volume derived method biomass regression equation and conversion factor continuous method are the four most commonly used methods for estimating carbon storage based on forest inventory data such as forest types stand age density volume tree height and diameter at breast height dbh sun and liu 2020 multi source remote sensing data have become alternative means of quantifying forest aboveground biomass carbon storage wulder et al 2012 common optical remote sensing data such as landsat tm quickbird modis spot avhrr and gf x series were all used for forest carbon storage estimation hame et al 1997 shaban 2011 xu et al 2012 yang et al 2018 jia 2017 li et al 2019 sar has certain advantage of penetrability to forest canopy being able to obtain different canopy depths and forest structure levels data nelson et al 2007 the application of sar in forest biomass estimation mainly uses l band alos palsar as the data source sinha et al 2019 lidar has the ability to efficiently measure three dimensional structures particularly in estimating height and spatial structure of trees due to high cost current researches mainly use airborne radar or ground based radar data to estimate the biomass of individual trees or stand biomass which is difficult to apply to regional scale scaranello et al 2019 in terms of large scale applications the only source of spaceborne lidar data is nasa s icesat glas ice cloud and land elevation geoscience laser altimeter system data saatchi et al 2011 process based estimation can be divided into two main types geostatistical modeling and mechanism modeling geostatistical modeling combines forest inventory data with topography elevation slope and other environmental factors to construct statistical models to estimate forest biomass at regional scales kriging interpolation k nearest neighbours knn partial least squares support vector machine svm machine learning are the most commonly used methods for geostatistical models destan et al 2013 several process mechanism modeling models have been developed and applied widely such as biome bgc running and hunt 1993 cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 rothc mishra et al 2019 yasso liski et al 2005 century fang et al 2012 intec chen et al 2000 and ksfc lee et al 2014 ibis foley et al 1996 dlem tian et al 2010 lpj sitch et al 2003 which are constructed based on process of exchanges of mass and energy or biogeochemical process though these models have greatly promoted the development of forest carbon storage estimation there are still some limitations needed to improve for example how to combine biogeochemical process of forest and regional spatial data according to the ninth national forest resources survey report 2014 2018 of china forest area of china has reached to 2 2 108 ha and the area of artificial forest was about 0 80 108 ha with ranking first in the world national forestry and grassland administration 2020 china is one of the most important contributors to the increase of the world s forest resources chen et al 2019 the rapid increase of forests has formed forest ecosystems with different forest age more than 80 of the newly increased forests are young age middle age or near mature forests carbon storage of forest ecosystem is significantly affected by forest age and habitats with different forest ages and stands will result in an increased variation among forests liu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 in order to accurately assess carbon storage of forest ecosystems clarifying the characteristics of carbon storage change of different forest types in specific habitats is necessary the qinling mountains locates in the hinterland of eastern and mid china with special geographical characteristics and is one of the most important climatic dividing lines of china kang 2012 which plays an important role in soil and water conservation climate change response and ecological function services gao et al 2004 forests of the qinling mountains experienced severe deforestation from the 1970s to the 1990s the deforestation area exceeded 8 104 ha since the implementation of the natural forest protection project in 1998 the forest ecosystem has implemented a comprehensive ban on logging afforestation and conservation have been also putted into practice strictly after more than 20 years of artificial renewal and natural restoration forest ecosystem has been well restored cui and liu 1991 aibes chensiensis is a unique tree species in china which mainly distributed in the qinling mountains with important ecological value natural aibes chensiensis forest was normally mature forest with high carbon storage which has great research values and was also the ideal research object for carbon storage estimation modeling with good degree of pure forest li et al 2012 a series of carbon relevant studies have been carried out in the qinling mountains including researches on the biomass carbon storage of trees in different forest types yang and yunming 2015 zhang 2019 wei 2014 shrub biomass carbon storage li et al 2014 soil organic carbon storage zhang et al 2020 xue 2016 wang et al 2015 litter and coarse wood residue carbon storage li and chui 2019 dang et al 1998 yuan et al 2017 and forest biomass and tree growth patterns ma 2016 li et al 2018 these studies provided good foundations for the study of carbon storage of forest ecosystem in the qinling mountains however the existing researches were mainly based on sample plots with few researches on forest carbon storage at the regional scale and temporal dynamics therefore it is necessary to conduct further research on the carbon storage of forest ecosystem in the qinling mountains to fill this research gap in order to get an accurate estimation of carbon storage of forest ecosystem in the qinling mountains this study intended to target the following objectives 1 to establish a dynamic estimation model of forest carbon storage for tree stand scale according to the data of forest growth and degradation characteristics of aibes chensiensis 2 to construct a regional and temporal estimation model of forest carbon storage based on aibes chensiensis forest spatial distribution data from 3s technology our results could obtain an accurate estimation of tree based carbon storage of the aibes chensiensis forest and clarify the variation characteristics of carbon storage of aibes chensiensis forest at different age stages at the regional scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and field survey 2 1 1 study area the study area located in the changqing national nature reserve on the southern slope of the qinling mountains china fig 1 the reserve has an area of 29 906 ha with an elevation range of 800 3071 m asl and its forest coverage is greater than 90 it is a transitional climate region between the north subtropics and the warm temperate zone types of forest vary from sub tropical to cold temperate abies chensiensis was the dominate natural tree species in the study area with the area of 2351 ha which occupied about 10 of the whole reserve the type of soil of study area was brown forest soil alfisol according to chinese soil taxonomy 2 1 2 field survey field work was conducted during september 2016 to may 2019 two permanent sample plots of abies chensiensis forest were established for field survey which were 100 m 100 m in dimension table 1 the selected abies chensiensis forest was natural forest at the tree age around 80 years field survey included three parts plant surveying litter sampling and soil sampling for the plant survey quadrats of 10 m 10 m were used for the tree layer fig 2 we measured each tree 5 cm in the quadrats and took down their abundance tree species dbh diameter at breast height at 1 37 m tree height and canopy coverage for tree layer analysis for litter sampling quadrats of 0 5 m 0 5 m were established randomly in triple under the tree layer quadrats all the litters in each quadrat were collected to obtain the biomass of litter and their carbon fraction coefficient soils were sampled 0 30 cm 10 cm interval as a layer at each sampling site after clearing out the humus horizon using a soil borer with a diameter of 3 5 cm to guarantee the representative of soil samples random triplicate point sampling was applied soils from the 3 points in one quadrat were well mixed and screened using 2 mm sieves to remove residual plants roots and debris as a replicate sample from each plot soil samples were placed in sterile plastic bags and then air dried at room temperature in the lab to determine soil chemical characteristics soil bulk density was measured using the core cutter method physico chemical properties of soil were all measured by using routine methods and each treatment was conducted in triplicate potentiometry water soil 2 5 1 bao 2000 potassium dichromate oxidation external heating method were applied for ph and soil organic matter som respectively xue 2016 the data of field survey were used for model validation 2 2 fcm model description the individual tree based model is an empirical and dynamic carbon model that consists of three compartments biomass dead organic matter dom and soil organic matter som fig 3 which cover the main carbon storage of forest ecosystem in order to describe the model concisely fcm forest carbon estimation model was used as abbreviation in this study the calculation processes for the three carbon pools in fcm model were listed in table 2 1 biomass compartment this compartment consists of four parts stem branch leaf and root biomass of the four parts could be calculated through allometric equation of abies chensiensis eq 1 using the data of tree height and dbh cheng et al 2007 tree height or dbh was a regression function with tree age as independent variable this regression function was established through the gompertz growth regression theory equation eq 2 yang 2019 forest biomass of individual tree was calculated further in this calculation forest stand density was needed to scale carbon storage to regional area for forest stand density there was a power function relationship between stand density and mean dbh in the similar age forest without thinning eq 3 deng 2009 carbon storages of tree biomass parts along tree age were calculated by combing eqs 1 3 for specific tree species 1 dom compartment carbon storage of dom pool was decided by two key processes which could be described as input process and output process eq 4 the carbon storage inputs d o m i n t were decided by mortalities of different biomass parts stem branch leaf and root the mortality of biomass could be represented by turnover rate of different tree parts d o m i n t was calculated by eq 5 decay rate of dom usually significant correlated with temperature in our model decay rate was explained through a single exponential decay function olson 1963 shown as eq 6 decay constant k i was further connected with temperature as a function of soil temperature and q10 value following an arrhenius equation eq 7 yi et al 2013 1 som compartment humus is the major component of som which could occupy more than 90 of som in our model we took humus as the som our model simulated som by two processes since there are two status of humus with different decay rates in soil kurz et al 2009 the simulation process of humus could be described as eq 8 during the decay process of dom or humus proportional substances were lost to atmospheric as gasses such as co2 or ch4 these parts were deducted in calculating the input of dom or humus the details of carbon loss fraction to atmosphere could also be found in supplementary part a table s1 2 3 geo fcm model description the construction conception of the geo fcm model was through calculating the stand carbon density of each patch of the specific tree species at the regional scale using fcm model the patch should have the information such as patch area annual average temperature tree age the frame of geo fcm model was shown as fig 4 for the tree stand age of each patch could not be obtained accurately we calculated the regional carbon storage used the distribution ratio of tree stand ages in the study area the ratio was obtained according to second survey of forest resources and the details could be found from supplementary part a table s2 after carbon storage of each patch was estimated eq 9 was then used to calculate the regional carbon storage 9 c s t o r a g e t i 1 m j 1 n c i j t where c s t o r a g e t was the regional carbon storage at t time c i j t was the carbon storage of tree species i in patch j at t time m and n were the numbers of tree species and patch respectively three other methods i e average biomass method conversion factor continuous method and soilgrids250m database were also used to estimate the carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in research region in order to compare and validate the results of geo fcm model the calculation equation used for average biomass method and conversion factor continuous method showed in table 3 the soilgrids250m database is a global automatic soil mapping system developed through machine learning based on 150 000 soil profile data and related variable data it predicts soil physicochemical properties at 7 vertical profiles 0 5 15 30 60 100 and 200 cm including soil organic carbon soil bulk density ph cation exchange capacity and soil texture etc which has become an important reference for global soil organic carbon estimation and related models in our research we download the data of study region from soilgrids250m database and then overlay with object oriented classification results to extract soil organic carbon data for each patch through arcgis software 2 4 model parameters and data input parameters used in fcm model included three parts biomass growth parameters turnover rate parameters and decay rate parameters supplementary part a table s1 these parameters for fcm model were determined through references reviewed and our field survey based on specific tree species the input data for fcm model were tree species tree age and air temperature which were readily available for various forests in multiple regions 3 results 3 1 model initialization and simulation multiple iterations were used to determine the initial value of fcm model assuming that all carbon pools were zero at initial state through several times of growth and harvest of trees slow decay humus carbon pool decomposition period 500a would reach a stable state in this study we terminated the iteration of the model when the difference of slow decay humus carbon pool between two successions was less than 0 1 and defined it as the stable state of the system the initial values of the model were determined at this state the initialization process of the model in our study used 80 year intervals as the logging cycle the initialization process of the model needs to meet the following assumptions 1 no succession occurred and tree species composition of the forest did not change 2 the growth characteristics of forest did not change 3 no other interferences except clearing 4 management of forest kept the same method 5 new forest would be planted immediately after clearing 6 stand productivity did not change during this simulation 7 physicochemical and biological characteristics of the soil environment were not changed 8 environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation did not change dynamic characteristics of slow decay humus carbon pool during initialization process were shown in fig 5 the result showed that slow decay humus carbon pool reached to a stable state at the 30th iteration for the difference between the 29th and 30th iterations was 0 02 0 1 and the value of the stable state was 95 3 t ha 1 then the model run one more time until it reached the planned forest stand age 120a in the study and carbon storage of forest at this age were determined as current carbon storage further model run from this age implied the simulation of future carbon dynamics 3 2 carbon storage estimation of abies chensiensis forest the running process of the model simulated the regularity of abies chensiensis growth at a simulation period of 120 years fig 6 a in the process of forest growth under the simulation it was divided into three stages 1 the early growth stage with carbon storage decreased 2 the pre middle stage with carbon storage increased rapidly annual growth rate 0 5 and 3 the later growth stage with carbon storage increased slowly annual growth rate 0 5 at the end of the early growth stage the 8th year carbon density of abies chensiensis forest reached to the lowest level then abies chensiensis forest grew in a rapid rate lasting about 100 years subsequently the trees went into a mature stage with biomass increasing slowly carbon density of the entire ecosystem reached to 326 20 t ha 1 at 120th year with 1 m soil depth in the process of forest growth dynamic patterns of different carbon pools varied dom carbon density and som carbon density were consistent with the total ecosystem carbon density which were decreased first and then increased som carbon density with 1 m soil depth was relatively stable with the lowest value of 83 84 t ha 1 which occurred at 45th year whereas biomass carbon density above and underground part increased during the forest growth process the proportion of different carbon pools varied with the growth stage of forest in the early growth stage the proportions of dom carbon and som carbon were high while the proportion of biomass carbon was low 5 in the first ten years the proportions of three carbon pools were relatively stable from the 60th year of simulation period where the proportions of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool were about 50 15 and 35 respectively validation simulated carbon densities at tree age of 80 years from fcm model were 245 56 t ha 1 while the values of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool were 123 92 22 52 and 89 00 t ha 1 respectively fig 6b comparison with measured carbon densities from field investigation difference in biomass carbon density was within 5 while measured biomass carbon density was 120 48 t ha 1 estimated som carbon density 0 30 cm was 13 56 lower than measured som carbon density 95 36 t ha 1 while estimated aboveground litter carbon density 11 58 t ha 1 to ensure the consistency of the comparison only the estimated results of aboveground litter part from the model was displayed to compare estimated aboveground litter carbon density was higher than measured aboveground litter carbon density 3 10 t ha 1 3 3 carbon storage estimation of abies chensiensis forest at the regional scale carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest at the regional scale was predicted through geo fcm model the simulated carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in changqing national nature reserve was 5 23 105 t in 2018 table 4 with the average carbon density of 222 26 t ha 1 in terms of specific carbon pools values of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool were 2 75 105 0 47 105 and 2 00 105 t respectively their average carbon densities were 117 04 19 90 and 85 32 t ha 1 respectively carbon storage increased along with tree growth we took the carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in 2028 as an example which reached to 5 60 105 t with an increase of 7 11 compared to the state of 2018 the estimated values of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool increased about 3 03 105 0 52 105 and 2 05 105 t respectively among them dom carbon pool increased most rapidly with the increase rate of 10 87 while som carbon storage was relatively stable with the increase rate of 2 17 in terms of spatial distribution shown in fig 7 carbon densities of different forest patches varied from 272 18 to 294 42 t ha 1 in 2018 fig 7a the patches with higher carbon densities exist in high altitude areas where have lower annual temperature after 10 year growth carbon densities of different abies chensiensis forest patches increased and the range varied from 288 77 to 312 52 t ha 1 fig 7b with average growth rate of about 6 10 here one patch with the area of 4 78 ha taken as an example showed its the carbon density increased from 293 55 t ha 1 to 311 58 t ha 1 fig 7c and d validation three other methods i e average biomass method conversion factor continuous method and soilgrids250 m database were also used to estimate the carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in research region in order to compare and validate the results of geo fcm model table 3 showed their estimation on carbon storage in terms of biomass carbon storage the estimated result of geo fcm model was 57 09 higher than that of conversion factor continuous method while it was similar to that of average biomass method with 2 91 lower in terms of som carbon storage 0 30 cm depth the estimated result of geo fcm model was also lower than that of average biomass method 17 36 but the difference was receivable the estimated som carbon storage 0 30 cm depth from soilgrids250m database was 43 50 higher than that from geo fcm model table 5 the differences of carbon storage estimated by different methods could be well explained which showed in the discussion part in details the data and calculation process of average biomass method conversion factor continuous method and soilgrids250m database were arranged in supplementary part b 4 discussions 1 model selection and its parameters tree growth is the basis for the existence of the forest ecosystem by establishing a stand growth model we can understand the law of tree growth and change predict and analyze the growth of tree stand deng 2009 forestry scholars have established several forest stand theoretic growth equations based on analytical stem data to predict tree growth such as gompertz equation rupsys et al 2011 logistic equation fortin 2014 richards equation wei et al 2012 in our study gompertz equation was chosen as the tree growth model which was much better than logistic and richards equation for abies chensiensis forest simulation pan et al 2019 also found that gompertz equation was the optimal growth model for chinese fir natural forest among seven growth models pan 2019 in this study biomass turnover was used to express the input of biomass to dead organic matter our study focused on abies chensiensis therefore the selection of model parameters was mainly based on the research results of the same tree species the biomass turnover parameters of trunks and fine roots were from the cbm cfs3 model kurz et al 2009 and the biomass turnover ratios of branches leaves and thick roots were from the research results of zhou et al 2010 fcm model was established based on the decomposition rate of different carbon pools thus the decomposition rates of each carbon pool need to be determined the lignin composition of trunk residues branch residues and rough root residues was relatively consistent and there is almost no differences in the degradation rate during the decomposition process lee et al 2014 the degradation rates of the three parts were same in our model which were from the data obtained by smyth et al 2010 the degradation rate of aboveground litter was from our field survey which was similar to the results of he et al 2011 in the same research region he 2011 the degradation rate of underground litter fine root was obtained from the results of chang et al 2011 easily degradable humus from the results of soil carbon turnover rate at the national scale in china wang et al 2018 and refractory humus from the values of yasso forest soil carbon cycle research liski et al 2005 at the regional scale climate was the dominant factor affecting the rate of decomposition not organic matter quality tree species composition and leaf habit etc huang et al 2010 in our study the common value q10 2 was used to adjust the effects of temperature in different regions smyth et al 2010 1 fcm model the estimated biomass carbon density from fcm model was slightly higher than the observed value which may be due to the existence of a certain degree of associated tree species in the actual stand field the fcm model simulated biomass carbon density in our study taking abies chensiensis trees as 100 in the field the underestimation of som carbon density may be due to the assumption that all som carbon came from biomass input in the model but in fact the organic carbon from humus accounted for about 90 95 of som carbon xu et al 2018 which leaded fcm model underestimated som carbon in the biomass simulation part the allometric equation calculated the biomass of different organs according to the dbh and tree height and both of them increased with tree age zhao et al 2019 which resulted in a continuous increasing of leaf biomass this process leads the differences to be occurred between the estimated and measured values of aboveground litter carbon though such researches showed that litter would turn to decline after reaching a peak along with tree age increased there is still no robust general description formulas or empirical parameters to simulate the process zhu 2019 pedersen and bille hansen 1999 considering that the significant difference between the estimated and measured values of aboveground litter carbon occurred in the later period of forest growth with a low growth rate the aboveground litter biomass would be at a relatively stable level with unrestricted growth meanwhile the aboveground litter carbon only accounted for 1 5 of the entire forest ecosystem with limited impacts on the estimation accuracy of the model thus it is acceptable for the existing difference between estimated and measured values of aboveground litter carbon 1 geo fcm model the estimated biomass carbon storage of geo fcm model was slightly lower than that of average biomass method which may be due to that geo fcm model fully considered the influence of different forest ages while the average biomass method just used the measured tree age around 80 years old compared with conversion factor continuous method although the forest age classification ratio of geo fcm model was determined according to the data of the second class survey of forest resources in the study area the estimated biomass carbon storage of geo fcm model was much higher than that of conversion factor continuous method the main reason may be that parameters used in this method were obtained at the national scale which were lower than those of the study area with high quality forest and the effect of forest age was not considered well in the parameters fitting thus biomass carbon storage obtained by conversion factor continuous method would underestimate when it was applied at the regional scale zhao et al 2019 the estimated som carbon storage of geo fcm model was slightly lower than that of average biomass method the reason may be that geo fcm model assumed som carbon storage was all derived from biomass input but in fact humus organic carbon accounted for about 90 of soil organic carbon batjes 1996 this leaded to an underestimation of som carbon storage by geo fcm model overall the result of the geo fcm model for som carbon storage estimation was consistent with the results of the related studies tang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the soilgrids250 m database clearly overestimated som carbon storage in the study area which was also consistent with the model interpretation rate of the soilgrids250 m averaging around 61 hengl et al 2017 though there was no direct data to calculate dom carbon storage in the study area validation was also done through literature review since trunk residues branch residues aboveground litter and underground tree root residues were all considered by geo fcm model the estimated dom carbon storage by geo fcm model was higher than those of the related studies that only estimate the aboveground litter in the study area for carbon storage of aboveground litter the estimated result by geo fcm model was in a reasonable range compared with the related researches zhang 2019 he 2011 dai et al 2018 overall geo fcm model could accurately reflect carbon storage of aibes chensiensis forest in the study area considering the complexity of forest carbon cycle process geo fcm model could be thought as a suitable carbon storage estimation model for forest at the regional scale furthermore geo fcm model can predict temporal changes of forest carbon storage which can provide an important reference for forest management and selection of plantation tree species 1 limitations of fcm and geo fcm models in estimating forest carbon storage tree species and its stand age were the determining factors of forest carbon storage zhu et al 2019 growth regression theory equation was established with tree age as independent variable in our model this improved the accuracy of regional forest carbon estimation where the region has less data of forest stand volume without continuous forest survey meanwhile the model required relative less input data and would have a wide range of applications however both fcm and geo fcm model have several limitations in estimating forest carbon storage shown below unable to solve heterogenous tree stand age issue the tree stand age of each tree was different in one patch and it is very hard to distinguish tree age of each tree stand and divide it into smaller patch with same tree age the solution in our study was introducing the distribution ratio of tree stand ages to obtain more accuracy results unable to estimate the region with different tree species in natural environment there was no ideal pure forest ecosystem and different tree species had different grow rhythm which could result in some deviation of the simulation results in our study we assumed that the modeled patches were pure forest which had more than 65 of single tree species unable to consider the impact of climate change on forest growth in the model there were temperature parameters in the model operating parameters but the effect of precipitation change on decomposition was not explained nor the effect of climate change on forest growth it was also assumed that there will be no change in temperature and precipitation in the future unable to consider the impact of disturbance on forest carbon storage model cannot simulate changes in forest carbon storages under disturbance scenarios for example during the growth of trees there may be disturbances such as pests and diseases fire etc which could affect tree growth 5 conclusions in this study a stand scale forest carbon storage estimation model fcm model was successfully constructed based on the key factors of forest growth and degradation and a geo fcm model suitable for regional scale forest carbon stock estimation was developed the carbon storage of aibes chensiensis forest in the southern slope of the middle qinling mountains was estimated using geo fcm model the estimated stand carbon density of aibes chensiensis forest at tree age of 80 years from fcm model were 245 56 t ha 1 which was similar to the measured carbon densities from field investigation and the simulation process of the fcm model could better reflect the growth characteristic of aibes chensiensis the simulated carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest ecosystem in the study region were 5 23 105 t in 2018 with the average carbon density of 222 26 t ha 1 and increased along with tree growth to 5 60 105 t in 2028 its carbon storage increases of 7 11 compared to the current state of 2018 considering the complexity of forest carbon cycle process geo fcm could be thought of as a suitable carbon storage estimation model for forest at the regional scale even though with some limitations author contribution we certify

mountains data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction global warming has become a key problem that needs to be solved urgently which was caused by the significant increasing of co2 concentration in the atmosphere closely related to human activities ipcc 2013 forest ecosystem plays an important role in the global carbon cycle as the largest photosynthetic unit in terrestrial ecosystems which could effectively reduce the co2 concentration in the atmosphere through photosynthesis more than 90 of the co2 exchange between terrestrial plants and the atmosphere is completed by forests fang et al 2001 forest ecosystem also stored huge amount of carbon accounting for about 40 of the total carbon storage of terrestrial ecosystems dixon et al 1994 studies showed that forest ecosystem has always been a stable carbon sink with great positive significance for carbon sequestration pan 2011 forest ecosystems could easily be disturbed by human activities the deforestation would not only greatly reduce carbon sequestration capacity but also release stored soil organic carbon which lead to forest ecosystem being a contributor to global warming woodwell et al 1978 lu et al 2018 therefore forest ecosystems could be a carbon sink for mitigating climate change or a carbon source for enhancing global warming the role of forest ecosystem in climate change needs to be further clarified thus accurate estimation of carbon storage of forest ecosystem has significant implications for mitigating global warming in countries with advanced forestry technologies such as the united states lal 2005 tian et al 2015 domke et al 2017 canada liu 1997 bhatti et al 2002 sage 2019 europe neumann et al 2016 rodríguez martín et al 2016 and russia krankina et al 1996 filipchuk et al 2018 a great deal of researches have been conducted on estimation of forest ecosystem carbon storage china has also conducted extensive researches in this field since the 1950s fang et al 1998 2001 zhang et al 2013 tang et al 2018 after decades efforts methods for forest carbon storage estimation can be mainly divided into three basic types 1 inventory based estimation 2 satellite based estimation and 3 process based estimation piao et al 2009 average biomass method volume derived method biomass regression equation and conversion factor continuous method are the four most commonly used methods for estimating carbon storage based on forest inventory data such as forest types stand age density volume tree height and diameter at breast height dbh sun and liu 2020 multi source remote sensing data have become alternative means of quantifying forest aboveground biomass carbon storage wulder et al 2012 common optical remote sensing data such as landsat tm quickbird modis spot avhrr and gf x series were all used for forest carbon storage estimation hame et al 1997 shaban 2011 xu et al 2012 yang et al 2018 jia 2017 li et al 2019 sar has certain advantage of penetrability to forest canopy being able to obtain different canopy depths and forest structure levels data nelson et al 2007 the application of sar in forest biomass estimation mainly uses l band alos palsar as the data source sinha et al 2019 lidar has the ability to efficiently measure three dimensional structures particularly in estimating height and spatial structure of trees due to high cost current researches mainly use airborne radar or ground based radar data to estimate the biomass of individual trees or stand biomass which is difficult to apply to regional scale scaranello et al 2019 in terms of large scale applications the only source of spaceborne lidar data is nasa s icesat glas ice cloud and land elevation geoscience laser altimeter system data saatchi et al 2011 process based estimation can be divided into two main types geostatistical modeling and mechanism modeling geostatistical modeling combines forest inventory data with topography elevation slope and other environmental factors to construct statistical models to estimate forest biomass at regional scales kriging interpolation k nearest neighbours knn partial least squares support vector machine svm machine learning are the most commonly used methods for geostatistical models destan et al 2013 several process mechanism modeling models have been developed and applied widely such as biome bgc running and hunt 1993 cbm cfs3 kurz et al 2009 rothc mishra et al 2019 yasso liski et al 2005 century fang et al 2012 intec chen et al 2000 and ksfc lee et al 2014 ibis foley et al 1996 dlem tian et al 2010 lpj sitch et al 2003 which are constructed based on process of exchanges of mass and energy or biogeochemical process though these models have greatly promoted the development of forest carbon storage estimation there are still some limitations needed to improve for example how to combine biogeochemical process of forest and regional spatial data according to the ninth national forest resources survey report 2014 2018 of china forest area of china has reached to 2 2 108 ha and the area of artificial forest was about 0 80 108 ha with ranking first in the world national forestry and grassland administration 2020 china is one of the most important contributors to the increase of the world s forest resources chen et al 2019 the rapid increase of forests has formed forest ecosystems with different forest age more than 80 of the newly increased forests are young age middle age or near mature forests carbon storage of forest ecosystem is significantly affected by forest age and habitats with different forest ages and stands will result in an increased variation among forests liu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 in order to accurately assess carbon storage of forest ecosystems clarifying the characteristics of carbon storage change of different forest types in specific habitats is necessary the qinling mountains locates in the hinterland of eastern and mid china with special geographical characteristics and is one of the most important climatic dividing lines of china kang 2012 which plays an important role in soil and water conservation climate change response and ecological function services gao et al 2004 forests of the qinling mountains experienced severe deforestation from the 1970s to the 1990s the deforestation area exceeded 8 104 ha since the implementation of the natural forest protection project in 1998 the forest ecosystem has implemented a comprehensive ban on logging afforestation and conservation have been also putted into practice strictly after more than 20 years of artificial renewal and natural restoration forest ecosystem has been well restored cui and liu 1991 aibes chensiensis is a unique tree species in china which mainly distributed in the qinling mountains with important ecological value natural aibes chensiensis forest was normally mature forest with high carbon storage which has great research values and was also the ideal research object for carbon storage estimation modeling with good degree of pure forest li et al 2012 a series of carbon relevant studies have been carried out in the qinling mountains including researches on the biomass carbon storage of trees in different forest types yang and yunming 2015 zhang 2019 wei 2014 shrub biomass carbon storage li et al 2014 soil organic carbon storage zhang et al 2020 xue 2016 wang et al 2015 litter and coarse wood residue carbon storage li and chui 2019 dang et al 1998 yuan et al 2017 and forest biomass and tree growth patterns ma 2016 li et al 2018 these studies provided good foundations for the study of carbon storage of forest ecosystem in the qinling mountains however the existing researches were mainly based on sample plots with few researches on forest carbon storage at the regional scale and temporal dynamics therefore it is necessary to conduct further research on the carbon storage of forest ecosystem in the qinling mountains to fill this research gap in order to get an accurate estimation of carbon storage of forest ecosystem in the qinling mountains this study intended to target the following objectives 1 to establish a dynamic estimation model of forest carbon storage for tree stand scale according to the data of forest growth and degradation characteristics of aibes chensiensis 2 to construct a regional and temporal estimation model of forest carbon storage based on aibes chensiensis forest spatial distribution data from 3s technology our results could obtain an accurate estimation of tree based carbon storage of the aibes chensiensis forest and clarify the variation characteristics of carbon storage of aibes chensiensis forest at different age stages at the regional scale 2 material and methods 2 1 study area and field survey 2 1 1 study area the study area located in the changqing national nature reserve on the southern slope of the qinling mountains china fig 1 the reserve has an area of 29 906 ha with an elevation range of 800 3071 m asl and its forest coverage is greater than 90 it is a transitional climate region between the north subtropics and the warm temperate zone types of forest vary from sub tropical to cold temperate abies chensiensis was the dominate natural tree species in the study area with the area of 2351 ha which occupied about 10 of the whole reserve the type of soil of study area was brown forest soil alfisol according to chinese soil taxonomy 2 1 2 field survey field work was conducted during september 2016 to may 2019 two permanent sample plots of abies chensiensis forest were established for field survey which were 100 m 100 m in dimension table 1 the selected abies chensiensis forest was natural forest at the tree age around 80 years field survey included three parts plant surveying litter sampling and soil sampling for the plant survey quadrats of 10 m 10 m were used for the tree layer fig 2 we measured each tree 5 cm in the quadrats and took down their abundance tree species dbh diameter at breast height at 1 37 m tree height and canopy coverage for tree layer analysis for litter sampling quadrats of 0 5 m 0 5 m were established randomly in triple under the tree layer quadrats all the litters in each quadrat were collected to obtain the biomass of litter and their carbon fraction coefficient soils were sampled 0 30 cm 10 cm interval as a layer at each sampling site after clearing out the humus horizon using a soil borer with a diameter of 3 5 cm to guarantee the representative of soil samples random triplicate point sampling was applied soils from the 3 points in one quadrat were well mixed and screened using 2 mm sieves to remove residual plants roots and debris as a replicate sample from each plot soil samples were placed in sterile plastic bags and then air dried at room temperature in the lab to determine soil chemical characteristics soil bulk density was measured using the core cutter method physico chemical properties of soil were all measured by using routine methods and each treatment was conducted in triplicate potentiometry water soil 2 5 1 bao 2000 potassium dichromate oxidation external heating method were applied for ph and soil organic matter som respectively xue 2016 the data of field survey were used for model validation 2 2 fcm model description the individual tree based model is an empirical and dynamic carbon model that consists of three compartments biomass dead organic matter dom and soil organic matter som fig 3 which cover the main carbon storage of forest ecosystem in order to describe the model concisely fcm forest carbon estimation model was used as abbreviation in this study the calculation processes for the three carbon pools in fcm model were listed in table 2 1 biomass compartment this compartment consists of four parts stem branch leaf and root biomass of the four parts could be calculated through allometric equation of abies chensiensis eq 1 using the data of tree height and dbh cheng et al 2007 tree height or dbh was a regression function with tree age as independent variable this regression function was established through the gompertz growth regression theory equation eq 2 yang 2019 forest biomass of individual tree was calculated further in this calculation forest stand density was needed to scale carbon storage to regional area for forest stand density there was a power function relationship between stand density and mean dbh in the similar age forest without thinning eq 3 deng 2009 carbon storages of tree biomass parts along tree age were calculated by combing eqs 1 3 for specific tree species 1 dom compartment carbon storage of dom pool was decided by two key processes which could be described as input process and output process eq 4 the carbon storage inputs d o m i n t were decided by mortalities of different biomass parts stem branch leaf and root the mortality of biomass could be represented by turnover rate of different tree parts d o m i n t was calculated by eq 5 decay rate of dom usually significant correlated with temperature in our model decay rate was explained through a single exponential decay function olson 1963 shown as eq 6 decay constant k i was further connected with temperature as a function of soil temperature and q10 value following an arrhenius equation eq 7 yi et al 2013 1 som compartment humus is the major component of som which could occupy more than 90 of som in our model we took humus as the som our model simulated som by two processes since there are two status of humus with different decay rates in soil kurz et al 2009 the simulation process of humus could be described as eq 8 during the decay process of dom or humus proportional substances were lost to atmospheric as gasses such as co2 or ch4 these parts were deducted in calculating the input of dom or humus the details of carbon loss fraction to atmosphere could also be found in supplementary part a table s1 2 3 geo fcm model description the construction conception of the geo fcm model was through calculating the stand carbon density of each patch of the specific tree species at the regional scale using fcm model the patch should have the information such as patch area annual average temperature tree age the frame of geo fcm model was shown as fig 4 for the tree stand age of each patch could not be obtained accurately we calculated the regional carbon storage used the distribution ratio of tree stand ages in the study area the ratio was obtained according to second survey of forest resources and the details could be found from supplementary part a table s2 after carbon storage of each patch was estimated eq 9 was then used to calculate the regional carbon storage 9 c s t o r a g e t i 1 m j 1 n c i j t where c s t o r a g e t was the regional carbon storage at t time c i j t was the carbon storage of tree species i in patch j at t time m and n were the numbers of tree species and patch respectively three other methods i e average biomass method conversion factor continuous method and soilgrids250m database were also used to estimate the carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in research region in order to compare and validate the results of geo fcm model the calculation equation used for average biomass method and conversion factor continuous method showed in table 3 the soilgrids250m database is a global automatic soil mapping system developed through machine learning based on 150 000 soil profile data and related variable data it predicts soil physicochemical properties at 7 vertical profiles 0 5 15 30 60 100 and 200 cm including soil organic carbon soil bulk density ph cation exchange capacity and soil texture etc which has become an important reference for global soil organic carbon estimation and related models in our research we download the data of study region from soilgrids250m database and then overlay with object oriented classification results to extract soil organic carbon data for each patch through arcgis software 2 4 model parameters and data input parameters used in fcm model included three parts biomass growth parameters turnover rate parameters and decay rate parameters supplementary part a table s1 these parameters for fcm model were determined through references reviewed and our field survey based on specific tree species the input data for fcm model were tree species tree age and air temperature which were readily available for various forests in multiple regions 3 results 3 1 model initialization and simulation multiple iterations were used to determine the initial value of fcm model assuming that all carbon pools were zero at initial state through several times of growth and harvest of trees slow decay humus carbon pool decomposition period 500a would reach a stable state in this study we terminated the iteration of the model when the difference of slow decay humus carbon pool between two successions was less than 0 1 and defined it as the stable state of the system the initial values of the model were determined at this state the initialization process of the model in our study used 80 year intervals as the logging cycle the initialization process of the model needs to meet the following assumptions 1 no succession occurred and tree species composition of the forest did not change 2 the growth characteristics of forest did not change 3 no other interferences except clearing 4 management of forest kept the same method 5 new forest would be planted immediately after clearing 6 stand productivity did not change during this simulation 7 physicochemical and biological characteristics of the soil environment were not changed 8 environmental conditions such as temperature and precipitation did not change dynamic characteristics of slow decay humus carbon pool during initialization process were shown in fig 5 the result showed that slow decay humus carbon pool reached to a stable state at the 30th iteration for the difference between the 29th and 30th iterations was 0 02 0 1 and the value of the stable state was 95 3 t ha 1 then the model run one more time until it reached the planned forest stand age 120a in the study and carbon storage of forest at this age were determined as current carbon storage further model run from this age implied the simulation of future carbon dynamics 3 2 carbon storage estimation of abies chensiensis forest the running process of the model simulated the regularity of abies chensiensis growth at a simulation period of 120 years fig 6 a in the process of forest growth under the simulation it was divided into three stages 1 the early growth stage with carbon storage decreased 2 the pre middle stage with carbon storage increased rapidly annual growth rate 0 5 and 3 the later growth stage with carbon storage increased slowly annual growth rate 0 5 at the end of the early growth stage the 8th year carbon density of abies chensiensis forest reached to the lowest level then abies chensiensis forest grew in a rapid rate lasting about 100 years subsequently the trees went into a mature stage with biomass increasing slowly carbon density of the entire ecosystem reached to 326 20 t ha 1 at 120th year with 1 m soil depth in the process of forest growth dynamic patterns of different carbon pools varied dom carbon density and som carbon density were consistent with the total ecosystem carbon density which were decreased first and then increased som carbon density with 1 m soil depth was relatively stable with the lowest value of 83 84 t ha 1 which occurred at 45th year whereas biomass carbon density above and underground part increased during the forest growth process the proportion of different carbon pools varied with the growth stage of forest in the early growth stage the proportions of dom carbon and som carbon were high while the proportion of biomass carbon was low 5 in the first ten years the proportions of three carbon pools were relatively stable from the 60th year of simulation period where the proportions of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool were about 50 15 and 35 respectively validation simulated carbon densities at tree age of 80 years from fcm model were 245 56 t ha 1 while the values of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool were 123 92 22 52 and 89 00 t ha 1 respectively fig 6b comparison with measured carbon densities from field investigation difference in biomass carbon density was within 5 while measured biomass carbon density was 120 48 t ha 1 estimated som carbon density 0 30 cm was 13 56 lower than measured som carbon density 95 36 t ha 1 while estimated aboveground litter carbon density 11 58 t ha 1 to ensure the consistency of the comparison only the estimated results of aboveground litter part from the model was displayed to compare estimated aboveground litter carbon density was higher than measured aboveground litter carbon density 3 10 t ha 1 3 3 carbon storage estimation of abies chensiensis forest at the regional scale carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest at the regional scale was predicted through geo fcm model the simulated carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in changqing national nature reserve was 5 23 105 t in 2018 table 4 with the average carbon density of 222 26 t ha 1 in terms of specific carbon pools values of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool were 2 75 105 0 47 105 and 2 00 105 t respectively their average carbon densities were 117 04 19 90 and 85 32 t ha 1 respectively carbon storage increased along with tree growth we took the carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in 2028 as an example which reached to 5 60 105 t with an increase of 7 11 compared to the state of 2018 the estimated values of biomass carbon pool dom carbon pool and som carbon pool increased about 3 03 105 0 52 105 and 2 05 105 t respectively among them dom carbon pool increased most rapidly with the increase rate of 10 87 while som carbon storage was relatively stable with the increase rate of 2 17 in terms of spatial distribution shown in fig 7 carbon densities of different forest patches varied from 272 18 to 294 42 t ha 1 in 2018 fig 7a the patches with higher carbon densities exist in high altitude areas where have lower annual temperature after 10 year growth carbon densities of different abies chensiensis forest patches increased and the range varied from 288 77 to 312 52 t ha 1 fig 7b with average growth rate of about 6 10 here one patch with the area of 4 78 ha taken as an example showed its the carbon density increased from 293 55 t ha 1 to 311 58 t ha 1 fig 7c and d validation three other methods i e average biomass method conversion factor continuous method and soilgrids250 m database were also used to estimate the carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest in research region in order to compare and validate the results of geo fcm model table 3 showed their estimation on carbon storage in terms of biomass carbon storage the estimated result of geo fcm model was 57 09 higher than that of conversion factor continuous method while it was similar to that of average biomass method with 2 91 lower in terms of som carbon storage 0 30 cm depth the estimated result of geo fcm model was also lower than that of average biomass method 17 36 but the difference was receivable the estimated som carbon storage 0 30 cm depth from soilgrids250m database was 43 50 higher than that from geo fcm model table 5 the differences of carbon storage estimated by different methods could be well explained which showed in the discussion part in details the data and calculation process of average biomass method conversion factor continuous method and soilgrids250m database were arranged in supplementary part b 4 discussions 1 model selection and its parameters tree growth is the basis for the existence of the forest ecosystem by establishing a stand growth model we can understand the law of tree growth and change predict and analyze the growth of tree stand deng 2009 forestry scholars have established several forest stand theoretic growth equations based on analytical stem data to predict tree growth such as gompertz equation rupsys et al 2011 logistic equation fortin 2014 richards equation wei et al 2012 in our study gompertz equation was chosen as the tree growth model which was much better than logistic and richards equation for abies chensiensis forest simulation pan et al 2019 also found that gompertz equation was the optimal growth model for chinese fir natural forest among seven growth models pan 2019 in this study biomass turnover was used to express the input of biomass to dead organic matter our study focused on abies chensiensis therefore the selection of model parameters was mainly based on the research results of the same tree species the biomass turnover parameters of trunks and fine roots were from the cbm cfs3 model kurz et al 2009 and the biomass turnover ratios of branches leaves and thick roots were from the research results of zhou et al 2010 fcm model was established based on the decomposition rate of different carbon pools thus the decomposition rates of each carbon pool need to be determined the lignin composition of trunk residues branch residues and rough root residues was relatively consistent and there is almost no differences in the degradation rate during the decomposition process lee et al 2014 the degradation rates of the three parts were same in our model which were from the data obtained by smyth et al 2010 the degradation rate of aboveground litter was from our field survey which was similar to the results of he et al 2011 in the same research region he 2011 the degradation rate of underground litter fine root was obtained from the results of chang et al 2011 easily degradable humus from the results of soil carbon turnover rate at the national scale in china wang et al 2018 and refractory humus from the values of yasso forest soil carbon cycle research liski et al 2005 at the regional scale climate was the dominant factor affecting the rate of decomposition not organic matter quality tree species composition and leaf habit etc huang et al 2010 in our study the common value q10 2 was used to adjust the effects of temperature in different regions smyth et al 2010 1 fcm model the estimated biomass carbon density from fcm model was slightly higher than the observed value which may be due to the existence of a certain degree of associated tree species in the actual stand field the fcm model simulated biomass carbon density in our study taking abies chensiensis trees as 100 in the field the underestimation of som carbon density may be due to the assumption that all som carbon came from biomass input in the model but in fact the organic carbon from humus accounted for about 90 95 of som carbon xu et al 2018 which leaded fcm model underestimated som carbon in the biomass simulation part the allometric equation calculated the biomass of different organs according to the dbh and tree height and both of them increased with tree age zhao et al 2019 which resulted in a continuous increasing of leaf biomass this process leads the differences to be occurred between the estimated and measured values of aboveground litter carbon though such researches showed that litter would turn to decline after reaching a peak along with tree age increased there is still no robust general description formulas or empirical parameters to simulate the process zhu 2019 pedersen and bille hansen 1999 considering that the significant difference between the estimated and measured values of aboveground litter carbon occurred in the later period of forest growth with a low growth rate the aboveground litter biomass would be at a relatively stable level with unrestricted growth meanwhile the aboveground litter carbon only accounted for 1 5 of the entire forest ecosystem with limited impacts on the estimation accuracy of the model thus it is acceptable for the existing difference between estimated and measured values of aboveground litter carbon 1 geo fcm model the estimated biomass carbon storage of geo fcm model was slightly lower than that of average biomass method which may be due to that geo fcm model fully considered the influence of different forest ages while the average biomass method just used the measured tree age around 80 years old compared with conversion factor continuous method although the forest age classification ratio of geo fcm model was determined according to the data of the second class survey of forest resources in the study area the estimated biomass carbon storage of geo fcm model was much higher than that of conversion factor continuous method the main reason may be that parameters used in this method were obtained at the national scale which were lower than those of the study area with high quality forest and the effect of forest age was not considered well in the parameters fitting thus biomass carbon storage obtained by conversion factor continuous method would underestimate when it was applied at the regional scale zhao et al 2019 the estimated som carbon storage of geo fcm model was slightly lower than that of average biomass method the reason may be that geo fcm model assumed som carbon storage was all derived from biomass input but in fact humus organic carbon accounted for about 90 of soil organic carbon batjes 1996 this leaded to an underestimation of som carbon storage by geo fcm model overall the result of the geo fcm model for som carbon storage estimation was consistent with the results of the related studies tang et al 2018 wang et al 2015 the soilgrids250 m database clearly overestimated som carbon storage in the study area which was also consistent with the model interpretation rate of the soilgrids250 m averaging around 61 hengl et al 2017 though there was no direct data to calculate dom carbon storage in the study area validation was also done through literature review since trunk residues branch residues aboveground litter and underground tree root residues were all considered by geo fcm model the estimated dom carbon storage by geo fcm model was higher than those of the related studies that only estimate the aboveground litter in the study area for carbon storage of aboveground litter the estimated result by geo fcm model was in a reasonable range compared with the related researches zhang 2019 he 2011 dai et al 2018 overall geo fcm model could accurately reflect carbon storage of aibes chensiensis forest in the study area considering the complexity of forest carbon cycle process geo fcm model could be thought as a suitable carbon storage estimation model for forest at the regional scale furthermore geo fcm model can predict temporal changes of forest carbon storage which can provide an important reference for forest management and selection of plantation tree species 1 limitations of fcm and geo fcm models in estimating forest carbon storage tree species and its stand age were the determining factors of forest carbon storage zhu et al 2019 growth regression theory equation was established with tree age as independent variable in our model this improved the accuracy of regional forest carbon estimation where the region has less data of forest stand volume without continuous forest survey meanwhile the model required relative less input data and would have a wide range of applications however both fcm and geo fcm model have several limitations in estimating forest carbon storage shown below unable to solve heterogenous tree stand age issue the tree stand age of each tree was different in one patch and it is very hard to distinguish tree age of each tree stand and divide it into smaller patch with same tree age the solution in our study was introducing the distribution ratio of tree stand ages to obtain more accuracy results unable to estimate the region with different tree species in natural environment there was no ideal pure forest ecosystem and different tree species had different grow rhythm which could result in some deviation of the simulation results in our study we assumed that the modeled patches were pure forest which had more than 65 of single tree species unable to consider the impact of climate change on forest growth in the model there were temperature parameters in the model operating parameters but the effect of precipitation change on decomposition was not explained nor the effect of climate change on forest growth it was also assumed that there will be no change in temperature and precipitation in the future unable to consider the impact of disturbance on forest carbon storage model cannot simulate changes in forest carbon storages under disturbance scenarios for example during the growth of trees there may be disturbances such as pests and diseases fire etc which could affect tree growth 5 conclusions in this study a stand scale forest carbon storage estimation model fcm model was successfully constructed based on the key factors of forest growth and degradation and a geo fcm model suitable for regional scale forest carbon stock estimation was developed the carbon storage of aibes chensiensis forest in the southern slope of the middle qinling mountains was estimated using geo fcm model the estimated stand carbon density of aibes chensiensis forest at tree age of 80 years from fcm model were 245 56 t ha 1 which was similar to the measured carbon densities from field investigation and the simulation process of the fcm model could better reflect the growth characteristic of aibes chensiensis the simulated carbon storage of abies chensiensis forest ecosystem in the study region were 5 23 105 t in 2018 with the average carbon density of 222 26 t ha 1 and increased along with tree growth to 5 60 105 t in 2028 its carbon storage increases of 7 11 compared to the current state of 2018 considering the complexity of forest carbon cycle process geo fcm could be thought of as a suitable carbon storage estimation model for forest at the regional scale even though with some limitations author contribution we certify

model to elucidate phytoplankton biomass and growth rates in tonle sap lake a large tropical lake floodplain system in cambodia the model consists of three modules of sediment phosphorus and phytoplankton explicitly describing the major processes of phytoplankton i e advection dispersion growth death sedimentation and resuspension as the basis the hydrological hydrodynamics model was applied to simulate the tributary river discharges and hydrodynamics of the lake then the pp model was calibrated for the period from november 2016 to july 2018 and validated from august 2018 to june 2019 the root mean square error of the simulated chlorophyll a concentration was 18 0 µg l in the calibration and 10 1 µg l in the validation indicating that the model described the major spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the lake the pp model revealed that the median specific growth rate and net growth rate in this lake peaked during the low water

habitat for various phytoplankton groups with possible inputs of nutrients and algae from bed sediment i e meroplankton dzialowski et al 2008 schallenberg and burns 2004 phillips et al 2005 as a result phytoplankton biomass and community show their dynamic shifts according to the seasonal flood pulse loverde oliveira and huszar 2019 campbell et al 2006 uk et al 2018 sarkkula et al 2003 therefore it is important to understand the phytoplankton growth and dynamics in tropical lake floodplain systems the phytoplankton community is affected by a variety of environmental factors such as ph water temperature light condition nutrient concentration water flow wind speed and biotic factors such as planktonic herbivores yu 2010 steele 1978 smayda 2008 primary production in tropical lakes is likely higher than in temperate lakes on a given nutrient base lewis 2000 possibly owing to its high decomposition rate sarmento 2012 and nutrient use efficiency lewis 2000 under the condition of high temperature and strong solar irradiance lewis jr 1996 von sperling 1997 has suggested that the nutrient assimilation and nutrient cycling rates are also high in tropical lakes if they are the case the tropical lakes seem to be more sensitive to the increment of nutrient supply than temperate lakes hecky 2000 lewis 2000 nevertheless our understanding of phytoplankton productivity and its relation to relevant processes e g nutrient dynamics hydrology and anthropogenic impacts in tropical lake floodplain systems remains unclear the rates of these processes have rarely been quantified particularly the rates of phytoplankton growth and loss and nutrient recycling to elucidate nutrient dynamics and primary production in the water environment mechanistic models also called process based models fornarelli et al 2013 or theoretical models vanhuet 1992 can be useful as they are based on the a priori knowledge of the driving processes of the lentic systems vinçon leite and casenave 2019 such a modeling approach is particularly useful for elucidating reaction rates e g primary production and mortality and those spatiotemporal distributions to date multidimensional process based primary production models have been developed and applied to various temperate shallow lakes e g zhao et al 2020 and zhang et al 2008 and subtropic lakes e g huang et al 2012 liu et al 2021 and fragoso et al 2008 these models are often coupled with a detailed hydrodynamics model and validated using the field data thus they are able to explain the effects of turbulence on phytoplankton growth and nutrient zhao et al 2020 the phytoplankton patchiness and their role in productivity hillmer et al 2008 and the mechanisms of phytoplankton bloom and the effects of such blooms on nutrient cycles sohma et al 2022 multidimensional process based primary production models are also designed to be used for the accurate simulation of the whole ecosystem vinçon leite and casenave 2019 for tropical lake floodplain systems however the multidimensional process based models have not been developed and applied to elucidate phytoplankton growth and primary production a phytoplankton model has been developed to predict short term algae blooms in lake taihu huang et al 2012 whereas this model does not include the nutrient and sediment modules other models are able to comprehensively explain the hydrodynamics nutrients phytoplankton and or zooplankton biomass in subtropic lakes while they do not integrate sediment transport liu et al 2021 fragoso et al 2008 therefore these models could not apply to the tropical lake floodplain systems where sediment nutrient and phytoplankton are closely coupled uk et al 2018 houser 2016 weigelhofer et al 2015 in fact lamberts and koponen 2008 have investigated a tropical lake floodplain system of tsl using an impact assessment model for estimating the potential ecosystem production although this model serves as a useful tool for the impact assessment it cannot describe the processes of nutrient and phytoplankton due to the simplification and unknown parameters that do not explicitly represent the rates of those processes in the models lamberts and koponen 2008 recently a hydrodynamics based phosphorus dynamics model has been developed to elucidate mass balance and spatiotemporal dynamics of phosphorus in tsl theng et al 2022 nevertheless this model also misses the explicit relation between nutrient dynamics and primary production therefore the objective of this study is to comprehensively understand phytoplankton growth and its biomass in a large tropical lake floodplain system tsl through the development of a process based primary production model the model was developed in two dimensions integrating three modules of nutrient phytoplankton and sediment to describe phytoplankton biomass on the basis of a hydrodynamics model this model was used to investigate the distributions of their biomass and rates of growth and loss in tsl then the calibrated parameters of the phytoplankton module were compared with lakes in the world focusing on phytoplankton growth mortality and settling rates in addition the sensitivity analysis was applied to elucidate the impacts of the model parameters and sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass 2 study area tsl was selected as the study area in this study fig 1 the model domain is including an open lake and its floodplain green red and blue area in fig 1 tsl is the center of fishery production in cambodia and is globally significant which was nominated in the man and biosphere program of unesco as a biosphere reserve in 1997 nam and song 2011 this tropical lake floodplain system is the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia being influenced by the seasonal flood pulse of the mekong river mr totally 12 main local tributaries are connected to the lake the lake water drains to tonle sap river tsr and mr the arrow in fig 1 in the dry season october to april or may while tsr shows reversal flow to tsl in the rainy season may to september the rainfall is influenced by the tropical monsoon climate mainly occurring between april and november with a peak in september the average annual rainfall surrounding tsl was 1 413 mm during our field survey and ranged from 1 342 to 1 561 mm during 1997 1999 campbell et al 2006 the spatial average of water depth ranged from 0 5 to 5 4 m and the lake s surface area ranged from 5 587 to 20 631 km2 extending the lake over the vast floodplain during 1999 2003 tanaka et al 2018 the lake water temperature ranges from 28 to 33 c sarkkula et al 2003 campbell et al 2006 according to the redfield ratio redfield 1934 phosphorus was likely the limiting nutrient in this lake figs s1 a and b for instance it has been reported that phosphorus appears to be a limiting nutrient in tsl throughout the year sarkkula et al 2003 except during periods of light limitation and in the northeast part of the lake burnett et al 2017 the total suspension solid in the open lake was higher than 1 000 mg l and 5 20 mg l during the low and high water periods respectively sarkkula et al 2003 the chlorophyll a chl a and phytoplankton biomass were also high during the low water period and low during the high water period sarkkula et al 2003 in this lake at least 149 species of fish are recorded and it provides habitat for 11 globally threatened and 6 near threatened species of vertebrates campbell et al 2006 in the model domain the total population in 2008 was 2 118 668 living in 2005 villages national institute of statistics 2010 black circles in fig 1 most of the wastewater from those villages discharge directly into the nearby river and tsl without any treatment due to the lack of wastewater treatment facilities brown et al 2010 takahashi et al 2002 the villages in the tsl catchment were classified into three types land based land water based and floating villages or water based sithirith 2011 3 methodology process based primary production model pp model was structured with components and processes of phosphorus phytoplankton and sediment which is coupled with a two dimensional local inertial model 2d lie the daily output from the 2d lie model water depth and flux was used as a basis for the pp model 3 1 hydrological hydrodynamics model 2d lie model as a simplified counterpart of the conventional shallow water equations was applied to compute daily horizontal two dimensional flow structure i e water depth and flux in tsl with a spatial resolution of 500 m tanaka et al 2019 the numerical method of 2d lie is based on the exact solution based discretization as an alternative to the conventional semi implicit scheme the numerical time step is updated according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition with the safety factor cfl 0 7 see tanaka et al 2019 2d lie neglected the coriolis force and wind shear as they have negligible influences on the surface water dynamics of tsl compared to reversal flows from the mr and inflow from local tributaries see tanaka and yoshioka 2017 for more details the discharge of 12 main local tributaries around tsl was simulated using soil water assessment tool swat model serving the boundary of tributary discharges for 2d lie and pp models the points indicated by red circles in fig 1 the observed water level at prek kdam station connected between tsl and tsr served as the boundary condition of 2d lie for tsr tsr discharge simulated by 2d lie also served as the boundary condition of the pp model 3 2 primary production model the pp model consists of three major modules including phosphorus phytoplankton and sediment fig 2 the phosphorus module consists of two important fractions which are dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and exchangeable particulate inorganic phosphorus pip the phytoplankton is quantified in terms of chlorophyll a chl a concentration the sediment module is the total suspended solids ss in water column including inorganic and organic suspended solids such as phytoplankton live and dead cells the equations for dip pip chl a and ss are described by the following mass transport equation 1 h c t

domain of 2d lie and pp models the green red and blue areas of fig 1 we implemented the hydrodynamics model 2d lie tanaka et al 2019 with the same assumption and method as theng et al 2022 the numerical discretization of advection dispersion equations was based on a finite volume method equipped with a total variation diminishing of the monotonic upstream centered type in a stable mass conservative and accurate manner prabhakaran and doss 2015 smaoui et al 2008 the temporal discretization of the scheme is based on the classical first order euler forward method the numerical time step was automatically adjusted according to the water velocity and dispersion coefficient to satisfy the stability condition of the advection dispersion equation cfl 0 5 in this study the evaluation of numerical discretion in the benchmark test and tsl application was satisfied see details theng et al 2022 in this application the x direction is from west to east while the y direction is from south to north using the coordination system vn 2000 utm zone 48n the pp model is our original code program written in c program while the governing equations of physical chemical and biological processes are based on literature and key parameters were calibrated based on the observation in the lake all the computation was implemented using workstations microsoft windows 10 the simulation for four year period took approximately eight hours on the workstations as for water quality and phytoplankton we utilized the observation data from 2016 to 2019 which has been detailed by uk et al 2022 the measurement of water quality parameters of tsl was conducted on sites and in a laboratory in short 37 samples including ss dip tpp and chl a concentrations were collected in tsl every three months for the phosphorus in sediment tpbed the 37 observations sampled during march 2017 were assumed to be constant for the whole study period monthly wind data with a resolution of 11 1 km taken from muñoz sabater 2019 was inputted into the pp model and assumed it was constant each month the vegetation cover with a resolution of 100 m taken from buchhorn et al 2020 was classified into four categories grass shrub forest and open water to represent the effects of different vegetation cover on net sedimentation siev et al 2018 all input data of swat 2d lie and pp models were summarized table s1 the conversion from phosphorus to chl a ypchla is 1 mg mg schnoor 1996 the conversion from chl a to dry biomass kschla is 19 35 mg g ayed et al 2015 this ratio is for green freshwater microalga chlorella vulgaris while in tsl the blue green algae were dominant during the low water period sarkkula et al 2003 as the variation of water temperature during our field survey is small in tsl 29 8 1 5 c uk et al 2022 we assumed that the effects of light f l and water temperature f t on phytoplankton growth rate were constant and express as one constant rate the density of dry bed sediment ρ s e d was 480 kg m3 calculated based on wet sediment density 1300 kg m3 siev et al 2018 and porosity of bed sediment 0 82 qin 2008 huang et al 2018 the number of villages and population data in 2008 were obtained from the national institute of statistics 2010 the population of the villages in 2016 2019 was estimated based on the annual population growth rate 1 54 national institute of statistics 2010 according to keskinen 2006 most floating villages are located on tsl where their dems are less than 6 m therefore in this study the villages located on the model domain with their dems less than 6 m were assumed as floating villages we assumed the floating villages moved to the nearby forest or land where the maximum distance from floating villages to the flooded forest or land was less than 4 5 km according to our survey in february and march 2020 in addition the water depth at that temporary location required at least 1 m the village population was assumed to be distributed in a 1 km2 squared area theng et al 2022 the dip mass from the villages was assumed to be accumulated on the land when dry and immediately released to the lake water when inundated while the ss and pip mass was considered only when inundated the concentrations of ss dip and pip contained in wastewater discharge from the villages are summarized table s1 due to some limitations in the field observation the observed chl a dip pip and ss concentrations from all tributaries every three months were assumed that they kept constant for every three months i e the observed data in march served as input data for february march and april when the observations of ss tpp dip and chl a data were not available the monthly average of those available data in that month during 2016 2018 was assumed to be the same in the tributaries during 2019 based on those data and assumptions the hydrodynamics model 2d lie was validated first and then the pp model was calibrated and validated 2d lie was validated from november 2016 to december 2019 using the calibrated parameters of tanaka et al 2018 the error magnitude of the water level for the whole period from july 1998 to december 2003 is from 1 12 m to 0 622 m tanaka et al 2018 the model parameters of sediment phosphorus and phytoplankton modules were manually calibrated from november 2016 to july 2018 and validated from august 2018 to june 2019 table s2 the calibration and validation were conducted based on the data at 37 sample sites every three months in tsl fig 1 the field survey in each season took from one to two weeks to cover the whole lake and thus the simulated dip pip chl a and ss concentration were extracted from the model at the same date as the sampling for calibration and validation in the calibration process all model parameters were manually calibrated in a way to minimize the root mean square error rmse of the dip chl a and ss concentration against its observation the range of model parameters in previous studies was shown in table s2 the simulated pip concentration was compared with the observed tpp concentration by assuming the fraction of pip to tpp in the water is equal to the fraction of pip to tpbed fp in eq 7 as pip concentration in the lake was unavailable in the application in every calculation the model was turned for the first 1 year period to obtain the initial condition by feeding the observed chl a dip pip and ss concentrations in december 2016 the boundary conditions in this first 1 year and the model parameters after the calibration we investigated the distributions of their biomass and rates of growth and loss in tsl to characterize the primary production in tsl we compared the calibrated loss the summation of phytoplankton death respiration and fish and zooplankton grazing settling and growth rates of phytoplankton in tsl with those in other lakes 3 4 spatial sensitivity analysis the spatial sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the responses of chl a concentration to the model parameters in the phytoplankton module i e vc kp chlabed km and gmax for the study period i e november 2016 december 2019 it also determined how the changes in the model parameters affect the chl a concentration in tsl the spatial sensitivity index ssi was calculated using eq 15 nelson et al 2018 theng et al 2022 15 s s i x y c m a x x y c m i n x y i m a x x y i m i n x y i x y c x y where the subscripts x and y are the coordination points in the x and y directions i max and i min denote the maximum and minimum values of each parameter or boundary value among its variations from the baseline respectively c max and c min are the maximum and minimum chl a concentrations in tsl responding to the variations of each parameter value respectively c and i denote the averages of the chl a concentration in tsl and each parameter condition respectively to determine the ssi of a model parameter either one of the parameters was varied from the baseline condition by factors from 0 5 to 1 5 with the intervals of 0 25 i e from 50 to 50 of the baseline whereas other parameters were kept unchanged i e at baseline conditions the baseline condition was defined as the chl a concentration reproduced from november 2016 to december 2019 then the calculated ssi was output and discussed separately for the four hydrological periods based on the temporal average chl a concentration at each grid for each period the four hydrological periods are the low water period april may the inflow period june september the early outflow period october december and the late outflow period january march hoshikawa et al 2019 then to investigate the effects of sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass the simulated results were taken as the baseline condition and then the sediment carrying capacity varied in the range from 75 to 75 of the baseline condition while other parameters were kept the same as the baseline condition when the sediment carrying capacity increased the sediment resuspension increased and vice versa 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance in the 2d lie validation the simulated water level at kampong loung station a white triangle in fig 1 showed a good correlation with the observed data r 0 99 fig 3 a the rmse of the water level was 0 60 m in the whole calculated period during which the observed water level ranged from 0 64 to 8 54 m although the simulated water level showed some difference from the observation during the lowest and highest water level in each hydrological cycle the validation in this period resulted in slightly larger errors than the calibration and validation from july 1998 to december 2003 tanaka et al 2018 which was possibly caused by the changes in environmental factors such as land use and land cover in the floodplain and groundwater discharge as the model does not integrate them in an explicit manner for the pp model the simulated dip tpp chl a and ss concentrations also showed a good agreement with the observation and the rmses in the calibration and validation were comparable in all modules figs 3b e the rmses of tpp in the calibration and validation were 26 2 and 54 4 µg l respectively fig 3c for the phytoplankton module the rmses of chl a concentration in the calibration and validation were 18 0 and 10 1 µg l respectively fig 3d the spatial distribution of chl a concentration between observation and simulation showed similar patterns fig s2 for ss concentration the rmses in the calibration and validation were 103 5 and 102 4 mg l respectively fig 3e the relatively large error of the simulated dip tpp chl a and ss concentration was confirmed during the low water period march 2017 when the observation data was fluctuating to be specific in march the rmses of dip in the calibration and validation were 8 6 and 7 8 µg l respectively fig 3b although the simulated dip was mostly comparable to the observation these errors might be caused by the error of hydrodynamics simulation during the low water period and the seasonally shifting groups of phytoplankton possibly showing different settling growth and mortality rates while the model did not distinguish the groups of phytoplankton nevertheless the outputs from the pp model and the field observations uk 2022 showed the peak concentrations of chl a dip and ss during the low water period and low concentrations during the high water period to be specific the concentrations of chl a and dip were high mostly in the northwest part of the lake fig 4 uk 2022 therefore the pp model was confirmed to reproduce the seasonal pattern of the concentration of chl a in tsl with the accuracy indicated by rmses table s3 thus these results indicated that the model reasonably describes the processes and dynamics of sediment phosphorus and phytoplankton table s3 the calibrated model parameters provide reasonable estimates of the ecosystem processes related to those three components ecological models are more or less empirical and mechanistic aldenberg et al 1995 for the large floodplain it is usually not feasible to describe ecological processes using approaches of field survey and the experimental study with similar spatial and temporal resolutions to the presented modeling approach there are several types of models such as mass balance regression linear or non linear and process based models because the ecological processes are mostly non linear so the non linear models such as optimal information flow ecosystem model li and convertino 2021 pcmci runge et al 2019 and empirical dynamic modeling edm wang et al 2019 have been applied to describe the non linear interactions of the variables for example the edm of wang et al 2019 has been applied to prediction of 2 methylisoborneol mib production in kamafusa reservoir in japan and determined causal variables for mib production however these non linear models cannot describe the mass balance i e the input and or output of nutrients and phytoplankton and spatial effects thus the process based model is useful to describe the dynamics mass balance and processes of the ecosystem even though model application is usually based on the a priori knowledge of the driving processes of lentic systems vinçon leite and casenave 2019 considering the assumptions in the modeling the processed based pp model reproduced reasonable and possible dynamics of phytoplankton in tsl which need further validation and improvement for better understanding by accumulating field observation and detailed investigation of specific processes this two dimensional process based model could extend its application to various scenarios such as the effects of floodplain land use future changes of floating villages and hydrological changes due to dam construction on primary production as long as the model assumption is valid for example on the limiting nutrient light and temperature condition 4 2 phytoplankton biomass the model simulation showed that the concentration of chl a peaked in april and may every year when the lake is shallow figs 4 and 5 the concentration was mostly higher than 5 µg l in the whole lake and 20 µg l in the northwest part of the lake and tributary outlets e g fig 4a then the average chl a concentration decreased gradually from 12 3 µg l in april to 3 8 µg l in september when the water level increased figs 4 and 5 during the rising water period the chl a concentration in tsl was strongly affected by the water flow from tsr which transported the major phytoplankton biomass towards northwest of the lake e g fig 4b in this season i e july the average concentration of chl a was 8 5 µg l fig 4 and a high concentration of chl a was found at the northwest part of the lake and the outlet of some local tributaries in september the concentration of chl a was widely uniform with the concentration of less than 3 µg l while the high concentration was found at the riparian zone of the inundated floodplain fig 4c in january the average concentration of chl a increased to 7 0 µg l as the water level decreased fig 5 as the water flowed out from tsl to tsr in this season the phytoplankton in the northwest part of the lake was transported to the southeast part of the lake and further to tsr fig 4d after january chl a concentration continued increasing until april or may this seasonal pattern of chl a concentration was confirmed in every hydrological year the daily change of chl a concentration was shown in the movie file appendix 2 during the low water period the chl a concentration peaked when the ss concentration showed the highest fig 5 in general high concentration of ss limits the light availability for phytoplankton growth and suppresses the phytoplankton biomass however this pattern has not been indicated also in the field observation uk 2022 say et al 2022 sarkkula et al 2003 song et al 2004 and both observation and simulation showed these peaks at the same season figs 3 and 5 the algae bloom in tsl has not yet been studied based on a general threshold value of chl a concentration nevertheless according to cunha et al 2013 eutrophication has occurred when the concentration of chl a is equal to or higher than 10 1 µg l the prevalence of algal bloom was observed on the water surface especially at the northern part and around floating villages during our field survey say et al 2022 the bloom of floating blue green algae has been seen during the low water period and the floating algal scum is hardly observed during the high water period also in other reports ohtaka et al 2010 mizuno and mori 1970 sarkkula et al 2003 and song et al 2004 have reported that one of the dominant species of phytoplankton anabaena spp develops heterocysts on the topmost centimeters of the water surface during the low water period indicating nitrogen fixing activity according to the model simulation the peak concentration of chl a during this period was caused by the increased availability of dip due to the internal loading i e its loading rate via desorption and diffusion 61 8 76 7 µg l month in march may the high desorption of dip was caused by the high net sediment resuspension from bed sediment which increased the pip concentration in the water column the previous studies also showed that the dominant internal loading during the low water period increased phosphorus concentration sarkkula et al 2003 uk et al 2018 theng et al 2022 the model also reproduced the pattern that the chl a concentration decreases from july to october when the dip concentration decreases followed by their increases again in the following months this pattern is consistent with our field survey say et al 2022 and similar to the field observation of sarkkula et al 2003 in 2001 2002 except in february when the observed chl a concentration decreased sarkkula et al 2003 in the field observation of campbell et al 2006 between august 2003 and may 2004 the concentration of chl a increased from october and reached its peak in february and declined in may the phytoplankton was dominated by green algae 61 and cyanobacteria 35 with a few diatoms 4 during the study period of campbell et al 2006 besides those identical patterns the model simulation supported the hypotheses of sarkkula et al 2003 and campbell et al 2009 demonstrating that the increase of phytoplankton biomass was caused by the high available dip due to the internal loading the phytoplankton biomass in tsl was found to change according to the water level fig 5 which is similar to the pantanal floodplain a shallow and eutrophic lake loverde oliveira and huszar 2019 the phytoplankton biomass and species richness in the pantanal floodplain are the highest during the low water period when the water is turbid and less influenced by the inflowing river loverde oliveira and huszar 2019 during the high water the phytoplankton biomass is the lowest with intermediate species richness as the floodplain lake is highly influenced by the river which causes high water depth and clear water in amazon floodplain lakes the internal loading of phosphorus also has a significant influence on the phytoplankton community kraus et al 2019 similarly our study confirmed that the phytoplankton biomass in tsl was high during the low water period when the internal loading of dip was dominated 4 3 rates of phytoplankton growth and loss the results showed that the median specific growth in the low water period april june was the highest in a year ranging from 0 27 to 0 29 d 1 the net growth rate in the same season ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 d 1 the high specific growth rate was caused by the high availability of dip during this period compared to other months when the monthly average of dip ranged from 13 5 to 16 2 µg l the specific growth rate peaked at 0 29 d 1 in may with the net growth rate of 0 03 d 1 indicating the increase in phytoplankton biomass figs 5 and 6 the specific growth rates in may mostly ranged from 0 10 to 0 65 d 1 and net growth rates ranged from 0 30 to 0 40 d 1 95 of water area then the specific growth rate of phytoplankton decreased from may to september when the water level in the lake increased due to the reversal flow from tsr to tsl fig 6 in july i e the rising water period the median specific and net growth rates of phytoplankton were 0 24 and 0 01 d 1 with their ranges from 0 10 to 0 55 d 1 and 0 15 to 0 30 d 1 respectively excluding some extreme values in september the median specific and net growth rates were 0 21 d 1 and 0 01 d 1 respectively which were the lowest throughout the year fig 6 both of those rates were almost spatially uniform as the concentration of dip was the lowest in a year average in september 7 9 µg l except for the outlets of the tributaries in this month of the targeted three years the water depth was the highest spatiotemporal average 3 9 m when the net sedimentation outflux of ss 22 9 mg l month was the highest compared to the loading from tributaries 12 9 mg l month and villages 0 009 mg l month and other internal processes i e biomass supply 1 0 mg l month ss reduction due to primary production 0 09 mg l month and pip desorption 0 003 mg l month as the result the input of dip from desorption 2 9 µg l month was minor compared to that in other seasons in addition the dip diffusion from bed sediment 16 8 µg l month was also the lowest when the peak water level and thus the dip concentration was almost uniform at the lowest level after september the specific and net growth rates increased as the water level decreased and the dip concentration available for phytoplankton uptake increased in january during this receding water level the median specific and net growth rates increased to 0 23 and 0 02 d 1 respectively and showed a larger spatial variation than that in september the specific and net growth rates of tsl were compared with those in other lakes including temperate lakes with different characteristics such as nutrient level trophic state and depth fig 6 those rates in other lakes were determined by the laboratory experiment field experiment and model application fig 6 table s4 the median specific growth rates in tsl were found to be smaller than in the temperate lakes i e erie ontario kasumigaura and lawrence larger than lake onondaga and the same as the range of lake müggelsee fig 6a however the specific growth rate in those lakes was found in the range of specific growth in tsl except lake lawrence the loss rate of phytoplankton from mortality grazing and respiration in tsl was 0 2 d 1 and settling velocity was 0 1 m d respectively these rates were also smaller than the grazing rate of phytoplankton by microzooplankton and settling velocity in the deep lake ontario table s4 the loss rate of tsl was estimated to be within the ranges of lake erie lake nansi and lake onondaga and higher than lake barleber the settling velocity of tsl was similar to those of lake erie and lake barleber and higher than those of lake nansi lake onondaga and karaoun reservoir table s4 previous studies have suggested that the decomposition rate sarmento 2012 nutrient use efficiency lewis 2000 and nutrient cycling rates von sperling 1997 of phytoplankton in tropical lakes are higher than in other lakes under the condition of high temperature and strong solar irradiance lewis 1996 in addition tropical lakes of a given trophic state have higher minimum biomass than temperate lakes of the same trophic state lewis 1990 the median specific growth rate in tsl was smaller than in the lake of louisiana state university semi tropic comparable to lake taihu subtropic and slightly higher than in lake tanganyika tropic fig 6 this variation might be caused mainly by the different nutrient supplies to these lakes lake tanganyika is in an oligotrophic state the observed chl a 0 3 3 7 µg l while tsl is spatially varied from oligotrophic to eutrophic state the observed chl a 0 5 178 7 µg l the median net growth rate of tsl ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 d 1 fig 6b and was smaller than in subtropic lake kinneret and similar to lake barleber nevertheless available nutrients pollution level and types and density of grazer predator also affect the specific growth and loss rates in each lake to make the comparison accurate we assumed the same phosphorus concentration p 0 31 mg l as the temperate shallow lake müggelsee nicklisch et al 2008 then the specific growth rate of tsl was re calculated eq 11 assuming that dip is 0 31 mg l in that case the specific growth rates of tsl would be 1 01 d 1 in the dry season and 1 06 d 1 in the wet season and both are higher than the specific growth rates of müggelsee 0 15 0 59 d 1 the specific growth rate in tsl 0 039 1 18 d 1 was also higher than in lake taihu 0 025 0 40 d 1 on a given nutrient base 0 002 2 mg l for other temperate lakes fig 6 phosphorus concentration has not been clearly reported which did not allow us for further comparison nevertheless the estimates in tsl provide us additional insight on productivity in topical lakes and filled in a missing piece in the global comparison for instance in testing the hypothesis that primary production in tropical lakes is likely higher than in temperate lakes on a given nutrient base lewis 2000 4 4 spatial sensitivity analysis as the result from the sensitivity analysis the high ssi accounted for the high impact on chl a concentration fig 7 the phytoplankton loss rate k m was the most influential to the chl a concentration followed by the maximum growth rate gmax half saturate coefficient of phosphorus kp chl a concentration in bed sediment chlabed and settling velocity vc on average of the four hydrological periods fig 7 the impact of the phytoplankton loss rate on chl a concentration was almost spatially uniform in all periods fig s3 the average ssi was comparable in the inflow early outflow and late outflow periods while the average ssi in the low water period was the lowest spatially the high impact was noticed where the chl a concentration was low except at the outlet of the tributaries where the water flow was rapid for the impacts of the maximum growth rate on chl a concentration were high in the lake and low at the floodplain during the low water and inflow periods fig s4 during the early outflow and late outflow periods its impact was high at the floodplain and the southeast part of the lake when the water flowing out from the lake to tonle sap river on average the highest ssi was found in the low water period when the baseline chl a concentration was also high the lowest ssi was found in the early outflow period when the baseline chl a concentration was also the lowest fig 7 for the half saturated coefficient of phosphorus and chl a concentration in bed sediment the average ssis were the highest in the low water period and followed by the late outflow inflow and early outflow periods fig 7 for the settling velocity the highest average ssi was in the low water period and followed by the inflow late outflow and early outflow periods fig 7 the spatial impacts of half saturated coefficient of phosphorus chl a concentration in bed sediment and settling velocity were shown in fig s5 s6 and s7 4 5 effect of sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass the sensitivity analysis regarding sediment carrying capacity showed that the ss concentration in the lake increased or decreased almost uniformly from the baseline condition respectively fig s8 on average the concentration of ss and chl a would increase from 95 0 mg l and 7 6 µg l in the baseline condition to 165 5 mg l and 8 9 µg l respectively when the net sediment resuspension increased by 75 they equaled to the increase of ss and chl a concentrations in the range of 70 1 74 7 and 1 3 31 6 respectively if the net sediment resuspension decreased by 75 the concentration of ss and chl a would decrease to 24 4 mg l and 6 2 µg l on average respectively corresponding to the decrease of ss concentration in a range of 70 3 74 8 and the decrease of chl a concentration in a range of 6 4 42 4 fig 8 the impact of sediment resuspension on ss concentration was higher than on chl a concentration figs 8 and s8 because the major internal process of ss was the sediment resuspension while the chl a was indirectly affected the sediment resuspension changed the pip concentration in the water and then the dip concentration was changed through the adsorption desorption of pip finally dip concentration changed the chl a concentration through the process of phytoplankton growth in addition the increase of sediment resuspension also could increase the resuspension of chl a meroplankton from the bed sediment into the water column the highest impact of sediment resuspension on chl a concentration was found in june fig s8 when the baseline net sediment resuspension flux was the highest at 1 96 105 ton month or 28 7 mg l month after june the impact of sediment resuspension decreased and the minimum impact was found in october when the net sedimentation flux of the baseline condition was high at 4 72 105 ton month or 10 2 mg l month several previous studies have also confirmed that the resuspension process is dominant during the low water period resulting in the peak concentration of ss and sedimentation is dominant during the high water period siev et al 2018 hoshikawa et al 2019 sarkkula et al 2003 sato et al 2021 therefore the effects of sediment resuspension on chl a concentration are also high during the low water period the increment of resuspended pip from bed sediment to the water column increased the desorption of pip to dip resulting in the enhancement of dip concentration and phytoplankton growth in our study we assumed there were no effects of sediment resuspension to light penetration into the water column the euphotic depth during our study period has been estimated from 0 2 m in the low water period to 6 7 m in the high water period uk 2022 as discussed in section 4 2 the phytoplankton grows on the topmost centimeters of the surface water during the low water period sarkkula et al 2003 and thus the impact of the ss concentration on phytoplankton growth seems insignificant previous studies have described that the sediment resuspension in shallow lakes caused by wind increases chl a concentration schelske et al 1995 ogilvie and mitchell 1998 schallenberg and burns 2004 in lake waihola a meso eutrophic shallow coastal lake in new zealand the sediment resuspension always increases the primary production schallenberg and burns 2004 the resuspension influenced phytoplankton production mainly via the resuspension of pip and by entraining algae meroplankton schallenberg and burns 2004 in addition the very high sediment resuspension in the scenarios might change the limiting factor from phosphorus to nitrogen while the pp model assumes that phosphorus is always the limiting nutrient even in the case of the increased sediment resuspension by 75 the highest increase of simulated dip concentration and assumed that the din concentration remains constant at the observed level phosphorus was still the limiting nutrient fig s1c thus the increment of sediment resuspension by 50 75 would not change the limiting nutrient from phosphorus to nitrogen and the results are still likely valid in this sensitivity analysis therefore the sediment resuspension in tropical lake floodplain and shallow lakes is sensitive to phytoplankton growth and biomass because it could increase the available dip for phytoplankton uptake and also slightly resuspend the meroplankton from the bed sediment this is the case for the condition that phytoplankton can grow on the topmost centimeters of the surface water even when the water is turbid it suggests that the model development should not neglect sediment resuspension in the simulation of primary production in the lake floodplain and possibly in the general shallow lakes where the sediment resuspension e g caused by wind is important 5 conclusion the pp model was developed in two dimensions integrating three major modules of phosphorus phytoplankton and sediment to elucidate phytoplankton growth and its biomass in the large tropical lake floodplain system tsl considering phosphorus as the limiting factor for primary production the phosphorus module consists of two major fractions of dip and pip as they are exchangeable between each other and dip is biologically available the application of the pp model to tsl showed its reasonable performance of the dynamics of ss dip pip and phytoplankton biomass and growth with rmses of 18 0 µg l in the calibration and 10 1 µg l in the validation of chl a concentration during 2016 2019 the model analysis in tsl revealed that the increase of phytoplankton biomass was caused by the high available dip due to the internal loading during the low water period in contrast the net reduction rate and the smallest specific growth rate of phytoplankton were found in september when the net sedimentation was dominant the median specific growth rate in tsl was estimated to be in the middle of the rates of other lakes in the world based on the spatial sensitivity analysis of the model parameter of the phytoplankton module the phytoplankton loss rate showed the highest impact on chl a concentration and followed the maximum growth rate half saturated coefficient of phosphorus chl a concentration in bed sediment and settling velocity of phytoplankton in addition the sediment resuspension affected the phytoplankton biomass in tsl as the resuspension of bed sediment increases the desorption of dip in the water column in this manner the developed model provided a detailed understanding of the nutrient cycle and the productivity of phytoplankton in tsl the important and unique property of the pp model is the tight integration of phosphorus sediment and primary production in addition the effects of floodplain vegetation on sedimentation and input of pip dip and ss from floating villages were also implemented thus its application possibly extends to various scenarios such as the effects of floodplain land use future changes in floating villages and hydrological changes in primary production the model requires the condition of phosphorus limitation in primary production in addition the simulation of the pp model at the floodplain may contain some uncertainty due to unavailable observed data for calibration which needs further investigation nevertheless the structure of the model is generally applicable to a variety of lake floodplain systems and general shallow lakes credit author statement vouchlay theng conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation

24222,our knowledge of phytoplankton productivity and its relevant factors in the tropical lake floodplains is still scarce thus this study aims to develop a two dimensional primary production pp model to elucidate phytoplankton biomass and growth rates in tonle sap lake a large tropical lake floodplain system in cambodia the model consists of three modules of sediment phosphorus and phytoplankton explicitly describing the major processes of phytoplankton i e advection dispersion growth death sedimentation and resuspension as the basis the hydrological hydrodynamics model was applied to simulate the tributary river discharges and hydrodynamics of the lake then the pp model was calibrated for the period from november 2016 to july 2018 and validated from august 2018 to june 2019 the root mean square error of the simulated chlorophyll a concentration was 18 0 µg l in the calibration and 10 1 µg l in the validation indicating that the model described the major spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton biomass and productivity in the lake the pp model revealed that the median specific growth rate and net growth rate in this lake peaked during the low water period april june when the available dissolved inorganic phosphorus for phytoplankton uptake was higher than in other seasons the model also allowed the comparison with other lakes regarding phytoplankton productivity indicating that the specific growth rate of tonle sap lake was in the middle of the rates of other lakes in the world the developed model substantially helps us understand the phytoplankton productivity in tropical lake floodplain systems keywords primary production phytoplankton growth sediment resuspension tonle sap lake data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction in tropical regions the lake floodplain system such as the amazon floodplains and tonle sap lake tsl in cambodia is one of the most important ecosystems for the provision of ecosystem services langan et al 2018 campbell et al 2006 hurd et al 2016 this fact is closely related to substantial river lake interaction which supports water resources flood attenuation water purification carbon sequestration and agricultural and fishery production li et al 2018 li et al 2019 li et al 2021 langan et al 2018 in such biogeochemical and ecological processes phytoplankton plays an important role naselli flores and padisák 2022 agrawal 1999 for instance phytoplankton provides a significant contribution to primary production agrawal 1999 sustaining a network of trophic interactions abonyi et al 2018 and important food sources for zooplankton and fish keckeis et al 2003 campos silva et al 2021 a well mixed water column under shallow conditions provides a suitable habitat for various phytoplankton groups with possible inputs of nutrients and algae from bed sediment i e meroplankton dzialowski et al 2008 schallenberg and burns 2004 phillips et al 2005 as a result phytoplankton biomass and community show their dynamic shifts according to the seasonal flood pulse loverde oliveira and huszar 2019 campbell et al 2006 uk et al 2018 sarkkula et al 2003 therefore it is important to understand the phytoplankton growth and dynamics in tropical lake floodplain systems the phytoplankton community is affected by a variety of environmental factors such as ph water temperature light condition nutrient concentration water flow wind speed and biotic factors such as planktonic herbivores yu 2010 steele 1978 smayda 2008 primary production in tropical lakes is likely higher than in temperate lakes on a given nutrient base lewis 2000 possibly owing to its high decomposition rate sarmento 2012 and nutrient use efficiency lewis 2000 under the condition of high temperature and strong solar irradiance lewis jr 1996 von sperling 1997 has suggested that the nutrient assimilation and nutrient cycling rates are also high in tropical lakes if they are the case the tropical lakes seem to be more sensitive to the increment of nutrient supply than temperate lakes hecky 2000 lewis 2000 nevertheless our understanding of phytoplankton productivity and its relation to relevant processes e g nutrient dynamics hydrology and anthropogenic impacts in tropical lake floodplain systems remains unclear the rates of these processes have rarely been quantified particularly the rates of phytoplankton growth and loss and nutrient recycling to elucidate nutrient dynamics and primary production in the water environment mechanistic models also called process based models fornarelli et al 2013 or theoretical models vanhuet 1992 can be useful as they are based on the a priori knowledge of the driving processes of the lentic systems vinçon leite and casenave 2019 such a modeling approach is particularly useful for elucidating reaction rates e g primary production and mortality and those spatiotemporal distributions to date multidimensional process based primary production models have been developed and applied to various temperate shallow lakes e g zhao et al 2020 and zhang et al 2008 and subtropic lakes e g huang et al 2012 liu et al 2021 and fragoso et al 2008 these models are often coupled with a detailed hydrodynamics model and validated using the field data thus they are able to explain the effects of turbulence on phytoplankton growth and nutrient zhao et al 2020 the phytoplankton patchiness and their role in productivity hillmer et al 2008 and the mechanisms of phytoplankton bloom and the effects of such blooms on nutrient cycles sohma et al 2022 multidimensional process based primary production models are also designed to be used for the accurate simulation of the whole ecosystem vinçon leite and casenave 2019 for tropical lake floodplain systems however the multidimensional process based models have not been developed and applied to elucidate phytoplankton growth and primary production a phytoplankton model has been developed to predict short term algae blooms in lake taihu huang et al 2012 whereas this model does not include the nutrient and sediment modules other models are able to comprehensively explain the hydrodynamics nutrients phytoplankton and or zooplankton biomass in subtropic lakes while they do not integrate sediment transport liu et al 2021 fragoso et al 2008 therefore these models could not apply to the tropical lake floodplain systems where sediment nutrient and phytoplankton are closely coupled uk et al 2018 houser 2016 weigelhofer et al 2015 in fact lamberts and koponen 2008 have investigated a tropical lake floodplain system of tsl using an impact assessment model for estimating the potential ecosystem production although this model serves as a useful tool for the impact assessment it cannot describe the processes of nutrient and phytoplankton due to the simplification and unknown parameters that do not explicitly represent the rates of those processes in the models lamberts and koponen 2008 recently a hydrodynamics based phosphorus dynamics model has been developed to elucidate mass balance and spatiotemporal dynamics of phosphorus in tsl theng et al 2022 nevertheless this model also misses the explicit relation between nutrient dynamics and primary production therefore the objective of this study is to comprehensively understand phytoplankton growth and its biomass in a large tropical lake floodplain system tsl through the development of a process based primary production model the model was developed in two dimensions integrating three modules of nutrient phytoplankton and sediment to describe phytoplankton biomass on the basis of a hydrodynamics model this model was used to investigate the distributions of their biomass and rates of growth and loss in tsl then the calibrated parameters of the phytoplankton module were compared with lakes in the world focusing on phytoplankton growth mortality and settling rates in addition the sensitivity analysis was applied to elucidate the impacts of the model parameters and sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass 2 study area tsl was selected as the study area in this study fig 1 the model domain is including an open lake and its floodplain green red and blue area in fig 1 tsl is the center of fishery production in cambodia and is globally significant which was nominated in the man and biosphere program of unesco as a biosphere reserve in 1997 nam and song 2011 this tropical lake floodplain system is the largest freshwater lake in southeast asia being influenced by the seasonal flood pulse of the mekong river mr totally 12 main local tributaries are connected to the lake the lake water drains to tonle sap river tsr and mr the arrow in fig 1 in the dry season october to april or may while tsr shows reversal flow to tsl in the rainy season may to september the rainfall is influenced by the tropical monsoon climate mainly occurring between april and november with a peak in september the average annual rainfall surrounding tsl was 1 413 mm during our field survey and ranged from 1 342 to 1 561 mm during 1997 1999 campbell et al 2006 the spatial average of water depth ranged from 0 5 to 5 4 m and the lake s surface area ranged from 5 587 to 20 631 km2 extending the lake over the vast floodplain during 1999 2003 tanaka et al 2018 the lake water temperature ranges from 28 to 33 c sarkkula et al 2003 campbell et al 2006 according to the redfield ratio redfield 1934 phosphorus was likely the limiting nutrient in this lake figs s1 a and b for instance it has been reported that phosphorus appears to be a limiting nutrient in tsl throughout the year sarkkula et al 2003 except during periods of light limitation and in the northeast part of the lake burnett et al 2017 the total suspension solid in the open lake was higher than 1 000 mg l and 5 20 mg l during the low and high water periods respectively sarkkula et al 2003 the chlorophyll a chl a and phytoplankton biomass were also high during the low water period and low during the high water period sarkkula et al 2003 in this lake at least 149 species of fish are recorded and it provides habitat for 11 globally threatened and 6 near threatened species of vertebrates campbell et al 2006 in the model domain the total population in 2008 was 2 118 668 living in 2005 villages national institute of statistics 2010 black circles in fig 1 most of the wastewater from those villages discharge directly into the nearby river and tsl without any treatment due to the lack of wastewater treatment facilities brown et al 2010 takahashi et al 2002 the villages in the tsl catchment were classified into three types land based land water based and floating villages or water based sithirith 2011 3 methodology process based primary production model pp model was structured with components and processes of phosphorus phytoplankton and sediment which is coupled with a two dimensional local inertial model 2d lie the daily output from the 2d lie model water depth and flux was used as a basis for the pp model 3 1 hydrological hydrodynamics model 2d lie model as a simplified counterpart of the conventional shallow water equations was applied to compute daily horizontal two dimensional flow structure i e water depth and flux in tsl with a spatial resolution of 500 m tanaka et al 2019 the numerical method of 2d lie is based on the exact solution based discretization as an alternative to the conventional semi implicit scheme the numerical time step is updated according to the courant friedrichs lewy cfl condition with the safety factor cfl 0 7 see tanaka et al 2019 2d lie neglected the coriolis force and wind shear as they have negligible influences on the surface water dynamics of tsl compared to reversal flows from the mr and inflow from local tributaries see tanaka and yoshioka 2017 for more details the discharge of 12 main local tributaries around tsl was simulated using soil water assessment tool swat model serving the boundary of tributary discharges for 2d lie and pp models the points indicated by red circles in fig 1 the observed water level at prek kdam station connected between tsl and tsr served as the boundary condition of 2d lie for tsr tsr discharge simulated by 2d lie also served as the boundary condition of the pp model 3 2 primary production model the pp model consists of three major modules including phosphorus phytoplankton and sediment fig 2 the phosphorus module consists of two important fractions which are dissolved inorganic phosphorus dip and exchangeable particulate inorganic phosphorus pip the phytoplankton is quantified in terms of chlorophyll a chl a concentration the sediment module is the total suspended solids ss in water column including inorganic and organic suspended solids such as phytoplankton live and dead cells the equations for dip pip chl a and ss are described by the following mass transport equation 1 h c t

domain of 2d lie and pp models the green red and blue areas of fig 1 we implemented the hydrodynamics model 2d lie tanaka et al 2019 with the same assumption and method as theng et al 2022 the numerical discretization of advection dispersion equations was based on a finite volume method equipped with a total variation diminishing of the monotonic upstream centered type in a stable mass conservative and accurate manner prabhakaran and doss 2015 smaoui et al 2008 the temporal discretization of the scheme is based on the classical first order euler forward method the numerical time step was automatically adjusted according to the water velocity and dispersion coefficient to satisfy the stability condition of the advection dispersion equation cfl 0 5 in this study the evaluation of numerical discretion in the benchmark test and tsl application was satisfied see details theng et al 2022 in this application the x direction is from west to east while the y direction is from south to north using the coordination system vn 2000 utm zone 48n the pp model is our original code program written in c program while the governing equations of physical chemical and biological processes are based on literature and key parameters were calibrated based on the observation in the lake all the computation was implemented using workstations microsoft windows 10 the simulation for four year period took approximately eight hours on the workstations as for water quality and phytoplankton we utilized the observation data from 2016 to 2019 which has been detailed by uk et al 2022 the measurement of water quality parameters of tsl was conducted on sites and in a laboratory in short 37 samples including ss dip tpp and chl a concentrations were collected in tsl every three months for the phosphorus in sediment tpbed the 37 observations sampled during march 2017 were assumed to be constant for the whole study period monthly wind data with a resolution of 11 1 km taken from muñoz sabater 2019 was inputted into the pp model and assumed it was constant each month the vegetation cover with a resolution of 100 m taken from buchhorn et al 2020 was classified into four categories grass shrub forest and open water to represent the effects of different vegetation cover on net sedimentation siev et al 2018 all input data of swat 2d lie and pp models were summarized table s1 the conversion from phosphorus to chl a ypchla is 1 mg mg schnoor 1996 the conversion from chl a to dry biomass kschla is 19 35 mg g ayed et al 2015 this ratio is for green freshwater microalga chlorella vulgaris while in tsl the blue green algae were dominant during the low water period sarkkula et al 2003 as the variation of water temperature during our field survey is small in tsl 29 8 1 5 c uk et al 2022 we assumed that the effects of light f l and water temperature f t on phytoplankton growth rate were constant and express as one constant rate the density of dry bed sediment ρ s e d was 480 kg m3 calculated based on wet sediment density 1300 kg m3 siev et al 2018 and porosity of bed sediment 0 82 qin 2008 huang et al 2018 the number of villages and population data in 2008 were obtained from the national institute of statistics 2010 the population of the villages in 2016 2019 was estimated based on the annual population growth rate 1 54 national institute of statistics 2010 according to keskinen 2006 most floating villages are located on tsl where their dems are less than 6 m therefore in this study the villages located on the model domain with their dems less than 6 m were assumed as floating villages we assumed the floating villages moved to the nearby forest or land where the maximum distance from floating villages to the flooded forest or land was less than 4 5 km according to our survey in february and march 2020 in addition the water depth at that temporary location required at least 1 m the village population was assumed to be distributed in a 1 km2 squared area theng et al 2022 the dip mass from the villages was assumed to be accumulated on the land when dry and immediately released to the lake water when inundated while the ss and pip mass was considered only when inundated the concentrations of ss dip and pip contained in wastewater discharge from the villages are summarized table s1 due to some limitations in the field observation the observed chl a dip pip and ss concentrations from all tributaries every three months were assumed that they kept constant for every three months i e the observed data in march served as input data for february march and april when the observations of ss tpp dip and chl a data were not available the monthly average of those available data in that month during 2016 2018 was assumed to be the same in the tributaries during 2019 based on those data and assumptions the hydrodynamics model 2d lie was validated first and then the pp model was calibrated and validated 2d lie was validated from november 2016 to december 2019 using the calibrated parameters of tanaka et al 2018 the error magnitude of the water level for the whole period from july 1998 to december 2003 is from 1 12 m to 0 622 m tanaka et al 2018 the model parameters of sediment phosphorus and phytoplankton modules were manually calibrated from november 2016 to july 2018 and validated from august 2018 to june 2019 table s2 the calibration and validation were conducted based on the data at 37 sample sites every three months in tsl fig 1 the field survey in each season took from one to two weeks to cover the whole lake and thus the simulated dip pip chl a and ss concentration were extracted from the model at the same date as the sampling for calibration and validation in the calibration process all model parameters were manually calibrated in a way to minimize the root mean square error rmse of the dip chl a and ss concentration against its observation the range of model parameters in previous studies was shown in table s2 the simulated pip concentration was compared with the observed tpp concentration by assuming the fraction of pip to tpp in the water is equal to the fraction of pip to tpbed fp in eq 7 as pip concentration in the lake was unavailable in the application in every calculation the model was turned for the first 1 year period to obtain the initial condition by feeding the observed chl a dip pip and ss concentrations in december 2016 the boundary conditions in this first 1 year and the model parameters after the calibration we investigated the distributions of their biomass and rates of growth and loss in tsl to characterize the primary production in tsl we compared the calibrated loss the summation of phytoplankton death respiration and fish and zooplankton grazing settling and growth rates of phytoplankton in tsl with those in other lakes 3 4 spatial sensitivity analysis the spatial sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the responses of chl a concentration to the model parameters in the phytoplankton module i e vc kp chlabed km and gmax for the study period i e november 2016 december 2019 it also determined how the changes in the model parameters affect the chl a concentration in tsl the spatial sensitivity index ssi was calculated using eq 15 nelson et al 2018 theng et al 2022 15 s s i x y c m a x x y c m i n x y i m a x x y i m i n x y i x y c x y where the subscripts x and y are the coordination points in the x and y directions i max and i min denote the maximum and minimum values of each parameter or boundary value among its variations from the baseline respectively c max and c min are the maximum and minimum chl a concentrations in tsl responding to the variations of each parameter value respectively c and i denote the averages of the chl a concentration in tsl and each parameter condition respectively to determine the ssi of a model parameter either one of the parameters was varied from the baseline condition by factors from 0 5 to 1 5 with the intervals of 0 25 i e from 50 to 50 of the baseline whereas other parameters were kept unchanged i e at baseline conditions the baseline condition was defined as the chl a concentration reproduced from november 2016 to december 2019 then the calculated ssi was output and discussed separately for the four hydrological periods based on the temporal average chl a concentration at each grid for each period the four hydrological periods are the low water period april may the inflow period june september the early outflow period october december and the late outflow period january march hoshikawa et al 2019 then to investigate the effects of sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass the simulated results were taken as the baseline condition and then the sediment carrying capacity varied in the range from 75 to 75 of the baseline condition while other parameters were kept the same as the baseline condition when the sediment carrying capacity increased the sediment resuspension increased and vice versa 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance in the 2d lie validation the simulated water level at kampong loung station a white triangle in fig 1 showed a good correlation with the observed data r 0 99 fig 3 a the rmse of the water level was 0 60 m in the whole calculated period during which the observed water level ranged from 0 64 to 8 54 m although the simulated water level showed some difference from the observation during the lowest and highest water level in each hydrological cycle the validation in this period resulted in slightly larger errors than the calibration and validation from july 1998 to december 2003 tanaka et al 2018 which was possibly caused by the changes in environmental factors such as land use and land cover in the floodplain and groundwater discharge as the model does not integrate them in an explicit manner for the pp model the simulated dip tpp chl a and ss concentrations also showed a good agreement with the observation and the rmses in the calibration and validation were comparable in all modules figs 3b e the rmses of tpp in the calibration and validation were 26 2 and 54 4 µg l respectively fig 3c for the phytoplankton module the rmses of chl a concentration in the calibration and validation were 18 0 and 10 1 µg l respectively fig 3d the spatial distribution of chl a concentration between observation and simulation showed similar patterns fig s2 for ss concentration the rmses in the calibration and validation were 103 5 and 102 4 mg l respectively fig 3e the relatively large error of the simulated dip tpp chl a and ss concentration was confirmed during the low water period march 2017 when the observation data was fluctuating to be specific in march the rmses of dip in the calibration and validation were 8 6 and 7 8 µg l respectively fig 3b although the simulated dip was mostly comparable to the observation these errors might be caused by the error of hydrodynamics simulation during the low water period and the seasonally shifting groups of phytoplankton possibly showing different settling growth and mortality rates while the model did not distinguish the groups of phytoplankton nevertheless the outputs from the pp model and the field observations uk 2022 showed the peak concentrations of chl a dip and ss during the low water period and low concentrations during the high water period to be specific the concentrations of chl a and dip were high mostly in the northwest part of the lake fig 4 uk 2022 therefore the pp model was confirmed to reproduce the seasonal pattern of the concentration of chl a in tsl with the accuracy indicated by rmses table s3 thus these results indicated that the model reasonably describes the processes and dynamics of sediment phosphorus and phytoplankton table s3 the calibrated model parameters provide reasonable estimates of the ecosystem processes related to those three components ecological models are more or less empirical and mechanistic aldenberg et al 1995 for the large floodplain it is usually not feasible to describe ecological processes using approaches of field survey and the experimental study with similar spatial and temporal resolutions to the presented modeling approach there are several types of models such as mass balance regression linear or non linear and process based models because the ecological processes are mostly non linear so the non linear models such as optimal information flow ecosystem model li and convertino 2021 pcmci runge et al 2019 and empirical dynamic modeling edm wang et al 2019 have been applied to describe the non linear interactions of the variables for example the edm of wang et al 2019 has been applied to prediction of 2 methylisoborneol mib production in kamafusa reservoir in japan and determined causal variables for mib production however these non linear models cannot describe the mass balance i e the input and or output of nutrients and phytoplankton and spatial effects thus the process based model is useful to describe the dynamics mass balance and processes of the ecosystem even though model application is usually based on the a priori knowledge of the driving processes of lentic systems vinçon leite and casenave 2019 considering the assumptions in the modeling the processed based pp model reproduced reasonable and possible dynamics of phytoplankton in tsl which need further validation and improvement for better understanding by accumulating field observation and detailed investigation of specific processes this two dimensional process based model could extend its application to various scenarios such as the effects of floodplain land use future changes of floating villages and hydrological changes due to dam construction on primary production as long as the model assumption is valid for example on the limiting nutrient light and temperature condition 4 2 phytoplankton biomass the model simulation showed that the concentration of chl a peaked in april and may every year when the lake is shallow figs 4 and 5 the concentration was mostly higher than 5 µg l in the whole lake and 20 µg l in the northwest part of the lake and tributary outlets e g fig 4a then the average chl a concentration decreased gradually from 12 3 µg l in april to 3 8 µg l in september when the water level increased figs 4 and 5 during the rising water period the chl a concentration in tsl was strongly affected by the water flow from tsr which transported the major phytoplankton biomass towards northwest of the lake e g fig 4b in this season i e july the average concentration of chl a was 8 5 µg l fig 4 and a high concentration of chl a was found at the northwest part of the lake and the outlet of some local tributaries in september the concentration of chl a was widely uniform with the concentration of less than 3 µg l while the high concentration was found at the riparian zone of the inundated floodplain fig 4c in january the average concentration of chl a increased to 7 0 µg l as the water level decreased fig 5 as the water flowed out from tsl to tsr in this season the phytoplankton in the northwest part of the lake was transported to the southeast part of the lake and further to tsr fig 4d after january chl a concentration continued increasing until april or may this seasonal pattern of chl a concentration was confirmed in every hydrological year the daily change of chl a concentration was shown in the movie file appendix 2 during the low water period the chl a concentration peaked when the ss concentration showed the highest fig 5 in general high concentration of ss limits the light availability for phytoplankton growth and suppresses the phytoplankton biomass however this pattern has not been indicated also in the field observation uk 2022 say et al 2022 sarkkula et al 2003 song et al 2004 and both observation and simulation showed these peaks at the same season figs 3 and 5 the algae bloom in tsl has not yet been studied based on a general threshold value of chl a concentration nevertheless according to cunha et al 2013 eutrophication has occurred when the concentration of chl a is equal to or higher than 10 1 µg l the prevalence of algal bloom was observed on the water surface especially at the northern part and around floating villages during our field survey say et al 2022 the bloom of floating blue green algae has been seen during the low water period and the floating algal scum is hardly observed during the high water period also in other reports ohtaka et al 2010 mizuno and mori 1970 sarkkula et al 2003 and song et al 2004 have reported that one of the dominant species of phytoplankton anabaena spp develops heterocysts on the topmost centimeters of the water surface during the low water period indicating nitrogen fixing activity according to the model simulation the peak concentration of chl a during this period was caused by the increased availability of dip due to the internal loading i e its loading rate via desorption and diffusion 61 8 76 7 µg l month in march may the high desorption of dip was caused by the high net sediment resuspension from bed sediment which increased the pip concentration in the water column the previous studies also showed that the dominant internal loading during the low water period increased phosphorus concentration sarkkula et al 2003 uk et al 2018 theng et al 2022 the model also reproduced the pattern that the chl a concentration decreases from july to october when the dip concentration decreases followed by their increases again in the following months this pattern is consistent with our field survey say et al 2022 and similar to the field observation of sarkkula et al 2003 in 2001 2002 except in february when the observed chl a concentration decreased sarkkula et al 2003 in the field observation of campbell et al 2006 between august 2003 and may 2004 the concentration of chl a increased from october and reached its peak in february and declined in may the phytoplankton was dominated by green algae 61 and cyanobacteria 35 with a few diatoms 4 during the study period of campbell et al 2006 besides those identical patterns the model simulation supported the hypotheses of sarkkula et al 2003 and campbell et al 2009 demonstrating that the increase of phytoplankton biomass was caused by the high available dip due to the internal loading the phytoplankton biomass in tsl was found to change according to the water level fig 5 which is similar to the pantanal floodplain a shallow and eutrophic lake loverde oliveira and huszar 2019 the phytoplankton biomass and species richness in the pantanal floodplain are the highest during the low water period when the water is turbid and less influenced by the inflowing river loverde oliveira and huszar 2019 during the high water the phytoplankton biomass is the lowest with intermediate species richness as the floodplain lake is highly influenced by the river which causes high water depth and clear water in amazon floodplain lakes the internal loading of phosphorus also has a significant influence on the phytoplankton community kraus et al 2019 similarly our study confirmed that the phytoplankton biomass in tsl was high during the low water period when the internal loading of dip was dominated 4 3 rates of phytoplankton growth and loss the results showed that the median specific growth in the low water period april june was the highest in a year ranging from 0 27 to 0 29 d 1 the net growth rate in the same season ranged from 0 02 to 0 03 d 1 the high specific growth rate was caused by the high availability of dip during this period compared to other months when the monthly average of dip ranged from 13 5 to 16 2 µg l the specific growth rate peaked at 0 29 d 1 in may with the net growth rate of 0 03 d 1 indicating the increase in phytoplankton biomass figs 5 and 6 the specific growth rates in may mostly ranged from 0 10 to 0 65 d 1 and net growth rates ranged from 0 30 to 0 40 d 1 95 of water area then the specific growth rate of phytoplankton decreased from may to september when the water level in the lake increased due to the reversal flow from tsr to tsl fig 6 in july i e the rising water period the median specific and net growth rates of phytoplankton were 0 24 and 0 01 d 1 with their ranges from 0 10 to 0 55 d 1 and 0 15 to 0 30 d 1 respectively excluding some extreme values in september the median specific and net growth rates were 0 21 d 1 and 0 01 d 1 respectively which were the lowest throughout the year fig 6 both of those rates were almost spatially uniform as the concentration of dip was the lowest in a year average in september 7 9 µg l except for the outlets of the tributaries in this month of the targeted three years the water depth was the highest spatiotemporal average 3 9 m when the net sedimentation outflux of ss 22 9 mg l month was the highest compared to the loading from tributaries 12 9 mg l month and villages 0 009 mg l month and other internal processes i e biomass supply 1 0 mg l month ss reduction due to primary production 0 09 mg l month and pip desorption 0 003 mg l month as the result the input of dip from desorption 2 9 µg l month was minor compared to that in other seasons in addition the dip diffusion from bed sediment 16 8 µg l month was also the lowest when the peak water level and thus the dip concentration was almost uniform at the lowest level after september the specific and net growth rates increased as the water level decreased and the dip concentration available for phytoplankton uptake increased in january during this receding water level the median specific and net growth rates increased to 0 23 and 0 02 d 1 respectively and showed a larger spatial variation than that in september the specific and net growth rates of tsl were compared with those in other lakes including temperate lakes with different characteristics such as nutrient level trophic state and depth fig 6 those rates in other lakes were determined by the laboratory experiment field experiment and model application fig 6 table s4 the median specific growth rates in tsl were found to be smaller than in the temperate lakes i e erie ontario kasumigaura and lawrence larger than lake onondaga and the same as the range of lake müggelsee fig 6a however the specific growth rate in those lakes was found in the range of specific growth in tsl except lake lawrence the loss rate of phytoplankton from mortality grazing and respiration in tsl was 0 2 d 1 and settling velocity was 0 1 m d respectively these rates were also smaller than the grazing rate of phytoplankton by microzooplankton and settling velocity in the deep lake ontario table s4 the loss rate of tsl was estimated to be within the ranges of lake erie lake nansi and lake onondaga and higher than lake barleber the settling velocity of tsl was similar to those of lake erie and lake barleber and higher than those of lake nansi lake onondaga and karaoun reservoir table s4 previous studies have suggested that the decomposition rate sarmento 2012 nutrient use efficiency lewis 2000 and nutrient cycling rates von sperling 1997 of phytoplankton in tropical lakes are higher than in other lakes under the condition of high temperature and strong solar irradiance lewis 1996 in addition tropical lakes of a given trophic state have higher minimum biomass than temperate lakes of the same trophic state lewis 1990 the median specific growth rate in tsl was smaller than in the lake of louisiana state university semi tropic comparable to lake taihu subtropic and slightly higher than in lake tanganyika tropic fig 6 this variation might be caused mainly by the different nutrient supplies to these lakes lake tanganyika is in an oligotrophic state the observed chl a 0 3 3 7 µg l while tsl is spatially varied from oligotrophic to eutrophic state the observed chl a 0 5 178 7 µg l the median net growth rate of tsl ranged from 0 01 to 0 03 d 1 fig 6b and was smaller than in subtropic lake kinneret and similar to lake barleber nevertheless available nutrients pollution level and types and density of grazer predator also affect the specific growth and loss rates in each lake to make the comparison accurate we assumed the same phosphorus concentration p 0 31 mg l as the temperate shallow lake müggelsee nicklisch et al 2008 then the specific growth rate of tsl was re calculated eq 11 assuming that dip is 0 31 mg l in that case the specific growth rates of tsl would be 1 01 d 1 in the dry season and 1 06 d 1 in the wet season and both are higher than the specific growth rates of müggelsee 0 15 0 59 d 1 the specific growth rate in tsl 0 039 1 18 d 1 was also higher than in lake taihu 0 025 0 40 d 1 on a given nutrient base 0 002 2 mg l for other temperate lakes fig 6 phosphorus concentration has not been clearly reported which did not allow us for further comparison nevertheless the estimates in tsl provide us additional insight on productivity in topical lakes and filled in a missing piece in the global comparison for instance in testing the hypothesis that primary production in tropical lakes is likely higher than in temperate lakes on a given nutrient base lewis 2000 4 4 spatial sensitivity analysis as the result from the sensitivity analysis the high ssi accounted for the high impact on chl a concentration fig 7 the phytoplankton loss rate k m was the most influential to the chl a concentration followed by the maximum growth rate gmax half saturate coefficient of phosphorus kp chl a concentration in bed sediment chlabed and settling velocity vc on average of the four hydrological periods fig 7 the impact of the phytoplankton loss rate on chl a concentration was almost spatially uniform in all periods fig s3 the average ssi was comparable in the inflow early outflow and late outflow periods while the average ssi in the low water period was the lowest spatially the high impact was noticed where the chl a concentration was low except at the outlet of the tributaries where the water flow was rapid for the impacts of the maximum growth rate on chl a concentration were high in the lake and low at the floodplain during the low water and inflow periods fig s4 during the early outflow and late outflow periods its impact was high at the floodplain and the southeast part of the lake when the water flowing out from the lake to tonle sap river on average the highest ssi was found in the low water period when the baseline chl a concentration was also high the lowest ssi was found in the early outflow period when the baseline chl a concentration was also the lowest fig 7 for the half saturated coefficient of phosphorus and chl a concentration in bed sediment the average ssis were the highest in the low water period and followed by the late outflow inflow and early outflow periods fig 7 for the settling velocity the highest average ssi was in the low water period and followed by the inflow late outflow and early outflow periods fig 7 the spatial impacts of half saturated coefficient of phosphorus chl a concentration in bed sediment and settling velocity were shown in fig s5 s6 and s7 4 5 effect of sediment resuspension on phytoplankton biomass the sensitivity analysis regarding sediment carrying capacity showed that the ss concentration in the lake increased or decreased almost uniformly from the baseline condition respectively fig s8 on average the concentration of ss and chl a would increase from 95 0 mg l and 7 6 µg l in the baseline condition to 165 5 mg l and 8 9 µg l respectively when the net sediment resuspension increased by 75 they equaled to the increase of ss and chl a concentrations in the range of 70 1 74 7 and 1 3 31 6 respectively if the net sediment resuspension decreased by 75 the concentration of ss and chl a would decrease to 24 4 mg l and 6 2 µg l on average respectively corresponding to the decrease of ss concentration in a range of 70 3 74 8 and the decrease of chl a concentration in a range of 6 4 42 4 fig 8 the impact of sediment resuspension on ss concentration was higher than on chl a concentration figs 8 and s8 because the major internal process of ss was the sediment resuspension while the chl a was indirectly affected the sediment resuspension changed the pip concentration in the water and then the dip concentration was changed through the adsorption desorption of pip finally dip concentration changed the chl a concentration through the process of phytoplankton growth in addition the increase of sediment resuspension also could increase the resuspension of chl a meroplankton from the bed sediment into the water column the highest impact of sediment resuspension on chl a concentration was found in june fig s8 when the baseline net sediment resuspension flux was the highest at 1 96 105 ton month or 28 7 mg l month after june the impact of sediment resuspension decreased and the minimum impact was found in october when the net sedimentation flux of the baseline condition was high at 4 72 105 ton month or 10 2 mg l month several previous studies have also confirmed that the resuspension process is dominant during the low water period resulting in the peak concentration of ss and sedimentation is dominant during the high water period siev et al 2018 hoshikawa et al 2019 sarkkula et al 2003 sato et al 2021 therefore the effects of sediment resuspension on chl a concentration are also high during the low water period the increment of resuspended pip from bed sediment to the water column increased the desorption of pip to dip resulting in the enhancement of dip concentration and phytoplankton growth in our study we assumed there were no effects of sediment resuspension to light penetration into the water column the euphotic depth during our study period has been estimated from 0 2 m in the low water period to 6 7 m in the high water period uk 2022 as discussed in section 4 2 the phytoplankton grows on the topmost centimeters of the surface water during the low water period sarkkula et al 2003 and thus the impact of the ss concentration on phytoplankton growth seems insignificant previous studies have described that the sediment resuspension in shallow lakes caused by wind increases chl a concentration schelske et al 1995 ogilvie and mitchell 1998 schallenberg and burns 2004 in lake waihola a meso eutrophic shallow coastal lake in new zealand the sediment resuspension always increases the primary production schallenberg and burns 2004 the resuspension influenced phytoplankton production mainly via the resuspension of pip and by entraining algae meroplankton schallenberg and burns 2004 in addition the very high sediment resuspension in the scenarios might change the limiting factor from phosphorus to nitrogen while the pp model assumes that phosphorus is always the limiting nutrient even in the case of the increased sediment resuspension by 75 the highest increase of simulated dip concentration and assumed that the din concentration remains constant at the observed level phosphorus was still the limiting nutrient fig s1c thus the increment of sediment resuspension by 50 75 would not change the limiting nutrient from phosphorus to nitrogen and the results are still likely valid in this sensitivity analysis therefore the sediment resuspension in tropical lake floodplain and shallow lakes is sensitive to phytoplankton growth and biomass because it could increase the available dip for phytoplankton uptake and also slightly resuspend the meroplankton from the bed sediment this is the case for the condition that phytoplankton can grow on the topmost centimeters of the surface water even when the water is turbid it suggests that the model development should not neglect sediment resuspension in the simulation of primary production in the lake floodplain and possibly in the general shallow lakes where the sediment resuspension e g caused by wind is important 5 conclusion the pp model was developed in two dimensions integrating three major modules of phosphorus phytoplankton and sediment to elucidate phytoplankton growth and its biomass in the large tropical lake floodplain system tsl considering phosphorus as the limiting factor for primary production the phosphorus module consists of two major fractions of dip and pip as they are exchangeable between each other and dip is biologically available the application of the pp model to tsl showed its reasonable performance of the dynamics of ss dip pip and phytoplankton biomass and growth with rmses of 18 0 µg l in the calibration and 10 1 µg l in the validation of chl a concentration during 2016 2019 the model analysis in tsl revealed that the increase of phytoplankton biomass was caused by the high available dip due to the internal loading during the low water period in contrast the net reduction rate and the smallest specific growth rate of phytoplankton were found in september when the net sedimentation was dominant the median specific growth rate in tsl was estimated to be in the middle of the rates of other lakes in the world based on the spatial sensitivity analysis of the model parameter of the phytoplankton module the phytoplankton loss rate showed the highest impact on chl a concentration and followed the maximum growth rate half saturated coefficient of phosphorus chl a concentration in bed sediment and settling velocity of phytoplankton in addition the sediment resuspension affected the phytoplankton biomass in tsl as the resuspension of bed sediment increases the desorption of dip in the water column in this manner the developed model provided a detailed understanding of the nutrient cycle and the productivity of phytoplankton in tsl the important and unique property of the pp model is the tight integration of phosphorus sediment and primary production in addition the effects of floodplain vegetation on sedimentation and input of pip dip and ss from floating villages were also implemented thus its application possibly extends to various scenarios such as the effects of floodplain land use future changes in floating villages and hydrological changes in primary production the model requires the condition of phosphorus limitation in primary production in addition the simulation of the pp model at the floodplain may contain some uncertainty due to unavailable observed data for calibration which needs further investigation nevertheless the structure of the model is generally applicable to a variety of lake floodplain systems and general shallow lakes credit author statement vouchlay theng conceptualization methodology software validation formal analysis investigation

24223,spatial capture recapture scr models are now widely used for estimating density from repeated individual spatial encounters scr accounts for the inherent spatial autocorrelation in individual detections by modelling detection probabilities as a function of distance between the detectors and individual activity centres however additional spatial heterogeneity in detection probability may still creep in due to environmental or sampling characteristics if unaccounted for such variation can lead to pronounced bias in population size estimates in this paper we address this issue by describing three bayesian scr models that use generalized linear mixed modelling glmm approach to account for latent heterogeneity in baseline detection probability across detectors with independent random effects re spatially autocorrelated random effects sare with components of prior covariance matrix modelled as a decreasing function of inter detector distance and a two group finite mixture model fm to identify latent detectability classes of each detector we test these models using a simulation study and an empirical application to a non invasive genetic monitoring data set of female brown bears ursus arctos in central sweden in the simulation study all three models largely succeeded in mitigating the biasing effect of spatially heterogeneous detection probability on population size estimates overall sare provided the least biased population size estimates median rb 9 6 when spatial autocorrelation in detection probability was high sare also performed best at predicting the spatial pattern of heterogeneity in detection probability at intermediate levels of autocorrelation spatially explicit estimates of detection probability obtained with fm were more accurate than those generated by sare and re the empirical example revealed patterns consistent with the results from the simulation study we found that ignoring spatial heterogeneity in detection probability led to at least 22 lower estimate of bear population size compared to models that accounted for it i e sare and re models when the number of detections per detector is low 1 the glmms considered here may require dimension reduction of the random effects by pooling baseline detection probability parameters across neighbouring detectors aggregation to avoid over parameterization the added complexity and computational overhead associated with scr glmms may only be justified in extreme cases of spatial heterogeneity e g large clusters of inactive detectors unbeknownst to the investigator however even in less extreme cases detecting and estimating spatially heterogeneous detection probability may assist in planning or adjusting monitoring schemes keywords spatial capture recapture detection

repository 1 introduction spatial capture recapture scr models are now widely used to estimate demographic parameters particularly density scr data inherently varies across space because animal movements are not completely random and an individual is more likely to be detected close to its centre of activity activity centre ac scr models account for and in fact exploit such spatial heterogeneity in detection by modelling the detection probability as a decreasing function of distance between a detector e g an observer a trap or a search location and a latent ac efford 2004 borchers and efford 2008 however the relative distance between a detector and an ac may not be the only cause of variation in detection probability spatially variable and autocorrelated detection probability can occur due to various other factors such as local differences in how animals use space and how sampling is performed moqanaki et al 2021 stevenson et al 2021 known sources of variation in detection probability are readily modelled in scr using covariates for example through proxies or direct measures of sampling effort efford et al 2013 resource selection data obtained from telemetry studies royle et al 2013 or information about landscape connectivity sutherland et al 2015 however not all sources of variation are known and fully observed for example local site specific characteristics affecting detector exposure or effect of local atmospheric conditions on the genotyping success rate of non invasively collected dna samples may remain unaccounted for during scr analyses efford et al 2013 kendall et al 2019 moqanaki et al 2021 furthermore large scale wildlife monitoring programmes sometimes include both structured and unstructured sampling data the latter may be data collected by the general public to increase the extent and intensity of sampling thompson et al 2012 bischof et al 2020a unstructured and opportunistic sampling data is likely to be associated with unknown spatial variation in detection probability unmodelled spatial variation in detection probability particularly in the presence of high spatial autocorrelation can lead to biased and overdispersed population size estimates in scr analyses moqanaki et al 2021 a worst case scenario are pockets or clusters of detectors where unbeknownst to the investigator detection probability is null adequately accounting for spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation in detection probability is essential for obtaining reliable statistical inference in scr analyses moqanaki et al 2021 howe et al 2022 in the absence of known covariates the effect of detector specific variation in detection probability can be modelled by using a function that explains the true pattern of heterogeneity this function is always unknown and we approximate it using random effects i e by extending scr with generalized linear mixed models glmm bayesian implementation of scr glmms allows modelling and estimation of heterogeneous detection probability surfaces in scr models hooten et al 2003 spatially explicit estimates of detection probability can in turn reveal problematic areas e g regions with very low detection probability which are important to wildlife monitoring and conservation using simulations we describe and test three extensions of bayesian scr glmms that aim to account for latent spatial heterogeneity in detection probability via the use of random effects 1 a simple glmm extension of the basic single season scr model by assigning independent random effects re to detector specific baseline detection probabilities with the aim to account for unknown spatial variation in detection probability among detectors 2 a glmm extension of the basic single season scr model incorporating spatial autocorrelation between detectors by means of spatially autocorrelated random effects sare where covariance is modelled as a function of inter detector distance thus implicitly defining an ordered neighbourhood structure and 3 a two group finite mixture fm model to identify latent detectability classes of detectors we assessed and compared these three structurally different models in terms of i their ability to produce unbiased abundance estimates ii their capacity to realistically predict detection probability surfaces iii their model complexity and iv their computational overhead finally we considered the role that model comparison could play in selecting the best scr model under different conditions finally we provide an empirical demonstration of our modelling approaches by applying them to a non invasive genetic monitoring data set on brown bears ursus arctos from central sweden we chose this example because a large proportion of the data were collected opportunistically by volunteers without reliable measures of sampling effort or spatial variation therein 2 methods we first describe a basic single season scr model where we assume a homogeneous baseline detection probability across all the detectors following that we describe three extensions of the scr model namely i a scr glmm with independent random effects re ii a scr glmm with spatially autocorrelated random effect sare and iii a scr glmm with two group mixture to model detector specific baseline detection probabilities fm lastly as a reference point for making comparisons we use a scr glm model where the known true cause of the variation in detection probability is modelled using fixed effects 2 1 model 1 basic single season scr model scr a single season scr model typically consists of two submodels a submodel for the spatial distribution of individual acs within a given habitat v r 2 and another submodel for the individual and detector specific observations conditional on the location of acs 2 1 1 the ecological submodel we considered n individuals to reside in v each of whom was assumed to move randomly around its ac with coordinates s i following a homogeneous point process each individual ac was assumed to be uniformly distributed across the habitat v 1 s i uniform v i 1 2 n in our analysis the location s i of individual acs and the number of these acs n are both unknown we used a data augmentation approach to model n royle et al 2007 with a large integer m as an upper bound for n we introduced a vector of m latent binary variables z z 1 z 2 z m such that z i 1 if individual i is a member of the population and z i 0 otherwise then we assumed that each z i follows a bernoulli distribution with inclusion probability ψ the probability that an arbitrary individual from the augmented population of m individuals is a member of the population under study 2 z i bernoulli ψ consequently population size n i 1 m z i is a derived parameter following a binomial distribution with parameters m and ψ 2 1 2 the observation submodel we considered one sampling occasion and a set of j detectors located in v the capture history of the i th individual is denoted as y i 1 y i 2 y i j where each y i j is binary i e y i j is 1 if individual i is detected at detector j and 0 otherwise the observed capture recapture data set denoted by y obs is of dimension n j where n is the number of detected individuals during the scr survey we augmented this data set y obs with m n all zero capture histories 0 j following the data augmentation approach the zero augmented data set is denoted by y and is of dimension m j we assumed a bernoulli model for each y i j conditional on z i 3 y i j bernoulli p i j z i where p i j denotes the detection probability of the i th individual at the j th detector the detection probability p i j is a decreasing function of distance modelled following a half normal form efford 2004 4 p i j p 0 exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 where d i j d s i x j s i x j is the euclidean distance between the detector location x j and individual ac s i p 0 is the baseline detection probability and the scale parameter σ quantifies the rate of decline in detection probability p i j with distance d i j the full scr model can thus be written as ψ uniform 0 1 σ uniform 0 50 logit p 0 n 0 2 2 i 1 2 m s i uniform v z i bernoulli ψ p i j p 0 exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 for j 1 2 j 5 y i j bernoulli p i j z i for j 1 2 j by modelling detection probability p i j in terms of individual acs and fitting a decreasing detection function as in 4 using the distance between acs and detector location the scr model accounts for the spatial autocorrelation within individual capture histories however under this model detection probabilities p i j and p i j are equal at two detectors j and j when they are located at the same distance from the ac s i regardless of other potential sources of variation between the two detectors in other words this model does not consider the additional variation in detection probability that may be present at different detectors due to their locations in the landscape and other heterogeneous characteristics 2 2 model 2 independent random effects scr model re to account for spatial heterogeneity in detection probability causing detector specific variation in detection probabilities we used a simple glmm extension of the basic single season scr model model 1 here we assigned a logistic regression type model to baseline detection probability for each detector 6 logit p 0 j μ w j j 1 2 j where μ denotes the intercept and w j denotes the random effect for the j th detector the detection probability p i j for individual i at detector j is expressed as 7 p i j p 0 j exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 we assumed a n 0 σ w 2 prior for each w j j 1 2 j and a n 0 2 2 prior for μ the variance parameter σ w 2 can be given a weakly informative prior note that the re model does not specifically account for spatial autocorrelation in detection probability across detectors 2 3 model 3 spatially autocorrelated random effects scr model sare we extended the basic single season scr model model 1 to account for spatial autocorrelation among detectors in particular we developed a scr model for situations where detectors at close proximity are more likely to have similar detection probability compared to more distant detectors we modelled this spatial autocorrelation by introducing an autocorrelated random effect w w 1 w 2 w j of length j we assumed w to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 j and covariance matrix γ γ j j which controls the spatial dependence between detectors we modelled each element γ j j of this covariance matrix as a decreasing function of distance between detectors j and j following moqanaki et al 2021 8 γ j j exp ϕ δ j j where δ j j d x j x j x j x j is the euclidean distance between the detector locations x j and x j this covariance function implicitly defines an ordered neighbourhood for each detector and ϕ controls the rate of distance dependent decay of spatial autocorrelation between the detectors in particular detectors are highly autocorrelated if ϕ is small e g 0 05 and autocorrelation decreases as ϕ increases figs 1 and 4 similar to the re model the detection probability p i j for individual i at detector j is then expressed as 9 p i j p 0 j exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 where 10 logit p 0 j μ w j j 1 2 j here we assigned a n 0 2 2 prior for μ and a n 0 5 2 prior for log transformed ϕ when ϕ 0 each component γ j j 1 for any j and j the random effect w becomes a degenerate process implying exact dependence between the detectors hence the value of each random effect w j is identical at any location of the detector grid this is equivalent to the basic single season scr model conversely when ϕ the covariance matrix γ reduces to an identity matrix and consequently the sare model reduces to a scr glmm with independent random effects re 2 4 model 4 two group finite mixture scr model fm variable sampling intensity could be associated with ordered classes of unknown variation in detection probability across the landscape for our study we proposed using a two group finite mixture scr model fm to model heterogeneity in detection probability between detectors cubaynes et al 2010 turek et al 2021 here we defined two groups of heterogeneity viz 1 and 2 and introduced two detection probability parameters η 1 and η 2 where η k is the detection probability of the b th subgroup b 1 2 a constraint is imposed on these parameters η 1 η 2 to ensure identifiability further we defined binary indicator variables u j j 1 2 j to indicate the subgroup that a detector belongs to 11 p 0 j 1 u j η 1 u j η 2 j 1 2 j mcmc computation allows the binary classification in our two group mixture model to implicitly account for the group membership probabilities pr u j 1 and consequently allows estimation of each p 0 j via 11 accounting for the uncertainty in the group membership probabilities of each detector we assigned a bernoulli prior to each u j with probability π of being assigned to second group we further assumed bounded uniform priors over the 0 1 interval for the probability parameters η 1 η 2 and π 2 5 model 5 scr model with known fixed effects fe for the sake of assessing and comparing the performance of the above models we considered a glm extension of basic single season scr model model 1 using detector specific effects i e the true source of variation to model baseline detection probability this can be executed by supplying the known simulated effect w as an observed virtual covariate and then model the baseline detection probability 12 logit p 0 j μ w j consequently the detection probability p i j is expressed as 13 p i j p 0 j exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 the rest of this fe model remains the same as the basic scr model 1 3 simulation study for simulations we used a 32 32 detector array number of traps j 1024 with 1 distance unit du of minimum inter detector spacing the detector array is centred on a 41 41 du habitat surrounded by a 5 du habitat buffer fig 1 we used a σ value of 1 5 for all the simulations so that the buffer width is larger than 3 σ resulting in negligible detection probability of individuals with acs near the habitat boundary efford 2011 we simulated scr data sets for n 300 individuals leading to a population level home range overlap index k σ density 0 63 efford et al 2016 we set the size of the augmented population m to be 500 3 1 simulation scenarios for each simulation we used the sare model model 3 section 2 3 to generate scr data with spatially autocorrelated detection probability between detectors we created simulation scenarios by varying spatial autocorrelation rate parameter ϕ with high ϕ 0 05 and intermediate ϕ 1 spatial autocorrelation to simulate spatially varying random effect w w 1 w 2 w j fig 1 3 1 1 continuous detector specific variation in detection probability detection probability may exhibit continuous spatial variation if it is linked with underlying habitat characteristics such as elevation forest cover or distance from roads that influence animal behaviour or detection effort and efficiency moqanaki et al 2021 for simplifying the interpretation of μ in sare model 3 we transformed it into a new variable η via the link μ logit η here η can also be viewed as the average baseline detection probability providing a clearer interpretation for the readers in simulations we used three values of η to generate low η 0 1 intermediate η 0 3 and high η 0 6 baseline detection probability for each detector subject to spatial autocorrelation infused by w fig 1 row 1 3 1 2 categorical detector specific variation in detection probability discrete differences in sampling or environmental characteristics can lead to categorical classes of variation in detection probability between detectors we considered an extreme case where 50 of the detectors would remain inactive and the remaining detectors would have a constant detection probability moqanaki et al 2021 thus a portion of the study area would remain entirely unsampled to simulate such scenarios we transformed each p 0 j into a discrete variable taking only one of the two values 0 and logit η to create two classes of detector specific baseline detection probability using 10 14 p 0 j 0 if w j q 50 logit η otherwise where q 50 is the 50 quantile of the effect w j s we used two values of η to generate low η 0 1 and intermediate η 0 3 levels of baseline detection probability for active detectors fig 1 row 2 in summary we divided all simulation scenarios in two broad setups viz continuous and categorical with respect to detector specific variation in detection probability in the continuous setup con we generated six simulation scenarios by combining two levels of autocorrelation ϕ and three levels of detection η in the categorical setup cat we generated four simulation scenarios by combining two levels of ϕ and two levels of η thus in total we generated 10 simulation scenarios for each simulation scenario we generated 100 independent scr data sets resulting in 1000 simulated scr data sets in total table 1 3 2 curse of dimensionality in many scr studies the majority of detectors are associated with no or very few detections gerber and parmenter 2015 tourani 2022 in such situations fitting complex models such as sare fm and re which involves large number of parameters and latent variables may lead to poor markov chain monte carlo mcmc convergence below par mixing and over fitting this phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality and expected to occur when models are over parameterized wikle and hooten 2010 we mitigated this issue by dimension reduction of the random effects to do this we aggregated random effects that are used to model baseline detection probability such that a single random effect value is assigned to a cluster of neighbouring detectors note that we are not aggregating detections themselves for instance in sare if each cluster contains n c detectors then each detector belonging to a cluster say j th will share the same random effect value w j j 1 2 j n c j being the total number of detectors here we aggregated the random effects by a factor of 4 squares of 4 4 detectors one cluster when aggregated the 32 32 detector grid i e 1024 detectors fig 1 forms a grid of 8 8 clusters 3 3 model fitting description we fitted five scr models to the same simulated datasets i basic single season scr model without aggregation section 2 1 ii re model both with and without aggregation section 2 2 iii sare model both with and without aggregation section 2 3 iv fm model both with and without aggregation section 2 4 and v fe model without aggregation section 2 5 the models were fitted using mcmc simulation with nimble de valpine et al 2017 nimble development team 2021 in r version 3 6 2 r core team 2019 we used the r package nimblescr bischof et al 2020b turek et al 2021 which implements the local evaluation approach milleret et al 2019 to increase mcmc efficiency for each simulated data set we ran three chains of i 30 000 iterations for both basic single season scr and fe model including burn in 12 000 iterations ii 100 000 iterations for sare and re including burn in 20 000 iterations both with and without aggregation and iii 60 000 iterations for fm without aggregation including burn in 12 000 iterations and 20 000 iterations for fm with aggregation including 4000 iteration burn in mcmc convergence of each model was monitored using the gelman rubin convergence diagnostic r ˆ with upper threshold 1 1 gelman et al 2014a and visual inspection of traceplots 3 4 model performance measures we used relative bias coefficient of variation and coverage probability to evaluate the performance of each fitted models with respect to estimation of focal parameters e g n σ suppose θ r r 1 2 r denotes a set of mcmc draws from the posterior distribution of a scalar parameter θ relative bias relative bias rb is calculated as 15 rb θ θ ˆ θ 0 θ 0 where θ ˆ denotes the posterior mean 1 r r 1 r θ r and θ 0 gives the true value coefficient of variation precision was measured by the coefficient of variation cv 16 cv θ sd θ θ ˆ where sd θ 1 r r 1 r 1 θ r θ ˆ 2 is the posterior standard deviation of parameter θ coverage probability coverage probability was computed as the proportion of converged model fits for which the estimated 95 credible interval ci of the parameter θ contained the true value θ 0 3 4 1 effective sample size and mcmc efficiency to compare the efficiency of the different mcmc algorithms of the fitted models we computed the effective sample size ess and mcmc efficiency ess mcmc run time of each top level parameter for each of the model runs we used the effectivesize function from the r package coda to compute ess plummer et al 2006 the calculation of ess is based on the combined samples of the converged mcmc chains after discarding the burn in period the mcmc computation time was calculated excluding the burn in period to obtain stable estimates of the quantities of interest it is recommended to have ess greater than 400 vehtari et al 2021 although mcmc algorithms are used to generate sample from posterior distributions efficiency can vary between different algorithms there are two primary measures of efficiency of mcmc algorithms quality of mcmc mixing and speed of mcmc computation we computed mcmc efficiency as a combined metric to assess both of these characteristics of mcmc algorithms so that we could compare the efficiency of different mcmc algorithms we reported the mean mcmc efficiency for each top level parameters in the model and across all the converged replicates in each scenario 3 4 2 spatial accuracy of predicted baseline detection probability surfaces baseline detection probability surfaces obtained from scr analyses are useful in evaluating the performance of our scr models as they have the potential to reveal spatial patterns in detection probability such as pockets with very low or very high detection probability that could be of practical relevance we compared the accuracy of the detector specific baseline detection probability surfaces predicted by the different models with the true simulated surface p 0 p 01 p 02 p 0 j we quantified the accuracy by calculating the expected sum of squared errors sse in practice we first obtained posterior mcmc sample of baseline detection probability surface p 0 p 01 p 02 p 0 j and computed the mean squared error for detector j sse j 1 r r 1 r p 0 j r p 0 j 2 where p 0 j 1 p 0 j 2 p 0 j r denotes a posterior mcmc sample of p 0 j j 1 2 j finally we calculated total error sum of squares sse j 1 j sse j as a measure of predictive accuracy of detection probability surface smaller sse implies a more accurate prediction closer to the truth of the baseline detection probability surface we used δ sse relative to the model with the lowest sse δ sse sse min sse to compare the accuracy of predicted baseline detection probability surface amongst the different models 3 4 3 model comparison using waic we compared the fitted models using watanabe akaike information criterion waic watanabe 2010 which is computed as 17 waic 2 i 1 m log 1 r r 1 r f y i θ r 2 p w where f y i θ denotes the likelihood of i th individual capture history y i y i 1 y i 2 y i j in the model here we adopted the second of the two variants of the penalty term p w proposed by gelman et al 2014b 18 p w i 1 m 1 r 1 r 1 r log f y i θ r 1 r r 1 r log f y i θ r 2 a model with smaller waic is preferred we use δ waic waic min waic to compare the different models in terms of their model fit and complexity 4 empirical example the brown bear population in sweden is monitored primarily using non invasive genetic sampling of scats and hair bischof et al 2016 2020a the majority of samples are collected voluntarily by hundreds of hunters due to the opportunistic nature of sample collection there are no direct measures of sampling effort available sampling effort meanwhile is liable to be both spatially heterogeneous and spatially autocorrelated isaac and pocock 2015 thus this data set offers a good case study to demonstrate the application of our modelling approaches for this analysis we considered genetic samples of adult female bears with confirmed individual identity sex location and sampling date from two swedish counties of jämtland and västernorrland during the monitoring from 1 april to 30 november 2020 fig 2 that were stored in the scandinavian large carnivore monitoring database rovbase 3 0 www rovbase se the data set was composed of 2207 successfully genotyped non invasive genetic samples associated with 731 individual female bears fig 2 b bear detections were assigned to the closest detector in a grid of 3152 detectors at 5 km resolution on average there were 0 7 detections per detector range 0 14 fig 2 c and 3 detections per detected individual range 1 31 for the purpose of demonstration we fitted five single season models scr re sare fm and fe as described in section 2 to the bear data and compared estimates of baseline detection probability and population size because of the low number of detections per detector we aggregated the random effects to 20 km resolution for models sare fm and re so that each random effect value was shared by a maximum of 16 detectors in an effort to model the spatial heterogeneity in detection probability with the fe model we picked three spatial covariates figure s5 supp material that were known to play an important role in detectability bischof et al 2020a i distance m from the nearest road as a measure of site accessibility during sampling ii a binary covariate indicating whether an observation from a large carnivore was recorded by members of the public www skandobs se or the authorities www rovbase se during the sampling period this binary covariate distinguishes areas with very low detectability from those where carnivore dna samples if present could have been detected and submitted for genetic analysis see milleret et al 2022 in addition iii separate intercepts were estimated for the two counties μ jämtland μ 1 and μ västernorrland μ 2 19 logit p 0 j μ county j x j β where county j denotes the county corresponding to the j th detector β β 1 β 2 denotes the vector of regression coefficients without intercept and x j x 1 j x 2 j denotes the distance to the nearest road and the presence absence of other observations at the j th detector we ran four mcmc chains for each of the five models the chain lengths burn in period and thinning rate were as following i scr 50 000 iterations burn in 6000 thinning rate 1 ii re 13 000 iterations burn in 5000 thinning rate 1 iii sare 300 000 iterations burn in 160 000 thinning rate 2 iv fm 40 000 iterations burn in 2000 thinning rate 1 and v fe 21 000 iterations burn in 6000 thinning rate 1 we followed the same procedure to assess model performance as we did in the simulation study but reported posterior parameter estimates as rb could not be calculated for the empirical example 5 results 5 1 simulation study 5 1 1 model convergence effective sample size and mcmc efficiency during comparison and interpretation we only considered models that had reached convergence and exhibited proper mixing of all the top level parameters e g n σ ϕ η with r ˆ 1 1 while all scr and fe models converged convergence of the sare re and fm models was challenging without aggregating the random effects table 2 only under the extreme categorical scenarios with low baseline detection probability η 0 1 the convergence rates i e the number of converged models out of 100 repetitions of re were found to be higher 60 than the other two glmm models the convergence rate of the re and fm models improved substantially when random effects were aggregated 66 100 the convergence rate for the sare model also improved substantially 67 96 after aggregating the random effects under high spatial autocorrelation scenarios ϕ 0 05 whereas the improvement was less pronounced 5 39 under intermediate autocorrelation scenarios ϕ 1 for all the models that converged the mean ess was considerably higher than the suggested threshold of 400 indicating that the mcmc chains were long enough to provide stable estimates tables s6 s9 supp material scr and fe had the highest mcmc efficiency mean mcmc eff 0 8 under most scenarios except for the extreme categorical scenario with η 0 1 and ϕ 0 05 where scr had a relatively lower mean mcmc efficiency 0 41 see table 3 mcmc efficiency of both sare and re models were 1 5 2 times lower than scr and fe models in these scenarios despite spatial aggregation of the random effects among the three glmm formulations sare showed the highest mcmc efficiency in most scenarios mean 0 8 1 6 in continuous and 0 27 0 77 in categorical scenarios fm model had the lowest mcmc efficiency mean 0 01 0 1 across all scenarios primarily due to the higher mcmc computation time table s9 considering the overall poor mcmc convergence of the three glmms when fitted without aggregation we only considered the results with dimension reduction 5 1 2 estimates of population size all five models showed negligible bias in population size n estimates under most simulation scenarios tested here both sare and fe models that account for spatial autocorrelation estimated population size with moderate accuracy across all the scenarios median rb 9 6 tables s3 s5 although scr and re did not specifically model spatial autocorrelation between detectors population size estimates from these models showed negligible bias median rb 10 5 in most scenarios considered tables s1 and s2 supp material however under scenarios with categorical spatial variation in baseline detection probability and high autocorrelation ϕ 0 05 the scr model showed approximately 30 negative bias in population size fig 3 the re model produced an elevated negative bias median rb 17 under the categorical scenario with η 0 3 and ϕ 0 05 table s2 the fm model also showed a similar level of accuracy in estimating population size compared to the sare and fe models for all continuous scenarios table s4 although the fm model seemed to be structurally better suited for the scenarios with categorical variation in detection probability due to the integration of membership in discrete detectability groups it showed an 11 negative bias in each of the categorical scenarios with high autocorrelation the coefficient of variation cv in population size estimated with the five fitted models varied moderately median cv 3 16 under η 0 1 and was less than 8 for the remaining scenarios with η 0 3 coverage probabilities for the scr model were 90 for the scenarios with intermediate autocorrelation ϕ 1 but when spatial autocorrelation was high ϕ 0 05 coverage declined drastically 65 97 coverage for the continuous scenarios and dropped to less than 20 for the categorical scenarios table s1 coverage probabilities for sare re and fe were 90 coverage for fm 81 for all the scenarios except for the extreme categorical scenario with η 0 3 and ϕ 0 05 where coverage probabilities were 0 77 0 29 and 0 51 respectively tables s2 s5 5 1 3 detection probability surfaces and model comparison both the sare and fm models produced reliable detection probability surfaces in the presence of high spatial autocorrelation between detectors fig 4 sare generated surfaces were more accurate in estimating surfaces of baseline detection probability with the lowest sse in 65 94 of the replicates in both continuous and categorical scenarios with high autocorrelation although fm was more precise than sare and re in scenarios with intermediate autocorrelation the scr model which assumes homogeneous baseline detection probability had the lowest sse in 72 97 of the replicates in these scenarios figs 5 s2 under the scenarios with continuous spatial variation in detectability and high autocorrelation sare was selected as the best model 4 6 times more frequently than the other models based on waic when η 0 3 with intermediate autocorrelation fm and re were selected 1 5 2 times more frequently than the other models when η was 0 3 and 0 6 respectively for all remaining scenarios including the scenarios with categorical spatial variation the scr model was selected 5 2 empirical example all bear models converged and effective sample sizes of all top level parameters e g n σ ϕ η were higher than the threshold of 400 which ensured stable estimates table 4 fig 2 mcmc efficiency of n was highest for the scr model 0 114 and lowest for the re model 0 0006 among the three glmms n had the highest mcmc efficiency 0 0175 under the sare model based on waic values the best model was sare followed by re fe fm and finally scr table 4 estimates of the number of female brown bears n were a at least 22 lower under the scr model and b at least 18 lower under the fm model compared to the sare and re models table 4 figure s6 the 95 ci also showed a similar pattern with the ci width being larger for the sare re and fe models ci width 213 234 and 181 respectively than for the scr and fm models ci width 127 and 141 respectively however the cvs of the population size estimates were rather low 2 4 under all five fitted models the scr glmms especially the sare and re models also predicted the largest heterogeneity for the baseline detection probability surface range 0 0005 0 14 fig 6 6 discussion using a simulation study we developed and tested three scr glmms an independent random effects scr model re a spatially autocorrelated random effects scr model sare and a two group finite mixture scr model fm we assessed and compared the performance of these three models in terms of their ability to account for latent spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation in detection probability among detectors the sare model the data generating model in the simulation study was the most reliable model in estimating population size across all the tested scenarios when autocorrelation was high ϕ 0 05 the sare model also performed best in predicting the baseline detection probability surface as indicated by sse population size estimates from the re and fm models were largely unbiased in the presence of continuous detector specific variation in baseline detection probability surface but subject to a pronounced negative bias when fitted to the extreme scenarios with categorical variation and high autocorrelation the fm model outperformed the sare and re models in terms of sse for predicted surfaces of baseline detection probability when autocorrelation was at intermediate level ϕ 1 unknown latent and autocorrelated variation in detection probability among detectors is common in scr studies stevenson et al 2021 as shown by moqanaki et al 2021 failure to properly account for spatially autocorrelated detection probability may result in biased and overdispersed population size estimates fig 3 in this study we presented a bayesian scr glmm sare that specifically accounts for spatial autocorrelation between detectors the primary advantages of modelling spatial autocorrelation among detectors include the ability to use the information on detector configuration to correctly account for uncertainty in the estimates in a practical context this may aid the identification of locations or regions inside the study area with very low or no sampling effort fitting the basic scr model in cases of high autocorrelation produced a 30 rb with approximately zero coverage probability whereas the sare model showed less than 10 rb and coverage probability over 77 even models that allow variation among detectors but do not explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation re and fm models were able to produce estimates of population size with little bias in most cases we demonstrated the modelling approaches in a real life scr study non invasive genetic sampling of brown bear in central sweden therein members of the public i e hunters opportunistically collect most of the bear genetic samples with no measure of sampling effort bischof et al 2020a more than half 56 of detectors on the east side of the study area had no bear detections compared to 74 on the west along the swedish norwegian border fig 2 this apparent disparity was picked up by the scr glmms which suggested a moderately high spatial autocorrelation in detection probability over the study area this was highlighted in the estimated baseline detection probability surface from the sare re and fm models which had moran s i values a measure of spatial autocorrelation lichstein et al 2002 greater than 0 7 one major difference between these models was that the estimated baseline detection probability p 0 at one group of aggregated detectors figs 6 black shaded pixel in subplot b and dark red shaded pixel in subplot c near the eastern boundary was significantly higher 0 1 than the remaining surface with models sare and re but not with models scr fm or fe this is most likely due to one of the female bears that was detected 23 times at this group of detectors which represents the highest detection rate of any individual at any detector group this localized apparent hotspot in sampling effort and corresponding large difference in detection probability could neither be accounted for by the scr model that assumed homogeneous detectability nor explained by the spatial covariates used in the fe model furthermore the size of the female brown bear population was estimated to be a at least 22 lower with the scr model and b at least 18 lower with the fm model compared to the sare and re models this pattern was consistent with our findings from the simulation study scenarios 2 and 8 figure s2 tables s1 and s4 and previous results from the literature moqanaki et al 2021 stevenson et al 2021 that showed an underestimation of abundance when not accounting for spatially heterogeneous detection probability finally with larger waic values the basic scr model fm and fe seemed to have poorer predictive ability than the sare and re these results should be interpreted with caution as the models presented here all assume homogeneous density i e uniform placement of individual acs when population density varies over space the number of samples collected in a given location will reflect both the variation in density and sampling effort for example if sampling effort is positively correlated with population density any of the scr glmm models presented here would likely overestimate the heterogeneity in detection and presumably return biased estimates of abundance further research is thus needed on the potential confounding effects of simultaneous spatial heterogeneity in density and sampling effort clark 2019 paterson et al 2019 and the ability of scr glmms to account for and quantify such variation in large scale monitoring programmes like our bear example data often hail from both structured and unstructured or opportunistic sampling altwegg and nichols 2019 bischof et al 2020a isaac et al 2020 in certain extreme cases e g citizen science data large portions of the study area may be left unsampled unbeknownst to the investigator bird et al 2014 johnston et al 2022 the three scr glmms tested here sare re and fm allow modelling and quantifying unknown spatial variation in detection probability in the absence of known fixed effects spatially explicit estimates of detection probability obtained with scr glmms can be useful in planning and adjusting large scale surveys as they help investigators identify regions with high and low detection probability including apparent holes in sampling on the flip side bayesian scr glmms involve a large number of unknown parameters making these models challenging to fit manifested in slow computation speeds and convergence issues under certain conditions e g scr data with low number of detections per detector fitting of glmm models without aggregating the random effects for choosing a model practitioners will need to weigh the benefits of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in detection probability against the costs associated with model complexity high dimensional random effects models can easily overfit typical scr data with few or no detections at the majority of detectors dimension reduction of the random effects is a typical strategy to avoid overfitting and to control the number of random effects in a model section 3 2 hefley et al 2017 gelman et al 2014a pooling information allows reliable inference from model fitting that would otherwise be computationally unstable as shown by the improved convergence rates of all scr glmm models when random effects were aggregated table 2 the choice of aggregation level implies a trade off between sample size per detector high aggregation to achieve dimension reduction and the resolution of spatially explicit estimates of detectability low aggregation for more spatial detail to balance the need for spatial detail and computation we recommend increasing the aggregation level until the mcmc convergence criteria are met for the key parameters of interest in empirical analyses random effects can also be aggregated based on natural groups of detectors such as administrative units sub regions that differ in varying sampling effort or some other categorical factors for the sare model we advise caution in choosing an upper bound for the aggregation scale as the spatial autocorrelation is specifically modelled as a decreasing function of inter detectors distance it may become computationally intractable to estimate model parameters with low number of random effects since the fitted coarse surface would over dilute the true scale of variation in the autocorrelated surface further one might introduce negative bias in the estimate of population size under highly autocorrelated scenarios similar to what we experienced when fitting the basic scr model to our simulated data with heterogeneous and spatially autocorrelated detection probability when the number of detections per detector in scr data sets is low multicollinearity can occur between the detector or cluster specific random effects and other parameters in the half normal detection function for instance such multicollinearity arises in situations where the sare model is fitted to scr data sets that are not sufficiently informative to reveal underlying autocorrelation amongst detectors based on sse values and waic in our study we recommend fitting the sare model primarily to data from extreme sampling situations where both detection probability and spatial autocorrelation are high in all other situations sare is expected to give a poorer fit and poor mcmc convergence whereas basic scr can cope with moderate levels of variation present among the detectors even under low detectability as indicated by sse and waic figure s3 supp material overall we found waic to be useful in selecting the best model in scenarios with different levels of autocorrelation which holds promise for waic application in empirical analyses in this study we focused on three extensions of the scr model that can account for latent heterogeneous detection probability other potential modelling solutions for dealing with this situation include i bayesian non parametric models allowing for the possibility of infinite number of subgroups for the detection probability turek et al 2021 ii conditionally autoregressive random effects model car that specifically models spatial autocorrelation between detectors nicolau et al 2020 and iii basis function models which use a basis expansion from factorization of a pre specified correlation matrix hefley et al 2017 recently stevenson et al 2021 developed a scr model that models spatially autocorrelated detections based on gaussian random fields while the modelling approach can be advantageous in situations where variation in detection probability occurs regularly within individual home ranges the use of gaussian random fields requires integrating out the spatially autocorrelated random effects as well as the ac locations resulting in a significant computational burden each of these different classes of models is computationally extensive overparameterized and likely to overfit the sparse scr data sets that are common in ecological studies gerber and parmenter 2015 tourani 2022 nonetheless we anticipate future advancements can overcome these computational and modelling barriers to facilitate successful application of these techniques to model heterogeneity in detection probability 6 1 conclusions accounting for spatial autocorrelation in detection probability can mitigate bias in population size estimates dimension reduction of the random effects can help avoid overfitting of such complex models but caution should be applied when choosing the aggregation scale given the trade offs between mcmc efficiency and spatial detail investigators specifically interested in predicting detection probability surfaces or in identifying sampling holes in their study area should choose the sare model in situations where spatial autocorrelation is high and the average number of detections per detector is above one in situations where either detectability or autocorrelation is low to moderate we recommend the fm model instead

24223,spatial capture recapture scr models are now widely used for estimating density from repeated individual spatial encounters scr accounts for the inherent spatial autocorrelation in individual detections by modelling detection probabilities as a function of distance between the detectors and individual activity centres however additional spatial heterogeneity in detection probability may still creep in due to environmental or sampling characteristics if unaccounted for such variation can lead to pronounced bias in population size estimates in this paper we address this issue by describing three bayesian scr models that use generalized linear mixed modelling glmm approach to account for latent heterogeneity in baseline detection probability across detectors with independent random effects re spatially autocorrelated random effects sare with components of prior covariance matrix modelled as a decreasing function of inter detector distance and a two group finite mixture model fm to identify latent detectability classes of each detector we test these models using a simulation study and an empirical application to a non invasive genetic monitoring data set of female brown bears ursus arctos in central sweden in the simulation study all three models largely succeeded in mitigating the biasing effect of spatially heterogeneous detection probability on population size estimates overall sare provided the least biased population size estimates median rb 9 6 when spatial autocorrelation in detection probability was high sare also performed best at predicting the spatial pattern of heterogeneity in detection probability at intermediate levels of autocorrelation spatially explicit estimates of detection probability obtained with fm were more accurate than those generated by sare and re the empirical example revealed patterns consistent with the results from the simulation study we found that ignoring spatial heterogeneity in detection probability led to at least 22 lower estimate of bear population size compared to models that accounted for it i e sare and re models when the number of detections per detector is low 1 the glmms considered here may require dimension reduction of the random effects by pooling baseline detection probability parameters across neighbouring detectors aggregation to avoid over parameterization the added complexity and computational overhead associated with scr glmms may only be justified in extreme cases of spatial heterogeneity e g large clusters of inactive detectors unbeknownst to the investigator however even

repository 1 introduction spatial capture recapture scr models are now widely used to estimate demographic parameters particularly density scr data inherently varies across space because animal movements are not completely random and an individual is more likely to be detected close to its centre of activity activity centre ac scr models account for and in fact exploit such spatial heterogeneity in detection by modelling the detection probability as a decreasing function of distance between a detector e g an observer a trap or a search location and a latent ac efford 2004 borchers and efford 2008 however the relative distance between a detector and an ac may not be the only cause of variation in detection probability spatially variable and autocorrelated detection probability can occur due to various other factors such as local differences in how animals use space and how sampling is performed moqanaki et al 2021 stevenson et al 2021 known sources of variation in detection probability are readily modelled in scr using covariates for example through proxies or direct measures of sampling effort efford et al 2013 resource selection data obtained from telemetry studies royle et al 2013 or information about landscape connectivity sutherland et al 2015 however not all sources of variation are known and fully observed for example local site specific characteristics affecting detector exposure or effect of local atmospheric conditions on the genotyping success rate of non invasively collected dna samples may remain unaccounted for during scr analyses efford et al 2013 kendall et al 2019 moqanaki et al 2021 furthermore large scale wildlife monitoring programmes sometimes include both structured and unstructured sampling data the latter may be data collected by the general public to increase the extent and intensity of sampling thompson et al 2012 bischof et al 2020a unstructured and opportunistic sampling data is likely to be associated with unknown spatial variation in detection probability unmodelled spatial variation in detection probability particularly in the presence of high spatial autocorrelation can lead to biased and overdispersed population size estimates in scr analyses moqanaki et al 2021 a worst case scenario are pockets or clusters of detectors where unbeknownst to the investigator detection probability is null adequately accounting for spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation in detection probability is essential for obtaining reliable statistical inference in scr analyses moqanaki et al 2021 howe et al 2022 in the absence of known covariates the effect of detector specific variation in detection probability can be modelled by using a function that explains the true pattern of heterogeneity this function is always unknown and we approximate it using random effects i e by extending scr with generalized linear mixed models glmm bayesian implementation of scr glmms allows modelling and estimation of heterogeneous detection probability surfaces in scr models hooten et al 2003 spatially explicit estimates of detection probability can in turn reveal problematic areas e g regions with very low detection probability which are important to wildlife monitoring and conservation using simulations we describe and test three extensions of bayesian scr glmms that aim to account for latent spatial heterogeneity in detection probability via the use of random effects 1 a simple glmm extension of the basic single season scr model by assigning independent random effects re to detector specific baseline detection probabilities with the aim to account for unknown spatial variation in detection probability among detectors 2 a glmm extension of the basic single season scr model incorporating spatial autocorrelation between detectors by means of spatially autocorrelated random effects sare where covariance is modelled as a function of inter detector distance thus implicitly defining an ordered neighbourhood structure and 3 a two group finite mixture fm model to identify latent detectability classes of detectors we assessed and compared these three structurally different models in terms of i their ability to produce unbiased abundance estimates ii their capacity to realistically predict detection probability surfaces iii their model complexity and iv their computational overhead finally we considered the role that model comparison could play in selecting the best scr model under different conditions finally we provide an empirical demonstration of our modelling approaches by applying them to a non invasive genetic monitoring data set on brown bears ursus arctos from central sweden we chose this example because a large proportion of the data were collected opportunistically by volunteers without reliable measures of sampling effort or spatial variation therein 2 methods we first describe a basic single season scr model where we assume a homogeneous baseline detection probability across all the detectors following that we describe three extensions of the scr model namely i a scr glmm with independent random effects re ii a scr glmm with spatially autocorrelated random effect sare and iii a scr glmm with two group mixture to model detector specific baseline detection probabilities fm lastly as a reference point for making comparisons we use a scr glm model where the known true cause of the variation in detection probability is modelled using fixed effects 2 1 model 1 basic single season scr model scr a single season scr model typically consists of two submodels a submodel for the spatial distribution of individual acs within a given habitat v r 2 and another submodel for the individual and detector specific observations conditional on the location of acs 2 1 1 the ecological submodel we considered n individuals to reside in v each of whom was assumed to move randomly around its ac with coordinates s i following a homogeneous point process each individual ac was assumed to be uniformly distributed across the habitat v 1 s i uniform v i 1 2 n in our analysis the location s i of individual acs and the number of these acs n are both unknown we used a data augmentation approach to model n royle et al 2007 with a large integer m as an upper bound for n we introduced a vector of m latent binary variables z z 1 z 2 z m such that z i 1 if individual i is a member of the population and z i 0 otherwise then we assumed that each z i follows a bernoulli distribution with inclusion probability ψ the probability that an arbitrary individual from the augmented population of m individuals is a member of the population under study 2 z i bernoulli ψ consequently population size n i 1 m z i is a derived parameter following a binomial distribution with parameters m and ψ 2 1 2 the observation submodel we considered one sampling occasion and a set of j detectors located in v the capture history of the i th individual is denoted as y i 1 y i 2 y i j where each y i j is binary i e y i j is 1 if individual i is detected at detector j and 0 otherwise the observed capture recapture data set denoted by y obs is of dimension n j where n is the number of detected individuals during the scr survey we augmented this data set y obs with m n all zero capture histories 0 j following the data augmentation approach the zero augmented data set is denoted by y and is of dimension m j we assumed a bernoulli model for each y i j conditional on z i 3 y i j bernoulli p i j z i where p i j denotes the detection probability of the i th individual at the j th detector the detection probability p i j is a decreasing function of distance modelled following a half normal form efford 2004 4 p i j p 0 exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 where d i j d s i x j s i x j is the euclidean distance between the detector location x j and individual ac s i p 0 is the baseline detection probability and the scale parameter σ quantifies the rate of decline in detection probability p i j with distance d i j the full scr model can thus be written as ψ uniform 0 1 σ uniform 0 50 logit p 0 n 0 2 2 i 1 2 m s i uniform v z i bernoulli ψ p i j p 0 exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 for j 1 2 j 5 y i j bernoulli p i j z i for j 1 2 j by modelling detection probability p i j in terms of individual acs and fitting a decreasing detection function as in 4 using the distance between acs and detector location the scr model accounts for the spatial autocorrelation within individual capture histories however under this model detection probabilities p i j and p i j are equal at two detectors j and j when they are located at the same distance from the ac s i regardless of other potential sources of variation between the two detectors in other words this model does not consider the additional variation in detection probability that may be present at different detectors due to their locations in the landscape and other heterogeneous characteristics 2 2 model 2 independent random effects scr model re to account for spatial heterogeneity in detection probability causing detector specific variation in detection probabilities we used a simple glmm extension of the basic single season scr model model 1 here we assigned a logistic regression type model to baseline detection probability for each detector 6 logit p 0 j μ w j j 1 2 j where μ denotes the intercept and w j denotes the random effect for the j th detector the detection probability p i j for individual i at detector j is expressed as 7 p i j p 0 j exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 we assumed a n 0 σ w 2 prior for each w j j 1 2 j and a n 0 2 2 prior for μ the variance parameter σ w 2 can be given a weakly informative prior note that the re model does not specifically account for spatial autocorrelation in detection probability across detectors 2 3 model 3 spatially autocorrelated random effects scr model sare we extended the basic single season scr model model 1 to account for spatial autocorrelation among detectors in particular we developed a scr model for situations where detectors at close proximity are more likely to have similar detection probability compared to more distant detectors we modelled this spatial autocorrelation by introducing an autocorrelated random effect w w 1 w 2 w j of length j we assumed w to follow a multivariate normal distribution with mean 0 j and covariance matrix γ γ j j which controls the spatial dependence between detectors we modelled each element γ j j of this covariance matrix as a decreasing function of distance between detectors j and j following moqanaki et al 2021 8 γ j j exp ϕ δ j j where δ j j d x j x j x j x j is the euclidean distance between the detector locations x j and x j this covariance function implicitly defines an ordered neighbourhood for each detector and ϕ controls the rate of distance dependent decay of spatial autocorrelation between the detectors in particular detectors are highly autocorrelated if ϕ is small e g 0 05 and autocorrelation decreases as ϕ increases figs 1 and 4 similar to the re model the detection probability p i j for individual i at detector j is then expressed as 9 p i j p 0 j exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 where 10 logit p 0 j μ w j j 1 2 j here we assigned a n 0 2 2 prior for μ and a n 0 5 2 prior for log transformed ϕ when ϕ 0 each component γ j j 1 for any j and j the random effect w becomes a degenerate process implying exact dependence between the detectors hence the value of each random effect w j is identical at any location of the detector grid this is equivalent to the basic single season scr model conversely when ϕ the covariance matrix γ reduces to an identity matrix and consequently the sare model reduces to a scr glmm with independent random effects re 2 4 model 4 two group finite mixture scr model fm variable sampling intensity could be associated with ordered classes of unknown variation in detection probability across the landscape for our study we proposed using a two group finite mixture scr model fm to model heterogeneity in detection probability between detectors cubaynes et al 2010 turek et al 2021 here we defined two groups of heterogeneity viz 1 and 2 and introduced two detection probability parameters η 1 and η 2 where η k is the detection probability of the b th subgroup b 1 2 a constraint is imposed on these parameters η 1 η 2 to ensure identifiability further we defined binary indicator variables u j j 1 2 j to indicate the subgroup that a detector belongs to 11 p 0 j 1 u j η 1 u j η 2 j 1 2 j mcmc computation allows the binary classification in our two group mixture model to implicitly account for the group membership probabilities pr u j 1 and consequently allows estimation of each p 0 j via 11 accounting for the uncertainty in the group membership probabilities of each detector we assigned a bernoulli prior to each u j with probability π of being assigned to second group we further assumed bounded uniform priors over the 0 1 interval for the probability parameters η 1 η 2 and π 2 5 model 5 scr model with known fixed effects fe for the sake of assessing and comparing the performance of the above models we considered a glm extension of basic single season scr model model 1 using detector specific effects i e the true source of variation to model baseline detection probability this can be executed by supplying the known simulated effect w as an observed virtual covariate and then model the baseline detection probability 12 logit p 0 j μ w j consequently the detection probability p i j is expressed as 13 p i j p 0 j exp d i j 2 2 σ 2 the rest of this fe model remains the same as the basic scr model 1 3 simulation study for simulations we used a 32 32 detector array number of traps j 1024 with 1 distance unit du of minimum inter detector spacing the detector array is centred on a 41 41 du habitat surrounded by a 5 du habitat buffer fig 1 we used a σ value of 1 5 for all the simulations so that the buffer width is larger than 3 σ resulting in negligible detection probability of individuals with acs near the habitat boundary efford 2011 we simulated scr data sets for n 300 individuals leading to a population level home range overlap index k σ density 0 63 efford et al 2016 we set the size of the augmented population m to be 500 3 1 simulation scenarios for each simulation we used the sare model model 3 section 2 3 to generate scr data with spatially autocorrelated detection probability between detectors we created simulation scenarios by varying spatial autocorrelation rate parameter ϕ with high ϕ 0 05 and intermediate ϕ 1 spatial autocorrelation to simulate spatially varying random effect w w 1 w 2 w j fig 1 3 1 1 continuous detector specific variation in detection probability detection probability may exhibit continuous spatial variation if it is linked with underlying habitat characteristics such as elevation forest cover or distance from roads that influence animal behaviour or detection effort and efficiency moqanaki et al 2021 for simplifying the interpretation of μ in sare model 3 we transformed it into a new variable η via the link μ logit η here η can also be viewed as the average baseline detection probability providing a clearer interpretation for the readers in simulations we used three values of η to generate low η 0 1 intermediate η 0 3 and high η 0 6 baseline detection probability for each detector subject to spatial autocorrelation infused by w fig 1 row 1 3 1 2 categorical detector specific variation in detection probability discrete differences in sampling or environmental characteristics can lead to categorical classes of variation in detection probability between detectors we considered an extreme case where 50 of the detectors would remain inactive and the remaining detectors would have a constant detection probability moqanaki et al 2021 thus a portion of the study area would remain entirely unsampled to simulate such scenarios we transformed each p 0 j into a discrete variable taking only one of the two values 0 and logit η to create two classes of detector specific baseline detection probability using 10 14 p 0 j 0 if w j q 50 logit η otherwise where q 50 is the 50 quantile of the effect w j s we used two values of η to generate low η 0 1 and intermediate η 0 3 levels of baseline detection probability for active detectors fig 1 row 2 in summary we divided all simulation scenarios in two broad setups viz continuous and categorical with respect to detector specific variation in detection probability in the continuous setup con we generated six simulation scenarios by combining two levels of autocorrelation ϕ and three levels of detection η in the categorical setup cat we generated four simulation scenarios by combining two levels of ϕ and two levels of η thus in total we generated 10 simulation scenarios for each simulation scenario we generated 100 independent scr data sets resulting in 1000 simulated scr data sets in total table 1 3 2 curse of dimensionality in many scr studies the majority of detectors are associated with no or very few detections gerber and parmenter 2015 tourani 2022 in such situations fitting complex models such as sare fm and re which involves large number of parameters and latent variables may lead to poor markov chain monte carlo mcmc convergence below par mixing and over fitting this phenomenon is known as the curse of dimensionality and expected to occur when models are over parameterized wikle and hooten 2010 we mitigated this issue by dimension reduction of the random effects to do this we aggregated random effects that are used to model baseline detection probability such that a single random effect value is assigned to a cluster of neighbouring detectors note that we are not aggregating detections themselves for instance in sare if each cluster contains n c detectors then each detector belonging to a cluster say j th will share the same random effect value w j j 1 2 j n c j being the total number of detectors here we aggregated the random effects by a factor of 4 squares of 4 4 detectors one cluster when aggregated the 32 32 detector grid i e 1024 detectors fig 1 forms a grid of 8 8 clusters 3 3 model fitting description we fitted five scr models to the same simulated datasets i basic single season scr model without aggregation section 2 1 ii re model both with and without aggregation section 2 2 iii sare model both with and without aggregation section 2 3 iv fm model both with and without aggregation section 2 4 and v fe model without aggregation section 2 5 the models were fitted using mcmc simulation with nimble de valpine et al 2017 nimble development team 2021 in r version 3 6 2 r core team 2019 we used the r package nimblescr bischof et al 2020b turek et al 2021 which implements the local evaluation approach milleret et al 2019 to increase mcmc efficiency for each simulated data set we ran three chains of i 30 000 iterations for both basic single season scr and fe model including burn in 12 000 iterations ii 100 000 iterations for sare and re including burn in 20 000 iterations both with and without aggregation and iii 60 000 iterations for fm without aggregation including burn in 12 000 iterations and 20 000 iterations for fm with aggregation including 4000 iteration burn in mcmc convergence of each model was monitored using the gelman rubin convergence diagnostic r ˆ with upper threshold 1 1 gelman et al 2014a and visual inspection of traceplots 3 4 model performance measures we used relative bias coefficient of variation and coverage probability to evaluate the performance of each fitted models with respect to estimation of focal parameters e g n σ suppose θ r r 1 2 r denotes a set of mcmc draws from the posterior distribution of a scalar parameter θ relative bias relative bias rb is calculated as 15 rb θ θ ˆ θ 0 θ 0 where θ ˆ denotes the

posterior standard deviation of parameter θ coverage probability coverage probability was computed as the proportion of converged model fits for which the estimated 95 credible interval ci of the parameter θ contained the true value θ 0 3 4 1 effective sample size and mcmc efficiency to compare the efficiency of the different mcmc algorithms of the fitted models we computed the effective sample size ess and mcmc efficiency ess mcmc run time of each top level parameter for each of the model runs we used the effectivesize function from the r package coda to compute ess plummer et al 2006 the calculation of ess is based on the combined samples of the converged mcmc chains after discarding the burn in period the mcmc computation time was calculated excluding the burn in period to obtain stable estimates of the quantities of interest it is recommended to have ess greater than 400 vehtari et al 2021 although mcmc algorithms are used to generate sample from posterior distributions efficiency can vary between different algorithms there are two primary measures of efficiency of mcmc algorithms quality of mcmc mixing and speed of mcmc computation we computed mcmc efficiency as a combined metric to assess both of these characteristics of mcmc algorithms so that we could compare the efficiency of different mcmc algorithms we reported the mean mcmc efficiency for each top level parameters in the model and across all the converged replicates in each scenario 3 4 2 spatial accuracy of predicted baseline detection probability surfaces baseline detection probability surfaces obtained from scr analyses are useful in evaluating the performance of our scr models as they have the potential to reveal spatial patterns in detection probability such as pockets with very low or very high detection probability that could be of practical relevance we compared the accuracy of the detector specific baseline detection probability surfaces predicted by the different models with the true simulated surface p 0 p 01 p 02 p 0 j we quantified the accuracy by calculating the expected sum of squared errors sse in practice we first obtained posterior mcmc sample of baseline detection probability surface p 0 p 01 p 02 p 0 j and computed the mean squared error for detector j sse j 1 r r 1 r p 0 j r p 0 j 2 where p 0 j 1 p 0 j 2 p 0 j r denotes a posterior mcmc sample of p 0 j j 1 2 j finally we calculated total error sum of squares sse j 1 j sse j as a measure of predictive accuracy of detection probability surface smaller sse implies a more accurate prediction closer to the truth of the baseline detection probability surface we used δ sse relative to the model with the lowest sse δ sse sse min sse to compare the accuracy of predicted baseline detection probability surface amongst the different models 3 4 3 model comparison using waic we compared the fitted models using watanabe akaike information criterion waic watanabe 2010 which is computed as 17 waic 2 i 1 m log 1 r r 1 r f y i θ r 2 p w where f y i θ denotes the likelihood of i th individual capture history y i y i 1 y i 2 y i j in the model here we adopted the second of the two variants of the penalty term p w proposed by gelman et al 2014b 18 p w i 1 m 1 r 1 r 1 r log f y i θ r 1 r r 1 r log f y i θ r 2 a model with smaller waic is preferred we use δ waic waic min waic to compare the different models in terms of their model fit and complexity 4 empirical example the brown bear population in sweden is monitored primarily using non invasive genetic sampling of scats and hair bischof et al 2016 2020a the majority of samples are collected voluntarily by hundreds of hunters due to the opportunistic nature of sample collection there are no direct measures of sampling effort available sampling effort meanwhile is liable to be both spatially heterogeneous and spatially autocorrelated isaac and pocock 2015 thus this data set offers a good case study to demonstrate the application of our modelling approaches for this analysis we considered genetic samples of adult female bears with confirmed individual identity sex location and sampling date from two swedish counties of jämtland and västernorrland during the monitoring from 1 april to 30 november 2020 fig 2 that were stored in the scandinavian large carnivore monitoring database rovbase 3 0 www rovbase se the data set was composed of 2207 successfully genotyped non invasive genetic samples associated with 731 individual female bears fig 2 b bear detections were assigned to the closest detector in a grid of 3152 detectors at 5 km resolution on average there were 0 7 detections per detector range 0 14 fig 2 c and 3 detections per detected individual range 1 31 for the purpose of demonstration we fitted five single season models scr re sare fm and fe as described in section 2 to the bear data and compared estimates of baseline detection probability and population size because of the low number of detections per detector we aggregated the random effects to 20 km resolution for models sare fm and re so that each random effect value was shared by a maximum of 16 detectors in an effort to model the spatial heterogeneity in detection probability with the fe model we picked three spatial covariates figure s5 supp material that were known to play an important role in detectability bischof et al 2020a i distance m from the nearest road as a measure of site accessibility during sampling ii a binary covariate indicating whether an observation from a large carnivore was recorded by members of the public www skandobs se or the authorities www rovbase se during the sampling period this binary covariate distinguishes areas with very low detectability from those where carnivore dna samples if present could have been detected and submitted for genetic analysis see milleret et al 2022 in addition iii separate intercepts were estimated for the two counties μ jämtland μ 1 and μ västernorrland μ 2 19 logit p 0 j μ county j x j β where county j denotes the county corresponding to the j th detector β β 1 β 2 denotes the vector of regression coefficients without intercept and x j x 1 j x 2 j denotes the distance to the nearest road and the presence absence of other observations at the j th detector we ran four mcmc chains for each of the five models the chain lengths burn in period and thinning rate were as following i scr 50 000 iterations burn in 6000 thinning rate 1 ii re 13 000 iterations burn in 5000 thinning rate 1 iii sare 300 000 iterations burn in 160 000 thinning rate 2 iv fm 40 000 iterations burn in 2000 thinning rate 1 and v fe 21 000 iterations burn in 6000 thinning rate 1 we followed the same procedure to assess model performance as we did in the simulation study but reported posterior parameter estimates as rb could not be calculated for the empirical example 5 results 5 1 simulation study 5 1 1 model convergence

σ ϕ η with r ˆ 1 1 while all scr and fe models converged convergence of the sare re and fm models was challenging without aggregating the random effects table 2 only under the extreme categorical scenarios with low baseline detection probability η 0 1 the convergence rates i e the number of converged models out of 100 repetitions of re were found to be higher 60 than the other two glmm models the convergence rate of the re and fm models improved substantially when random effects were aggregated 66 100 the convergence rate for the sare model also improved substantially 67 96 after aggregating the random effects under high spatial autocorrelation scenarios ϕ 0 05 whereas the improvement was less pronounced 5 39 under intermediate autocorrelation scenarios ϕ 1 for all the models that converged the mean ess was considerably higher than the suggested threshold of 400 indicating that the mcmc chains were long enough to provide stable estimates tables s6 s9 supp material scr and fe had the highest mcmc efficiency mean mcmc eff 0 8 under most scenarios except for the extreme categorical scenario with η 0 1 and ϕ 0 05 where scr had a relatively lower mean mcmc efficiency 0 41 see table 3 mcmc efficiency of both sare and re models were 1 5 2 times lower than scr and fe models in these scenarios despite spatial aggregation of the random effects among the three glmm formulations sare showed the highest mcmc efficiency in most scenarios mean 0 8 1 6 in continuous and 0 27 0 77 in categorical scenarios fm model had the lowest mcmc efficiency mean 0 01 0 1 across all scenarios primarily due to the higher mcmc computation time table s9 considering the overall poor mcmc convergence of the three glmms when fitted without aggregation we only considered the results with dimension reduction 5 1 2 estimates of population size all five models showed negligible bias in population size n estimates under most simulation scenarios tested here both sare and fe models that account for spatial autocorrelation estimated population size with moderate accuracy across all the scenarios median rb 9 6 tables s3 s5 although scr and re did not specifically model spatial autocorrelation between detectors population size estimates from these models showed negligible bias median rb 10 5 in most scenarios considered tables s1 and s2 supp material however under scenarios with categorical spatial variation in baseline detection probability and high autocorrelation ϕ 0 05 the scr model showed approximately 30 negative bias in population size fig 3 the re model produced an elevated negative bias median rb 17 under the categorical scenario with η 0 3 and ϕ 0 05 table s2 the fm model also showed a similar level of accuracy in estimating population size compared to the sare and fe models for all continuous scenarios table s4 although the fm model seemed to be structurally better suited for the scenarios with categorical variation in detection probability due to the integration of membership in discrete detectability groups it showed an 11 negative bias in each of the categorical scenarios with high autocorrelation the coefficient of variation cv in population size estimated with the five fitted models varied moderately median cv 3 16 under η 0 1 and was less than 8 for the remaining scenarios with η 0 3 coverage probabilities for the scr model were 90 for the scenarios with intermediate autocorrelation ϕ 1 but when spatial autocorrelation was high ϕ 0 05 coverage declined drastically 65 97 coverage for the continuous scenarios and dropped to less than 20 for the categorical scenarios table s1 coverage probabilities for sare re and fe were 90 coverage for fm 81 for all the scenarios except for the extreme categorical scenario with η 0 3 and ϕ 0 05 where coverage probabilities were 0 77 0 29 and 0 51 respectively tables s2 s5 5 1 3 detection probability surfaces and model comparison both the sare and fm models produced reliable detection probability surfaces in the presence of high spatial autocorrelation between detectors fig 4 sare generated surfaces were more accurate in estimating surfaces of baseline detection probability with the lowest sse in 65 94 of the replicates in both continuous and categorical scenarios with high autocorrelation although fm was more precise than sare and re in scenarios with intermediate autocorrelation the scr model which assumes homogeneous baseline detection probability had the lowest sse in 72 97 of the replicates in these scenarios figs 5 s2 under the scenarios with continuous spatial variation in detectability and high autocorrelation sare was selected as the best model 4 6 times more frequently than the other models based on waic when η 0 3 with intermediate autocorrelation fm and re were selected 1 5 2 times more frequently than the other models when η was 0 3 and 0 6 respectively for all remaining scenarios including the scenarios with categorical spatial variation the scr model was selected 5 2 empirical example all bear models converged and effective sample sizes of all top level parameters e g n σ ϕ η were higher than the threshold of 400 which ensured stable estimates table 4 fig 2 mcmc efficiency of n was highest for the scr model 0 114 and lowest for the re model 0 0006 among the three glmms n had the highest mcmc efficiency 0 0175 under the sare model based on waic values the best model was sare followed by re fe fm and finally scr table 4 estimates of the number of female brown bears n were a at least 22 lower under the scr model and b at least 18 lower under the fm model compared to the sare and re models table 4 figure s6 the 95 ci also showed a similar pattern with the ci width being larger for the sare re and fe models ci width 213 234 and 181 respectively than for the scr and fm models ci width 127 and 141 respectively however the cvs of the population size estimates were rather low 2 4 under all five fitted models the scr glmms especially the sare and re models also predicted the largest heterogeneity for the baseline detection probability surface range 0 0005 0 14 fig 6 6 discussion using a simulation study we developed and tested three scr glmms an independent random effects scr model re a spatially autocorrelated random effects scr model sare and a two group finite mixture scr model fm we assessed and compared the performance of these three models in terms of their ability to account for latent spatial heterogeneity and autocorrelation in detection probability among detectors the sare model the data generating model in the simulation study was the most reliable model in estimating population size across all the tested scenarios when autocorrelation was high ϕ 0 05 the sare model also performed best in predicting the baseline detection probability surface as indicated by sse population size estimates from the re and fm models were largely unbiased in the presence of continuous detector specific variation in baseline detection probability surface but subject to a pronounced negative bias when fitted to the extreme scenarios with categorical variation and high autocorrelation the fm model outperformed the sare and re models in terms of sse for predicted surfaces of baseline detection probability when autocorrelation was at intermediate level ϕ 1 unknown latent and autocorrelated variation in detection probability among detectors is common in scr studies stevenson et al 2021 as shown by moqanaki et al 2021 failure to properly account for spatially autocorrelated detection probability may result in biased and overdispersed population size estimates fig 3 in this study we presented a bayesian scr glmm sare that specifically accounts for spatial autocorrelation between detectors the primary advantages of modelling spatial autocorrelation among detectors include the ability to use the information on detector configuration to correctly account for uncertainty in the estimates in a practical context this may aid the identification of locations or regions inside the study area with very low or no sampling effort fitting the basic scr model in cases of high autocorrelation produced a 30 rb with approximately zero coverage probability whereas the sare model showed less than 10 rb and coverage probability over 77 even models that allow variation among detectors but do not explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation re and fm models were able to produce estimates of population size with little bias in most cases we demonstrated the modelling approaches in a real life scr study non invasive genetic sampling of brown bear in central sweden therein members of the public i e hunters opportunistically collect most of the bear genetic samples with no measure of sampling effort bischof et al 2020a more than half 56 of detectors on the east side of the study area had no bear detections compared to 74 on the west along the swedish norwegian border fig 2 this apparent disparity was picked up by the scr glmms which suggested a moderately high spatial autocorrelation in detection probability over the study area this was highlighted in the estimated baseline detection probability surface from the sare re and fm models which had moran s i values a measure of spatial autocorrelation lichstein et al 2002 greater than 0 7 one major difference between these models was that the estimated baseline detection probability p 0 at one group of aggregated detectors figs 6 black shaded pixel in subplot b and dark red shaded pixel in subplot c near the eastern boundary was significantly higher 0 1 than the remaining surface with models sare and re but not with models scr fm or fe this is most likely due to one of the female bears that was detected 23 times at this group of detectors which represents the highest detection rate of any individual at any detector group this localized apparent hotspot in sampling effort and corresponding large difference in detection probability could neither be accounted for by the scr model that assumed homogeneous detectability nor explained by the spatial covariates used in the fe model furthermore the size of the female brown bear population was estimated to be a at least 22 lower with the scr model and b at least 18 lower with the fm model compared to the sare and re models this pattern was consistent with our findings from the simulation study scenarios 2 and 8 figure s2 tables s1 and s4 and previous results from the literature moqanaki et al 2021 stevenson et al 2021 that showed an underestimation of abundance when not accounting for spatially heterogeneous detection probability finally with larger waic values the basic scr model fm and fe seemed to have poorer predictive ability than the sare and re these results should be interpreted with caution as the models presented here all assume homogeneous density i e uniform placement of individual acs when population density varies over space the number of samples collected in a given location will reflect both the variation in density and sampling effort for example if sampling effort is positively correlated with population density any of the scr glmm models presented here would likely overestimate the heterogeneity in detection and presumably return biased estimates of abundance further research is thus needed on the potential confounding effects of simultaneous spatial heterogeneity in density and sampling effort clark 2019 paterson et al 2019 and the ability of scr glmms to account for and quantify such variation in large scale monitoring programmes like our bear example data often hail from both structured and unstructured or opportunistic sampling altwegg and nichols 2019 bischof et al 2020a isaac et al 2020 in certain extreme cases e g citizen science data large portions of the study area may be left unsampled unbeknownst to the investigator bird et al 2014 johnston et al 2022 the three scr glmms tested here sare re and fm allow modelling and quantifying unknown spatial variation in detection probability in the absence of known fixed effects spatially explicit estimates of detection probability obtained with scr glmms can be useful in planning and adjusting large scale surveys as they help investigators identify regions with high and low detection probability including apparent holes in sampling on the flip side bayesian scr glmms involve a large number of unknown parameters making these models challenging to fit manifested in slow computation speeds and convergence issues under certain conditions e g scr data with low number of detections per detector fitting of glmm models without aggregating the random effects for choosing a model practitioners will need to weigh the benefits of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in detection probability against the costs associated with model complexity high dimensional random effects models can easily overfit typical scr data with few or no detections at the majority of detectors dimension reduction of the random effects is a typical strategy to avoid overfitting and to control the number of random effects in a model section 3 2 hefley et al 2017 gelman et al 2014a pooling information allows reliable inference from model fitting that would otherwise be computationally unstable as shown by the improved convergence rates of all scr glmm models when random effects were aggregated table 2 the choice of aggregation level implies a trade off between sample size per detector high aggregation to achieve dimension reduction and the resolution of spatially explicit estimates of detectability low aggregation for more spatial detail to balance the need for spatial detail and computation we recommend increasing the aggregation level until the mcmc convergence criteria are met for the key parameters of interest in empirical analyses random effects can also be aggregated based on natural groups of detectors such as administrative units sub regions that differ in varying sampling effort or some other categorical factors for the sare model we advise caution in choosing an upper bound for the aggregation scale as the spatial autocorrelation is specifically modelled as a decreasing function of inter detectors distance it may become computationally intractable to estimate model parameters with low number of random effects since the fitted coarse surface would over dilute the true scale of variation in the autocorrelated surface further one might introduce negative bias in the estimate of population size under highly autocorrelated scenarios similar to what we experienced when fitting the basic scr model to our simulated data with heterogeneous and spatially autocorrelated detection probability when the number of detections per detector in scr data sets is low multicollinearity can occur between the detector or cluster specific random effects and other parameters in the half normal detection function for instance such multicollinearity arises in situations where the sare model is fitted to scr data sets that are not sufficiently informative to reveal underlying autocorrelation amongst detectors based on sse values and waic in our study we recommend fitting the sare model primarily to data from extreme sampling situations where both detection probability and spatial autocorrelation are high in all other situations sare is expected to give a poorer fit and poor mcmc convergence whereas basic scr can cope with moderate levels of variation present among the detectors even under low detectability as indicated by sse and waic figure s3 supp material overall we found waic to be useful in selecting the best model in scenarios with different levels of autocorrelation which holds promise for waic application in empirical analyses in this study we focused on three extensions of the scr model that can account for latent heterogeneous detection probability other potential modelling solutions for dealing with this situation include i bayesian non parametric models allowing for the possibility of infinite number of subgroups for the detection probability turek et al 2021 ii conditionally autoregressive random effects model car that specifically models spatial autocorrelation between detectors nicolau et al 2020 and iii basis function models which use a basis expansion from factorization of a pre specified correlation matrix hefley et al 2017 recently stevenson et al 2021 developed a scr model that models spatially autocorrelated detections based on gaussian random fields while the modelling approach can be advantageous in situations where variation in detection probability occurs regularly within individual home ranges the use of gaussian random fields requires integrating out the spatially autocorrelated random effects as well as the ac locations resulting in a significant computational burden each of these different classes of models is computationally extensive overparameterized and likely to overfit the sparse scr data sets that are common in ecological studies gerber and parmenter 2015 tourani 2022 nonetheless we anticipate future advancements can overcome these computational and modelling barriers to facilitate successful application of these techniques to model heterogeneity in detection probability 6 1 conclusions accounting for spatial autocorrelation in detection probability can mitigate bias in population size estimates dimension reduction of the random effects can help avoid overfitting of such complex models but caution should be applied when choosing the aggregation scale given the trade offs between mcmc efficiency and spatial detail investigators specifically interested in predicting detection probability surfaces or in identifying sampling holes in their study area should choose the sare model in situations where spatial autocorrelation is high and the average number of detections per detector is above one in situations where either detectability or autocorrelation is low to moderate we recommend the fm model instead

24224,the construction of ecological security pattern and ecological security network and reasonable ecological security planning are of great significance for ecosystem protection and restoration and optimal regulation this study takes the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf as the study area based on the improved ecological footprint model and the patch generating land use simulation plus model the ecological carrying capacity changes and driving mechanisms from 1990 to 2040 were analysed the study proposed the idea of history present future to construct an ecological security pattern we have constructed an integrated points lines and surfaces ecological security network and carried out ecological security optimization planning the results show that 1 the overall 1990 2040 belongs to the medium high carrying capacity grade showing a trend of rising and then falling and the spatial changes are dominated by the type of unchanging ecological carrying capacity nanning is the most severely damaged slope and temperature are the main driving factors 2 a total of 17 ecological source patches were identified in this study the ecological source patches account for the overall area in general and their distribution is relatively concentrated so the ecological security of the central city needs to be focused on 3 this study extracts 17 ecological corridors and 11 karst ecological corridors generating an integrated ecological security network structure of points lines and surfaces the ecological optimization planning proposal of two belts three screens four zones and multiple

data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction since the turn of the century the rapid development of china s technology and economy has resulted in the sloppy use of national land resources and ecological damage which has led to a decrease in the carrying capacity of ecosystems and a prominent conflict between human and land kowe et al 2020 china is actively promoting the construction of ecological civilization practicing the concept of green water and green mountains are golden mountains and creating a new situation of beautiful china which puts forward higher requirements for effective response to ecological environment degradation he et al 2019 the ecosystem have a profound impact on improving the environment climate change and ecosystem function but development in many areas has exceeded the ecological carrying capacity of the area and development patterns are unsustainable posing a threat to ecological security ecological carrying capacity ecc is the key to evaluating sustainable development capacity and is an important analytical tool to determine ecological security models for human and ecosocial system development guo et al 2017 lu et al 2020 the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs have repeatedly reported on ecosystem restoration calling for human restoration and protection of nature and a dynamic balance between human needs and the carrying capacity of the natural environment which has become an international consensus qiu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to construct an ecological security pattern based on ecological carrying capacity assessment which is of great significance for ecosystem protection and restoration and integrated co governance ecological carrying capacity was first defined as the maximum size at which organisms could survive in a given environment responding to ecological supply capacity in 1987 the united nations published our common future which articulated sustainable development which laid a solid foundation for subsequent ecological carrying capacity studies xiong et al 2013 china started around the 1990s and is still in a phase of rapid development in terms of research content tourism ecological carrying capacity agriculture forestry and fishery ecological carrying capacity are mostly studied folke et al 1997 galli et al 2015 guangxi has also made some research results on ecological carrying capacity and has made great progress in water resources karst mountains and oceans in recent years but it is mostly a single aspect of research and the comprehensive exploration of complex ecosystems needs to be strengthened in terms of research methods ecological footprint method three dimensional ecological footprint model and life cycle evaluation method are common zhou 2019 yang et al 2020 among which the ecological footprint method is the most common method used by experts and scholars to study ecological carrying capacity which is mature operable and highly credible but in the calculation of important parameters mostly refer to global hectares or national hectares are used for the calculation of important parameters and problems such as large scale variability and poor targeting are found in the study resulting in a large error between the final calculation results and the actual situation this study adopts provincial hectares instead of the traditional global national hectares to improve the ecological footprint model with a view to quantifying and spatially expressing the ecological carrying capacity of the region and realizing the spatial pattern analysis of the regional ecological carrying capacity in terms of research regions and scales global national large scale urban clusters watersheds counties etc zhang et al 2022 the effectiveness and variability of statistical data updates make it insufficient in revealing the spatial pattern of ecological carrying capacity and relatively few studies are conducted at the patch scale which leads to the phenomenon of incomplete analysis of the problem the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa has proposed that ecological security is the fundamental right to life health and well being of human beings it is a state in which all aspects of essential livelihood security resources and the ability to adapt to environmental change are not compromised xiao et al 2002 this coincides with the un sustainable development goals sdgs and the strategy to build a beautiful china as a composite content ecological security emphasizes ecological balance and mutual coordination of environmental elements which is characterized by comprehensive diversified regional and dynamic nature peng et al 2016 ecological security pattern is a spatial pattern composed of various landscape elements spatial locations and their interconnections the construction of ecological security pattern is a specific measure taken to achieve the ecological security goal and it needs to set the development goals with regional characteristics protect regional biodiversity maintain ecological balance and maintain the integrity of ecosystem structure and processes otherwise the ecosystem foundation will be damaged so it is necessary to control and improve regional ecological and environmental problems and improve regional ecological carrying capacity chen et al 2018 ecological security pattern studies often take the perspective of ecosystem service value and land use as the entry point and take urban clusters and ecologically fragile areas as the study area and common methods include minimum cumulative resistance surface model neural network model etc mostly based on mathematical statistics or rs and gis technology to construct ecological security patterns to guide regional ecological planning zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 ecological source site identification is a crucial first step in the construction of ecological security patterns traditional ecological source identification is usually achieved by directly selecting nature reserves and historical sites vergnes et al 2013 mostly considering natural ecological functions and ignoring the possibility of human use of land and thus affecting ecological carrying capacity which may cause substantial bias in ecological source identification and thus affect the identification of ecological security patterns ecological carrying capacity assessment is an integral part of the spatial development pattern and optimization of the national territory lu et al 2020 at present the scientific and rational use and development of land space is severe and the traditional ecological security evaluation can no longer provide more effective decision support and the trend of ecological security pattern construction and ecological security network establishment conversion has been presented based on the law of historical development leading to poor precision in identifying ecological source sites and inaccurate extraction of ecological corridors it cannot provide a good basis for building an integrated ecological safety network of points lines and surfaces nor can it meet the scientific regulation of decision makers so the idea of history present future have proposed for ecological security optimization planning the idea of constructing ecological security pattern by combining ecological security zoning and three land use types is rarely reported and the key ecological pinch point extraction is also the direction of the key breakthrough of ecological security network research for the realization of national spatial management and development of the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf the scientific use of ecological carrying capacity evaluation results to guide optimal planning of regional ecological security patterns will be key feng et al 2021 the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf is an integrated transition zone spanning mountains rivers and seas with the fragility of karst mountains the complexity of multiple watersheds and the interaction of coastal zones and integrated diverse and complex ecosystems zhang et al 2021a the region is characterized by large differences in economic development insufficient attention to ecological protection and environmental management measures complex and diverse terrain and geology and frequent natural disasters such as floods droughts and typhoons which make ecological and environmental management more difficult and decrease ecological carrying capacity making it difficult to meet the demand for coordinated and integrated development of coastal riverine and border regions that china wants in the new era of china the region is a major international gateway towards asean and a new strategic pivot point for the open development of the southwest central and southern regions its location on the south western frontier has been pushed to the forefront of china s opening up to the outside world and it has been given a rare and historic opportunity the construction of ecological security pattern and ecological security network in the region and the proposed spatial planning for ecological security optimization is an important scientific issue to ensure the environmental service program therefore how to scientifically protect and optimally regulate complex ecosystems to encourage ecologically socially safe and sustainable development is an important element that cannot be circumvented 2 materials and methods 2 1 research content 1 we used the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf as our study area based on multi source data and the plus model to predict spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capacity over the next 20 years the spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2040 and the main driving factors are analysed 2 we identified ecological source sites and selected nine resistance factors to construct ecological resistance surfaces based on the 50 year ecological carrying capacity assessment results we constructed ecological security patterns for site types and zoned ecological security based on the minimum cumulative resistance mcr model 3 based on the gis spatial analysis platform we extracted ecological corridors constructed an integrated points lines and surfaces ecological security network and carried out ecological security optimization planning 2 2 study area the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf is located in the southwest of guangxi e104 28 109 56 n20 26 25 07 consisting of southwest guangxi karst district and guangxi beibu gulf economic zone containing 7 cities and 55 counties with a total area of 108 365 41 km2 fig 2 the overall topography of the region gradually decrease from northwest to southeast with a top down slope along the foothills of the yunnan guizhou plateau to the coastal zone of beibu gulf temperatures range from 2 8 to 40 4 c with an average temperature of 22 5 c sometimes extreme weather can occur precipitation is between 1745 6 3111 9 mm with abundant rainfall and abundant water resources the karst mountains with serious stone desertification poor soil prone to drought not easy to cultivate and serious soil erosion the coastal areas of the northern bay densely populated by humans with unreasonable development of resources such as sea enclosures and scenic development in coastal areas and aquaculture destroying marine resources from 1990 to 2020 forest resources wetland resources and grassland resources have declined across the region by the end of 2020 the total population of the region s 55 counties will have reached 26 433 100 people and the gross domestic product per capita will reach 1212 783 million yuan 2 3 data source and data preprocessing digital elevation model dem data were obtained from the national center for basic geographic information http www

methods 2 4 1 ecological carrying capacity index improved ecological footprint model ecological footprint models are widely used in ecological carrying capacity research and have the advantages of intuition simple operation and high feasibility at present the calculation of ecological footprint in china is unified in national and global hectares shao et al 2012 and there is no unified calculation method based on provincial hectares which will affect the reliability and relevance of the results therefore in this study the ecological footprint is calculated using provincial hectares as the accounting unit and the important parameters are modified locally since this study only calculates the ecological carrying capacity index it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological carrying capacity the ecological carrying capacity index formula is as follows 1 q i 1 n a i p i r i where ai is the productive land area of category i pi equilibrium factor and ri is the yield factor 1 equilibrium factor the equilibrium factor which characterizes the differences in the productive capacity of different land classes can convert the per capita occupancy of different productive land classes into equilibrium area by the following formula 2 p i p i p e i f i e i f i where pi is the equilibrium factor of productive land of class i p i is the average productivity of land i p is the productivity of all land ei is the total production of land of class i and fi is the productive area of land of class i 1 yield factor the yield factor is an expression of the difference in productivity between the same land category differences in natural and human factors lead to differences in productivity between land categories from year to year hence the need to convert yield factors as shown below 3 r i p i j p i e i j f i j e i f i where ri is the yield factor of productive land of category i p i j is the average productivity of land i in region j p i is the productivity of all land e i j is the total output of land of category i in region j f i j is the area of land of category i in region j ei is the total yield of land of category i and fi is the productive area of land of category i 2 4 2 plus model in this study the plus model is used to simulate and predict the spatial and temporal patterns of ecological carrying capacity in the study area compared with other related models the plus model can obtain higher simulation accuracy and more reasonable spatio temporal patterns the plus model is constructed by random forest algorithm rf and meta cellular automata ca the plus model consists of two modules 1 a transformed rule mining framework leas based on land expansion analysis strategy 2 a multi type stochastic patch seeding mechanism cars based on ca model 2 4 3 ecological carrying capacity driving mechanism detection geographic probe model 1 factor detection factor detection detects the extent to which a factor explains the spatial differentiation of variables the spatial distribution layer of wetland damage in guangxi was overlaid with each driving factor layer to detect the importance of driving factors the expression is as follows 4 p d h 1 1 n σ 2 h 1 l n h σ h 2 where pd h is the explanatory power of influence factor d on the ecological carrying capacity of study area h n is the number of areas l is the number of drivers and nh and σ h 2 are the sample size and variance of ecological carrying capacity of layer h respectively zhang et al 2021b 1 interaction detection interaction detection is the driving factor xn and xm will strengthen or weaken the impact of wetland damage is mainly shown in five types as shown in table 1 xn is x1 x2 x3 x10 xm is x1 x2 x3 x10 2 4 4 minimum cumulative resistance model the minimum cumulative resistance mcr model proposed by knappen was originally developed for the study of species dispersal and is essentially the cost or work done to overcome the resistance of each source site through different resistance landscapes which is calculated as follows 5 m c r f min i n i m d i j r i where mcr denotes the minimum cumulative resistance value of source expansion to a landscape f is an unknown negative function dij denotes the spatial distance from ecological source i to landscape j ri denotes the magnitude of resistance value of source i in the expansion process 2 4 5 ecological security network construction method 1 identification of ecological corridors the ecological corridors are minimum resistance pathways between two source sites and are an effective means of maintaining the flow of ecological elements in the region braaker et al 2014 the geometric center of the ecological source site is used as the ecological source point and an iterative model is constructed using the cost path module to extract the minimum resistance path from the source point to the remaining center point 2 extraction of ecological nodes the ecological strategic points are the highest resistance points on the ecological corridor generally located in the weakest part of the ecosystem where the ecological corridor is prone to disruption and should be protected in arcgis platform the hydrological analysis module is used to extract the ridge line of the minimum cumulative resistance surface and then the network analysis module is used to establish the ecological strategic points and ecological vulnerable points so as to generate the ecological security network structure of point line and surface 3 analysis of results 3 1 spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2040 the ecological carrying capacity for 1990 2040 was calculated by improving the ecological footprint model and plus model and the geometric breakpoint method of gis platform was used to classify the ecological carrying capacity per unit area into five levels low carrying capacity 0 1 462 middle low carrying capacity 1 463 2 776 middle carrying capacity 2 777 4 392 middle high carrying capacity 4 393 6 454 and high bearing capacity 6 455 8 176 fig 3 overall the ecological carrying capacity per unit area for the four periods from 1990 to 2040 ranges from 0 884 to 8 176 with an average value of 4 403 which is a medium high carrying capacity grade overall showing a trend of rising first and then falling from 1990 to 2020 the karst mountains mainly in baise and chongzuo cities show an overall decreasing trend mainly in the medium carrying capacity and the medium low carrying capacity the watershed and its surrounding areas are dominated by low carrying capacity with the upper reaches having a large impact on many rivers downstream the coastal zone area of the northern bay shows an overall small decreasing trend from 2020 to 2040 low carrying capacity is mainly distributed around waters such as reservoirs lakes etc baise city nanning city beihai city is more obvious the distribution area is smaller the middle low carrying capacity is concentrated around the construction land such as nanning city municipal district yulin city municipal district medium carrying capacity is scattered more distributed in baise city the middle high bearing capacity is the most widely distributed with wide distribution in baise city north central nanning city southern chongzuo city fangchenggang city and southern yulin city we have counted the changes in area by class which is more conducive to analysing the decline in ecological carrying capacity fig 4 the area of the low carrying capacity zone is slowly shrinking and it only accounts for 4 in the whole study area this grade is mainly distributed in the watershed which indicates that the watershed and coastal zone areas will be treated to some extent in the next 20 years the low middle carrying capacity is rising with a total rise of 2366 km2 from 1990 to 2040 the middle carrying capacity accounts for a small percentage of the study area and remains basically stable with insignificant changes the middle high carrying capacity changes more and also the ecological carrying capacity grade of the region is the most widely distributed from 1990 to 2040 is a decreasing trend a total of 4558km2 the ecological carrying capacity grade decreases mainly because of the rapid decrease of this grade area high carrying capacity declining trend year by year the change is more obvious there is a risk of continued degradation grade should increase the governance strengthen the means of governance improve the governance system do real green water and green mountains is the silver mountain concept in order to visualize the changes in ecological carrying capacity we used gis for spatial overlay analysis to obtain spatial distribution maps for 1990 2020 and 2020 2040 fig 5 in the graph a value of difference greater than 0 indicates an increase in ecological carrying capacity equal to 0 indicates no change in ecological carrying capacity and less than 0 indicates a decrease in ecological carrying capacity the results show that the ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2020 is dominated by the unchanged type the ecological carrying capacity increase type is the smallest mainly distributed around the municipal area of nanning the border area of chongzuo the coastal area of beihai and scattered in yulin the ecological carrying capacity situation in 2000 2040 is not optimistic the distribution of the unchanged type of ecological carrying capacity is relatively concentrated and contiguous mainly in the southwest of baise city and chongzuo city the ecological carrying capacity decrease with several obvious regional distributions the distribution is not so fragmented compared with the previous time period mainly in the northwest of baise city chongzuo city and fangchenggang city in order to get a more detailed picture of the ecological carrying capacity change the increase and decrease of ecological carrying capacity area of each municipality were counted fig 6 in general the ecological carrying capacity area of each city increased less than decreased from 1990 to 2020 with an overall decreasing trend and different differences in the increase and decrease the most serious decrease in ecological carrying capacity area is in nanning city followed by chongzuo city and qinzhou city which are also more serious and the lesser decrease is in beihai city and fangchenggang city with a decrease of 39 615 hm2 and 23 853 hm2 respectively the two cities with the largest increase in ecological carrying capacity in terms of area are baise and chongzuo and the two cities with the smallest increase are still beihai and fangchenggang the comparison of each city found that the ecological carrying capacity of nanning decrease seriously the decrease area is more and the difference with the increase area is also the most followed by qinzhou city and chongzuo city which has a certain relationship with urban expansion and local ecological restoration and management policies nanning as the capital of guangxi the necessary economic construction and urban expansion is inevitable but pay attention to ecological protection and resource utilization chongzuo city is the border area of the study area and karst rocky mountainous area the topography and politics and other factors are complex the restoration is more difficult the smallest interpolated value of increase and decrease is yulin city with only 941 hm2 in the above analysis it can also be seen that the ecological carrying capacity of yulin has changed relatively steadily over the years maintaining a good local ecological environment while fully integrating the region into the construction of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area 3 2 analysis of ecological carrying capacity driving mechanism the factor detector reveals the influence of each factor on ecological carrying capacity 11 driving factors acting individually have certain influence on the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity and the influence of each factor on ecological carrying capacity is extracted by calculating the pd h values of driving factors the ranking of each driving factor on the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity is slope average annual temperature gdp population density vegetation cover distance from railroad average annual precipitation distance to road distance to township distance to county slope direction it indicates that slope average annual temperature gdp and population density are the main driving factors affecting the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity in the study area the topography of the area is complex mostly mountainous and hilly with high slope which is not conducive to the formation of ecosystems such as arable land and construction land suitable temperature is important for the growth of arable land and forests the factor interaction detector responds to the explanatory power of the two interactions of the drivers on the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity and analyzes whether they are enhanced weakened or independent of each other the interrelationship between the drivers and the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity is detected using this detector the results of the factor interaction detection show that the average annual temperature x1 average annual precipitation x2 population density x3 gdp x4 distance from road x8 and distance from railroad x9 are bilinearly enhanced with all the natural factors slope x5 is nonlinearly enhanced with slope direction x6 and vegetation cover x7 distance from township x11 in which the slope factor has a stronger effect when superimposed with each natural factor two by two especially the strongest interaction with the temperature factor with an explanatory power of more than 40 mainly because the region is more mountainous and has a large altitude drop other factors cannot avoid being influenced by slope and the explanatory power is also general when slope direction is superimposed with other factors therefore combining the three detectors analysis slope and temperature are the most dominant driving factors 3 3 ecological security pattern construction by assessing the ecological carrying capacity of the region from 1990 to 2040 the ecological carrying capacity calculation results of the six years were standardized and processed and the area of high carrying capacity land was selected as a priority conservation area we combined all the priority protected areas with the main lakes rivers and woodland patches in the catchment to obtain a final ecological source area covering approximately 43 of the total area fig 7 on the whole the ecological source sites account for an average overall area and are more concentrated in distribution ecological source sites are concentrated in the northwestern southwestern and southeastern parts of the region with the highest concentration of woodlands complex terrain dense river networks more coastal oases and higher ecological quality while the central flat areas and the eastern basin and coastal zone areas are affected by climate and topography with less ecological source site distribution ecological source sites are the basis for source site expansion and the selection of resistance factors is the condition for ecological source site expansion in general the more complex the topography the denser the vegetation cover the richer the soil organic matter content the closer to the water system and the higher the level of ecological service value the more favorable the ecological land expansion based on the consideration of the regional ecological environment eight resistance factors with a high degree of relevance to the expansion of ecological land were finally selected to construct the index system of resistance to the expansion of ecological source land according to the natural property or natural fracture method the subjective and objective assignment method is used to assign values to each resistance factor into five levels from the largest to the smallest 5 4 3 2 1 the assignment layer of each resistance factor is shown in table 2 we used a raster calculator to calculate the minimum cumulative resistance in conjunction with the extended resistance dataset for ecological source sites to obtain the minimum cumulative resistance surface fig 8 in general the minimum resistance shows a transition trend from southwest to southeast from low to high and the resistance areas are mainly distributed in the central and southern parts of the region with nanning chongzuo and beihai being the most widely distributed and baise mountainous forest resistance being smaller combined with the resistance factors the overall minimum resistance surface results for the region are very similar to those of ecosystem service values and ndvi which are not only related to the weight assignment but also to ecological restoration projects and treatment policies based on the minimum cumulative resistance surface we have used the natural breakpoint method to divide the area into hierarchical ecological safety pattern zones namely ecological conservation zone optimized buffer zone ecological transition zone and ecological protection zone fig 9 according to the statistical results the most widely distributed area in the study area is the ecological conservation zone accounting for 36 mainly in the western karst forest area and around yulin city we should strengthen ecological control adhere to the appropriate forest the appropriate grass is grass the ecological buffer zone and ecological transition zone account for 39 and 21 respectively which are mainly distributed in the surrounding areas of ecological conservation areas and are basically the intermediate transition zone between mountainous areas and cities and should adhere to the management method of grass livestock balance to prevent stone desertification in mountainous areas the ecological land in the ecological prevention and control area accounts for 4 mainly distributed in the chongzuo karst area urban center and beibu gulf area which should be delineated as a no build and restricted area strengthen the construction of ecological protection forest system control the unreasonable development and utilization of the coastal zone limit the scale of construction and development and maintain the integrity and continuity of ecological patches in order to make the ecological safety pattern zoning more scientific and reasonable we used the remote sensing data of land use in ri to extract the three living sites and overlaid them with the minimum cumulative resistance surface to finally obtain the ecological security pattern zoning fig 10 among them production land is the operational place for production and supply mainly paddy land dry land and industrial land living land refers to the area that carries and guarantees the function of human settlement mainly urban land and rural settlement land ecological land is the area that regulates and maintains ecological functions and provides ecological services mainly wetlands woodlands and waters the ecological land in the ecological conservation area is the core ecological patch in the region accounting for 16 33 of the study area it is mainly distributed in the karst mountains in southwest guizhou 100 000 mountains in fangchenggang as well as in the mashan county of nanning and the northern part of yulin and has a huge amount of ecological service value which should be permanently protected by establishing conservation areas according to local conditions in order to be used forever the production land in the ecological conservation area and the living land in the ecological conservation area are mainly distributed in the annex of the ecological land in the ecological conservation area for the ecological land in the ecological conservation area has a great impact on the surrounding environment so the area should establish a karst ecological corridor and delineate a reasonable production and living boundary to prevent the ecological crisis caused by the blind expansion of land the ecological buffer zone is close to the river and there is a large area of cultivated land along the river so trees should be planted at the junction of the river and the cultivated land to prevent soil erosion the watershed water resources should be used reasonably for irrigation the use of organic fertilizer should be promoted gradually to decrease the pollution and eutrophication of the river and the ecological corridor of the river should be established to increase the connectivity of the landscape the ecological transition zone trisected land is distributed around the urban area accounting for 35 24 of the study area the living land in some ecological transition zones wants to connect with the ecological land in the ecological conservation zone which poses a great threat to the ecological security of the study area such as the northeastern part of nanning city and the central part of baise city etc isolation zones should be set up to guard the ecological security boundary the ecological prevention and control area of the three living sites are mainly distributed in urban areas and coastal zone areas with less surface vegetation and poorer habitat quality protective forests should be planted in the area to increase urban greening and gradually restore surface vegetation with reasonable planning 3 4 ecological security network construction and optimization planning the ecological security network is an integrated development layout with each ecological source site as the core ecological strategic points as clues and various corridors as the backbone there are 28 ecological corridors in 17 ecological patches in the study area with a total length of 2236 26 km 17 ecological corridors are identified with a length of 1498 75 km and 11 karst ecological corridors with a length of 737 51 km influenced by the spatial distribution and resource endowment of each ecological source site the distribution of ecological corridors is tortuous and winding bypassing many production and living sites mainly in the central and eastern parts in view of the low ecological carrying capacity in order to avoid excessive human interference activities the corridors linking the karst reserves with other source areas are stripped out from the ecological corridors as karst ecological corridors at the same time in order to improve the connectivity between ecological sources other important corridors including road and river corridors are introduced to build an ecological security network with integrated points and lines fig 11 description of the construction of three types of important corridors 1 ecological corridors exist in the form of primary planting corridors the ecological corridors identified in this study connect important ecological sources and jointly maintain regional ecological security ecological conservation needs to be strengthened along the ecological corridors if it needs to cross construction land vegetation corridors can be built around the city if it needs to cross cultivated land crop production can be guaranteed in the form of farmland protection forests it can be used as a guide for ecological control planning of cities and counties districts to play the function of local biological landscape connectivity 2 karst corridors exist in the form of soil fixing vegetation belts with karst ecological source points and ecological fragile points integrating stone desertification prevention and breeding with ecological landscape functions to jointly create karst ecological corridors 3 river corridor existing in the form of rivers the river corridor mainly consists of rivers such as the left and right river yu river nanliu river qin river and beilun river in the natural landscape area riparian vegetation can regulate the transport of water and materials from the surrounding land to the river and the vegetation zone should be scientifically arranged along the river in the non natural landscape area the over exploitation of the river by production and life should be strictly limited and the river corridor break point should be minimized during the construction and maintenance process and the construction of river banks on both sides should be strengthened to enhance the habitat adaptation of the watershed the longer the ecological corridor is the greater the possibility of being interrupted by the outside world the smaller the area and more dispersed the distribution of ecological source sites the weaker the diffusion effect of ecological source sites making the ecological corridor less stable by extracting the intersection of the ridge line and the ecological corridor a total of 20 eco strategic points are identified mainly distributed in the center of the ecological corridor with long distances and near the ecological source sites the ecological source sites and eco strategic points together form the ecological green heart and in the areas where they are densely distributed the local ecological environment can be improved through the construction of ecological stations and other measures to strengthen the ecological benefits of the ecological source sites and the corridor finally the ecological conservation zone and ecological control zone 6 types in the ecological security pattern were extracted as the ecological spatial planning matrix and the ecological corridors and ecological source points were superimposed to propose the optimal planning of two belts three screens four zones and multiple centers fig 12 among them the two belts refer to the karst ecological protection belt linking the karsts in northwest guizhou and the 100 000 mountains and the beibu gulf watershed bay ecological landscape belt with the beibu gulf inlet rivers as the main body the karst ecological protection belt serves as a key link to the karst ecological sources in the region and the beibu gulf watershed bay ecological landscape belt also serves as an important clue to connect the watershed with the coastal zone ecological protection the three screens refers to the natural ecological barrier formed by the karst forest the 100 000 mountain reserve and the xijiang river basin which together build the great green wall of the southern border the four areas refers to the mangrove restoration protection zone the west river water connotation area stone desertification prevention and conservation area and the ecological protection zone of rivers entering the sea mangrove restoration protection zone mainly includes yingluo port tieshan port lianzhou bay dafengjiang maowei sea east and west bay pearl bay and other bays and estuaries are the main distribution areas of mangroves west river water containment zone is mainly the water connotation function of the left and right river basin do a good job of integrated management of soil and water conservation stone desertification prevention and conservation zone aims to restore regional vegetation management control of human activities into the sea river ecological protection zone to the ecological protection zone is mainly composed of many rivers entering the sea to prevent land based pollution and protect biodiversity multi center refers to a number of ecological green centers composed of ecological source points and ecological strategic points 4 discussions 4 1 inspiration from the research content in this study a combination of rs gis technology and the ecological footprint method is used to evaluate the ecological carrying capacity however it is worth considering that the different ecological functions of patches at different scales and the different administrative division of governments at different levels lead to hierarchical nature in spatial governance and control which indicates that how to effectively apply the evaluation results of ecological carrying capacity at small patch scale to provide support for ecological remediation and restoration of governments at all levels is an urgent issue to be explored in depth the high carrying capacity is surrounded by medium and high carrying capacity the ecosystem structure is more perfect there are slight ecological anomalies the service function is good the ecological pressure is less and the sensitivity to all kinds of disturbances is weak in light of the current high level of global human activity and the intensification of ecological problems and climate change it is necessary to refer to the international situation to guide local development in terms of ecological security in the region assessed against the sdg15 2 target of by 2020 promote sustainable management of all types of forests halt deforestation restore degraded forests and significantly increase global afforestation and reforestation the region has not achieved this target the main reason is that human beings encroach on forest land to develop it for living and production and the ecosystem management methods and experience are insufficient lu et al 2022 according to the first sdg report submitted in 2019 if the un member states continue to follow the current development model many sdgs will not be achieved by 2020 and 2030 and such conclusions are only applicable to this region the ecological spatial planning proposal of two belts three screens four zones and multiple centers mentioned in this study is laid out under the principle of ecological orientation and its feasibility will be more reliable if it can be integrated with the spatial suitability assessment of land development to create a one map of national land resources 4 2 thinking about the application of the model the main function of ecological corridors is to connect different ecological source sites to maintain ecological process connectivity dilts et al 2016 we have identified the extent of the ecological corridor by the minimum cumulative resistance if the cumulative resistance threshold is continuously adjusted to delineate the spatial extent of ecological corridors the spatial pattern of ecological corridors may lead to new discoveries by extracting ecological corridors and ecological nodes which are often the cause of ecological network collapse is the key to solve ecological problems and ensure regional ecological security omeret al 2021 future research plans to couple the least resistance model and maxent model for ensuring the accuracy of ecological corridor ecological node extraction we have applied the ecological footprint model and the plus model to explore the spatial distribution of past and future ecological carrying capacity very well the plus model also suffers from limitations in the accuracy of the spatial allocation algorithm comparison of the results of our simulations with actual observations in 2020 reveals that the plus model is unable to predict new patches the allocation model is applied statically and the drivers are all selected from historical data if the environment in the ecological carrying capacity changes there are potential changes that cannot be described and future ecological carrying capacity simulations would benefit from adding dynamic environmental variables to the model to reduce errors due to new patches we will continue to explore this further in the future incorporating future urban ecological planning data and future climate data with the intention of improving the accuracy of the simulations 4 3 suggestions for future ecological protection and management guangxi plays an important role in china s belt and road construction and ecological security in 2019 the national master plan for major projects for the protection and restoration of important ecosystems was launched as a major national strategy a key step of which is to ensure ecological security build an ecological security barrier and improve carrying capacity through the integrated management and protection of the southern hills and coastal zone in addition with the accelerated urbanization throughout china the expansion of construction land has led to a gradual degradation of ecological carrying capacity especially for forest land and arable land yuan et al 2020 however forested and cultivated land can make significant contributions to the energy flow and material cycle of cities peng et al 2018 the results show that about 25 of ecological corridors 14 of ecological sources and most of the pinch points are dominated by woodlands and croplands therefore ecologically fragile points ecological strategic points and ecological corridor areas should be considered as priority areas for ecological protection to achieve sustainable development in the region it is necessary to deal with the relationship between ecological environment and social economy adhere to the concept of green water and green mountains are golden mountains improve the ecological security mechanism and invest in ecological construction vigorously develop ecological industries and focus on the development of landmark products to continue to close the mountainous areas of karst manage soil erosion control human activities and other policies should be highly implemented to improve the ecological environment to cope with ecological risks control the upper reaches of the watershed and land based pollution increase pollution control prevent land based pollution into the sea reasonable and moderate development of the coastal areas of the beibu gulf the regional environment is complex the city county district joint prevention and control integrated management and prevention to deal with multiple risks sources and improve ecological carrying capacity 4 4 limitations the projections in our study are only based on natural development scenarios and there is no discussion of multi scenario simulation projections where future developments are highly uncertain and should require exploration of more aspects however the discussion of however many scenarios is not a precise prediction of the future but rather an attempt to explore possible future directions in an appropriate way and to provide decision makers with response options in terms of the selection of resistance factors as there is no clear indicator system at home and abroad for researchers to refer to there will still be a certain amount of subjectivity after combining various forms of selection and it does not fully represent the ecological carrying capacity of the study area using a more precise and reasonable method to verify the scientific and systematic nature of the selection of factors is a difficult part of the study 5 conclusions 1 the average value of ecological carrying capacity per unit area from 1990 to 2040 is 4 403 which is a medium high carrying capacity grade as a whole showing a trend of rising and then falling the two time periods from 1990 to 2040 are dominated by the type of unchanging ecological carrying capacity the increase of ecological carrying capacity area of each city is smaller than the decrease and the overall trend is decreasing nanning qinzhou and chongzuo are the most severely damaged slope and temperature are the main driving factors 2 a total of 17 ecological source patches were identified in the study area accounting for 36 of the total area of the study area and the ecological source areas accounted for the overall area in general with a more concentrated distribution 3 we have established an integrated ecological security network structure of points lines and surfaces the ecological conservation zone and the ecological control zone are used as the substrate for ecological spatial planning and important corridors and ecological green centres are overlaid to propose an ecological optimization plan of two belts three screens four zones and multiple centres

data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction since the turn of the century the rapid development of china s technology and economy has resulted in the sloppy use of national land resources and ecological damage which has led to a decrease in the carrying capacity of ecosystems and a prominent conflict between human and land kowe et al 2020 china is actively promoting the construction of ecological civilization practicing the concept of green water and green mountains are golden mountains and creating a new situation of beautiful china which puts forward higher requirements for effective response to ecological environment degradation he et al 2019 the ecosystem have a profound impact on improving the environment climate change and ecosystem function but development in many areas has exceeded the ecological carrying capacity of the area and development patterns are unsustainable posing a threat to ecological security ecological carrying capacity ecc is the key to evaluating sustainable development capacity and is an important analytical tool to determine ecological security models for human and ecosocial system development guo et al 2017 lu et al 2020 the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs have repeatedly reported on ecosystem restoration calling for human restoration and protection of nature and a dynamic balance between human needs and the carrying capacity of the natural environment which has become an international consensus qiu et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to construct an ecological security pattern based on ecological carrying capacity assessment which is of great significance for ecosystem protection and restoration and integrated co governance ecological carrying capacity was first defined as the maximum size at which organisms could survive in a given environment responding to ecological supply capacity in 1987 the united nations published our common future which articulated sustainable development which laid a solid foundation for subsequent ecological carrying capacity studies xiong et al 2013 china started around the 1990s and is still in a phase of rapid development in terms of research content tourism ecological carrying capacity agriculture forestry and fishery ecological carrying capacity are mostly studied folke et al 1997 galli et al 2015 guangxi has also made some research results on ecological carrying capacity and has made great progress in water resources karst mountains and oceans in recent years but it is mostly a single aspect of research and the comprehensive exploration of complex ecosystems needs to be strengthened in terms of research methods ecological footprint method three dimensional ecological footprint model and life cycle evaluation method are common zhou 2019 yang et al 2020 among which the ecological footprint method is the most common method used by experts and scholars to study ecological carrying capacity which is mature operable and highly credible but in the calculation of important parameters mostly refer to global hectares or national hectares are used for the calculation of important parameters and problems such as large scale variability and poor targeting are found in the study resulting in a large error between the final calculation results and the actual situation this study adopts provincial hectares instead of the traditional global national hectares to improve the ecological footprint model with a view to quantifying and spatially expressing the ecological carrying capacity of the region and realizing the spatial pattern analysis of the regional ecological carrying capacity in terms of research regions and scales global national large scale urban clusters watersheds counties etc zhang et al 2022 the effectiveness and variability of statistical data updates make it insufficient in revealing the spatial pattern of ecological carrying capacity and relatively few studies are conducted at the patch scale which leads to the phenomenon of incomplete analysis of the problem the international institute for applied systems analysis iiasa has proposed that ecological security is the fundamental right to life health and well being of human beings it is a state in which all aspects of essential livelihood security resources and the ability to adapt to environmental change are not compromised xiao et al 2002 this coincides with the un sustainable development goals sdgs and the strategy to build a beautiful china as a composite content ecological security emphasizes ecological balance and mutual coordination of environmental elements which is characterized by comprehensive diversified regional and dynamic nature peng et al 2016 ecological security pattern is a spatial pattern composed of various landscape elements spatial locations and their interconnections the construction of ecological security pattern is a specific measure taken to achieve the ecological security goal and it needs to set the development goals with regional characteristics protect regional biodiversity maintain ecological balance and maintain the integrity of ecosystem structure and processes otherwise the ecosystem foundation will be damaged so it is necessary to control and improve regional ecological and environmental problems and improve regional ecological carrying capacity chen et al 2018 ecological security pattern studies often take the perspective of ecosystem service value and land use as the entry point and take urban clusters and ecologically fragile areas as the study area and common methods include minimum cumulative resistance surface model neural network model etc mostly based on mathematical statistics or rs and gis technology to construct ecological security patterns to guide regional ecological planning zhang et al 2019 yang et al 2017 ecological source site identification is a crucial first step in the construction of ecological security patterns traditional ecological source identification is usually achieved by directly selecting nature reserves and historical sites vergnes et al 2013 mostly considering natural ecological functions and ignoring the possibility of human use of land and thus affecting ecological carrying capacity which may cause substantial bias in ecological source identification and thus affect the identification of ecological security patterns ecological carrying capacity assessment is an integral part of the spatial development pattern and optimization of the national territory lu et al 2020 at present the scientific and rational use and development of land space is severe and the traditional ecological security evaluation can no longer provide more effective decision support and the trend of ecological security pattern construction and ecological security network establishment conversion has been presented based on the law of historical development leading to poor precision in identifying ecological source sites and inaccurate extraction of ecological corridors it cannot provide a good basis for building an integrated ecological safety network of points lines and surfaces nor can it meet the scientific regulation of decision makers so the idea of history present future have proposed for ecological security optimization planning the idea of constructing ecological security pattern by combining ecological security zoning and three land use types is rarely reported and the key ecological pinch point extraction is also the direction of the key breakthrough of ecological security network research for the realization of national spatial management and development of the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf the scientific use of ecological carrying capacity evaluation results to guide optimal planning of regional ecological security patterns will be key feng et al 2021 the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf is an integrated transition zone spanning mountains rivers and seas with the fragility of karst mountains the complexity of multiple watersheds and the interaction of coastal zones and integrated diverse and complex ecosystems zhang et al 2021a the region is characterized by large differences in economic development insufficient attention to ecological protection and environmental management measures complex and diverse terrain and geology and frequent natural disasters such as floods droughts and typhoons which make ecological and environmental management more difficult and decrease ecological carrying capacity making it difficult to meet the demand for coordinated and integrated development of coastal riverine and border regions that china wants in the new era of china the region is a major international gateway towards asean and a new strategic pivot point for the open development of the southwest central and southern regions its location on the south western frontier has been pushed to the forefront of china s opening up to the outside world and it has been given a rare and historic opportunity the construction of ecological security pattern and ecological security network in the region and the proposed spatial planning for ecological security optimization is an important scientific issue to ensure the environmental service program therefore how to scientifically protect and optimally regulate complex ecosystems to encourage ecologically socially safe and sustainable development is an important element that cannot be circumvented 2 materials and methods 2 1 research content 1 we used the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf as our study area based on multi source data and the plus model to predict spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capacity over the next 20 years the spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2040 and the main driving factors are analysed 2 we identified ecological source sites and selected nine resistance factors to construct ecological resistance surfaces based on the 50 year ecological carrying capacity assessment results we constructed ecological security patterns for site types and zoned ecological security based on the minimum cumulative resistance mcr model 3 based on the gis spatial analysis platform we extracted ecological corridors constructed an integrated points lines and surfaces ecological security network and carried out ecological security optimization planning 2 2 study area the southwest guangxi karst beibu gulf is located in the southwest of guangxi e104 28 109 56 n20 26 25 07 consisting of southwest guangxi karst district and guangxi beibu gulf economic zone containing 7 cities and 55 counties with a total area of 108 365 41 km2 fig 2 the overall topography of the region gradually decrease from northwest to southeast with a top down slope along the foothills of the yunnan guizhou plateau to the coastal zone of beibu gulf temperatures range from 2 8 to 40 4 c with an average temperature of 22 5 c sometimes extreme weather can occur precipitation is between 1745 6 3111 9 mm with abundant rainfall and abundant water resources the karst mountains with serious stone desertification poor soil prone to drought not easy to cultivate and serious soil erosion the coastal areas of the northern bay densely populated by humans with unreasonable development of resources such as sea enclosures and scenic development in coastal areas and aquaculture destroying marine resources from 1990 to 2020 forest resources wetland resources and grassland resources have declined across the region by the end of 2020 the total population of the region s 55 counties will have reached 26 433 100 people and the gross domestic product per capita will reach 1212 783 million yuan 2 3 data source and data preprocessing digital elevation model dem data were obtained from the national center for basic geographic information http www

methods 2 4 1 ecological carrying capacity index improved ecological footprint model ecological footprint models are widely used in ecological carrying capacity research and have the advantages of intuition simple operation and high feasibility at present the calculation of ecological footprint in china is unified in national and global hectares shao et al 2012 and there is no unified calculation method based on provincial hectares which will affect the reliability and relevance of the results therefore in this study the ecological footprint is calculated using provincial hectares as the accounting unit and the important parameters are modified locally since this study only calculates the ecological carrying capacity index it does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the ecological carrying capacity the ecological carrying capacity index formula is as follows 1 q i 1 n a i p i r i where ai is the productive land area of category i pi equilibrium factor and ri is the yield factor 1 equilibrium factor the equilibrium factor which characterizes the differences in the productive capacity of different land classes can convert the per capita occupancy of different productive land classes into equilibrium area by the following formula 2 p i p i p e i f i e i f i where pi is the equilibrium factor of productive land of class i p i is the average productivity of land i p is the productivity of all land ei is the total production of land of class i and fi is the productive area of land of class i 1 yield factor the yield factor is an expression of the difference in productivity between the same land category differences in natural and human factors lead to differences in productivity between land categories from year to year hence the need to convert yield factors as shown below 3 r i p i j p i e i j f i j e i f i where ri is the yield factor of productive land of category i p i j is the average productivity of land i in region j p i is the productivity of all land e i j is the total output of land of category i in region j f i j is the area of land of category i in region j ei is the total yield of land of category i and fi is the productive area of land of category i 2 4 2 plus model in this study the plus model is used to simulate and predict the spatial and temporal patterns of ecological carrying capacity in the study area compared with other related models the plus model can obtain higher simulation accuracy and more reasonable spatio temporal patterns the plus model is constructed by random forest algorithm rf and meta cellular automata ca the plus model consists of two modules 1 a transformed rule mining framework leas based on land expansion analysis strategy 2 a multi type stochastic patch seeding mechanism cars based on ca model 2 4 3 ecological carrying capacity driving mechanism detection geographic probe model 1 factor detection factor detection detects the extent to which a factor explains the spatial differentiation of variables the spatial distribution layer of wetland damage in guangxi was overlaid with each driving factor layer to detect the importance of driving factors the expression is as follows 4 p d h 1 1 n σ 2 h 1 l n h σ h 2 where pd h is the explanatory power of influence factor d on the ecological carrying capacity of study area h n is the number of areas l is the number of drivers and nh and σ h 2 are the sample size and variance of ecological carrying capacity of layer h respectively zhang et al 2021b 1 interaction detection interaction detection is the driving factor xn and xm will strengthen or weaken the impact of wetland damage is mainly shown in five types as shown in table 1 xn is x1 x2 x3 x10 xm is x1 x2 x3 x10 2 4 4 minimum cumulative resistance model the minimum cumulative resistance mcr model proposed by knappen was originally developed for the study of species dispersal and is essentially the cost or work done to overcome the resistance of each source site through different resistance landscapes which is calculated as follows 5 m c r f min i n i m d i j r i where mcr denotes the minimum cumulative resistance value of source expansion to a landscape f is an unknown negative function dij denotes the spatial distance from ecological source i to landscape j ri denotes the magnitude of resistance value of source i in the expansion process 2 4 5 ecological security network construction method 1 identification of ecological corridors the ecological corridors are minimum resistance pathways between two source sites and are an effective means of maintaining the flow of ecological elements in the region braaker et al 2014 the geometric center of the ecological source site is used as the ecological source point and an iterative model is constructed using the cost path module to extract the minimum resistance path from the source point to the remaining center point 2 extraction of ecological nodes the ecological strategic points are the highest resistance points on the ecological corridor generally located in the weakest part of the ecosystem where the ecological corridor is prone to disruption and should be protected in arcgis platform the hydrological analysis module is used to extract the ridge line of the minimum cumulative resistance surface and then the network analysis module is used to establish the ecological strategic points and ecological vulnerable points so as to generate the ecological security network structure of point line and surface 3 analysis of results 3 1 spatial and temporal changes in ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2040 the ecological carrying capacity for 1990 2040 was calculated by improving the ecological footprint model and plus model and the geometric breakpoint method of gis platform was used to classify the ecological carrying capacity per unit area into five levels low carrying capacity 0 1 462 middle low carrying capacity 1 463 2 776 middle carrying capacity 2 777 4 392 middle high carrying capacity 4 393 6 454 and high bearing capacity 6 455 8 176 fig 3 overall the ecological carrying capacity per unit area for the four periods from 1990 to 2040 ranges from 0 884 to 8 176 with an average value of 4 403 which is a medium high carrying capacity grade overall showing a trend of rising first and then falling from 1990 to 2020 the karst mountains mainly in baise and chongzuo cities show an overall decreasing trend mainly in the medium carrying capacity and the medium low carrying capacity the watershed and its surrounding areas are dominated by low carrying capacity with the upper reaches having a large impact on many rivers downstream the coastal zone area of the northern bay shows an overall small decreasing trend from 2020 to 2040 low carrying capacity is mainly distributed around waters such as reservoirs lakes etc baise city nanning city beihai city is more obvious the distribution area is smaller the middle low carrying capacity is concentrated around the construction land such as nanning city municipal district yulin city municipal district medium carrying capacity is scattered more distributed in baise city the middle high bearing capacity is the most widely distributed with wide distribution in baise city north central nanning city southern chongzuo city fangchenggang city and southern yulin city we have counted the changes in area by class which is more conducive to analysing the decline in ecological carrying capacity fig 4 the area of the low carrying capacity zone is slowly shrinking and it only accounts for 4 in the whole study area this grade is mainly distributed in the watershed which indicates that the watershed and coastal zone areas will be treated to some extent in the next 20 years the low middle carrying capacity is rising with a total rise of 2366 km2 from 1990 to 2040 the middle carrying capacity accounts for a small percentage of the study area and remains basically stable with insignificant changes the middle high carrying capacity changes more and also the ecological carrying capacity grade of the region is the most widely distributed from 1990 to 2040 is a decreasing trend a total of 4558km2 the ecological carrying capacity grade decreases mainly because of the rapid decrease of this grade area high carrying capacity declining trend year by year the change is more obvious there is a risk of continued degradation grade should increase the governance strengthen the means of governance improve the governance system do real green water and green mountains is the silver mountain concept in order to visualize the changes in ecological carrying capacity we used gis for spatial overlay analysis to obtain spatial distribution maps for 1990 2020 and 2020 2040 fig 5 in the graph a value of difference greater than 0 indicates an increase in ecological carrying capacity equal to 0 indicates no change in ecological carrying capacity and less than 0 indicates a decrease in ecological carrying capacity the results show that the ecological carrying capacity from 1990 to 2020 is dominated by the unchanged type the ecological carrying capacity increase type is the smallest mainly distributed around the municipal area of nanning the border area of chongzuo the coastal area of beihai and scattered in yulin the ecological carrying capacity situation in 2000 2040 is not optimistic the distribution of the unchanged type of ecological carrying capacity is relatively concentrated and contiguous mainly in the southwest of baise city and chongzuo city the ecological carrying capacity decrease with several obvious regional distributions the distribution is not so fragmented compared with the previous time period mainly in the northwest of baise city chongzuo city and fangchenggang city in order to get a more detailed picture of the ecological carrying capacity change the increase and decrease of ecological carrying capacity area of each municipality were counted fig 6 in general the ecological carrying capacity area of each city increased less than decreased from 1990 to 2020 with an overall decreasing trend and different differences in the increase and decrease the most serious decrease in ecological carrying capacity area is in nanning city followed by chongzuo city and qinzhou city which are also more serious and the lesser decrease is in beihai city and fangchenggang city with a decrease of 39 615 hm2 and 23 853 hm2 respectively the two cities with the largest increase in ecological carrying capacity in terms of area are baise and chongzuo and the two cities with the smallest increase are still beihai and fangchenggang the comparison of each city found that the ecological carrying capacity of nanning decrease seriously the decrease area is more and the difference with the increase area is also the most followed by qinzhou city and chongzuo city which has a certain relationship with urban expansion and local ecological restoration and management policies nanning as the capital of guangxi the necessary economic construction and urban expansion is inevitable but pay attention to ecological protection and resource utilization chongzuo city is the border area of the study area and karst rocky mountainous area the topography and politics and other factors are complex the restoration is more difficult the smallest interpolated value of increase and decrease is yulin city with only 941 hm2 in the above analysis it can also be seen that the ecological carrying capacity of yulin has changed relatively steadily over the years maintaining a good local ecological environment while fully integrating the region into the construction of the guangdong hong kong macao greater bay area 3 2 analysis of ecological carrying capacity driving mechanism the factor detector reveals the influence of each factor on ecological carrying capacity 11 driving factors acting individually have certain influence on the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity and the influence of each factor on ecological carrying capacity is extracted by calculating the pd h values of driving factors the ranking of each driving factor on the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity is slope average annual temperature gdp population density vegetation cover distance from railroad average annual precipitation distance to road distance to township distance to county slope direction it indicates that slope average annual temperature gdp and population density are the main driving factors affecting the heterogeneity of spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity in the study area the topography of the area is complex mostly mountainous and hilly with high slope which is not conducive to the formation of ecosystems such as arable land and construction land suitable temperature is important for the growth of arable land and forests the factor interaction detector responds to the explanatory power of the two interactions of the drivers on the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity and analyzes whether they are enhanced weakened or independent of each other the interrelationship between the drivers and the spatial distribution of ecological carrying capacity is detected using this detector the results of the factor interaction detection show that the average annual temperature x1 average annual precipitation x2 population density x3 gdp x4 distance from road x8 and distance from railroad x9 are bilinearly enhanced with all the natural factors slope x5 is nonlinearly enhanced with slope direction x6 and vegetation cover x7 distance from township x11 in which the slope factor has a stronger effect when superimposed with each natural factor two by two especially the strongest interaction with the temperature factor with an explanatory power of more than 40 mainly because the region is more mountainous and has a large altitude drop other factors cannot avoid being influenced by slope and the explanatory power is also general when slope direction is superimposed with other factors therefore combining the three detectors analysis slope and temperature are the most dominant driving factors 3 3 ecological security pattern construction by assessing the ecological carrying capacity of the region from 1990 to 2040 the ecological carrying capacity calculation results of the six years were standardized and processed and the area of high carrying capacity land was selected as a priority conservation area we combined all the priority protected areas with the main lakes rivers and woodland patches in the catchment to obtain a final ecological source area covering approximately 43 of the total area fig 7 on the whole the ecological source sites account for an average overall area and are more concentrated in distribution ecological source sites are concentrated in the northwestern southwestern and southeastern parts of the region with the highest concentration of woodlands complex terrain dense river networks more coastal oases and higher ecological quality while the central flat areas and the eastern basin and coastal zone areas are affected by climate and topography with less ecological source site distribution ecological source sites are the basis for source site expansion and the selection of resistance factors is the condition for ecological source site expansion in general the more complex the topography the denser the vegetation cover the richer the soil organic matter content the closer to the water system and the higher the level of ecological service value the more favorable the ecological land expansion based on the consideration of the regional ecological environment eight resistance factors with a high degree of relevance to the expansion of ecological land were finally selected to construct the index system of resistance to the expansion of ecological source land according to the natural property or natural fracture method the subjective and objective assignment method is used to assign values to each resistance factor into five levels from the largest to the smallest 5 4 3 2 1 the assignment layer of each resistance factor is shown in table 2 we used a raster calculator to calculate the minimum cumulative resistance in conjunction with the extended resistance dataset for ecological source sites to obtain the minimum cumulative resistance surface fig 8 in general the minimum resistance shows a transition trend from southwest to southeast from low to high and the resistance areas are mainly distributed in the central and southern parts of the region with nanning chongzuo and beihai being the most widely distributed and baise mountainous forest resistance being smaller combined with the resistance factors the overall minimum resistance surface results for the region are very similar to those of ecosystem service values and ndvi which are not only related to the weight assignment but also to ecological restoration projects and treatment policies based on the minimum cumulative resistance surface we have used the natural breakpoint method to divide the area into hierarchical ecological safety pattern zones namely ecological conservation zone optimized buffer zone ecological transition zone and ecological protection zone fig 9 according to the statistical results the most widely distributed area in the study area is the ecological conservation zone accounting for 36 mainly in the western karst forest area and around yulin city we should strengthen ecological control adhere to the appropriate forest the appropriate grass is grass the ecological buffer zone and ecological transition zone account for 39 and 21 respectively which are mainly distributed in the surrounding areas of ecological conservation areas and are basically the intermediate transition zone between mountainous areas and cities and should adhere to the management method of grass livestock balance to prevent stone desertification in mountainous areas the ecological land in the ecological prevention and control area accounts for 4 mainly distributed in the chongzuo karst area urban center and beibu gulf area which should be delineated as a no build and restricted area strengthen the construction of ecological protection forest system control the unreasonable development and utilization of the coastal zone limit the scale of construction and development and maintain the integrity and continuity of ecological patches in order to make the ecological safety pattern zoning more scientific and reasonable we used the remote sensing data of land use in ri to extract the three living sites and overlaid them with the minimum cumulative resistance surface to finally obtain the ecological security pattern zoning fig 10 among them production land is the operational place for production and supply mainly paddy land dry land and industrial land living land refers to the area that carries and guarantees the function of human settlement mainly urban land and rural settlement land ecological land is the area that regulates and maintains ecological functions and provides ecological services mainly wetlands woodlands and waters the ecological land in the ecological conservation area is the core ecological patch in the region accounting for 16 33 of the study area it is mainly distributed in the karst mountains in southwest guizhou 100 000 mountains in fangchenggang as well as in the mashan county of nanning and the northern part of yulin and has a huge amount of ecological service value which should be permanently protected by establishing conservation areas according to local conditions in order to be used forever the production land in the ecological conservation area and the living land in the ecological conservation area are mainly distributed in the annex of the ecological land in the ecological conservation area for the ecological land in the ecological conservation area has a great impact on the surrounding environment so the area should establish a karst ecological corridor and delineate a reasonable production and living boundary to prevent the ecological crisis caused by the blind expansion of land the ecological buffer zone is close to the river and there is a large area of cultivated land along the river so trees should be planted at the junction of the river and the cultivated land to prevent soil erosion the watershed water resources should be used reasonably for irrigation the use of organic fertilizer should be promoted gradually to decrease the pollution and eutrophication of the river and the ecological corridor of the river should be established to increase the connectivity of the landscape the ecological transition zone trisected land is distributed around the urban area accounting for 35 24 of the study area the living land in some ecological transition zones wants to connect with the ecological land in the ecological conservation zone which poses a great threat to the ecological security of the study area such as the northeastern part of nanning city and the central part of baise city etc isolation zones should be set up to guard the ecological security boundary the ecological prevention and control area of the three living sites are mainly distributed in urban areas and coastal zone areas with less surface vegetation and poorer habitat quality protective forests should be planted in the area to increase urban greening and gradually restore surface vegetation with reasonable planning 3 4 ecological security network construction and optimization planning the ecological security network is an integrated development layout with each ecological source site as the core ecological strategic points as clues and various corridors as the backbone there are 28 ecological corridors in 17 ecological patches in the study area with a total length of 2236 26 km 17 ecological corridors are identified with a length of 1498 75 km and 11 karst ecological corridors with a length of 737 51 km influenced by the spatial distribution and resource endowment of each ecological source site the distribution of ecological corridors is tortuous and winding bypassing many production and living sites mainly in the central and eastern parts in view of the low ecological carrying capacity in order to avoid excessive human interference activities the corridors linking the karst reserves with other source areas are stripped out from the ecological corridors as karst ecological corridors at the same time in order to improve the connectivity between ecological sources other important corridors including road and river corridors are introduced to build an ecological security network with integrated points and lines fig 11 description of the construction of three types of important corridors 1 ecological corridors exist in the form of primary planting corridors the ecological corridors identified in this study connect important ecological sources and jointly maintain regional ecological security ecological conservation needs to be strengthened along the ecological corridors if it needs to cross construction land vegetation corridors can be built around the city if it needs to cross cultivated land crop production can be guaranteed in the form of farmland protection forests it can be used as a guide for ecological control planning of cities and counties districts to play the function of local biological landscape connectivity 2 karst corridors exist in the form of soil fixing vegetation belts with karst ecological source points and ecological fragile points integrating stone desertification prevention and breeding with ecological landscape functions to jointly create karst ecological corridors 3 river corridor existing in the form of rivers the river corridor mainly consists of rivers such as the left and right river yu river nanliu river qin river and beilun river in the natural landscape area riparian vegetation can regulate the transport of water and materials from the surrounding land to the river and the vegetation zone should be scientifically arranged along the river in the non natural landscape area the over exploitation of the river by production and life should be strictly limited and the river corridor break point should be minimized during the construction and maintenance process and the construction of river banks on both sides should be strengthened to enhance the habitat adaptation of the watershed the longer the ecological corridor is the greater the possibility of being interrupted by the outside world the smaller the area and more dispersed the distribution of ecological source sites the weaker the diffusion effect of ecological source sites making the ecological corridor less stable by extracting the intersection of the ridge line and the ecological corridor a total of 20 eco strategic points are identified mainly distributed in the center of the ecological corridor with long distances and near the ecological source sites the ecological source sites and eco strategic points together form the ecological green heart and in the areas where they are densely distributed the local ecological environment can be improved through the construction of ecological stations and other measures to strengthen the ecological benefits of the ecological source sites and the corridor finally the ecological conservation zone and ecological control zone 6 types in the ecological security pattern were extracted as the ecological spatial planning matrix and the ecological corridors and ecological source points were superimposed to propose the optimal planning of two belts three screens four zones and multiple centers fig 12 among them the two belts refer to the karst ecological protection belt linking the karsts in northwest guizhou and the 100 000 mountains and the beibu gulf watershed bay ecological landscape belt with the beibu gulf inlet rivers as the main body the karst ecological protection belt serves as a key link to the karst ecological sources in the region and the beibu gulf watershed bay ecological landscape belt also serves as an important clue to connect the watershed with the coastal zone ecological protection the three screens refers to the natural ecological barrier formed by the karst forest the 100 000 mountain reserve and the xijiang river basin which together build the great green wall of the southern border the four areas refers to the mangrove restoration protection zone the west river water connotation area stone desertification prevention and conservation area and the ecological protection zone of rivers entering the sea mangrove restoration protection zone mainly includes yingluo port tieshan port lianzhou bay dafengjiang maowei sea east and west bay pearl bay and other bays and estuaries are the main distribution areas of mangroves west river water containment zone is mainly the water connotation function of the left and right river basin do a good job of integrated management of soil and water conservation stone desertification prevention and conservation zone aims to restore regional vegetation management control of human activities into the sea river ecological protection zone to the ecological protection zone is mainly composed of many rivers entering the sea to prevent land based pollution and protect biodiversity multi center refers to a number of ecological green centers composed of ecological source points and ecological strategic points 4 discussions 4 1 inspiration from the research content in this study a combination of rs gis technology and the ecological footprint method is used to evaluate the ecological carrying capacity however it is worth considering that the different ecological functions of patches at different scales and the different administrative division of governments at different levels lead to hierarchical nature in spatial governance and control which indicates that how to effectively apply the evaluation results of ecological carrying capacity at small patch scale to provide support for ecological remediation and restoration of governments at all levels is an urgent issue to be explored in depth the high carrying capacity is surrounded by medium and high carrying capacity the ecosystem structure is more perfect there are slight ecological anomalies the service function is good the ecological pressure is less and the sensitivity to all kinds of disturbances is weak in light of the current high level of global human activity and the intensification of ecological problems and climate change it is necessary to refer to the international situation to guide local development in terms of ecological security in the region assessed against the sdg15 2 target of by 2020 promote sustainable management of all types of forests halt deforestation restore degraded forests and significantly increase global afforestation and reforestation the region has not achieved this target the main reason is that human beings encroach on forest land to develop it for living and production and the ecosystem management methods and experience are insufficient lu et al 2022 according to the first sdg report submitted in 2019 if the un member states continue to follow the current development model many sdgs will not be achieved by 2020 and 2030 and such conclusions are only applicable to this region the ecological spatial planning proposal of two belts three screens four zones and multiple centers mentioned in this study is laid out under the principle of ecological orientation and its feasibility will be more reliable if it can be integrated with the spatial suitability assessment of land development to create a one map of national land resources 4 2 thinking about the application of the model the main function of ecological corridors is to connect different ecological source sites to maintain ecological process connectivity dilts et al 2016 we have identified the extent of the ecological corridor by the minimum cumulative resistance if the cumulative resistance threshold is continuously adjusted to delineate the spatial extent of ecological corridors the spatial pattern of ecological corridors may lead to new discoveries by extracting ecological corridors and ecological nodes which are often the cause of ecological network collapse is the key to solve ecological problems and ensure regional ecological security omeret al 2021 future research plans to couple the least resistance model and maxent model for ensuring the accuracy of ecological corridor ecological node extraction we have applied the ecological footprint model and the plus model to explore the spatial distribution of past and future ecological carrying capacity very well the plus model also suffers from limitations in the accuracy of the spatial allocation algorithm comparison of the results of our simulations with actual observations in 2020 reveals that the plus model is unable to predict new patches the allocation model is applied statically and the drivers are all selected from historical data if the environment in the ecological carrying capacity changes there are potential changes that cannot be described and future ecological carrying capacity simulations would benefit from adding dynamic environmental variables to the model to reduce errors due to new patches we will continue to explore this further in the future incorporating future urban ecological planning data and future climate data with the intention of improving the accuracy of the simulations 4 3 suggestions for future ecological protection and management guangxi plays an important role in china s belt and road construction and ecological security in 2019 the national master plan for major projects for the protection and restoration of important ecosystems was launched as a major national strategy a key step of which is to ensure ecological security build an ecological security barrier and improve carrying capacity through the integrated management and protection of the southern hills and coastal zone in addition with the accelerated urbanization throughout china the expansion of construction land has led to a gradual degradation of ecological carrying capacity especially for forest land and arable land yuan et al 2020 however forested and cultivated land can make significant contributions to the energy flow and material cycle of cities peng et al 2018 the results show that about 25 of ecological corridors 14 of ecological sources and most of the pinch points are dominated by woodlands and croplands therefore ecologically fragile points ecological strategic points and ecological corridor areas should be considered as priority areas for ecological protection to achieve sustainable development in the region it is necessary to deal with the relationship between ecological environment and social economy adhere to the concept of green water and green mountains are golden mountains improve the ecological security mechanism and invest in ecological construction vigorously develop ecological industries and focus on the development of landmark products to continue to close the mountainous areas of karst manage soil erosion control human activities and other policies should be highly implemented to improve the ecological environment to cope with ecological risks control the upper reaches of the watershed and land based pollution increase pollution control prevent land based pollution into the sea reasonable and moderate development of the coastal areas of the beibu gulf the regional environment is complex the city county district joint prevention and control integrated management and prevention to deal with multiple risks sources and improve ecological carrying capacity 4 4 limitations the projections in our study are only based on natural development scenarios and there is no discussion of multi scenario simulation projections where future developments are highly uncertain and should require exploration of more aspects however the discussion of however many scenarios is not a precise prediction of the future but rather an attempt to explore possible future directions in an appropriate way and to provide decision makers with response options in terms of the selection of resistance factors as there is no clear indicator system at home and abroad for researchers to refer to there will still be a certain amount of subjectivity after combining various forms of selection and it does not fully represent the ecological carrying capacity of the study area using a more precise and reasonable method to verify the scientific and systematic nature of the selection of factors is a difficult part of the study 5 conclusions 1 the average value of ecological carrying capacity per unit area from 1990 to 2040 is 4 403 which is a medium high carrying capacity grade as a whole showing a trend of rising and then falling the two time periods from 1990 to 2040 are dominated by the type of unchanging ecological carrying capacity the increase of ecological carrying capacity area of each city is smaller than the decrease and the overall trend is decreasing nanning qinzhou and chongzuo are the most severely damaged slope and temperature are the main driving factors 2 a total of 17 ecological source patches were identified in the study area accounting for 36 of the total area of the study area and the ecological source areas accounted for the overall area in general with a more concentrated distribution 3 we have established an integrated ecological security network structure of points lines and surfaces the ecological conservation zone and the ecological control zone are used as the substrate for ecological spatial planning and important corridors and ecological green centres are overlaid to propose an ecological optimization plan of two belts three screens four zones and multiple centres
