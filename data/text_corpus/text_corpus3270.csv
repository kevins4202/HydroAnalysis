16350,drinking water disinfection by chlorination or chloramination can result in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps such as haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms pyrogenic carbonaceous matter pcm such as activated carbon ac is commonly used as an ostensibly inert adsorbent to remove haas from water haa degradation has been mainly attributed to biological factors this study for the first time revealed that abiotic haa degradation in the presence of pcm could be important under water treatment conditions specifically we observed complete destruction of br3aa a model haa in the presence of powder ac at ph 7 within 30 min to understand the role of pcm and the reaction mechanism we performed a systematic study using a suite of haas and various pcm types we found that pcm significantly accelerated the transformation of three haas br3aa brcl2aa br2claa at ph 7 product characterization indicated an approximately 1 1 haa molar transformation into their respective thms following a decarboxylation pathway with pcm the br3aa activation energy ea was measured by kinetic experiments at 15 45 c with and without a model pcm wherein a significant decrease in ea from 25 7 3 2 to 13 6 2 2 kcal mol 1 was observed we further demonstrated that oxygenated functional groups on pcm e g cooh can accelerate haa decarboxylation using synthesized polymers to resemble pcm density functional theory simulations were performed to determine the enthalpy of activation δh for br3aa decarboxylation with h3o and formic acid hcooh the presence of hcooh significantly lowered the overall δh value for br3aa decarboxylation supporting the hypothesis that cooh catalyzes the c c bond breaking in br3aa overall our study demonstrated the importance of a previously overlooked abiotic reaction pathway where haas can be quickly converted to thms with pcm under water treatment relevant conditions these findings have substantial implications for dbp mitigation in water quality control particularly for potable water reuse or pre chlorinated water that allow direct contact between haas and ac during filtration as well as pac fines traveling with finished water in water distribution systems as such the volatilization and relative low toxicity of volatile thms may be considered as a detoxification process to mitigate adverse dbp effects in drinking water thereby lowering potential health risks to consumers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts haloacetic acids trihalomethanes decarboxylation density functional theory pyrogenic carbonaceous matter 1 introduction haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms are major classes of disinfection byproducts dbps that are produced when disinfectants react with organic and inorganic precursors in water mcrae et al 2004 parvsez et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 the occurrence of haas and thms have been reported in drinking water levesque et al 2006 rodriguez et al 2004 villanueva et al 2003 since the identification of the first known dbps in the 1970s dbps such as haas and thms have been increasingly reported to be ubiquitous in chlorinated drinking water at haa and thm concentrations ranging between 8 86 and 3 50 µg l 1 respectively richardson 2002 villanueva et al 2003 due to the potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of haas pals et al 2011 parvez et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 the united states environmental protection agency usepa currently regulates five haas claa cl2aa cl3aa braa br2aa and four thms chbr3 chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl in drinking water under stages i ii of the disinfectants disinfection byproducts rule at a combined maximum contaminant level mcl of 60 μg l 1 for haas and 80 μg l 1 for thms four additional haas namely tribromoacetic acid br3aa bromochloroacetic acid brclaa bromodichloroacetic acid brcl2aa and chlorodibromoacetic acid br2claa although not yet regulated have raised concerns over their higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as compared to regulated haas plewa et al 2010 usepa 2016 thus effective mitigative approaches toward controlling both regulated and emerging haas are needed pyrogenic carbonaceous matter pcm is the solid residual generated from the incomplete combustion of fresh or fossilized biomass engineering analogs of pcm such as granular activated carbon gac and powder activated carbon pac have been widely used in water treatment benjamin and lawler 2013 for instance gac pac altmann et al 2016 tung et al 2006 are commonly used medium for water filtration wherein their effectiveness largely depends on the contaminant s hydrophobicity golea et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 therefore they are effective towards intermediate aromatic dbps jiang et al 2020 2018 jiang and zhang 2018 jiang et al 2017 but are ineffective towards dbps with high polarity and low molecular weight such as haas tung et al 2006 and thms capar and yetiş 2002 summers et al 1993 furthermore once the adsorption sites are saturated used gac pac require off site disposal or regeneration crittenden et al 2012 xie 2003 with costs ranging from 1720 to 3000 ton 1year 1 casey et al 2013 usepa 2000 biological ac bac is often used for haa removal during water treatment bac reactivity has been attributed to biotic processes of bacterial enrichment cultures mcrae et al 2004 heterotrophic bacteria hozalski et al 2001 tung and xie 2009 and biofilms behbahani et al 2018 tung and xie 2011 zhou and xie 2002 whereas ac is considered an inert attachment surface for microbial growth recent studies have found that pac incorporation into porous electrodes can mimic bac performance by facilitating the adsorption of polar dbps such as haas and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and subsequently destroying these contaminants electrochemically almassi et al 2019a 2019b although the role of pcm as a passive adsorbent is well recognized recent studies have demonstrated that pcm has intrinsic reactivity and can participate in an array of biotic and abiotic reactions occurring in the natural environment pignatello et al 2017 xu et al 2020a 2021 for instance pcm promotes a suite of pollutant transformation under environmentally relevant conditions including primary amines aguilar et al 2005 nitroaromatics ding et al 2018 gomes et al 2008 phenolic compounds li et al 2015 pei et al 2018 xie et al 2017 chlorinated hydrocarbons chen et al 2014 explosives xu et al 2010 agrochemicals ding et al 2019 ding and xu 2016 xu et al 2013 2022 2020b and azo dyes van der zee et al 2003 zhao et al 2019 given the widely observed pcm reactivity in nature these reactions could potentially occur in engineered systems including water treatment processes for instance ac was able to convert n dbp precursors e g dimethylamine to nitrosamines increasing secondary amine formation in wastewater effluent padhye et al 2010 2011 previous studies also reported haa conversion to their respective trihalomethanes under ambient heller grossman et al 1993 zhang and minear 2002 or high temperature conditions chen et al 2021 lifongo et al 2010 pan et al 2014 in the absence of pcm with relatively slow kinetics e g a half life of 17 d for br3aa zhang and minear 2002 however despite the prevalence of bac for haa removal in water treatment little information is available regarding whether or not pcm could promote abiotic haa transformation kinetics or their associated product distribution characterizing and understanding how these reactions may affect haa mitigation are important in water quality control especially for potable water reuse or pre chlorinated water wherein haas and ac have direct contact during the filtration process as well as clear well welland water distribution systems that often present pac fines that travel with finished water this study aims to investigate the feasibility of pcm in promoting abiotic haa transformation under conditions relevant to water treatment and characterize the associated surface transformation reaction pathway specifically we explored nine haas haa9 br3aa br2claa brcl2aa claa cl2aa cl3aa braa br2aa brclaa including both regulated and emerging dbps to understand structural haa requirements for pcm enhanced abiotic transformation the degradation of haas was monitored and their products were characterized kinetic modeling was performed to delineate the adsorption kinetics from surface transformation rates the role of specific pcm functional groups e g cooh oh in promoting haa transformation i e br3aa was investigated by synthesizing pcm like polymers to resemble pcm density functional theory dft simulations were performed where the enthalpy of activation δh and overall reaction enthalpy δhr for br3aa decarboxylation were determined lastly the impact of solution chemistry was evaluated and haa decay dependence on pcm type e g graphite pac mwcnts was studied our findings elucidated an overlooked reaction where the presence of pcm significantly enhanced abiotic haa transformation into their respective haloforms under water treatment relevant conditions these results can inform the water industry regarding their dbp mitigation approaches where the increased presence of volatile thms with relatively lower toxicity following haa decay might help reduce the adverse health impact of dbps in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents a complete reagent list is detailed in text s1 pcm like polymers were synthesized by pd 0 cu i catalyzed cross coupling chemistry following a method adapted from our previous study li et al 2019 three pcm like

identification purposes select samples with high br3aa concentration 10 mg l 1 were analyzed for bromide using ion chromatography ic shimadzu kyoto japan 2 5 characterization of pcm and pcm like polymers the graphite pac mwcnts pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh surface areas were measured following a previously established method using a brunauer emmett teller bet surface analyzer nova 3000e

resonance nmr experiments were performed on a bruker avance 400 spectrometer at 100 mhz 13c frequency with a double resonance probe head with 4 mm sample rotors a previously established 13c multiple cross polarization magic angle spinning multi cp mas nmr technique was applied to gather pcm like polymer quantitative structural information johnson and schmidt rohr 2014 li et al 2019 wherein

of 4 μs all spectra presented good signal to noise ratios with significantly small 3 spinning sidebands and minimal overlapping center bands in addition the multi cp experiments were combined with 68 μs dipolar dephasing multi cp dd to generate non protonated c and mobile group sub spectra johnson and schmidt rohr 2014 li et al 2019 we adapted a previously established method to determine the point of zero charges pzc for pcm and pcm like polymers ni et al 2011 briefly di water wherein all reagents and naoh and hcl solutions were prepared was boiled for 1 h and degassed with n2 for 30 min for co2 removal subsequently 0 8 g powder graphite pcm oh or pcm cooh was pre wetted in 10 ml di water for 48 h at 25 c 40 rpm the initial blank ph no solids with 10 ml di water was lowered to ph 2 and recorded volumes of 0 1 or 1 n naoh were added until ph 12 identical hcl and naoh volumes were added to each powder sample and the ph at each increment was recorded the powder pzc was obtained when the initial and final ph values were identical 2 6 density functional theory dft simulations density functional theory dft simulations were performed using gaussian 16 software frisch et al 2016 unrestricted spin all electron calculations were performed using the 6 31g d basis set for frequency and geometry optimizations and the 6 311g 3df 2p basis set for energy calculations m06 2x hybrid meta exchange correlation functionals were employed for exchange and correlation this combination of basis sets and correlation functionals has been shown to be accurate for estimating reactions of organic compounds foresman and frisch 1996 zhao and truhlar 2008 implicit water solvation was simulated using the solvation model based on solute electron density smd marenich et al 2009 the transition state of a given reaction was determined by the pseudo reaction coordinate method anderson and kang 1998 where the c c bond length in br3c coo was systemically varied the resulting structure was confirmed to be representative of the transition state by yielding a single negative frequency during the frequency calculation foresman and frisch 1996 3 results and discussion 3 1 br3aa br2claa and brcl2aa transformation kinetics and products three out of nine haas haa3 br3aa br2claa brcl2aa exhibited reactivity toward graphite by contrast degradation was not observed for the other six haas haa6 consistent with a previous study almassi et al 2019b haa6 adsorption can be described by the freundlich model adsorption isotherms in fig s2 haa3 decay was monitored over time to obtain over 90 parent compound decay the total br3aa mass from both solid and aqueous phases were obtained using previously determined extraction efficiencies text s3 our results suggest that the presence of graphite significantly accelerated br3aa decay where 80 5 0 01 of br3aa disappeared with graphite compared to 38 7 0 01 without graphite over the experimental timeframe fig 1 a b haa degradation without graphite has been previously reported to follow an intramolecular electron transfer reaction zhang and minear 2002 bromoform chbr3 was identified as the main br3aa transformation product with a 1 1 molar transformation of br3aa to chbr3 the average mass balance on bromine atom calculated as 3 br3aa 3 chbr3 was close to 100 over the entire experimental timeframe with without graphite similarly to br3aa graphite also accelerated br2claa and brcl2aa decay but with much slower kinetics details on haa3 pseudo first order decay kinetics and r 2 values are in fig s3 similar to br3aa a 1 1 molar transformation of br2claa and brcl2aa to their respective thms chbr2cl and chbrcl2 were observed approximately 100 br mass balance calculated as 2 br2claa 2 chbr2cl and brcl2aa chbrcl2 were achieved for br2claa and brcl2aa respectively to characterize the formation of other transformation products select samples with high br3aa concentration 10 mg l 1 were monitored with or without graphite wherein no br br2aa braa or acetic acid were observed suggesting reductive dehalogenation was negligible adhikary et al 2017 hozalski et al 2001 for all reaction systems with without graphite as shown in fig 1 c k obs for haa3 decay with graphite followed the trend br3aa 2 02 0 17 10 1 d 1 r2 0 97 br2claa 4 75 0 88 10 2 d 1 r2 0 85 brcl2aa 1 03 0 15 10 2 d 1 r2 0 92 haa3 decay without graphite exhibited a similar trend with much slower kinetics br3aa 4 62 0 64 10 2 d 1 r2 0 91 br2claa 1 77 0 43 10 2 d 1 r2 0 86 brcl2aa 3 88 0 58 10 3 d 1 r2 0 90 haa3 enhancement factors by graphite were calculated by a ratio of the observed rate constants k obs with without graphite i e k graphite k no graphite which followed br3aa 4 37 0 25 br2claa 2 68 0 16 brcl2aa 2 65 0 01 although haloform formation from haa decay without pcm has been previously reported heller grossman et al 1993 lifongo et al 2010 zhang and minear 2002 this is the first study to demonstrate that pcm can significantly enhance the decay kinetics of these reactions for instance graphite shortened br3aa half lives from 15 1 1 to 3 4 0 4 d notably graphite was used herein as a model pcm with the smallest surface area orders of magnitude lower than pac and minimum surface functionality it is expected that haa decay would be much faster in the presence of pac which will be further evaluated in section 3 4 moreover the observed haa3 degradation trend mirrored their logk ow values br3aa 1 71 br2claa 1 62 brcl2aa 1 53 suggesting that non specific interaction between haas and the pcm surface played a dominant role in accelerating their decay we also investigated the possible contribution of trace metals on graphite to haa decay wherein no significant differences were observed in br3aa decay rates k obs with graphite as a reference 2 68 0 21 10 1 d 1 r2 0 97 versus hcl washed graphite 2 89 0 29 10 1 d 1 r2 0 95 details on the experimental procedure and decay kinetics with hcl washed graphite are in fig s4 3 2 modeling haa decomposition on pcm surface in general haa transformation with pcm is a combination of three processes i e adsorption desorption and surface transformation reactions on pcm which can be described by the langmuir kinetic model ding et al 2018 li et al 2019 xu et al 2013 1 d q d t k a c q q k d k r x n q where q is the haa solid phase concentration μg g 1 c is the aqueous concentration μg l 1 q is the total number of sorption sites μg g 1 and k a l μg 1 d 1 k d d 1 and k rxn d 1 are the adsorption desorption and surface transformation reaction rate constants respectively depending on the rate limiting step among these processes k obs may not reflect the true surface transformation reaction rate k rxn thus we used a combined modeling and experimental approach to quantify k rxn br3aa was employed as a model compound herein details on the model fitting are in text s4 fig s5 and obtained rate constants for br3aa adsorption desorption and surface transformation reaction with graphite are in table 1 our results suggest a three fold larger k rxn 3 52 0 92 102 d 1 as compared to k obs 2 02 0 17 10 1 d 1 for br3aa decay with graphite suggesting that the adsorption process is rate limiting table 1 moreover we calculated the br3aa mass fluxes φ µg m 2 d 1 for the surface transformation reaction φrxn k rxn q adsorption φa k a c q q and desorption φd k d q with graphite table s2 across the experimental timeframe all mass flux terms were comparable with each other suggesting that all three processes contributed to br3aa transformation and thus the observed k obs with graphite 3 3 reaction mechanism 3 3 1 activation energy ea a previous study suggested that haa conversion to thms followed intramolecular electron transfer zhang and minear 2002 in our study the presence of pcm evidently accelerated the reaction to understand the role of pcm in accelerating br3aa degradation we first quantified the activation energy ea of br3aa decarboxylation by measuring br3aa decay rate constants over 15 45 c with and without graphite detailed decay kinetics are in fig s6 eq 2 can be linearized to calculate ea 2 k o b s a e e a r t where k obs is the degradation rate constant d 1 a is the pre exponential factor d 1 e a is the activation energy kcal mol 1 r is the gas constant and t is the temperature k as shown in fig 2 a graphite accelerated br3aa decay from 15 to 45 c as compared to without graphite though the pcm effect was less predominant at higher temperatures we determined the br3aa decay e a values using the linear regression slopes which were 13 6 2 2 and 25 7 3 2 kcal mol 1 with and without graphite respectively our results suggest that graphite significantly lowered e a and thus accelerated br3aa decay the obtained e a without graphite was comparable to a previous study which reported an e a of 29 2 kcal mol 1 for br3aa decarboxylation in water zhang and minear 2002 this is the first study showing that graphite could lower br3aa activation energy 3 3 2 br3aa decay with functionalized pcm like polymers in this study we employed pcm like polymers to understand the role of oxygenated functional groups in accelerating haa decay by doing so we were able to isolate specific functionalities from an array of functional groups typically present in pcm like pcm the pcm like polymers are 1 highly conjugated and amorphous with no long range molecular order 2 contain micropores and large surface areas and 3 have a high affinity towards organic contaminants different from pcm however specific functional groups can be introduced via a polymer synthesis approach following protocols established in our lab li et al 2019 allowing us to investigate the impact of individual functionalities on haa decay advanced solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy was used to provide information on the polymerization degree and confirm the presence of target functional groups as shown in fig 2 b peaks at 123 7 ppm car c c car 131 8 ppm car h and 90 8 ppm cr cc r suggest conjugated polymer network formation in pcm pcm oh and pcm cooh additionally peaks at 167 8 ppm car oh and 196 2 ppm car o for pcm oh respectively verify the incorporation of phenolic and carbonyl groups in the polymer network peak differentiation imitating nmr analysis was employed to investigate the polymerization degree li et al 2019 specifically the peak at 90 8 ppm cr cc r indicates efficient aryl halide and alkyne coupling the low intensity peak ratio at 80 3 ppm c cc h over the peak at 90 8 ppm cr cc r provides information on the condensation degree wherein smaller values indicate higher polymerization degrees pcm0 and pcm oh exhibited ratios of 0 18 and 0 15 respectively as previously reported li et al 2019 and pcm cooh presented a ratio of 0 01 suggesting a higher condensation degree which were consistent with previous literature dawson et al 2009 jiang et al 2008 to understand the influence of oxygenated functional groups on haa sorption and decay the br3aa reactivity against pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh was examined br3aa demonstrated pseudo first order decay at ph 7 with pcm like polymers fig 2 c pcm cooh k obs 4 31 0 05 10 1 d 1 r2 0 92 pcm oh 3 58 0 62 10 1 d 1 r2 0 84 pcm0 2 57 0 20 10 1 d 1 r2 0 98 the kinetics of br3aa decay product formation and bromine mass balance in the presence of pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh are shown in fig s7 where 100 br mass balance were observed with all pcm like polymers given that all polymers were synthesized following the same reaction route with an identical catalyst we attribute the observed differences to variations in polymer surface functionalities similarly to section 3 2 we obtained the br3aa adsorption k a desorption k d and surface transformation reaction k rxn rate constants with pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh table 1 details on br3aa adsorption kinetics with pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh are in fig s8 br3aa adsorption kinetics followed pcm0 k a 1 60 0 32 10 1 d 1 pcm oh 9 29 0 68 10 2 d 1 pcm cooh 6 58 0 13 10 2 d 1 which can be attributed to a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between br3aa and pcm like polymers the measured pzc of pcm cooh and pcm oh were 2 57 and 7 respectively fig s9 thus pcm cooh is more negatively charged compared to pcm oh under circumneutral conditions repelling negatively charged br3aa pka 0 72 and hindering its adsorption serjeant and dempsey 1979 interestingly despite the slowest adsorption rate constant for pcm cooh its k rxn was the highest pcm cooh k rxn 4 34 0 01 103 d 1 pcm oh 1 97 0 03 103 d 1 pcm0 2 68 0 01 102 d 1 we also calculated the mass fluxes φ µg m2 d 1 of br3aa adsorption desorption and surface transformation reactions table s3 for pcm0 φa was approximately twice compared to φrxn interestingly φrxn became predominant for pcm oh φa φrxn and pcm cooh φa φrxn these results further confirmed that adsorption was the rate limiting step for br3aa decay with pcm oh and pcm cooh and the surface transformation rate was much higher than the k obs 3 3 3 dft modeling to understand the reaction pathway for br3aa decarboxylation dft simulations were performed the enthalpy of activation δh and overall reaction enthalpy δhr were determined for br3aa reaction with h3o according to eq 3 3 b r 3 c co o h 3 o rb r 3 ch c o 2 h 2 o where δh 50 kcal mol 1 and δhr 3 8 kcal mol 1 the cc bond in br3aa increased from 1 55 to 2 00 å in the transition state structure wherein h transfer from h3o to cbr3 was characterized fig 2 d i to investigate the ability of cooh in catalyzing the reaction the dft simulations added formic acid per eq 4 4 b r 3 c co o hcooh b r 3 c o 2 hcoo where δh 27 kcal mol 1 and δhr 3 4 kcal mol 1 the br3aa c c bond increased from 1 58 to 2 32 å in the transition state structure wherein h transfer from hcooh to cbr3 was also observed fig 2 d ii the lower δh value for reaction 2 relative to reaction 1 supports our experimental observation where the e a value for br3aa decreased from 25 7 3 2 to 13 6 2 2 kcal mol 1 with graphite moreover our dft simulation supports that cooh catalyzes the c c bond breaking reaction of br3aa while facilitating the transfer of h from cooh to cbr3 we postulate that the formation of a low barrier h bond lbhb between br3aa and the surface oxygenated functional groups cooh in particular played an important role in catalyzing c c bond breaking the lbhb strength is highly dependent on the proton affinity pka proximities of the proton donor and acceptor groups where smaller differences in acidity constants generate stronger h bonds brück et al 2000 pignatello et al 2017 thus the higher haa reactivity with pcm cooh versus pcm oh can be explained by the formation of a stronger h bond between br3aa and cooh as evidenced by the closer proximity of pka values between br3aa 0 72 and cooh pka cooh 3 6 compared to oh pka phenol 9 10 pignatello et al 2017 in addition to surface functionalities other reaction sites such as surface edges may also contribute to accelerating haa decay luo and jean charles 2006 pignatello et al 2017 3 4 pcm type other pcm types including pac and mwcnts were also investigated with respect to their ability to promote br3aa transformation at ph 7 0 wherein k obs was normalized with respect to pcm dosage fig 3 a left axis vs surface area fig 3 a right axis details on the 1 1 molar transformation of br3aa to chbr3 with pac and mwcnts are in fig s10 our results suggest that br3aa decay on a dosage normalized rate constant basis was over two orders of magnitude higher with pac than that with mwcnts which was one order and three orders magnitude higher than that with the pcm like polymers and graphite respectively normalizing these rate constants once more with respect to surface area we now see the values showed overall smaller variations among different pcm pac was now one order of magnitude higher than mwcnts which was about one order of magnitude higher than functionalized pcm like polymers and two orders of magnitude higher than graphite we attributed the lowest reactivity of graphite to its smallest surface area and functional groups among all pcm these results suggest that in addition to pcm surface area other pcm properties such as the identity and density of surface functional groups as well as surface defects luo and jean charles 2006 pignatello et al 2017 might also contribute to the pcm accelerated haa decay detailed rate constants normalized against pcm dosage and surface area are presented in table s4 it is possible that there might be radicals present on the pcm surface which could initiate the formation of a carboxylate radical and thus lead to the subsequent decarboxylation of br3aa we thereby performed quenching experiments by monitoring br3aa degradation in the presence of pac with and without 2 propanol d8 as detailed in fig s11 and text s5 a statistical analysis t test indicated no significant differences between the two rate constants of haa decay p 0 05 with 3 26 0 19 10 1 min 1 or without 2 propanol d8 3 66 0 25 10 1 min 1 moreover the statistical analysis t test indicated no significant differences p 0 05 in chbr3 formation with 6 75 0 93 10 4 µmol or without 7 70 0 38 10 4 µmol 2 propanol d8 following a 3 min reaction of br3aa in the presence of pac in a separate experiment our results clearly demonstrate that the radical pathway if present is negligible for the observed conversion between haas to thms 3 5 effect of solution chemistry on br3aa degradation we further investigated the effect of solution chemistry on br3aa decay kinetics under a ph range of 3 9 all ph values were measured before and after reaction which exhibited negligible change we observed pseudo first order br3aa decay with graphite from ph 5 to 9 wherein k obs followed ph 5 2 k obs 2 46 0 25 10 1 d 1 r2 0 96 6 2 2 30 0 01 10 1 d 1 r2 0 99 7 3 2 22 0 18 10 1 d 1 r2 0 97 8 9 1 97 0 18 10 1 d 1 r2 0 96 fig 3 b a statistical analysis t test indicated no significant differences among the four rate constants p 0 05 suggesting negligible ph effect on br3aa decay with graphite at ph 5 9 by contrast a much higher k obs was noted k obs ph3 1 49 0 16 d 1 r2 0 92 for br3aa degradation with graphite at ph 3 details on br3aa decay kinetics with without graphite from ph 3 9 are in fig s12 a previous study found negligible solution ph effect for br3aa degradation between ph 6 9 in water k obs 0 04 0 043 d 1 zhang and minear 2002 our results confirmed that similar trend held true for br3aa decay from ph 5 9 with graphite but not when the ph was lowered to 3 we attributed the accelerated br3aa decay observed at ph 3 to the interaction between graphite and br3aa since the pzc charge of graphite was 3 5 fig s9 graphite will be negatively charged at ph 5 9 repelling haa and resulting in slow adsorption in the respective ph range however graphite will be neutral positively charged at ph 3 resulting in higher affinity toward haa due to electrostatic interaction and accelerating haa decay punyapalakul et al 2009 we also examined the water matrix effect on br3aa decay using local tap water ph 7 0 0 2 unadjusted br3aa removal with graphite in tap water exhibited pseudo first order kinetics k obs 0 291 0 01 d 1 r2 0 99 the obtained value is comparable to the reference value in kh2po4 k2hpo4 buffer at ph 7 k obs 0 226 0 02 d 1 r2 0 97 suggesting negligible water matrix effects on br3aa decay with graphite details on br3aa decay kinetics with tap water and relevant parameters are in fig 3 c similarly the presence of suwannee river natural organic matter nom 3 mg l 1 as c pre equilibrated with graphite overnight did not affect br3aa decay as evidenced by the decay kinetics in fig 3 d consistent with previous studies our results suggest negligible water matrix effects on haa decay with nom zhang and minear 2002 4 conclusions the present study for the first time demonstrated that pcm alone can significantly accelerate abiotic haa decarboxylation reaction although haa decarboxylation in water alone has been previously reported the half lives were too slow to affect engineering applications e g a half life of 15 1 1 d for br3aa in water at ph 7 herein we demonstrated that complete br3aa degradation removal can be achieved within the typical empty bed contact time ebct of the filtration process i e 30 min or less in the presence of pac which suggests that the ac can significantly influence the conversion of haas to their respective thms in potable water reuse or pre chlorinated water during the filtration process where haas are in direct contact with ac moreover pac fines may travel with the finished water in clear well and water distribution systems with a typical residence time of hours to days tinker et al 2009 increasing the contact time between haas and pac and further promoting the transformation of haas to their respective thms we expect these reactions to proceed even faster in residential hot water distribution systems resulting in increased presence of volatile dbps in treated water following haa decay in addition gac filters are widely used as home filters where haas might be further converted to thms in the time frame of minutes to hours wqa 2016 it has been recently reported that volatile dbps contributed marginally to the developmental toxicity of dbp mixtures in drinking water han and zhang 2018 li et al 2020 plewa and wagner 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 therefore both the volatilization and the relative low toxicity of volatile thms might contribute as a detoxification process for mitigating the adverse effects of dbps in drinking water and thus reduce health risks to consumers we also employed a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidate the role of pcm in accelerating br3aa decarboxylation specifically this study is the first to demonstrate that the presence of pcm lowered the activation energy for br3aa decarboxylation we further demonstrated that the carboxylic acid groups on pcm catalyzed br3aa decarboxylation using a polymer synthesis approach our dft simulation supported these experimental observations and showed a lower overall δh value for catalyzed br3aa decarboxylation with hcooh versus with h3o indicating that cooh catalyzed the cc bond breaking of br3aa while facilitating h transfer from cooh to cbr3 overall this study unraveled a previously overlooked process namely the abiotic haa conversion to their respective thms in the presence of pcm which could significantly affect the dbp mitigative approaches due to the rapid conversation of hydrophilic dbps into their respective volatile dbps its implications on smaller

16350,drinking water disinfection by chlorination or chloramination can result in the formation of disinfection byproducts dbps such as haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms pyrogenic carbonaceous matter pcm such as activated carbon ac is commonly used as an ostensibly inert adsorbent to remove haas from water haa degradation has been mainly attributed to biological factors this study for the first time revealed that abiotic haa degradation in the presence of pcm could be important under water treatment conditions specifically we observed complete destruction of br3aa a model haa in the presence of powder ac at ph 7 within 30 min to understand the role of pcm and the reaction mechanism we performed a systematic study using a suite of haas and various pcm types we found that pcm significantly accelerated the transformation of three haas br3aa brcl2aa br2claa at ph 7 product characterization indicated an approximately 1 1 haa molar transformation into their respective thms following a decarboxylation pathway with pcm the br3aa activation energy ea was measured by kinetic experiments at 15 45 c with and without a model pcm wherein a significant decrease in ea from 25 7 3 2 to 13 6 2 2 kcal mol 1 was observed we further demonstrated that oxygenated functional groups on pcm e g cooh can accelerate haa decarboxylation using synthesized polymers to resemble pcm density functional theory simulations were performed to determine the enthalpy of activation δh for br3aa decarboxylation with h3o and formic acid hcooh the presence of hcooh significantly lowered the overall δh value for br3aa decarboxylation supporting the hypothesis that cooh catalyzes the c c bond breaking in br3aa overall our study demonstrated the importance of a previously overlooked abiotic reaction pathway where haas can be quickly converted to thms with pcm under water treatment relevant conditions these findings have substantial implications for dbp mitigation in water quality control particularly for potable water reuse or pre chlorinated water that allow direct contact between haas and ac during filtration as well as pac fines traveling with finished water in water distribution systems as such the volatilization and relative low toxicity of volatile thms may be considered as a detoxification process to mitigate adverse dbp effects in drinking water thereby lowering potential health risks to consumers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection byproducts haloacetic acids trihalomethanes decarboxylation density functional theory pyrogenic carbonaceous

in water mcrae et al 2004 parvsez et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 the occurrence of haas and thms have been reported in drinking water levesque et al 2006 rodriguez et al 2004 villanueva et al 2003 since the identification of the first known dbps in the 1970s dbps such as haas and thms have been increasingly reported to be ubiquitous in chlorinated drinking water at haa and thm concentrations ranging between 8 86 and 3 50 µg l 1 respectively richardson 2002 villanueva et al 2003 due to the potential genotoxicity and carcinogenicity of haas pals et al 2011 parvez et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 the united states environmental protection agency usepa currently regulates five haas claa cl2aa cl3aa braa br2aa and four thms chbr3 chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl in drinking water under stages i ii of the disinfectants disinfection byproducts rule at a combined maximum contaminant level mcl of 60 μg l 1 for haas and 80 μg l 1 for thms four additional haas namely tribromoacetic acid br3aa bromochloroacetic acid brclaa bromodichloroacetic acid brcl2aa and chlorodibromoacetic acid br2claa although not yet regulated have raised concerns over their higher cytotoxicity and genotoxicity as compared to regulated haas plewa et al 2010 usepa 2016 thus effective mitigative approaches toward controlling both regulated and emerging haas are needed pyrogenic carbonaceous matter pcm is the solid residual generated from the incomplete combustion of fresh or fossilized biomass engineering analogs of pcm such as granular activated carbon gac and powder activated carbon pac have been widely used in water treatment benjamin and lawler 2013 for instance gac pac altmann et al 2016 tung et al 2006 are commonly used medium for water filtration wherein their effectiveness largely depends on the contaminant s hydrophobicity golea et al 2020 jiang et al 2017 therefore they are effective towards intermediate aromatic dbps jiang et al 2020 2018 jiang and zhang 2018 jiang et al 2017 but are ineffective towards dbps with high polarity and low molecular weight such as haas tung et al 2006 and thms capar and yetiş 2002 summers et al 1993 furthermore once the adsorption sites are saturated used gac pac require off site disposal or regeneration crittenden et al 2012 xie 2003 with costs ranging from 1720 to 3000 ton 1year 1 casey et al 2013 usepa 2000 biological ac bac is often used for haa removal during water treatment bac reactivity has been attributed to biotic processes of bacterial enrichment cultures mcrae et al 2004 heterotrophic bacteria hozalski et al 2001 tung and xie 2009 and biofilms behbahani et al 2018 tung and xie 2011 zhou and xie 2002 whereas ac is considered an inert attachment surface for microbial growth recent studies have found that pac incorporation into porous electrodes can mimic bac performance by facilitating the adsorption of polar dbps such as haas and n nitrosodimethylamine ndma and subsequently destroying these contaminants electrochemically almassi et al 2019a 2019b although the role of pcm as a passive adsorbent is well recognized recent studies have demonstrated that pcm has intrinsic reactivity and can participate in an array of biotic and abiotic reactions occurring in the natural environment pignatello et al 2017 xu et al 2020a 2021 for instance pcm promotes a suite of pollutant transformation under environmentally relevant conditions including primary amines aguilar et al 2005 nitroaromatics ding et al 2018 gomes et al 2008 phenolic compounds li et al 2015 pei et al 2018 xie et al 2017 chlorinated hydrocarbons chen et

nature these reactions could potentially occur in engineered systems including water treatment processes for instance ac was able to convert n dbp precursors e g dimethylamine to nitrosamines increasing secondary amine formation in wastewater effluent padhye et al 2010 2011 previous studies also reported haa conversion to their respective trihalomethanes under ambient heller grossman et al 1993 zhang and minear 2002 or high temperature conditions chen et al 2021 lifongo et al 2010 pan et al 2014 in the absence of pcm with relatively slow kinetics e g a half life of 17 d for br3aa zhang and minear 2002 however despite the prevalence of bac for haa removal in water treatment little information is available regarding whether or not pcm could promote abiotic haa transformation kinetics or their associated product distribution characterizing and understanding how these reactions may affect haa mitigation are important in water quality control especially for potable water reuse or pre chlorinated water wherein haas and ac have direct contact during the filtration process as well as clear well welland water distribution systems that often present pac fines that travel with finished water this study aims to investigate the feasibility of pcm in promoting abiotic haa transformation under conditions relevant to water treatment and characterize the associated surface transformation reaction pathway specifically we explored nine haas haa9 br3aa br2claa brcl2aa claa cl2aa cl3aa braa br2aa brclaa including both regulated and emerging dbps to understand structural haa requirements for pcm enhanced abiotic transformation the degradation of haas was monitored and their products were characterized kinetic modeling was performed to delineate the adsorption kinetics from surface transformation rates the role of specific pcm functional groups e g cooh oh in promoting haa transformation i e br3aa was investigated by synthesizing pcm like polymers to resemble pcm density functional theory dft simulations were performed where the enthalpy of activation δh and overall reaction enthalpy δhr for br3aa decarboxylation were determined lastly the impact of solution chemistry was evaluated and haa decay dependence on pcm type e g graphite pac mwcnts was studied our findings elucidated an overlooked reaction where the presence of pcm significantly enhanced abiotic haa transformation into their respective haloforms under water treatment relevant conditions these results can inform the water industry regarding their dbp mitigation approaches where the increased presence of volatile thms with relatively lower toxicity following haa decay might help reduce the adverse health impact of dbps in drinking water 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents a complete

washed with chloroform water methanol and acetone to remove unreacted monomers and catalyst residues and purified by soxhlet extraction with methanol for 48 h and dried at 100 c for 24 h pcm oh and

of zero charges pzc for pcm and pcm like polymers ni et al 2011 briefly di water wherein all reagents and naoh and hcl solutions were prepared was boiled for 1 h and degassed with n2 for 30 min for co2 removal subsequently 0 8 g powder graphite pcm oh or pcm cooh was pre wetted in 10 ml di water for 48 h at 25 c 40 rpm the initial blank ph no solids with 10 ml di water was lowered to ph 2 and recorded volumes of 0 1 or 1 n naoh were added until ph 12 identical hcl and naoh volumes were added to each powder sample and the ph at each increment was recorded the powder pzc was obtained when the initial and final ph values were identical 2 6 density functional theory dft simulations density functional theory dft simulations were performed using gaussian 16 software frisch et al 2016 unrestricted spin all electron calculations were performed using the 6 31g d basis set for frequency and geometry optimizations and the 6 311g 3df 2p basis set for energy calculations m06 2x hybrid meta exchange correlation functionals were employed for exchange and correlation this combination of basis sets and correlation functionals has been shown to be accurate for estimating reactions of organic compounds foresman and frisch 1996 zhao and truhlar 2008 implicit water solvation was simulated using the solvation model based on solute electron density smd marenich et al 2009 the transition state of a given reaction was determined by the pseudo reaction coordinate method anderson and kang 1998 where the c c bond length in br3c coo was systemically varied the resulting

br3aa br2claa and brcl2aa transformation kinetics and products three out of nine haas haa3 br3aa br2claa brcl2aa exhibited reactivity toward graphite by contrast degradation was not observed for the other six haas haa6 consistent with a previous study almassi et al 2019b haa6 adsorption can be described by the freundlich model adsorption isotherms in fig s2 haa3 decay was monitored over time to obtain over 90 parent compound decay the total br3aa mass from both solid and aqueous phases were obtained using previously determined extraction efficiencies text s3 our results suggest that the presence of graphite significantly accelerated br3aa decay where 80 5 0 01 of br3aa disappeared with graphite compared to 38 7 0 01 without graphite over the experimental timeframe fig 1 a b haa degradation without graphite has been previously reported to follow an intramolecular electron transfer reaction zhang and minear 2002 bromoform chbr3 was identified as the main br3aa transformation product with a 1 1 molar transformation of br3aa to chbr3 the average mass balance on bromine atom calculated as 3 br3aa 3 chbr3 was close to 100 over the entire experimental timeframe with without graphite similarly to br3aa graphite also accelerated br2claa and brcl2aa decay but with much slower kinetics details on haa3 pseudo first order decay kinetics and r 2 values are in fig s3 similar to br3aa a 1 1 molar transformation of br2claa and brcl2aa to their respective thms chbr2cl and chbrcl2 were observed approximately 100 br mass balance calculated as 2 br2claa 2 chbr2cl and brcl2aa chbrcl2 were achieved for br2claa and brcl2aa respectively to characterize the formation of other transformation products select samples with high br3aa concentration 10 mg l 1 were monitored with or without graphite wherein no br br2aa braa or acetic acid were observed suggesting reductive dehalogenation was negligible adhikary et al 2017 hozalski et al 2001 for all reaction systems with without graphite as shown in fig 1 c k obs for haa3 decay with graphite followed the trend br3aa 2 02 0 17 10 1 d 1 r2 0 97 br2claa 4 75 0 88 10 2 d 1 r2 0 85 brcl2aa 1 03 0 15 10 2 d 1 r2 0 92 haa3 decay without graphite exhibited a similar trend with much slower kinetics br3aa 4 62 0 64 10 2 d 1 r2 0 91 br2claa 1 77 0 43 10 2 d 1 r2 0 86 brcl2aa 3 88 0 58 10 3 d 1 r2 0 90 haa3 enhancement factors by graphite were calculated by a ratio of the observed rate constants k obs with without graphite i e k graphite k no graphite which followed br3aa 4 37 0 25 br2claa 2 68 0 16 brcl2aa 2 65 0 01 although haloform formation from haa decay without pcm has been previously reported heller grossman et al 1993 lifongo et al 2010 zhang and minear 2002 this is the first study to demonstrate that pcm can significantly enhance the decay kinetics of these reactions for instance graphite shortened br3aa half lives from 15 1 1 to 3 4 0 4 d notably graphite was used herein as a model pcm with the smallest surface area orders of magnitude lower than pac and minimum surface functionality it is expected that haa decay would be much faster in the presence of pac which will be further evaluated in section 3 4 moreover the observed haa3 degradation trend mirrored their logk ow values br3aa 1 71 br2claa 1 62 brcl2aa 1 53 suggesting that non specific interaction between haas and the pcm surface played a dominant role in accelerating their decay we also investigated the possible contribution of trace metals on graphite to haa decay wherein no significant differences were observed in br3aa decay rates k obs with graphite as a reference 2 68 0 21 10 1 d 1 r2 0 97 versus hcl washed graphite 2 89 0 29 10 1 d 1 r2 0 95 details on the experimental procedure and decay kinetics with hcl washed graphite are in fig s4 3 2 modeling haa decomposition on pcm surface in general haa transformation with pcm is a combination of three processes i e adsorption desorption and surface transformation reactions on pcm which can be described by the langmuir kinetic model ding et al 2018 li et al 2019 xu et al 2013 1 d q d t k a c q q k d k r x n q where q is the haa solid phase concentration μg g 1 c is the aqueous concentration μg l 1 q is the total number of sorption sites μg g 1 and k a l μg 1 d 1 k d d 1 and k rxn d 1 are the adsorption desorption and surface transformation reaction rate constants respectively depending on the rate limiting step among these processes k obs may not reflect the true surface transformation reaction rate k rxn thus we used a combined modeling and experimental approach to quantify k rxn br3aa was employed as a model compound herein details on the model fitting are in text s4 fig s5 and obtained rate constants for br3aa adsorption desorption and surface transformation reaction with graphite are in table 1 our results suggest a three fold larger k rxn 3 52 0 92 102 d 1 as compared to k obs 2 02 0 17 10 1 d 1 for br3aa decay with graphite suggesting that the adsorption process is rate limiting table 1 moreover we calculated the br3aa mass fluxes φ µg m 2 d 1 for the surface transformation reaction φrxn k rxn q adsorption φa k a c q q and desorption φd k d q with graphite table s2 across the experimental timeframe all mass flux terms were comparable with each other suggesting that all three processes contributed to br3aa transformation and thus the observed k obs with graphite 3 3 reaction mechanism 3 3 1 activation energy ea a previous study suggested that haa conversion to thms followed intramolecular electron transfer zhang and minear 2002 in our study the presence of pcm evidently accelerated the reaction to understand the role of pcm in accelerating br3aa degradation we first quantified the activation energy ea of br3aa decarboxylation by measuring br3aa decay rate constants over 15 45 c with and without graphite detailed decay kinetics are in fig s6 eq 2 can be linearized to calculate ea 2 k o b s a e e a r t where k obs is the degradation rate constant d 1 a is the pre exponential factor d 1 e a is the activation energy kcal mol 1 r is the gas constant and t is the temperature k as shown in fig 2 a graphite accelerated br3aa decay from 15 to 45 c as compared to without graphite though the pcm effect was less predominant at higher temperatures we determined the br3aa decay e a values using the linear regression slopes which were 13 6 2 2 and 25 7 3 2 kcal mol 1 with and without graphite respectively our results suggest that graphite significantly lowered e a and thus accelerated br3aa decay the obtained e a without graphite was comparable to a previous study which reported an e a of 29 2 kcal mol 1 for br3aa decarboxylation in water zhang and minear 2002 this is the first study showing that graphite could lower br3aa activation energy 3 3 2 br3aa decay with functionalized pcm like polymers in this study we employed pcm like polymers to understand the role of oxygenated functional groups in accelerating haa decay by doing so we were able to isolate specific functionalities from an array of functional groups typically present in pcm like pcm the pcm like polymers are 1 highly conjugated and amorphous with no long range molecular order 2 contain micropores and large surface areas and 3 have a high affinity towards organic contaminants different from pcm however specific functional groups can be introduced via a polymer synthesis approach following protocols established in our lab li et al 2019 allowing us to investigate the impact of individual functionalities on haa decay advanced solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy was used to provide information on the polymerization degree and confirm the presence of target functional groups as shown in fig 2 b peaks at 123 7 ppm car c c car 131 8 ppm car h and 90 8 ppm cr cc r suggest conjugated polymer network formation in pcm pcm oh and pcm cooh additionally peaks at 167 8 ppm car oh and 196 2 ppm car o for pcm oh respectively verify the incorporation of phenolic and carbonyl groups in the polymer network peak differentiation imitating nmr analysis was employed to investigate the polymerization degree li et al 2019 specifically the peak at 90 8 ppm cr cc r indicates efficient aryl halide and alkyne coupling the low intensity peak ratio at 80 3 ppm c cc h over the peak at 90 8 ppm cr cc r provides information on the condensation degree wherein smaller values indicate higher polymerization degrees pcm0 and pcm oh exhibited ratios of 0 18 and 0 15 respectively as previously reported li et al 2019 and pcm cooh presented a ratio of 0 01 suggesting a higher condensation degree which were consistent with previous literature dawson et al 2009 jiang et al 2008 to understand the influence of oxygenated functional groups on haa sorption and decay the br3aa reactivity against pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh was examined br3aa demonstrated pseudo first order decay at ph 7 with pcm like polymers fig 2 c pcm cooh k obs 4 31 0 05 10 1 d 1 r2 0 92 pcm oh 3 58 0 62 10 1 d 1 r2 0 84 pcm0 2 57 0 20 10 1 d 1 r2 0 98 the kinetics of br3aa decay product formation and bromine mass balance in the presence of pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh are shown in fig s7 where 100 br mass balance were observed with all pcm like polymers given that all polymers were synthesized following the same reaction route with an identical catalyst we attribute the observed differences to variations in polymer surface functionalities similarly to section 3 2 we obtained the br3aa adsorption k a desorption k d and surface transformation reaction k rxn rate constants with pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh table 1 details on br3aa adsorption kinetics with pcm0 pcm oh and pcm cooh are in fig s8 br3aa adsorption kinetics followed pcm0 k a 1 60 0 32 10 1 d 1 pcm oh 9 29 0 68 10 2 d 1 pcm cooh 6 58 0 13 10 2 d 1 which can be attributed to a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between br3aa and pcm like polymers the measured pzc of pcm cooh and pcm oh were 2 57 and 7 respectively fig s9 thus pcm cooh is more negatively charged compared to pcm oh under circumneutral conditions repelling negatively charged br3aa pka 0 72 and hindering its adsorption serjeant and dempsey 1979 interestingly despite the slowest adsorption rate constant for pcm cooh its k rxn was the highest pcm cooh k rxn 4 34 0 01 103 d 1 pcm oh 1 97 0 03 103 d 1 pcm0 2 68 0 01 102 d 1 we also calculated the mass fluxes φ µg m2 d 1 of br3aa adsorption desorption and surface transformation reactions table s3 for pcm0 φa was approximately twice compared to φrxn interestingly φrxn became predominant for pcm oh φa φrxn and pcm cooh φa φrxn these results further confirmed that adsorption was the rate limiting step for br3aa decay with pcm oh and pcm cooh and the surface transformation rate was much higher than the k obs 3 3 3 dft modeling to understand the reaction pathway for br3aa decarboxylation dft simulations were performed the enthalpy of activation δh and overall reaction enthalpy δhr were determined for br3aa reaction with h3o according to eq 3 3 b r 3 c co o h 3 o rb r 3 ch c o 2 h 2 o where δh 50 kcal mol 1 and δhr 3 8 kcal mol 1 the cc bond in br3aa increased from 1 55 to 2 00 å in the transition state structure wherein h transfer from h3o to cbr3 was characterized fig 2 d i to investigate the ability of cooh in catalyzing the reaction the dft simulations added formic acid per eq 4 4 b r 3 c co o hcooh b r 3 c o 2 hcoo where δh 27 kcal mol 1 and δhr 3 4 kcal mol 1 the br3aa c c bond increased from 1 58 to 2 32 å in the transition state structure wherein h transfer from hcooh to cbr3 was also observed fig 2 d ii the lower δh value for reaction 2 relative to reaction 1 supports our experimental observation where the e a value for br3aa decreased from 25 7 3 2 to 13 6 2 2 kcal mol 1 with graphite moreover our dft simulation supports that cooh catalyzes the c c bond breaking reaction of br3aa while facilitating the transfer of h from cooh to cbr3 we postulate that the formation of a low barrier h bond lbhb between br3aa and the surface oxygenated functional groups cooh in particular played an important role in catalyzing c c bond breaking the lbhb strength is highly dependent on the proton affinity pka proximities of the proton donor and acceptor groups where smaller differences in acidity constants generate stronger h bonds brück et al 2000 pignatello et al 2017 thus the higher haa reactivity with pcm cooh versus pcm oh can be explained by the formation of a stronger h bond between br3aa and cooh as evidenced by the closer proximity of pka values between br3aa 0 72 and cooh pka cooh 3 6 compared to oh pka phenol 9 10 pignatello et al 2017 in addition to surface functionalities other reaction sites such as surface edges may also contribute to accelerating haa decay luo and jean charles 2006 pignatello et al 2017 3 4 pcm type other pcm types including pac and mwcnts were also investigated with respect to their ability to promote br3aa transformation at ph 7 0 wherein k obs was normalized with respect to pcm dosage fig 3 a left axis vs surface area fig 3 a right axis details on the 1 1 molar transformation of br3aa to chbr3 with pac and mwcnts are in fig s10 our results suggest that br3aa decay on a dosage normalized rate constant basis was over two orders of magnitude higher with pac than that with mwcnts which was one order and three orders magnitude higher than that with the pcm like polymers and graphite respectively normalizing these rate constants once more with respect to surface area we now see the values showed overall smaller variations among different pcm pac was now one order of magnitude higher than mwcnts which was about one order of magnitude higher than functionalized pcm like polymers and two orders of magnitude higher than graphite we attributed the lowest reactivity of graphite to its smallest surface area and functional groups among all pcm these results suggest that in addition to pcm surface area other pcm properties such as the identity and density of surface functional groups as well as surface defects luo and jean charles 2006 pignatello et al 2017 might also contribute to the pcm accelerated haa decay detailed rate constants normalized against pcm dosage and surface area are presented in table s4 it is possible that there might be radicals present on the pcm surface which could initiate the formation of a carboxylate radical and thus lead to the subsequent decarboxylation of br3aa we thereby performed quenching experiments by monitoring br3aa degradation in the presence of pac with and without 2 propanol d8 as detailed in fig s11 and text s5 a statistical analysis t test indicated no significant differences between the two rate constants of haa decay p 0 05 with 3 26 0 19 10 1 min 1 or without 2 propanol d8 3 66 0 25 10 1 min 1 moreover the statistical analysis t test indicated no significant differences p 0 05 in chbr3 formation with 6 75 0 93 10 4 µmol or without 7 70 0 38 10 4 µmol 2 propanol d8 following a 3 min reaction of br3aa in the presence of pac in a separate experiment our results clearly demonstrate that the radical pathway if present is negligible for the observed conversion between haas to thms 3 5 effect of solution chemistry on br3aa degradation we further investigated the effect of solution chemistry on br3aa decay kinetics under a ph range of 3 9 all ph values were measured before and after reaction which exhibited negligible change we observed pseudo first order br3aa decay with graphite from ph 5 to 9 wherein k obs followed ph 5 2 k obs 2 46 0 25 10 1 d 1 r2 0 96 6 2 2 30 0 01 10 1 d 1 r2 0 99 7 3 2 22 0 18 10 1 d 1 r2 0 97 8 9 1 97 0 18 10 1 d 1 r2 0 96 fig 3 b a statistical analysis t test indicated no significant differences among the four rate constants p 0 05 suggesting negligible ph effect on br3aa decay with graphite at ph 5 9 by contrast a much higher k obs was noted k obs ph3 1 49 0 16 d 1 r2 0 92 for br3aa degradation with graphite at ph 3 details on br3aa decay kinetics with without graphite from ph 3 9 are in fig s12 a previous study found negligible solution ph effect for br3aa degradation between ph 6 9 in water k obs 0 04 0 043 d 1 zhang and minear 2002 our results confirmed that similar trend held true for br3aa decay from ph 5 9 with graphite but not when the ph was lowered to 3 we attributed the accelerated br3aa decay observed at ph 3 to the interaction between graphite and br3aa since the pzc charge of graphite was 3 5 fig s9 graphite will be negatively charged at ph 5 9 repelling haa and resulting in slow adsorption in the respective ph range however graphite will be neutral positively charged at ph 3 resulting in higher affinity toward haa due to electrostatic interaction and accelerating haa decay punyapalakul et al 2009 we also examined the water matrix effect on br3aa decay using local tap water ph 7 0 0 2 unadjusted br3aa removal with graphite in tap water exhibited pseudo first order kinetics k obs 0 291 0 01 d 1 r2 0 99 the obtained value is comparable to the reference value in kh2po4 k2hpo4 buffer at ph 7 k obs 0 226 0 02 d 1 r2 0 97 suggesting negligible water matrix effects on br3aa decay with graphite details on br3aa decay kinetics with tap water and relevant parameters are in fig 3 c similarly the presence of suwannee river natural organic matter nom 3 mg l 1 as c pre equilibrated with graphite overnight did not affect br3aa decay as evidenced by the decay kinetics in fig 3 d consistent with previous studies our results suggest negligible water matrix effects on haa decay with nom zhang and minear 2002 4 conclusions the present study for the first time demonstrated that pcm alone can significantly accelerate abiotic haa decarboxylation reaction although haa decarboxylation in water alone has been previously reported the half lives were too slow to affect engineering applications e g a half life of 15 1 1 d for br3aa in water at ph 7 herein we demonstrated that complete br3aa degradation removal can be achieved within the typical empty bed contact time ebct of the filtration process i e 30 min or less in the presence of pac which suggests that the ac can significantly influence the conversion of haas to their respective thms in potable water reuse or pre chlorinated water during the filtration process where haas are in direct contact with ac moreover pac fines may travel with the finished water in clear well and water distribution systems with a typical residence time of hours to days tinker et al 2009 increasing the contact time between haas and pac and further promoting the transformation of haas to their respective thms we expect these reactions to proceed even faster in residential hot water distribution systems resulting in increased presence of volatile dbps in treated water following haa decay in addition gac filters are widely used as home filters where haas might be further converted to thms in the time frame of minutes to hours wqa 2016 it has been recently reported that volatile dbps contributed marginally to the developmental toxicity of dbp mixtures in drinking water han and zhang 2018 li et al 2020 plewa and wagner 2015 wagner and plewa 2017 therefore both the volatilization and the relative low toxicity of volatile thms might contribute as a detoxification process for mitigating the adverse effects of dbps in drinking water and thus reduce health risks to consumers we also employed a combined experimental and computational approach to elucidate the role of pcm in accelerating br3aa decarboxylation specifically this study is the first to demonstrate that the presence of pcm lowered the activation energy for br3aa decarboxylation we further demonstrated that the carboxylic acid groups on pcm catalyzed br3aa decarboxylation using a polymer synthesis approach our dft simulation supported these experimental observations and showed a lower overall δh value for catalyzed br3aa decarboxylation with hcooh versus with h3o indicating that cooh catalyzed the cc bond breaking of br3aa while facilitating h transfer from cooh to cbr3 overall this study unraveled a previously overlooked process namely the abiotic haa conversion to their respective thms in the presence of pcm which could significantly affect the dbp mitigative approaches due to the rapid conversation of hydrophilic dbps into their respective volatile dbps its implications on smaller

16351,the present study evaluates the use of reverse osmosis ro reject termed as ror for microalgal biomass production the supplementation of ror from two different sources namely domestic ro unit ror1 and commercial scale ro plant ror2 showed a synergistic effect on the growth and biochemical composition of chlorella pyrenoidosa among the tested ror1 doses the highest biomass production 1 27 0 06 g l 1 was observed with 25 ror1 supplemented growth media in contrast the lipid content 28 85 3 13 of ts in c pyrenoidosa at 50 ror1 dose was almost twice that in bg11 positive control interestingly the microalgae showed relatively higher biomass production 1 37 0 07 g l 1 and higher lipid content 33 23 3 92 of ts when 50 ror2 was used in growth media at the same time the estimated carbohydrate and protein contents were 28 41 0 73 and 29 75 0 31 of ts respectively furthermore the lipid productivity 28 98 2 79 mg l 1 d 1 was relatively higher than the nutrient media 12 35 1 34 mg l 1 d 1 the present findings revealed that the ro reject from drinking water purifiers can efficiently be utilized for lipid rich microalgal biomass production hence the dependency on freshwater resources for mass scale microalgae cultivation through recycling of ro reject can be reduced graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorella pyrenoidosa reverse osmosis reject lipid biofuel water recycling wastewater 1 introduction freshwater scarcity has emerged as a serious global threat that directly impacts humans and their biotic and abiotic environment motoshita et al 2018 according to the 2017 united nations sustainable development goals report more than 2 billion global population is currently living in extreme water stress conditions guterres 2017 therefore various technologies and policies are being developed to mitigate the global freshwater deficiency bernauer and böhmelt 2020 reverse osmosis ro is one of the advanced and efficient technology for water purification the ro technology has been adopted on domestic and industrial scales across the globe to produce safe drinking water wenten and khoiruddin 2016 however the generation of concentrated reject streams wastewater in this process is another emerging challenge mamta et al 2020 further the production of such a massive amount of ro reject ror streams is raising the water stress conditions thus in the surge of establishing an environmentally sustainable water process the ror treatment and recycling is the need of the hour deep well injection evaporation condensation landfilling distillation and crystallization are some of the common techniques used for the treatment and disposal of industrial ror subramani and jacangelo 2014 while some advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as the ro coupled with thermal treatment as well as various advanced membrane based techniques including membrane distillation forward osmosis and electrodialysis and capacitive deionization have also been investigated for treating the ror maheshwari and agrawal 2020 muhammad yaqub and lee 2019 however the above listed treatment technologies are mainly used for the ror resulting from the effluent treatment plants of the chemical textile and food industries in contrast the reports on treatment and safe disposal of the ror from the drinking water plant are relatively unexplored mamta et al 2020 though the available treatment technologies for industrial ror can also be used for ror originated from drinking water plants the acceptability and applicability of these approaches are questionable due to high cost and energy inputs mamta et al 2020 on the other hand bioinspired techniques such as the use of microalgae phycoremediation have been proven to be efficient for the remediation of a range of wastewater chang et al 2020 chen et al 2015 matos et al 2015 henceforth the phycoremediation technology can also be explored for treating and recycling the ror from the drinking water treatment plant however in depth and multifarious research interventions are required to assess the applicability of the microalgae based approaches in drinking water plants ror treatment and recycling microalgal biomass is considered as an attractive feedstock for the production of various metabolites proteins pigments and vitamins and biofuel precursors such as lipid for biodiesel and carbohydrate for bioethanol kusmayadi et al 2021 pagels et al 2021 these algal derived products are sought after within the nutraceutical pharmaceutical cosmetic and biofuel sectors on the global market elakbawy et al 2021 kusmayadi et al 2021 however the high nutrients and water demand make algae cultivation economically infeasible on a commercial platform gopalakrishnan et al 2018 tan et al 2018 for instance 4 59 to 6 39 m3 yr 1 water is required for cultivating algae in a piece of 1 0 m2 land guieysse et al 2013 furthermore the water footprint for per kg dry algal biomass production in a photobioreactor pbr lies in the range of 2 4 to 6 8 m3 marcin and mucha 2015 consequently on a commercial scale an estimated 952 to 1903 billion m3 of freshwater would be required for replacing 5 10 of the fossil fuel with algal biofuel renuka et al 2021 thus some researchers have investigated the feasibility of wastewater for algae cultivation to rectify these issues elakbawy et al 2021 gopalakrishnan et al 2018 leite et al 2019 for example in a comparative study ali et al 2021 found higher biomass productivity in domestic wastewater than distilled water likewise kumar et al al 2020 have analyzed the suitability of dairy effluent for algal biomass production in addition to reducing the need for nutrients the application of wastewater can also lessen the freshwater demand by up to 90 yang et al 2011 hence improving the water footprint of algal cultivation thus these outcomes anticipated that wastewater with some pretreatment if required could be a feasible option for mass scale algae cultivation however the presence of toxic chemicals and pathogens in wastewater prevents the use of the resulting algal biomass for animal and human consumption chavan and mutnuri 2020 conversely the ror water from a portable water treatment unit usually has a consistent nutrient composition and is free from toxic contaminants and pathogens reddy et al 2018 therefore ror from drinking water plants can be explored for mass scale algae cultivation and valuable metabolites production in addition the composition and concentration of nutrients in ror depend on the characteristics of the feed groundwater as a result the physicochemical properties of the ror may vary with the location henceforth the ror from a portable drinking water unit may require dilution or supplementation of nutrients before algae cultivation moreover to the best of the authors knowledge no such attempts have been made where the ro reject from the domestic or commercial drinking ro unit was used for microalgae cultivation hence for developing a novel and feasible approach in the present work the applicability of ror from a drinking water treatment plant was assessed for cultivating chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa is a promising algal strain with high photosynthetic efficiency rich in lipid and protein content and can grow in different types of wastewaters bhushan et al 2021 mat aron et al 2021 it is noteworthy that c pyrenoidosa is among the emerging microalgal strains for producing metabolites and biofuel elakbawy et al 2021 lian et al 2021 this study initially investigated the microalgal growth and biomass composition in the ror1 supplemented nutrient media furthermore to validate the applicability and acceptability of ro reject water on a larger scale the ro reject ror2 from a commercial ro plant was also tested 2 material and methods 2 1 algal strains and culture pure culture of chlorella pyrenoidosa ncim 2738 was procured from the national collection

conductivity and salinity of the sample were estimated using a portable conductivity meter lovibord senso direct con200 using standard protocols 2 3 reverse osmosis reject ror supplemented growth media for c pyrenoidosa the ror at different concentrations v v was mixed with bg11 medium for microalgae cultivation initially the bg11 media was supplemented with 25 50 and 75 ror1 based on the findings two optimum doses i e 50 and 75 of ror1 supplemented bg11 media were further tested with ror2 the flasks containing 0 100 bg11 and 100 ror 0 bg11 were used as a positive and negative control respectively throughout the study to acclimatize the microalgae in ror the cells were initially grown in 100 ml bg11 media after every 24 h 10 ml of the media was replaced with 10 ml of ror and the culture was incubated under the above mentioned control conditions for 10 days kumar et al 2017 all the experiments were performed in a 250 ml flask with 50 ml working volume in triplicate the flasks were inoculated with freshly grown algal culture having an optical density of 2 0 at 680 nm od680 nm 2 0 and the inoculum size was kept at 10 v v prajapati et al 2014a the experiments were carried out for 15 days and an aliquot i e 1 ml from each culture flask was withdrawn at a three day interval after the growth period 15 days the microalgal biomass was harvested through centrifugation at 2459 g rcf relative centrifugal force for 8 min and biomass pellets were collected the harvested biomass was then washed thrice with deionized water through repeated cycles of resuspension and centrifugation finally the washed pelletized biomass was dried at 105 c for three hours in a hot air oven and powdered in a mortal pestle the dried biomass powder was then used for elemental and biochemical analysis 2 4 algal growth and biomass estimation the algal growth was estimated in terms of biomass concentration g l 1 and chlorophyll content chl a µg ml 1 the biomass concentration was determined using the calibration curve derived from the dry cell weight and absorbance at 680 nm od680 nm the freshly grown algal culture was diluted in distilled water in various concentrations namely 2 4 6 8 and 10 ml to yield a total volume of 10 ml the absorbance of these samples was measured at 680 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv vis lambda 365 perkinelmer usa the homogenized algal samples were filtered through a pre weighed 70 mm whatman s glass microfiber filter gf c and dried for 4 h at 105 c after drying the filter paper s ultimate weight was recorded and the dry cell weight was calculated using eq 1 1 d r y c e l l w t g l w f w i sample volume where wi and wf are the initial and final weight of filter paper mg finally a calibration curve between absorbance and dry cell weight was created the algal biomass concentration g l 1 and biomass productivity bp were then calculated using calibration curve eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 2 b i o m a s s c o n c g l 0 3513 a 0 0661

methodology reported by porra et al 1989 was followed for extraction and estimation of chlorophyll in brief a 1 ml algal sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 4436 g rcf and pellets were collected the pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml methanol and incubated for 30 min in a water bath at 60 c the sample was then allowed to cool down at room temperature finally the optical density of the algal sample was measured at 652 nm 665 2 nm and 670 nm chlorophyll chl a was measured using the following eq 4 4 c h l a μ g m l 16 29 a 665 2 a 750 8 54 a 652 a 670 where0 chl a is the chlorophyll content in µg ml 1 a652 a665 2 and a670 are the absorbance at 652 nm 665 2 nm and 670 nm respectively 2 5 elemental and biochemical analyses of biomass the elemental composition of the microalgal biomass was determined using a chns o analyzer elementar vario el iii us briefly the dried algal powder 2 5 mg was combusted at 1000 c and after complete combustion the biomass gets reduced to elemental gasses co2 h2o n2 and so2 the combusted products were subsequently separated using a chromatographic column finally the gasses were detected and quantified by the thermal conductivity detector the carbohydrate content of the biomass was estimated using the phenol sulphuric acid method dubois et al 1951 in brief 10 mg dried algal biomass was added to a clean vial containing 5 ml 2 5 n hcl the vials were then heated at 100 c for 3 h the hydrolyzed algal biomass was allowed to cool to ambient temperature afterward the vials were neutralized with sodium carbonate finally cell debris was removed from the treated biomass by centrifuging it at 4436 g rcf for 10 min and the supernatant was collected for sugar measurement after that 1 ml of phenol solution 5 v v was added to each tube containing 1 ml of the sample reagent black and glucose standard and mixed thoroughly subsequently 5 ml of h2so4 98 was added to each test tube then the solution was kept at room temperature for 10 min followed by 25 min incubation at 25 c in a water bath at last the absorbance of the sample was measured at 490 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer perkinelmer lamda 365 and the sugar content was calculated lee et al 2010 using the calibration curve eq 5 5 s u g a r m g l a 490 0 0167 0 0107 where a490 is the absorbance at 490 nm lipid was extracted and estimated using the modified bligh and dyer s method lee et al 2010 the algal slurry of 2 g l 1 concentration was prepared by adding 10 ml deionized water to 20 mg dried algal biomass the algal suspension was subjected to microwave treatment at 750 w power for 5 min in a microwave oven and cooled down at room temperature the chloroform and methanol 1 2 ratio were then added to the reaction vials for lipid extraction then the suspension was mixed thoroughly and kept at room temperature for an hour later 5 ml water was added to the solution and the suspension was kept under stationary conditions at room temperature until the organic layers separated and settled to the bottom the organic layer containing lipid and chloroform was then carefully collected and the total volume was recorded following that a known volume of the organic layer was placed in a pre weighed aluminum foil cup placed in a hot air oven at 105 c for two hours to vaporize the chloroform at last the weight of lipid containing dried aluminum foil was noted and the lipid content expressed as a percentage of dried algal biomass was calculated using eq 6 6 l i p i d m g f w f f w i v t v a where fwi and fwf are the initial and final weight of the aluminum foil cup in mg respectively vt and va are the total volumes of the organic layer and the aliquot in ml the final lipid productivity was calculated using eq 7 as described by dickinson et al

stated otherwise and the data are reported as mean values with standard deviations mean sd n 3 or with error bars in the graphs 3 result and discussion 3 1 growth study of c pyrenoidosa in ro reject supplemented media the selected doses of the ror1 showed varying effects on microalgal growth the growth profiles of microalgae c pyrenoidosa cultivated in ror1 media 0 100 are shown in fig 1 during the first 6 days of growth no significant differences in biomass concentration were observed however 6th day onwards the different doses of ror1 showed different patterns in the biomass concentration profiles fig 1a overall during 15 days of growth the highest biomass concentration was recorded in the media supplemented with 25 ror1 biomass concentration 1 27 0 06 g l 1 followed by 50 ror1 biomass concentration 1 25 0 07 g l 1 the corresponding biomass productivity mg l 1 d 1 achieved were 81 40 2 22 and 80 98 3 59 respectively interestingly the biomass concentration and productivities obtained in the present work were at par with the values recorded in the bg11 1 29 0 09 g l 1 and 82 66 6 29 mg l 1 d 1 respectively furthermore the obtained biomass productivity of c pyrenoidosa in ror1 supplemented media was around 1 5 times higher than that reported by zhou et al 2020 in municipal wastewater however ror1 supplementation beyond 50 led to a progressive decrease in resultant biomass and the lowest biomass productivity i e 53 33 4 65 mg l 1 d 1 was attained with 100 ror1 negative control though the final microalgal biomass in 100 ror1 negative control was the lowest among all the tested sets it was nevertheless higher than the biomass reported for c pyrenoidosa in municipal wastewater he et al 2021 likewise matos et al 2021 observed similar outcomes when spirulina platensis was grown in inland desalination concentrate dc and they also found the lowest biomass concentration in 100 dc i e 0 86 0 08 g l 1 henceforth the current observation and comparison with literature evidenced that microalgal growth relies on the subjected environmental conditions and the growth medium used hence in a nutshell it can be concluded that the ror1 can efficiently be utilized as a nutrient source to reduce the requirement of commercial nutrient media by 50 the chlorophyll chl a profile of c pyrenoidosa was in line with the biomass concentration profile fig 1b the maximum chl a concentration 14 52 0 17 mg l 1 was attained on the 12th day in 50 ror1 supplemented media followed by the positive control bg11 13 44 0 63 mg l 1 on the other hand chl a content of the biomass in 100 ror1 negative control was substantially low 2 79 0 35 mg l 1 it is noteworthy that chlorophyll a nitrogenous pigment promotes microalgal growth through photosynthesis and acts as an intracellular nitrogen reserve to drive cell proliferation and biomass production umamaheswari et al 2020 therefore algal cells acquire higher chlorophyll pigments in nitrogen rich media whereas the chlorophyll pigments get reduced under nitrogen deficiency in addition the phosphorous concentration also affects pigment synthesis by altering photosynthetic efficiency huang et al 2021 therefore the decline in chlorophyll content was possible due to lesser nitrogen n and phosphorous p availability 6 76 0 29 and 2 5 0 13 mg l 1 respectively in ror1 table 1 compared to nutrient media such as bg11 n 0 247 g l 1 p 0 543 g l 1 thus the current statistics evidenced that the nutrient concentration in growth media significantly affects the microalgal growth and cellular composition therefore optimizing media composition and growth parameters is crucial for producing high density algal biomass 3 2 elemental and biochemical composition the algal biomass was harvested after 15 days culturing period and the dried algal biomass was analysed for determining their biochemical composition the elemental composition of the microalgae is shown in table 2a the carbon content in the microalgal cells grown in ror1 supplemented media was more or less comparable to that of the bg11 positive control the carbon content in 75 ror1 was highest 51 18 0 44 representing a 6 39 improvement over the bg11 positive control despite this there was no discernible variation in carbon content among the tested media compositions higher ror1 concentrations on the other hand resulted in a more remarkable fall in n content in algal cells since the nitrogen availability in the growth medium has a direct impact on the algal cellular nitrogen content zhao et al 2019 for example the reduction in n content in 25 ror1 was just 5 85 compared to the bg11 positive control but it was substantially larger i e 58 92 in negative control 100 ror1 likewise a reduction in algal cellular protein was detected with increasing ror1 concentration fig 2 the microalgae grown in bg11 positive control had the highest protein content 40 63 0 81 followed by 38 22 2 47 34 0 38 32 38 2 75 and 16 69 0 13 protein content in 25 50 75 and 100 ror1 respectively in comparison to the bg11 positive control 5 94 58 92 reduction in algal protein was noticed in the ror1 containing media which resembled the variation in nitrogen content additionally the drop in cellular nitrogen reduces cellular nitrogen rich components such as chlorophyll amino acids proteins and nucleotides under nitrogen stress conditions these cellular components get degraded to form ammonium to perform other metabolic biosynthesis processes chen et al 2020 in contrast the microalgae grown in ror1 added media showed higher lipid and carbohydrate content than the positive control bg11 fig 2 despite the slight increase in carbohydrate content a significant enhancement in lipid content was noticed at all the media compositions the microalgae c pyrenoidosa exhibited a maximum lipid content of 28 85 3 13 in 50 ror1 medium which was almost twice the positive control bg11 followed by 24 76 1 99 lipid in 75 ror1 media further the lipid productivity of c pyrenoidosa at all the tested concentrations of ror1 is tabulated in table 2 b notably the observed enhancement in lipid content and lipid productivity were either at par with or higher than the reported values in the literature for instance matos et al 2015 reported the highest 12 6 lipid accumulation in algal biomass when the nannochloropsis gaditana was grown in desalination concentrate mixed f 2 media furthermore the lipid accumulation recorded by tan et al al 2019 in microalgae c pyrenoidosa in the anaerobically digested starch wastewater and secondary treated starch wastewater was 60 83 and 37 61 lesser than that recorded in the present work 50 ror1 respectively the variation in carbohydrate content at different doses of ror1 was relatively low 1 7 7 except the negative control 100 ror1 fig 2 with a slight enhancement of 1 7 over the positive control bg11 a maximum carbohydrate content of 315 3 1 69 mg g 1 was obtained at 25 ror1 at the same time the highest reduction 28 59 in carbohydrate content was recorded with negative control 283 94 4 49 mg g 1 moreover in continuation to the earlier findings related to biomass productivity and chlorophyll content the carbohydrate and lipid production in 100 ror1 media were also lowest possibly due to insufficient nutrient availability to support microalgal growth and metabolic cycles 3 3 feasibility assessment of commercial ro plant reject for algae cultivation in the second phase the ro reject from a commercial ro plant ror2 was tested to examine the broader scale applicability of ror for mass scale algae cultivation the 50 and 75 ror2 concentrations were selected along with the bg11 and ror2 alone as a positive and negative control noticeably the outcomes of ror2 media analysis backed up previous research on ror1 as shown in fig 3 the ror2 can stimulate microalgal growth when the concentration was 50 whereas when the ror2 concentration was 75 and 100 negative control it could inhibit the growth of microalgae c pyrenoidosa among the different ror2 doses the microalgal growth was relatively promoted at 50 ror2 with a maximum biomass concentration and biomass productivity of 1 37 0 07 g l 1 and 87 23 3 23 mg l 1 d 1 respectively in addition a maximal 13 19 0 36 mg l 1 chlorophyll chl a content was also found at 50 ror2 among the tested doses however the highest chlorophyll content 14 35 0 49 mg l 1 was observed with bg11 alone positive control it is noticeable that the net biomass attained at 50 ror2 was either higher or at par with the reported values for microalgae cultivated in different wastewater table 3 for instance rana and prajapati 2021a reported biomass concentration up to 1 1 g l 1 when c pyrenoidosa was grown in synthetic wastewater likewise in biochar supplemented dye solution the microalgae c pyrenoidosa showed maximum biomass productivity of 17 63 mg l 1 d 1 approximately 5 times lower than recorded in 50 ror2 media behl et al 2019 conversely tan et al 2019 found 31 37 higher biomass in anaerobically digested starch wastewater than noted in 50 ror2 furthermore a detailed comparative study is presented in table 3 the carbon content of the biomass did not change with the varying concentration of ror2 in the media table 4 a thus with a moderate enhancement of 2 46 over the positive control the maximum carbon content of 50 37 0 05 was obtained in 50 ror2 similar to the previous findings of ror1 a drop of 35 23 65 35 in nitrogen content over the bg11 positive control was recorded at different ror2 concentrations as a result a reduction in biomass protein content was noted with a rising concentration of ror2 fig 4 the recorded protein content in 50 75 and 100 ror2 negative control was 29 75 0 31 23 84 0 31 and 15 91 0 41 respectively in addition a remarkably high lipid containing biomass could be obtained in ror2 media with slightly reduced carbohydrate content fig 4 resembling the outcomes of the ror1 medium the microalgae also exhibited a maximum lipid content of 33 23 3 92 and lipid productivity of 28 98 2 79 mg l 1 d 1 in 50 ror2 which was approximately 2 3 times higher than that in the positive control furthermore the lipid content in ror2 100 was 19 13 3 14 increased by 33 78 over the positive control bg11 moreover lipid productivity was only 9 81 1 32 mg l 1 d 1 owing to the lowest biomass productivity 51 27 6 48 mg l 1 d 1 the microalgal biomass and lipid productivity at different ror2 doses are summarized in table 4 b the present findings revealed that a higher lipid accumulation in microalgae is possible when ror2 supplemented growth media is used compared to other wastewater reported in the literature for instance in an outdoor study umamaheswari et al 2020 found 27 47 lipid accumulation in microalgae c pyrenoidosa in the paddy soaked wastewater which was 18 68 lesser than the microalgal lipid content in 50 ror2 furthermore a detailed comparative study of c pyrenoidosa biomass and lipid accumulation in different media types is summarized in table 3 it is well known that the cultural and environmental variables directly influence microalgal growth and biological activity the availability of nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorous carbon sources temperature light intensity photoperiod and salinity derives the biological cycles and thus the biochemical composition of microalgae sajjadi et al 2018 it is noteworthy that high lipid containing biomass is a widely recognized biofuel biodiesel precursor however the commercialization of algal biofuel is restricted due to higher production costs lower biomass and lipid productivity renuka et al 2021 thus various biomass and lipid enhancement strategies have been investigated in the past few years table 5 for example gao et al al 2019 observed a maximum of 118 56 lipid enhancement after varying the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the municipal wastewater similarly liu et al 2021 found iron and acetate supplemented municipal wastewater suitable for significantly enhancing the lipid content of c pyrenoidosa 248 enhancement liu et al 2021 varying culture conditions i e ph light intensity photoperiod nutrients supplementation limitation co culturing with bacteria and genetic modification are some of the approaches which have been explored by various researchers for improving microalgal biomass and lipid content ge et al 2018 rai et al 2013 sachdeva et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 overall the recent studies targeting lipid enhancement infer that microalgal lipid accumulation can be enhanced by altering growth conditions and or nutrient composition in addition the present findings also reveal that under nutrient stress conditions especially nitrogen and phosphorous limitation higher algal lipid accumulation occurs therefore an optimized ror derived algal biomass could be a source of such a high value product it is noteworthy that there have been significant advancements in the area of algal biomass harvesting some of the promising methods for recovering the algal biomass after cultivation includes the bioharvesting using filamentous fungi bhattacharya et al 2017 prajapati et al 2016 2014b ph assisted biomass settling mehta and chakraborty 2021 pérez et al 2017 and nanoparticle mediated harvesting fu et al 2021 mubarakali 2019 furthermore extraction and recovery of these high value biofuel precursors can further be improved by adopting advanced efficient and low cost green pretreatment techniques such as microwave treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis bhushan et al 2021 rana and prajapati 2021b implementing such cost effective green approaches for the recovery of biomass and lipid from microalgae grown in ror will further help to attain economic sustainability on a commercial scale the preliminary results showed that the use of ror as growth media could effectively reduce freshwater demand in mass scale algae cultivation table 6 further the usage of ror will assist in minimizing its handling and treatment cost thus to assure wider scale acceptability of the present work the water footprint for algal biomass production was theoretically calculated notably only the direct water consumption for algae cultivation was taken into consideration for estimating the water footprint the theoretical analysis states that around 742 03 m3 freshwater water will be required to produce a targeted 1000 kg of dried algal biomass table 6 however the water footprint of algae cultivation can be cut down to half 364 43 m3 when 50 ror2 is be used as growth media interestingly 1230 45 m3 of ror2 100 ror2 will be sufficient to completely cut down freshwater demand for cultivating c pyrenoidosa consequently the application of ror seems a sustainable approach for wastewater recycling and minimizing the natural water stress condition hence in a nutshell it can be concluded that microalgae can grow in domestic as well as commercial ror and biochemically enriched biomass can be obtained furthermore the proposed methodology will help in attaining economic sustainability on a commercial scale by reducing the freshwater and nutrient demand additionally it will also reduce the ror treatment and algae cultivation costs therefore the ror can be considered as a suitable media for mass scale algae cultivation for biofuel production 4 conclusions the present study concluded that the microalgae c pyrenoidosa could thrive in both domestic as well commercial scale ror the 50 ror dose was found optimal to improve the algal biomass productivities while in comparison to bg11 2 03 and 2 32 folds enhanced lipid was achieved in ror1 and ror2 respectively in addition the final biomass had a good amount of pigments chlorophyll a proteins and carbohydrate content in conclusion among the tested ror dosages 50 ror had the greatest impact on microalgal biomass growth and lipid production therefore the ro rejects water mediated biomass cultivation as a sustainable and novel approach for producing biochemical rich microalgae biomass will broaden the possibilities for more efficient microalgal technology development the foregoing theories however need

16351,the present study evaluates the use of reverse osmosis ro reject termed as ror for microalgal biomass production the supplementation of ror from two different sources namely domestic ro unit ror1 and commercial scale ro plant ror2 showed a synergistic effect on the growth and biochemical composition of chlorella pyrenoidosa among the tested ror1 doses the highest biomass production 1 27 0 06 g l 1 was observed with 25 ror1 supplemented growth media in contrast the lipid content 28 85 3 13 of ts in c pyrenoidosa at 50 ror1 dose was almost twice that in bg11 positive control interestingly the microalgae showed relatively higher biomass production 1 37 0 07 g l 1 and higher lipid content 33 23 3 92 of ts when 50 ror2 was used in growth media at the same time the estimated carbohydrate and protein contents were 28 41 0 73 and 29 75 0 31 of ts respectively furthermore the lipid productivity 28 98 2 79 mg l 1 d 1 was relatively higher than the nutrient media 12 35 1 34 mg l 1 d 1 the present findings revealed that the ro reject from drinking water purifiers can efficiently be utilized for lipid rich microalgal biomass production hence the dependency on freshwater resources for mass scale microalgae cultivation through recycling of ro reject can be reduced graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords chlorella pyrenoidosa reverse osmosis reject lipid biofuel water recycling wastewater 1 introduction freshwater scarcity has emerged as a serious global threat that directly impacts humans and their biotic and abiotic environment motoshita et al 2018 according to the 2017 united nations sustainable development goals report more than 2 billion global population is currently living in extreme water stress conditions guterres 2017 therefore various technologies and policies are being developed to mitigate the global freshwater deficiency bernauer and böhmelt 2020 reverse osmosis ro is one of the advanced and efficient technology for water purification the ro technology has been adopted on domestic and industrial scales across the globe to produce safe drinking water wenten and khoiruddin 2016 however the generation of concentrated reject streams wastewater in this process is another emerging challenge mamta et al 2020 further the production of such a massive amount of ro reject ror streams is raising the water stress conditions thus in the surge of establishing an environmentally sustainable water process the ror treatment and recycling is the need of the hour deep well injection evaporation condensation landfilling distillation and crystallization are some of the common techniques used for the treatment and disposal of industrial ror subramani and jacangelo 2014 while some advanced wastewater treatment technologies such as the ro coupled with thermal treatment as well as various advanced membrane based techniques including membrane distillation forward osmosis and electrodialysis and capacitive deionization have also been investigated for treating the ror maheshwari and agrawal 2020 muhammad yaqub and lee 2019 however the above listed treatment technologies are mainly used for the ror resulting from the effluent treatment plants of the chemical textile and food industries in contrast the reports on treatment and safe disposal of the ror from the drinking water plant are relatively unexplored mamta et al 2020 though the available treatment technologies for industrial ror can also be used for ror originated from drinking water plants the acceptability and applicability of these approaches are questionable due to high cost and energy inputs mamta et al 2020 on the other hand bioinspired techniques such as the use of microalgae phycoremediation have been proven to be efficient for the remediation of a range of wastewater chang et al 2020 chen et al 2015 matos et al 2015 henceforth the phycoremediation technology can also be explored for treating and recycling the ror from the drinking water treatment plant however in depth and multifarious research interventions are required to assess the applicability of the microalgae based approaches in drinking water plants ror treatment and recycling microalgal biomass is considered as an attractive feedstock for the production of various metabolites proteins pigments and vitamins and biofuel precursors such as lipid for biodiesel and carbohydrate for bioethanol kusmayadi et al 2021 pagels et al 2021 these algal derived products are sought after within the nutraceutical pharmaceutical cosmetic and biofuel sectors on the global market elakbawy et al 2021 kusmayadi et al 2021 however the high nutrients and water demand make algae cultivation economically infeasible on a commercial platform gopalakrishnan et al 2018 tan et al 2018 for instance 4 59 to 6 39 m3 yr 1 water is required for cultivating algae in a piece of 1 0 m2 land guieysse et al 2013 furthermore the water footprint for per kg dry algal biomass production in a photobioreactor pbr lies in the range of 2 4 to 6 8 m3 marcin and mucha 2015 consequently on a commercial scale an estimated 952 to 1903 billion m3 of freshwater would be required for replacing 5 10 of the fossil fuel with algal biofuel renuka et al 2021 thus some researchers have investigated the feasibility of wastewater for algae cultivation to rectify these issues elakbawy et al 2021 gopalakrishnan et al 2018 leite et al 2019 for example in a comparative study ali et al 2021 found higher biomass productivity in domestic wastewater than distilled water likewise kumar et al al 2020 have analyzed the suitability of dairy effluent for algal biomass production in addition to reducing the need for nutrients the application of wastewater can also lessen the freshwater demand by up to 90 yang et al 2011 hence improving the water footprint of algal cultivation thus these outcomes anticipated that wastewater with some pretreatment if required could be a feasible option for mass scale algae cultivation however the presence of toxic chemicals and pathogens in wastewater prevents the use of the resulting algal biomass for animal and human consumption chavan and mutnuri 2020 conversely the ror water from a portable water treatment unit usually has a consistent nutrient composition and is free from toxic contaminants and pathogens reddy et al 2018 therefore ror from drinking water plants can be explored for mass scale algae cultivation and valuable metabolites production in addition the composition and concentration of nutrients in ror depend on the characteristics of the feed groundwater as a result the physicochemical properties of the ror may vary with the location henceforth the ror from a portable drinking water unit may require dilution or supplementation of nutrients before algae cultivation moreover to the best of the authors knowledge no such attempts have been made where the ro reject from the domestic or commercial drinking ro unit was used for microalgae cultivation hence for developing a novel and feasible approach in the present work the applicability of ror from a drinking water treatment plant was assessed for cultivating chlorella pyrenoidosa c pyrenoidosa is a promising algal strain with high photosynthetic efficiency rich in lipid and protein content and can grow in different types of wastewaters bhushan et al 2021 mat aron et al 2021 it is noteworthy that c pyrenoidosa is among the emerging microalgal strains for producing metabolites and biofuel elakbawy et al 2021 lian et al 2021 this study initially investigated the microalgal growth and biomass composition in the ror1 supplemented nutrient media furthermore to validate the applicability and acceptability of ro reject water on a larger scale the ro reject ror2 from a commercial ro plant was also tested 2 material and methods 2 1 algal strains and culture pure culture of chlorella pyrenoidosa ncim 2738 was procured from the national collection

conductivity and salinity of the sample were estimated using a portable conductivity meter lovibord senso direct con200 using standard protocols 2 3 reverse osmosis reject ror supplemented growth media for c pyrenoidosa the ror at different concentrations v v was mixed with bg11 medium for microalgae cultivation initially the bg11 media was supplemented with 25 50 and 75 ror1 based on the findings two optimum doses i e 50 and 75 of ror1 supplemented bg11 media were further tested with ror2 the flasks containing 0 100 bg11 and 100 ror 0 bg11 were used as a positive and negative control respectively throughout the study to acclimatize the microalgae in ror the cells were initially grown in 100 ml bg11 media after every 24 h 10 ml of the media was replaced with 10 ml of ror and the culture was incubated under the above mentioned control conditions for 10 days kumar et al 2017 all the experiments were performed in a 250 ml flask with 50 ml working volume in triplicate the flasks were inoculated with freshly grown algal culture having an optical density of 2 0 at 680 nm od680 nm 2 0 and the inoculum size was kept at 10 v v prajapati et al 2014a the experiments were carried out for 15 days and an aliquot i e 1 ml from each culture flask was withdrawn at a three day interval after the growth period 15 days the microalgal biomass was harvested through centrifugation at 2459 g rcf relative centrifugal force for 8 min and biomass pellets were collected the harvested biomass was then washed thrice with deionized water through repeated cycles of resuspension and centrifugation finally the washed pelletized biomass was dried at 105 c for three hours in a hot air oven and powdered in a mortal pestle the dried biomass powder was then used for elemental and biochemical analysis 2 4 algal growth and biomass estimation the algal growth was estimated in terms of biomass concentration g l 1 and chlorophyll content chl a µg ml 1 the biomass concentration was determined using the calibration curve derived from the dry cell weight and absorbance at 680 nm od680 nm the freshly grown algal culture was diluted in distilled water in various concentrations namely 2 4 6 8 and 10 ml to yield a total volume of 10 ml the absorbance of these samples was measured at 680 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv vis lambda 365 perkinelmer usa the homogenized algal samples were filtered through a pre weighed 70 mm whatman s glass microfiber filter gf c and dried for 4 h at 105 c after drying the filter paper s ultimate weight was recorded and the dry cell weight was calculated using eq 1 1 d r y c e l l w t g l w f w i sample volume where wi and wf are the initial and final weight of filter paper mg finally a calibration curve between absorbance and dry cell weight was created the algal biomass concentration g l 1 and biomass productivity bp were then calculated using calibration curve eq 2 and eq 3 respectively 2 b i o m a s s c o n c g l 0 3513 a 0 0661 r 2 0 989 3 b p m g l day b f b i t f t i where bi and bf are the initial and final biomass concentrations in mg l 1 respectively and ti is the initial and tf is the final time in days the standard methodology reported by porra et al 1989 was followed for extraction and estimation of chlorophyll in brief a 1 ml algal sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 4436 g rcf and pellets were collected the pellet was then resuspended in 1 ml methanol and incubated for 30 min in a water bath at 60 c the sample was then allowed to cool down at room temperature finally the optical density of the algal sample was measured at 652 nm 665 2 nm and 670 nm chlorophyll chl a was measured using the following eq 4 4 c h l a μ g m l 16 29 a 665 2 a 750 8 54 a 652 a 670 where0 chl a is the chlorophyll content in µg ml 1 a652 a665 2 and a670 are the absorbance at 652 nm 665 2 nm and 670 nm respectively 2 5 elemental and biochemical analyses of biomass the elemental composition of the microalgal biomass was determined using a chns o analyzer elementar vario el iii us briefly the dried algal powder 2 5 mg was combusted at 1000 c and after complete combustion the biomass gets reduced to elemental gasses co2 h2o n2 and so2 the combusted products were subsequently separated using a chromatographic column finally the gasses were detected and quantified by the thermal conductivity detector the carbohydrate content of the biomass was estimated using the phenol sulphuric acid method dubois et al 1951 in brief 10 mg dried algal biomass was added to a clean vial containing 5 ml 2 5 n hcl the vials were then heated at 100 c for 3 h the hydrolyzed algal biomass was allowed to cool to ambient temperature afterward the vials were neutralized with sodium carbonate finally cell debris was removed from the treated biomass by centrifuging it at 4436 g rcf for 10 min and the supernatant was collected for sugar measurement after that 1 ml of phenol solution 5 v v was added to each tube containing 1 ml of the sample reagent black and glucose standard and mixed thoroughly subsequently 5 ml of h2so4 98 was added to each test tube then the solution was kept at room temperature for 10 min followed by 25 min incubation at 25 c in a water bath at last the absorbance of the sample was measured at 490 nm using a uv visible spectrophotometer perkinelmer lamda 365 and the sugar content was calculated lee et al 2010 using the calibration curve eq 5 5 s u g a r m g l a 490 0 0167 0 0107 where a490 is the absorbance at 490 nm lipid was extracted and estimated using the modified bligh and dyer s method lee et al 2010 the algal slurry of 2 g l 1 concentration was prepared by adding 10 ml deionized water to 20 mg dried algal biomass the algal suspension was subjected to microwave treatment at 750 w power for 5 min in a microwave oven and cooled down at room temperature the chloroform and methanol 1 2 ratio were then added to the reaction vials for lipid extraction then the suspension was mixed thoroughly and kept at room temperature for an hour later 5 ml water was added to the solution and the suspension was kept under stationary conditions at room temperature until the organic layers separated and settled to the bottom the organic layer containing lipid and chloroform was then carefully collected and the total volume was recorded following that a known volume of the organic layer was placed in a pre weighed aluminum foil cup placed in a hot air oven at 105 c for two hours to vaporize the chloroform at last the weight of lipid containing dried aluminum foil was noted and the lipid content expressed as a percentage of dried algal biomass was calculated using eq 6 6 l i p i d m g f w f f w i v t v a where fwi and fwf are the initial and final weight of the aluminum foil cup in mg respectively vt and va are the total volumes of the organic layer and the aliquot in ml the final lipid productivity was calculated using eq 7 as described by dickinson et al

multiplying the elemental nitrogen content with the nitrogen to a protein conversion factor of 6 25 kumar et al 2017 2 6 statistical analysis the experiments were performed in triplicates unless stated otherwise and the data are reported as mean values with standard deviations mean sd n 3 or with error bars in the graphs 3 result and discussion 3 1 growth study of c pyrenoidosa in ro reject supplemented media the selected doses of the ror1 showed varying effects on microalgal growth the growth profiles of microalgae c pyrenoidosa cultivated in ror1 media 0 100 are shown in fig 1 during the first 6 days of growth no significant differences in biomass concentration were observed however 6th day onwards the different doses of ror1 showed different patterns in the biomass concentration profiles fig 1a overall during 15 days of growth the highest biomass concentration was recorded in the media supplemented with 25 ror1 biomass concentration 1 27 0 06 g l 1 followed by 50 ror1 biomass concentration 1 25 0 07 g l 1 the corresponding biomass productivity mg l 1 d 1 achieved were 81 40 2 22 and 80 98 3 59 respectively interestingly the biomass concentration and productivities obtained in the present work were at par with the values recorded in the bg11 1 29 0 09 g l 1 and 82 66 6 29 mg l 1 d 1 respectively furthermore the obtained biomass productivity of c pyrenoidosa in ror1 supplemented media was around 1 5 times higher than that reported by zhou et al 2020 in municipal wastewater however ror1 supplementation beyond 50 led to a progressive decrease in resultant biomass and the lowest biomass productivity i e 53 33 4 65 mg l 1 d 1 was attained with 100 ror1 negative control though the final microalgal biomass in 100 ror1 negative control was the lowest among all the tested sets it was nevertheless higher than the biomass reported for c pyrenoidosa in municipal wastewater he et al 2021 likewise matos et al 2021 observed similar outcomes when spirulina platensis was grown in inland desalination concentrate dc and they also found the lowest biomass concentration in 100 dc i e 0 86 0 08 g l 1 henceforth the current observation and comparison with literature evidenced that microalgal growth relies on the subjected environmental conditions and the growth medium used hence in a nutshell it can be concluded that the ror1 can efficiently be utilized as a nutrient source to reduce the requirement of commercial nutrient media by 50 the chlorophyll chl a profile of c pyrenoidosa was in line with the biomass concentration profile fig 1b the maximum chl a concentration 14 52 0 17 mg l 1 was attained on the 12th day in 50 ror1 supplemented media followed by the positive control bg11 13 44 0 63 mg l 1 on the other hand chl a content of the biomass in 100 ror1 negative control was substantially low 2 79 0 35 mg l 1 it is noteworthy that chlorophyll a nitrogenous pigment promotes microalgal growth through photosynthesis and acts as an intracellular nitrogen reserve to drive cell proliferation and biomass production umamaheswari et al 2020 therefore algal cells acquire higher chlorophyll pigments in nitrogen rich media whereas the chlorophyll pigments get reduced under nitrogen deficiency in addition the phosphorous concentration also affects pigment synthesis by altering photosynthetic efficiency huang et al 2021 therefore the decline in chlorophyll content was possible due to lesser nitrogen n and phosphorous p availability 6 76 0 29 and 2 5 0 13 mg l 1 respectively in ror1 table 1 compared to nutrient media such as bg11 n 0 247 g l 1 p 0 543 g l 1 thus the current statistics evidenced that the nutrient concentration in growth media significantly affects the microalgal growth and cellular composition therefore optimizing media composition and growth parameters is crucial for producing high density algal biomass 3 2 elemental and biochemical composition the algal biomass was harvested after 15 days culturing period and the dried algal biomass was analysed for determining their biochemical composition the elemental composition of the microalgae is shown in table 2a the carbon content in the microalgal cells grown in ror1 supplemented media was more or less comparable to that of the bg11 positive control the carbon content in 75 ror1 was highest 51 18 0 44 representing a 6 39 improvement over the bg11 positive control despite this there was no discernible variation in carbon content among the tested media compositions higher ror1 concentrations on the other hand resulted in a more remarkable fall in n content in algal cells since the nitrogen availability in the growth medium has a direct impact on the algal cellular nitrogen content zhao et al 2019 for example the reduction in n content in 25 ror1 was just 5 85 compared to the bg11 positive control but it was substantially larger i e 58 92 in negative control 100 ror1 likewise a reduction in algal cellular protein was detected with increasing ror1 concentration fig 2 the microalgae grown in bg11 positive control had the highest protein content 40 63 0 81 followed by 38 22 2 47 34 0 38 32 38 2 75 and 16 69 0 13 protein content in 25 50 75 and 100 ror1 respectively in comparison to the bg11 positive control 5 94 58 92 reduction in algal protein was noticed in the ror1 containing media which resembled the variation in nitrogen content additionally the drop in cellular nitrogen reduces cellular nitrogen rich components such as chlorophyll amino acids proteins and nucleotides under nitrogen stress conditions these cellular components get degraded to form ammonium to perform other metabolic biosynthesis processes chen et al 2020 in contrast the microalgae grown in ror1 added media showed higher lipid and carbohydrate content than the positive control bg11 fig 2 despite the slight increase in carbohydrate content a significant enhancement in lipid content was noticed at all the media compositions the microalgae c pyrenoidosa exhibited a maximum lipid content of 28 85 3 13 in 50 ror1 medium which was almost twice the positive control bg11 followed by 24 76 1 99 lipid in 75 ror1 media further the lipid productivity of c pyrenoidosa at all the tested concentrations of ror1 is tabulated in table 2 b notably the observed enhancement in lipid content and lipid productivity were either at par with or higher than the reported values in the literature for instance matos et al 2015 reported the highest 12 6 lipid accumulation in algal biomass when the nannochloropsis gaditana was grown in desalination concentrate mixed f 2 media furthermore the lipid accumulation recorded by tan et al al 2019 in microalgae c pyrenoidosa in the anaerobically digested starch wastewater and secondary treated starch wastewater was 60 83 and 37 61 lesser than that recorded in the present work 50 ror1 respectively the variation in carbohydrate content at different doses of ror1 was relatively low 1 7 7 except the negative control 100 ror1 fig 2 with a slight enhancement of 1 7 over the positive control bg11 a maximum carbohydrate content of 315 3 1 69 mg g 1 was obtained at 25 ror1 at the same time the highest reduction 28 59 in carbohydrate content was recorded with negative control 283 94 4 49 mg g 1 moreover in continuation to the earlier findings related to biomass productivity and chlorophyll content the carbohydrate and lipid production in 100 ror1 media were also lowest possibly due to insufficient nutrient availability to support microalgal growth and metabolic cycles 3 3 feasibility assessment of commercial ro plant reject for algae cultivation in the second phase the ro reject from a commercial ro plant ror2 was tested to examine the broader scale applicability of ror for mass scale algae cultivation the 50 and 75 ror2 concentrations were selected along with the bg11 and ror2 alone as a positive and negative control noticeably the outcomes of ror2 media analysis backed up previous research on ror1 as shown in fig 3 the ror2 can stimulate microalgal growth when the concentration was 50 whereas when the ror2 concentration was 75 and 100 negative control it could inhibit the growth of microalgae c pyrenoidosa among the different ror2 doses the microalgal growth was relatively promoted at 50 ror2 with a maximum biomass concentration and biomass productivity of 1 37 0 07 g l 1 and 87 23 3 23 mg l 1 d 1 respectively in addition a maximal 13 19 0 36 mg l 1 chlorophyll chl a content was also found at 50 ror2 among the tested doses however the highest chlorophyll content 14 35 0 49 mg l 1 was observed with bg11 alone positive control it is noticeable that the net biomass attained at 50 ror2 was either higher or at par with the reported values for microalgae cultivated in different wastewater table 3 for instance rana and prajapati 2021a reported biomass concentration up to 1 1 g l 1 when c pyrenoidosa was grown in synthetic wastewater likewise in biochar supplemented dye solution the microalgae c pyrenoidosa showed maximum biomass productivity of 17 63 mg l 1 d 1 approximately 5 times lower than recorded in 50 ror2 media behl et al 2019 conversely tan et al 2019 found 31 37 higher biomass in anaerobically digested starch wastewater than noted in 50 ror2 furthermore a detailed comparative study is presented in table 3 the carbon content of the biomass did not change with the varying concentration of ror2 in the media table 4 a thus with a moderate enhancement of 2 46 over the positive control the maximum carbon content of 50 37 0 05 was obtained in 50 ror2 similar to the previous findings of ror1 a drop of 35 23 65 35 in nitrogen content over the bg11 positive control was recorded at different ror2 concentrations as a result a reduction in biomass protein content was noted with a rising concentration of ror2 fig 4 the recorded protein content in 50 75 and 100 ror2 negative control was 29 75 0 31 23 84 0 31 and 15 91 0 41 respectively in addition a remarkably high lipid containing biomass could be obtained in ror2 media with slightly reduced carbohydrate content fig 4 resembling the outcomes of the ror1 medium the microalgae also exhibited a maximum lipid content of 33 23 3 92 and lipid productivity of 28 98 2 79 mg l 1 d 1 in 50 ror2 which was approximately 2 3 times higher than that in the positive control furthermore the lipid content in ror2 100 was 19 13 3 14 increased by 33 78 over the positive control bg11 moreover lipid productivity was only 9 81 1 32 mg l 1 d 1 owing to the lowest biomass productivity 51 27 6 48 mg l 1 d 1 the microalgal biomass and lipid productivity at different ror2 doses are summarized in table 4 b the present findings revealed that a higher lipid accumulation in microalgae is possible when ror2 supplemented growth media is used compared to other wastewater reported in the literature for instance in an outdoor study umamaheswari et al 2020 found 27 47 lipid accumulation in microalgae c pyrenoidosa in the paddy soaked wastewater which was 18 68 lesser than the microalgal lipid content in 50 ror2 furthermore a detailed comparative study of c pyrenoidosa biomass and lipid accumulation in different media types is summarized in table 3 it is well known that the cultural and environmental variables directly influence microalgal growth and biological activity the availability of nutrients particularly nitrogen and phosphorous carbon sources temperature light intensity photoperiod and salinity derives the biological cycles and thus the biochemical composition of microalgae sajjadi et al 2018 it is noteworthy that high lipid containing biomass is a widely recognized biofuel biodiesel precursor however the commercialization of algal biofuel is restricted due to higher production costs lower biomass and lipid productivity renuka et al 2021 thus various biomass and lipid enhancement strategies have been investigated in the past few years table 5 for example gao et al al 2019 observed a maximum of 118 56 lipid enhancement after varying the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the municipal wastewater similarly liu et al 2021 found iron and acetate supplemented municipal wastewater suitable for significantly enhancing the lipid content of c pyrenoidosa 248 enhancement liu et al 2021 varying culture conditions i e ph light intensity photoperiod nutrients supplementation limitation co culturing with bacteria and genetic modification are some of the approaches which have been explored by various researchers for improving microalgal biomass and lipid content ge et al 2018 rai et al 2013 sachdeva et al 2016 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 overall the recent studies targeting lipid enhancement infer that microalgal lipid accumulation can be enhanced by altering growth conditions and or nutrient composition in addition the present findings also reveal that under nutrient stress conditions especially nitrogen and phosphorous limitation higher algal lipid accumulation occurs therefore an optimized ror derived algal biomass could be a source of such a high value product it is noteworthy that there have been significant advancements in the area of algal biomass harvesting some of the promising methods for recovering the algal biomass after cultivation includes the bioharvesting using filamentous fungi bhattacharya et al 2017 prajapati et al 2016 2014b ph assisted biomass settling mehta and chakraborty 2021 pérez et al 2017 and nanoparticle mediated harvesting fu et al 2021 mubarakali 2019 furthermore extraction and recovery of these high value biofuel precursors can further be improved by adopting advanced efficient and low cost green pretreatment techniques such as microwave treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis bhushan et al 2021 rana and prajapati 2021b implementing such cost effective green approaches for the recovery of biomass and lipid from microalgae grown in ror will further help to attain economic sustainability on a commercial scale the preliminary results showed that the use of ror as growth media could effectively reduce freshwater demand in mass scale algae cultivation table 6 further the usage of ror will assist in minimizing its handling and treatment cost thus to assure wider scale acceptability of the present work the water footprint for algal biomass production was theoretically calculated notably only the direct water consumption for algae cultivation was taken into consideration for estimating the water footprint the theoretical analysis states that around 742 03 m3 freshwater water will be required to produce a targeted 1000 kg of dried algal biomass table 6 however the water footprint of algae cultivation can be cut down to half 364 43 m3 when 50 ror2 is be used as growth media interestingly 1230 45 m3 of ror2 100 ror2 will be sufficient to completely cut down freshwater demand for cultivating c pyrenoidosa consequently the application of ror seems a sustainable approach for wastewater recycling and minimizing the natural water stress condition hence in a nutshell it can be concluded that microalgae can grow in domestic as well as commercial ror and biochemically enriched biomass can be obtained furthermore the proposed methodology will help in attaining economic sustainability on a commercial scale by reducing the freshwater and nutrient demand additionally it will also reduce the ror treatment and algae cultivation costs therefore the ror can be considered as a suitable media for mass scale algae cultivation for biofuel production 4 conclusions the present study concluded that the microalgae c pyrenoidosa could thrive in both domestic as well commercial scale ror the 50 ror dose was found optimal to improve the algal biomass productivities while in comparison to bg11 2 03 and 2 32 folds enhanced lipid was achieved in ror1 and ror2 respectively in addition the final biomass had a good amount of pigments chlorophyll a proteins and carbohydrate content in conclusion among the tested ror dosages 50 ror had the greatest impact on microalgal biomass growth and lipid production therefore the ro rejects water mediated biomass cultivation as a sustainable and novel approach for producing biochemical rich microalgae biomass will broaden the possibilities for more efficient microalgal technology development the foregoing theories however need

the fe iii h2o2 system were evaluated for smx removal fig 1 a illustrates ncnt 1 95 01 and ncnt 2 98 67 can strongly boost the fe iii h2o2 system and almost completely remove smx compared to the low reactivity of undoped cnt cnt600 34 06 although no significant structural property change occurs during n doping modification fig s1 the increase of sbet can also partly enhance the adsorption of smx

min 1 are 1 93 9 01 folds than that of cnt600 0 009 min 1 k obs is linearly depended on the proportion of nitrogen r2 0 927 fig 1b and table s3 therefore above results demonstrate n doping can significantly enhance the reactivity of cnt to boost fenton oxidation the recent surge in aops shows metal free carbon materials especially n doped cnt can oxidize organic contaminants by activating persulfate via non radical pathway nimai et al 2020 therefore the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system was compared with the ncnt 1 pms system toward diverse organic contaminants including antibiotics smx and siz drug cbz phenols bpa and pe phthalate esters dmp and dep dyes ao7 and mb and other aromatic compounds ba and nb as shown in fig 1c and s2 the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system exhibits excellent and non selective oxidation capacities to oxidize all of these organic contaminants with entirely different molecular structures however the ncnt 1 pms system shows selective oxidation capabilities which can only oxidize organic compounds with electron rich moieties smx siz bpa pe ao7 and mb but not for the refractory contaminants cbz dep dmp ba and nb specifically the k obs of contaminant removal in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system are 1 4 207 7 times more than those of the ncnt 1 pms system additionally the apparent kinetic model by analyzing the interdependencies between k obs and dosages of ncnt 1 h2o2 and fe iii illustrates the dominant role of fe iii for contaminant removal in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system which reveals that iron species is critical for inducing the generation of ros text s5 and fig s3 3 2 qualitative and semi quantitative analysis of ros the significant increase of h2o2 depletion in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system 0 37 mm compared with that of the fe iii h2o2 system 0 03

fig 2 a the appearance of the specific quartet lines for dmpooh adduct 1 2 2 1 αn αh 14 9 g confirms the generation of oh the intensity of dmpooh adduct in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system is apparently stronger than those from the cnt600 fe iii h2o2 system and fe iii h2o2 system indicating ncnt 1 can significantly promote iron catalyzed haber weiss cycle to produce oh moreover ipa k ipa oh 2 3 109 m

1988 therefore ba was selected as the chemical probe to semi quantitatively analyze the production of oh by detecting characteristic products p ba derived from oh induced hydroxylation of ba lai et al 2018 fig 2c depicts 3 13 μm p ba could be detected with the consumption of 42 79 μm ba 42 79 at 60 min in the fe iii h2o2 system while ncnt 1 can enhance oxidation of ba 97 87 μm 97 87 to produce 7 30 μm p ba in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system based on above results ncnt 1 can forcefully promote the fe iii h2o2 system to produce oh resulting in non selective oxidation of a wide variety of organic contaminants figs s5 s7 moreover the controversy of main ros oh or fe iv in iron mediated fenton fenton like reactions has been going on since the discovery of fenton reagent based on the opposite results from theoretical calculations and actual chemistry tests bataineh et al 2012 buda et al 2001 mignon et al 2012 yamamoto et al 2012 although oh is the most widely accepted ros for oxidizing organic compounds in classical fenton system at acidic conditions changeover from oh to fe iv can also partly occur at ph 6 7 1 10 by employing pmso as the probe of fe iv the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system can significantly degrade pmso but without obvious generation of pmso2 fig 2d demonstrating few fe iv can be produced wang et al 2021 3 3 ncnt induced sustainable and green fe iii fe ii conversion based on recent literatures metal free carbonaceous materials can promote iron mediated fenton fenton like oxidation by expediting fe iii fe ii cycles via two approaches i the formation of iron complex by chelating with iron to regulate the potential of fe iii fe ii complex couple and avoid undesirable precipitation of fe iii species e g fullerol graphene oxide and functionalized cnt cheng et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2020d ii donating electrons for reduction of fe iii e g the persistent free radicals of biochar and the reducing group of powdered activated carbon and cnt fang et al 2014 seo et al 2015 fig 3 a demonstrates that almost no iron species is adsorbed on the surface of ncnt 1 revealing the insignificant role of ncnt 1 for chelating with iron species however ncnt 1 is capable of directly reducing fe iii into fe ii specifically 13 21 μm fe ii was produced in the ncnt 1 fe iii system at 60 min additionally more dissolved fe ii can also be detected in the n doped carbons fe iii system compared with those carbons without n doping fig s8 nevertheless the relatively low removal efficiency of smx in the fenton system fe ii h2o2 with the addition of 13 21 μm fe ii demonstrates other possible approaches for ncnt to promote fenton oxidation fig s9 in classical fenton chain reactions h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii to produce fe ii and superoxide radical ho2 h o2 pka 4 8 zhou et al 2020b via eq 2 is recognized as the rate limiting step however few studies focus on the strategies to boost the reactivity of fe iii for accelerating eq 2 to produce fe ii as the specific product of fe iii induced oxidation of h2o2 the generation of ho2 dmpoho2 αn 14 2 g αn 11 2 g and αh 1 3 g was obviously enhanced in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system by comparison with the cnt600 fe iii h2o2 system and the fe iii h2o2 system fig 3b shao et al 2021 therefore it is another potential routine for ncnt to promote fenton oxidation by reinforcing the oxidation capability of fe iii based on these results ncnt may enhance the fenton oxidation via two approaches i ncnt as electron donor to directly reduce fe iii ii ncnt enhance the reactivity of fe iii to promote h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii 3 3 1 role of carbonyl groups for direct reduction of fe iii these above findings of fe iii reduction by ncnt initiate speculation on the role of electron donating moieties on surface of ncnt and oxygen functional groups are reported as the active sites to donating electrons cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the c 1 s xps and ftir spectra demonstrate the existence of oxygen functional groups oh cooh and c o in ncnt zhang et al 2020 therefore the role of surface oxygen functional groups for reducing fe iii was investigated the content of carbonyl on surface of ncnt increases with the growth of n doped amount fig s10 while the ft ir signal of carbonyl on surface of ncnt 1 disappears after 6 cycling tests in the ncnt 1 h2o2 fe iii system fig s11 it indicates the high potential of carbonyl as the electron donating moiety to promote fe iii fe ii conversion asri et al 2021 boily et al 2010 moreover to further confirm the contribution of carbonyl for fe iii reduction brpe bad and ph were used to shield cooh oh and c o on surface of ncnt 1 respectively cheng et al 2019 the low reactivity of ncnt ph for reducing fe iii fig 4 a and a good linear correlation between carbonyl ratio and fe ii regeneration fig 4b r2 0 962 further prove that carbonyl is the dominant electron supplier for fe iii reduction seo et al 2015 however the k obs of smx removal does not linearly depend on the content of carbonyl r2 0 864 probably implying that carbonyl induced fe iii reduction is not the only approach for boosting fenton oxidation in the ncnt fe iii h2o2 system fig 4c moreover it is distinct from common reducing agents ha and boron for ubiquitously enhancing fenton like activation of peroxides h2o2 pds and pms by reducing fe iii and ncnt 1 has the significant dependence on h2o2 in modified fenton like systems for oxidizing refractory contaminants ba and dep fig 4d chen et al 2011 zhou et al 2021b combining the longer o o bond length of h2o2 1 471 å than pds 1 222 å and pms 1 326 å h2o2 is easier to donate electrons for reducing fe iii by cleaving o o bonds duan et al 2015a therefore ncnt may elevate the reactivity of fe iii to promote the reaction between fe iii and h2o2 to initiate fenton chain reactions in which h2o2 as electron donors 3 3 2 role of near free fe iii for long lasting fe iii fe ii cycles with h2o2 as electron donors although h2o2 can be used as the electron donor for reduction of fe iii eq 2 its sluggish kinetics restricts the rapid and long lasting generation of oh based on the potential route of ncnt for promoting h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii the reactivity of fe iii on the surface of ncnt was analyzed by xps eds and ocp fig 3a depicts almost all fe species exists in the dissolved form in the fe iii ncnt 1 system demonstrating obviously low ability of ncnt 1 to adsorb and chelate fe species fe iii and fe ii however xps fe 2p spectra and eds mapping of the original and reacted ncnt manifest that the existence of trace fe iii on the surface of ncnt figs 5 a and s12 therefore the fe iii mainly exists in the free state but ncnt 1 may also weakly bind with fe iii species to elevate reactivity of fe iii species ocp tests were then conducted to analyze the reactivity of fe iii on surface of ncnt the oxidation potential of fe iii on glassy carbon electrode gce is 0 428 v which is enhanced to 0 552 v on the ncnt 1 coated gce fig 5b therefore nitrogen modified cnt has the ability for elevating the oxidation potential of fe iii and it is also a common property of n doped carbon materials fig 5c three typical n doped carbon materials ng nab and ncnf can boost the fe iii h2o2 system and significantly promote the removal of smx compared to undoped carbon materials fig s13 hence the existence of highly active fe iii species near free fe iii on the surface of ncnt was testified moreover distribution of fe iii species k obs of smx removal and ocp of fe iii species at ph 2 0 6 0 were comparatively analyzed for identifying the predominant form of near free fe iii for enhancing fenton oxidation fig 5d depicts that feoh2 is the primary fe iii species at ph 2 5 3 5 based on the result of visual minteq and the solution ph changes slightly during the reaction progress fig s14 moreover well fitted curves between feoh2 distribution and k obs of smx removal reveal feoh2 is the main fe species for initiating fenton chain reactions fig 5e and oh is primarily produced via fenton reaction between fe2 and h2o2 fig s15 zhou et al 2020c surprisingly fig 5f shows the potential of fe iii on the ncnt 1 coated gce is higher than that on glassy carbon electrode with ph ranging from 2 8 to 3 8 which is correspond with the ph range of highly efficient smx removal and high proportion of feoh2 eqs 5 and 6 therefore ncnt 1 can elevate the oxidation potential of near free fe iii in the form of feoh2 h2o2 can serve as the electron donor to easily reduce fe iii into fe ii which initiates fenton chain reactions for sustainable generation of oh 5 fe iii ncnt near free fe iii 6 h2o2 near free fe iii ho2 h fe ii 3 4 nitrogen doped cnt mediated sustainable fenton oxidation ncnt is not only an electron sacrificer but also a sustainable mediator for reducing fe iii the elevation of the oxidation potential of fe iii enhances the reaction between near free fe iii and h2o2 and initiates sustainable fenton oxidation fig 6 a indicates the smx removal efficiency almost remained 100 0 after 11 cycling tests in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system in contrast consequential loss of smx removal ability emerges in the ncnt 1 pms system during consecutive runs fig 6b owing to pms induced loss of active site e g nitrogen doping sites conjugation of carbon network defective sites oxygen functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials e g cnt and graphene yu et al 2020 the inactivation of catalysts during cycling tests is the main drawback of heterogeneous aops xps fig s10 ftir fig s11 and raman fig s16 results reveal the surface functional groups and structural defects id ig of ncnt 1 change slightly after multiple usage which demonstrates its high stability in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system the stability of ncnt 1 is consistent with the high and stable k obs of smx removal in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system during cycling tests therefore the near free fe iii on the surface of ncnt is beneficial to sustainable fe iii fe ii cycles which avoids irreversible destruction of ncnt structure morphology defect and surface functional group for long lasting and high efficiency fenton oxidation liu et al 2021b recently metal free carbon materials e g cnt graphene and biochar and heteroatom doped derivatives induced aops for high efficiency degradation of target contaminants reflect the optimism of carbon materials in environmental remediation duan et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however most carbon materials mediated aops such as activation of persulfates show selective oxidation capabilities and can only degrade some contaminants with electron rich moieties meanwhile the inactivation of carbon materials after multiple usage does not meet the requirement of sustainable future of environmental chemistry duan et al 2015b lee et al 2020 to our delight the ncnt fe iii h2o2 system exhibits non selective oxidation capability towards a wide variety of organic contaminants due to ncnt can elevate the reactivity of fe iii species to enhance fenton chain reactions with h2o2 as the electron donor ncnt is not primarily an electron sacrificer but an electron mediator and ncnt thus shows high stability during cycling tests fig 6 therefore the ncnt boosted fenton oxidation shows high potential for green sustainable and non selective environmental remediation 3 5 dft calculation dft calculations were further performed to shed light on the theoretical insights of near free fe iii for initiating fenton chain reactions li et al 2018 fig 7 a e show the fully relaxed atomic configurations of fe iii on four cnt models cnt feoh2 graphitic ncnt feoh2 pyridinic ncnt feoh2 and pyrrolic ncnt feoh2 with the corresponding adsorption energies eads and fe o bond length of feoh2 as shown in fig 7e the fe o bond lengths of near free feoh2 on surface of cnt and ncnt are raised from 164 pm to 174 177 pm compared with that of the free feoh2 molecular thus the fe atom of near free feoh2 is more electron deficient which causes high capability of near free feoh2 to abstract electrons from h2o2 for accelerating reaction rate of eq 2 fig 7f although carbon sites of pristine cnt and graphitic n sites of ncnt can also enhance fe o bond lengths of near free feoh2 the higher eads of pyridinic n 3 518 ev and pyrrolic n 3 828 ev towards feoh2 reveals that pyridinic pyrrolic n are the primary sites for enhancing the reactivity of feoh2 moreover feoh2 weakly binds with cnt and then lead to the in situ generation of fe ii and ho2 between feoh2 and h2o2 via eq 2 thereby the rate determining step of fe iii reduction is the release of ho2 from cnts feoh2 2 ho2 hence the activation energies for releasing ho2 on various sites of pristine cnt and ncnt were calculated to further figure out the contributions of nitrogen sites for fe iii reduction fig s17 the relatively lower energy barriers of ho2 release on graphitic n 3 549 ev and pyridinic n 3 521 ev reflects that the occurrence of fe iii reduction is more flexible on these two kinds of nitrogen sites fig 7g and table s4 therefore dft calculation results reveal that nitrogen sites on the surface of ncnt especially pyridinic n and pyrrolic n are the primary active sites to elevate the oxidation capability of feoh2 by enhancing the fe o bond lengths which can further overcome the energy barriers of h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii in addition the high stability of nitrogen on the surface of ncnt after cycling tests fig s18 indicates nitrogen sites of ncnt can induce sustainable fenton chemistry with h2o2 as the electron donor based on above experimental and theoretical results ncnt can enhance fenton oxidation by accelerating fe iii reduction via two approaches fig 7h i carbonyl groups of ncnt donate electrons to reduce fe iii ii nitrogen sites on the surface of ncnt to elevate the oxidation potential of near free fe iii which significantly accelerate h2o2 induced fe iii reduction via eq 2 near free fe iii with high reactivity overcomes the energy barriers of fe iii reduction with h2o2 acting as the electron donor therefore ncnt can enhance the oxidation capability of the fe iii h2o2 system to degrade a wide array of organic contaminants with excellent stability meanwhile oh is still the primary ros produced by fenton reaction between fe2 and h2o2 in the ncnt fe iii h2o2 system fig s19 and table s5 besides the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system exhibits high capability for smx removal in real water matrixes indicating nitrogen doped carbon materials enhanced fenton oxidation has practical significance for the environmental remediation fig s20 4 conclusions sluggish kinetics of reaction between h2o2 and fe iii eq 2 is the rate limiting step of the fenton system seeking for sustainable and green strategies of promoting fe iii reduction is the primary theme for long lasting fenton chemistry in this study we found that the metal free ncnt can sustainably enhance fenton oxidation to oxidize multifarious organic contaminants due to the generation of oh although the carbonyl groups of ncnt can directly reduce fe iii as electron sacrificers it cannot achieve steady fe iii reduction on account of the limited content of carbonyl groups meanwhile ncnt cannot significantly enhance fenton like activation of persulfates for oxidizing refractory organic contaminants like common reducing agents ha and boron the n atoms doped into the matrix of a sp2 bonded carbon skeleton boost the polarization of neighboring carbon atom charge without significant lattice mismatches which will cause a relatively long fe o bond length of feoh2 on the surface of ncnt resulting in higher oxidation potential of near free fe iii the primary innovation and contribution of this study is to put forward the highly active near free fe iii on the surface of ncnt and h2o2 can induce fast reduction of near free fe iii for green and sustainable fenton chemistry without external energies and co catalysts to our delight it is not a unique phenomenon for ncnt nitrogen doping can universally enhance the capabilities of diversified carbon materials g ab and cnf to elevate the reactivity of near free fe iii therefore this work represents a novel strategy to boost fenton oxidation by in situ elevating the reactivity of fe iii to overcome the rate

lin et al 2012 wang et al 2015 therefore ncnt may also enhance the reactivity of surface fe iii and reactions between h2o2 electron donor and surface fe iii eq 2 are hypothesized to initiate long

reactivity of undoped cnt cnt600 34 06 although no significant structural property change occurs during n doping modification fig s1 the increase of sbet can also partly enhance the adsorption of smx

min 1 are 1 93 9 01 folds than that of cnt600 0 009 min 1 k obs is linearly depended on the proportion of nitrogen r2 0 927 fig 1b and table s3 therefore above results demonstrate n doping can significantly enhance the reactivity of cnt to boost fenton oxidation the recent surge in aops shows metal free carbon materials especially n doped cnt can oxidize organic contaminants by activating persulfate via non radical pathway nimai et al 2020 therefore the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system was compared with the ncnt 1 pms system toward diverse organic contaminants including antibiotics smx and siz drug cbz phenols bpa and pe phthalate esters dmp and dep dyes ao7 and mb and other aromatic compounds ba and nb as shown in fig 1c and s2 the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system exhibits excellent and non

ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system are 1 4 207 7 times more than those of the ncnt 1 pms system additionally the apparent kinetic model by analyzing the interdependencies between k obs and dosages of ncnt 1 h2o2 and fe iii illustrates the dominant role of fe iii for contaminant removal in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system which reveals that iron species is critical for inducing the generation of ros text s5 and fig s3 3 2 qualitative and semi quantitative analysis of ros the significant increase of h2o2 depletion in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system 0 37 mm compared with that of the fe iii h2o2 system 0 03

fig 2 a the appearance of the specific quartet lines for dmpooh adduct 1 2 2 1 αn αh 14 9 g confirms the generation of oh the intensity of dmpooh adduct in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system is apparently

1988 therefore ba was selected as the chemical probe to semi quantitatively analyze the production of oh by detecting characteristic products p ba derived from oh induced hydroxylation of ba lai et al 2018 fig 2c depicts 3 13 μm p ba could be detected with the consumption of 42 79 μm ba 42 79 at 60 min in the fe iii h2o2 system while ncnt 1 can enhance oxidation of ba 97 87 μm 97 87 to produce 7 30 μm p ba in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system based on above results ncnt 1 can forcefully promote the fe iii h2o2 system to produce oh resulting in non selective oxidation of a wide variety of organic contaminants figs s5 s7 moreover the controversy of main ros oh or fe iv in iron mediated fenton fenton like reactions has been going on since the discovery of fenton reagent based on the opposite results from theoretical calculations and actual chemistry tests bataineh et al 2012 buda et al 2001 mignon et al 2012 yamamoto et al 2012 although oh is the most widely accepted ros for oxidizing organic compounds in classical fenton system at acidic conditions changeover from oh to fe iv can also partly occur at ph 6 7 1 10 by employing pmso as the probe of fe iv the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system can significantly degrade pmso but without obvious generation of pmso2 fig 2d demonstrating few fe iv can be produced wang et al 2021 3 3 ncnt induced sustainable and green fe iii fe ii conversion based on recent literatures metal free carbonaceous materials can promote iron mediated fenton fenton like oxidation by expediting fe iii fe ii cycles via two approaches i the formation of iron complex by chelating with iron to regulate the potential of fe iii fe ii complex couple and avoid undesirable precipitation of fe iii species e g fullerol graphene oxide and functionalized cnt cheng et al 2021 yang et al 2018 zhou et al 2020d ii donating electrons for reduction of fe iii e g the persistent free radicals of biochar and the reducing group of powdered activated carbon and cnt fang et al 2014 seo et al 2015 fig 3 a demonstrates that almost no iron species is adsorbed on the surface of ncnt 1 revealing the insignificant role of ncnt 1 for chelating with iron species however ncnt 1 is capable of directly reducing fe iii into fe ii specifically 13 21 μm fe ii was produced in the ncnt 1 fe iii system at 60 min additionally more dissolved fe ii can also be detected in the n doped carbons fe iii system compared with those carbons without n doping fig s8 nevertheless the relatively low removal efficiency of smx in the fenton system fe ii h2o2 with the addition of 13 21 μm fe ii demonstrates other possible approaches for ncnt to promote fenton oxidation fig s9 in classical fenton chain reactions h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii to produce fe ii and superoxide radical ho2 h o2 pka 4 8 zhou et al 2020b via eq 2 is recognized as the rate limiting step however few studies focus on the strategies to boost the reactivity of fe iii for accelerating eq 2 to produce fe ii as the specific product of fe iii induced oxidation of h2o2 the generation of ho2 dmpoho2 αn 14 2 g αn 11 2 g and αh 1 3 g was obviously enhanced in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system by comparison with the cnt600 fe iii h2o2 system and the fe iii h2o2 system fig 3b shao et al 2021 therefore it is another potential routine for ncnt to promote fenton oxidation by reinforcing the oxidation capability of fe iii based on these results ncnt may enhance the fenton oxidation via two approaches i ncnt as electron donor to directly reduce fe iii ii ncnt enhance the reactivity of fe iii to promote h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii 3 3 1 role of carbonyl groups for direct reduction of fe iii these above findings of fe iii reduction by ncnt initiate speculation on the role of electron donating moieties on surface of ncnt and oxygen functional groups are reported as the active sites to donating electrons cheng et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the c 1 s xps and ftir spectra demonstrate the existence of oxygen functional groups oh cooh and c o in ncnt zhang et al 2020 therefore the role of surface oxygen functional groups for reducing fe iii was investigated the content of carbonyl on surface of ncnt increases with the growth of n doped amount fig s10 while the ft ir signal of carbonyl on surface of ncnt 1 disappears after 6 cycling tests in the ncnt 1 h2o2 fe iii system fig s11 it indicates the high potential of carbonyl as the electron donating moiety to promote fe iii fe ii conversion asri et al 2021 boily et al 2010 moreover to further confirm the contribution of carbonyl for fe iii reduction brpe bad and ph were used to shield cooh oh and c o on surface of ncnt 1 respectively cheng et al 2019 the low reactivity of ncnt ph for reducing fe iii fig 4 a and a good linear correlation between carbonyl ratio and fe ii regeneration fig 4b r2 0 962 further prove that carbonyl is the dominant electron supplier for fe iii reduction seo et al 2015 however the k obs of smx removal does not linearly depend on the content of carbonyl r2 0 864 probably implying that carbonyl induced fe iii reduction is not the only approach for boosting fenton oxidation in the ncnt fe iii h2o2 system fig 4c moreover it is distinct from common reducing agents ha and boron for ubiquitously enhancing fenton like activation of peroxides h2o2 pds and pms by reducing fe iii and ncnt 1 has the significant dependence on h2o2 in modified fenton like systems for oxidizing refractory contaminants ba and dep fig 4d chen et al 2011 zhou et al 2021b combining the longer o o bond length of h2o2 1 471 å than pds 1 222 å and pms 1 326 å h2o2 is easier to donate electrons for reducing fe iii by cleaving o o bonds duan et al 2015a therefore ncnt may elevate the reactivity of fe iii to promote the reaction between fe iii and h2o2 to initiate fenton chain reactions in which h2o2 as electron donors 3 3 2 role of near free fe iii for long lasting fe iii fe ii cycles with h2o2 as electron donors although h2o2 can be used as the electron donor for reduction of fe iii eq 2 its sluggish kinetics restricts the rapid and long lasting generation of oh based on the potential route of ncnt for promoting h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii the reactivity of fe iii on the surface of ncnt was analyzed by xps eds and ocp fig 3a depicts almost all fe species exists in the dissolved form in the fe iii ncnt 1 system demonstrating obviously low ability of ncnt 1 to adsorb and chelate fe species fe iii and fe ii however xps fe 2p spectra and eds mapping of the original and reacted ncnt manifest that the existence of trace fe iii on the surface of ncnt figs 5 a and s12 therefore the fe iii mainly exists in the free state but ncnt 1 may also weakly bind with fe iii species to elevate reactivity of fe iii species ocp tests were then conducted to analyze the reactivity of fe iii on surface of ncnt the oxidation potential of fe iii on glassy carbon electrode gce is 0 428 v which is enhanced to 0 552 v on the ncnt 1 coated gce fig 5b therefore nitrogen modified cnt has the ability for elevating the oxidation potential of fe iii and it is also a common property of n doped carbon materials fig 5c three typical n doped carbon materials ng nab and ncnf can boost the fe iii h2o2 system and significantly promote the removal of smx compared to undoped carbon materials fig s13 hence the existence of highly active fe iii species near free fe iii on the surface of ncnt was testified moreover distribution of fe iii species k obs of smx removal and ocp of fe iii species at ph 2 0 6 0 were comparatively analyzed for identifying the predominant form of near free fe iii for enhancing fenton oxidation fig 5d depicts that feoh2 is the primary fe iii species at ph 2 5 3 5 based on the result of visual minteq and the solution ph changes slightly during the reaction progress fig s14 moreover well fitted curves between feoh2 distribution and k obs of smx removal reveal feoh2 is the main fe species for initiating fenton chain reactions fig 5e and oh is primarily produced via fenton reaction between fe2 and h2o2 fig s15 zhou et al 2020c surprisingly fig 5f shows the potential of fe iii on the ncnt 1 coated gce is higher than that on glassy carbon electrode with ph ranging from 2 8 to 3 8 which is correspond with the ph range of highly efficient smx removal and high proportion of feoh2 eqs 5 and 6 therefore ncnt 1 can elevate the oxidation potential of near free fe iii in the form of feoh2 h2o2 can serve as the electron donor to easily reduce fe iii into fe ii which initiates fenton chain reactions for sustainable generation of oh 5 fe iii ncnt near free fe iii 6 h2o2 near free fe iii ho2 h fe ii 3 4 nitrogen doped cnt mediated sustainable fenton oxidation ncnt is not only an electron sacrificer but also a sustainable mediator for reducing fe iii the elevation of the oxidation potential of fe iii enhances the reaction between near free fe iii and h2o2 and initiates sustainable fenton oxidation fig 6 a indicates the smx removal efficiency almost remained 100 0 after 11 cycling tests in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system in contrast consequential loss of smx removal ability emerges in the ncnt 1 pms system during consecutive runs fig 6b owing to pms induced loss of active site e g nitrogen doping sites conjugation of carbon network defective sites oxygen functional groups on the surface of carbon based materials e g cnt and graphene yu et al 2020 the inactivation of catalysts during cycling tests is the main drawback of heterogeneous aops xps fig s10 ftir fig s11 and raman fig s16 results reveal the surface functional groups and structural defects id ig of ncnt 1 change slightly after multiple usage which demonstrates its high stability in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system the stability of ncnt 1 is consistent with the high and stable k obs of smx removal in the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system during cycling tests therefore the near free fe iii on the surface of ncnt is beneficial to sustainable fe iii fe ii cycles which avoids irreversible destruction of ncnt structure morphology defect and surface functional group for long lasting and high efficiency fenton oxidation liu et al 2021b recently metal free carbon materials e g cnt graphene and biochar and heteroatom doped derivatives induced aops for high efficiency degradation of target contaminants reflect the optimism of carbon materials in environmental remediation duan et al 2018 yu et al 2020 however most carbon materials mediated aops such as activation of persulfates show selective oxidation capabilities and can only degrade some contaminants with electron rich moieties meanwhile the inactivation of carbon materials after multiple usage does not meet the requirement of sustainable future of environmental chemistry duan et al 2015b lee et al 2020 to our delight the ncnt fe iii h2o2 system exhibits non selective oxidation capability towards a wide variety of organic contaminants due to ncnt can elevate the reactivity of fe iii species to enhance fenton chain reactions with h2o2 as the electron donor ncnt is not primarily an electron sacrificer but an electron mediator and ncnt thus shows high stability during cycling tests fig 6 therefore the ncnt boosted fenton oxidation shows high potential for green sustainable and non selective environmental remediation 3 5 dft calculation dft calculations were further performed to shed light on the theoretical insights of near free fe iii for initiating fenton chain reactions li et al 2018 fig 7 a e show the fully relaxed atomic configurations of fe iii on four cnt models cnt feoh2 graphitic ncnt feoh2 pyridinic ncnt feoh2 and pyrrolic ncnt feoh2 with the corresponding adsorption energies eads and fe o bond length of feoh2 as shown in fig 7e the fe o bond lengths of near free feoh2 on surface of cnt and ncnt are raised from 164 pm to 174 177 pm compared with that of the free feoh2 molecular thus the fe atom of near free feoh2 is more electron deficient which causes high capability of near free feoh2 to abstract electrons from h2o2 for accelerating reaction rate of eq 2 fig 7f although carbon sites of pristine cnt and graphitic n sites of ncnt can also enhance fe o bond lengths of near free feoh2 the higher eads of pyridinic n 3 518 ev and pyrrolic n 3 828 ev towards feoh2 reveals that pyridinic pyrrolic n are the primary sites for enhancing the reactivity of feoh2 moreover feoh2 weakly binds with cnt and then lead to the in situ generation of fe ii and ho2 between feoh2 and h2o2 via eq 2 thereby the rate determining step of fe iii reduction is the release of ho2 from cnts feoh2 2 ho2 hence the activation energies for releasing ho2 on various sites of pristine cnt and ncnt were calculated to further figure out the contributions of nitrogen sites for fe iii reduction fig s17 the relatively lower energy barriers of ho2 release on graphitic n 3 549 ev and pyridinic n 3 521 ev reflects that the occurrence of fe iii reduction is more flexible on these two kinds of nitrogen sites fig 7g and table s4 therefore dft calculation results reveal that nitrogen sites on the surface of ncnt especially pyridinic n and pyrrolic n are the primary active sites to elevate the oxidation capability of feoh2 by enhancing the fe o bond lengths which can further overcome the energy barriers of h2o2 induced reduction of fe iii in addition the high stability of nitrogen on the surface of ncnt after cycling tests fig s18 indicates nitrogen sites of ncnt can induce sustainable fenton chemistry with h2o2 as the electron donor based on above experimental and theoretical results ncnt can enhance fenton oxidation by accelerating fe iii reduction via two approaches fig 7h i carbonyl groups of ncnt donate electrons to reduce fe iii ii nitrogen sites on the surface of ncnt to elevate the oxidation potential of near free fe iii which significantly accelerate h2o2 induced fe iii reduction via eq 2 near free fe iii with high reactivity overcomes the energy barriers of fe iii reduction with h2o2 acting as the electron donor therefore ncnt can enhance the oxidation capability of the fe iii h2o2 system to degrade a wide array of organic contaminants with excellent stability meanwhile oh is still the primary ros produced by fenton reaction between fe2 and h2o2 in the ncnt fe iii h2o2 system fig s19 and table s5 besides the ncnt 1 fe iii h2o2 system exhibits high capability for smx removal in real water matrixes indicating nitrogen doped carbon materials enhanced fenton oxidation has practical significance for the environmental remediation fig s20 4 conclusions sluggish kinetics of reaction between h2o2 and fe iii eq 2 is the rate limiting step of the fenton system seeking for sustainable and green strategies of promoting fe iii reduction is the primary theme for long lasting fenton chemistry in this study we found that the metal free ncnt can sustainably enhance fenton oxidation to oxidize multifarious organic contaminants due to the generation of oh although the carbonyl groups of ncnt can directly reduce fe iii as electron sacrificers it cannot achieve steady fe iii reduction on account of the limited content of carbonyl groups meanwhile ncnt cannot significantly enhance fenton like activation of persulfates for oxidizing refractory organic contaminants like common reducing agents ha and boron the n atoms doped into the matrix of a sp2 bonded carbon skeleton boost the polarization of neighboring carbon atom charge without significant lattice mismatches which will cause a relatively long fe o bond length of feoh2 on the surface of ncnt resulting in higher oxidation potential of near free fe iii the primary innovation and contribution of this study is to put forward the highly active near free fe iii on the surface of ncnt and h2o2 can induce fast reduction of near free fe iii for green and sustainable fenton chemistry without external energies and co catalysts to our delight it is not a unique phenomenon for ncnt nitrogen doping can universally enhance the capabilities of diversified carbon materials g ab and cnf to elevate the reactivity of near free fe iii therefore this work represents a novel strategy to boost fenton oxidation by in situ elevating the reactivity of fe iii to overcome the rate limiting step of fenton chain reactions we hope our work can stimulate the researchers to focus on the highly active near free fe iii for green and sustainable fenton chemistry declaration of

16353,the baltic sea receives substantial amounts of hazardous substances and nutrients which accumulate for decades and persistently impair the baltic ecosystems with long half lives and high solubility anthropogenic uranium isotopes 236u and 233u are ideal tracers to depict the ocean dynamics in the baltic sea and the associated impacts on the fates of contaminants however their applications in the baltic sea are hampered by the inadequate source term information this study reports the first three dimensional distributions of 236u and 233u in the baltic sea 2018 2019 and the first long term hindcast simulation for reprocessing derived 236u dispersion in the north baltic sea 1971 2018 using 233u 236u fingerprints we distinguish 236u from the nuclear weapon testing and civil nuclear industries which have comparable contributions 142 13 and 174 40 g to the 236u inventory in modern baltic seawater budget calculations for 236u inputs since the 1950s indicate that the major 236u sources in the baltic sea are the atmospheric fallouts 1 35 kg and discharges from nuclear reprocessing plants 211 g and there is a continuous sink of 236u to the anoxic sediments 589 43 g our findings also indicate that the limited water renewal endows the baltic sea a strong memory effect retaining aged 236u signals and the previously unknown 236u in the baltic sea is likely attributed to the retention of the mid 1990s discharges from the nuclear reprocessing plants our preliminary results demonstrate the power of 236u 129i dual tracer in investigating water mass mixing and estimating water age in the baltic sea and this work provides fundamental knowledge for future 236u tracer studies in the baltic sea graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords baltic sea

promising candidates with long radioactive half lives i e no decay correction needed and high solubility in addition the reverse temporal discharging trends from the reprocessing plants between 129i

combination of 129i and 236u has been used to quantify the circulation timescale of atlantic waters in the arctic ocean casacuberta et al 2016 wefing et al 2021 and can be potentially applied for estimating the ages of the saline inflowing waters from the north sea to the baltic sea which were only calculated by three dimensional 3d ocean models meier 2007 2005 but not verified by any

yi et al 2013a 2013b 2011 but little information is known about 236u during the atomic era significant amounts of 236u have been released into the environment by human nuclear activities 236u is

2012 casacuberta et al 2014 and the authorized discharges from the reprocessing plants 260 kg castrillejo et al 2020 however the ubiquitous gf derived 236u interferes with the point source released reprocessing derived 236u in observations christl et al 2015a until recently the accessible measurement of another anthropogenic uranium isotope 233u t u 233 0 16 ma in environmental samples by

past observations of 236u and 233u in the baltic sea are scarce qiao et al 2017 and lin et al 2021b investigated the levels and distribution of 236u in the danish coastal waters and temporal evolution of 236u and 233u in the central baltic sea respectively they demonstrated that the baltic sea receives 236u from both gf and reprocessing plants a follow up study by qiao et al 2021 reported the distributions of 236u and 233u in the surface waters of the baltic sea and suggested an unknown local nr derived 236u source e g the undocumented discharges from local nuclear facilities or accidental leakages from nuclear waste dumping however there are still many knowledge gaps of the 236u and 233u in the baltic sea e g their 3d distributions major input output fluxes and budgets in seawater in addition pinpointing the source of the unknown nr derived 236u in the baltic sea requires further investigation to ease the public concern on radiological safety hence systematic observations of 236u and 233u become the prerequisite of their tracer applications in the baltic sea in this work we present the first dataset of 3d distribution of 236u and 233u in the modern baltic sea 2018 2019 using the novel 233u 236u signature we aim to locate the source terms of 236u and quantify their contributions to the total 236u budget in the baltic seawater by combining observation and numerical modeling we also seek to uncover the transport and mixing processes related to the dispersion of nr derived 236u from the north sea to the baltic sea thus providing a better understanding of the dynamics and fates of contaminants in the baltic sea 2 material and methods 2 1 seawater sampling to investigate the spatial distributions of 236u and 233u in the baltic sea 125 seawater samples were collected from 35 stations depth files in the baltic sea during 2018 2019 table 1 the scientific expeditions were carried out by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi the national institute of aquatic resources at technical university of denmark dtu aqua the finnish environment institute and radiation and nuclear safety authority syke and stuk and the leibniz institute for baltic sea research warnemünde iow germany based on the sampling periods and geographical distribution these samples could be grouped into three transects transect 1 from the skagerrak to western gotland basin in the winter of 2018 transect 2 from the bothnian bay to the gulf of finland in the summer of 2019 and transect 3 from the arkona basin to the western gotland basin in the winter of 2019 fig 1 the sampling area covers all major regions of the baltic sea including the transition zone between the north sea and baltic sea skagerrak kattegat and danish straits the southern baltic sea region arkona basin bornholm basin and south baltic proper the middle baltic sea region northern baltic proper western gotland basin and eastern gotland basin and the northern baltic sea region archipelago sea åland sea bothnian sea bothnian bay and gulf of finland to facilitate the presentation of results and discussions we identified six water masses in the baltic sea based on the salinity and geographical locations in the transition zone the atlantic water salinity 34 5 jutland coastal water salinity 32 34 5 and baltic inflowing outflowing water salinity 15 32 are three dominating water masses aarup et al 1996 the atlantic water dominates the bottom of skagerrak and kattegat and originates from a southeastward branch of the norwegian atlantic current expanding along the slope of the norwegian trench andersson 2007 the jutland coastal water is comprised of the central southern north sea waters and the runoff influenced english channel water which transports waters from the southern north sea to the transition zone by the jutland coastal current aure 1998 the main body of the baltic sea is separated by a permanent halocline into the baltic bottom water salinity 9 15 and baltic surface water salinity 5 9 which are influenced by the saline inflows from the transition zone less saline brackish water from the northern baltic region and large freshwater supply from the rivers the baltic freshwater salinity 5 is mainly distributed in the bothnian bay and the estuary of neva river in the gulf of finland 2 2 determination of 238u 236u and 233u 238u concentrations in seawater samples were directly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 8800 icp qqq after 20 50 times dilution for the determination of ultra trace levels of 236u and 233u an optimized radiochemical separation procedure was utilized to extract uranium isotopes from 4 5 9 l seawater samples qiao et al 2015 lin et al 2021c which is detailed in supporting information procedure blanks in a total of nineteen were prepared in every batch typically seven samples of analysis using ultrapure water following the same analytical procedure special measures were implemented to reduce the backgrounds of 236u and 233u including purification of chemicals utilization of laminar flow bench and acid boiling for glassware lin et al 2021c less than 1 95 ng of 238u 2 79 106 atoms of 236u and 8 94 103 atoms of 233u were detected in the procedure blanks which were negligible compared to the uranium isotopes measured in our seawater samples the accelerator mass spectrometry measurements of the atomic ratios of 236u 238u and 233u 238u were carried out at the vienna environmental research accelerator vera facility in the university of vienna using the established setup and method for actinides steier et al 2019 hain et al 2020 238u was also used as an intrinsic tracer to obtain the chemical yield of uranium which was on an average of 70 in this work the robustness of the analytical method was verified by repeatedly analyzing a quality control sample 2018184 baltic seawater provided by the federal maritime and hydrographic agency of germany together with the seawater samples in this work lin et al 2021c the background subtraction and uncertainty calculation for the actual uranium concentrations and isotope ratios are detailed in supporting information 2 3 hindcast simulation in this work a 3d ocean circulation model hiromb boos model hbm was applied to simulate the dispersion of reprocessing derived 236u in the north baltic sea more details of the hbm

berg and poulsen 2012 she and murawski 2018 murawski et al 2021 the model has three nested layers 1 a 2d barotropic model covering the north atlantic shelf sea in 6 nautical mile resolution to provide wind induced sea level for the 3d regional model 2 a 3d north baltic sea model in 3 nautical mile resolution which is two way nested with two high resolution sub domains 3 two 0 5 nautical mile model sub domains in the wadden sea and the transition zone between the north sea and the baltic sea the dynamic two way nesting with high resolution is essential for resolving the narrow danish straits and simulating the water exchange between the north sea and the baltic sea she et al 2007 two point sources were set for the two european reprocessing plants at la hague and sellafield the annual discharges of 236u from two point sources were based on the reconstructed data from shell records by castrillejo et al 2020 and a constant discharge rate was assumed for each point source within a specific year as sellafield is located out of the north baltic sea domain the corresponding point source was moved to the upper left corner of the domain a loss rate of 50 and a lag time of 1 year were assumed for the transport of 236u from sellafield to its new location as suggested by christl et al 2015b the model was simulated from 1971 to 2018 and validated with the observed nr derived 236u

correlation with salinity r2 0 999 fig 2 a in the surface waters depth 10 m of the baltic sea the intercept of linear fitting suggested an average riverine 238u concentration of 0 06 μg kg however compared to the calculated 238u concentrations from the surface 238u salinity correlation negative offsets were apparent avg 15 for measured 238u concentrations in the sulfidic deep waters of the central baltic sea and the offsets showed a strong connection with sulfide concentrations fig 2b and c the measured 236u 238u and 233u 238u atomic ratios 2 42 25 8 10 9 and 1 42 22 5 10 11 respectively in the baltic seawater collected in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than their natural background ratios of 10 14 10 10 and 10 14 10 11 respectively steier et al 2008 hain et al 2020 suggesting the dominance of anthropogenic 236u and 233u in the baltic sea 236u 238u and 233u 238u atomic ratios in this work were comparable to the reported values in baltic surface waters in 2014 2015 5 47 52 4 10 9 and 0 77 28 6 10 11 respectively qiao et al 2021 the obtained 236u 238u 14 8 16 6 10 9 and 233u 238u 7 60 9 82 10 11 atomic ratios in the bottom waters of the gotland basin and the landsort deep were also consistent with the values 14 5 16 3 10 9 and 7 54 10 8 10 11 respectively previously determined in the 2018 segments of sediment cores collected at the same sites lin et al 2021b the measured 236u 1 99 8 75 107 atoms kg and 233u 1 31 3 73 105 atoms kg concentrations in this study were also similar to the previously determined levels in the surface waters of the baltic sea in 2011 2016 3 31 12 5 107 atoms kg and 0 46 5 63 105 atoms kg respectively qiao et al 2017 2021 a comparison of currently available 236u datasets fig 3 indicated that the north sea and the baltic sea have higher 236u concentrations than the inflowing eastern north atlantic central waters to the north sea as the eastern north atlantic central waters solely carry gf signal castrillejo et al 2018 the elevated 236u concentrations in the north sea and the baltic sea should be attributed to the regional sources i e reprocessing plants the 236u concentrations in the baltic sea were slightly lower than those in the north sea and relatively high 236u concentrations 5 107 atoms kg were observed in the jutland coastal water baltic inflowing outflowing water and part of baltic bottom water along the passage from the danish straits to the gotland basin fig 4 suggesting the transport of 236u from the north sea to the baltic sea the 233u concentrations were distributed within a narrow range 2 15 3 50 105 atoms kg throughout the baltic sea with slightly lower levels in the atlantic water and baltic freshwater 3 2 levels and distributions of 233u 236u atomic ratios gf derived and nr derived 236u concentrations the atomic ratios of 233u 236u in the baltic sea were within 0 18 0 97 10 2 in 2018 2019 reflecting contributions of 236u from both gf and nr sources higher 233u 236u atomic ratios as observed in the bothnian bay indicated higher relative contributions of gf derived 236u whereas lower 233u 236u atomic ratios in the jutland coastal water baltic inflow water and baltic bottom water reflected the relatively strong influences of nr derived 236u in the transition zone and southern baltic region fig 5 using 233u 236u atomic ratio in a binary mixing algorithm consisting of gf derived 236u 233u 236u 1 40 10 2 and nr derived 236u 233u 236u 10 6 as endmembers the gf derived and nr derived 236u concentrations in all seawater samples were calculated see details in supporting information which varied within 0 93 2 66 107 and 0 61 6 90 107 atoms kg respectively fig 5 in the brackish waters of the baltic sea baltic inflowing outflowing water baltic surface water and baltic bottom water the gf derived 236u concentrations 1 48 2 66 107 atoms kg were evenly distributed whereas the freshwater and saline sources atlantic water and jutland coastal water had slightly lower gf derived 236u concentrations 0 93 1 66 107 atoms kg the gf derived 236u concentrations 1 8 2 5 107 atoms kg in the surface waters of the central baltic sea in 2018 2019 were consistent with the reported values 1 2 3 9 107 atoms kg in 2011 2016 qiao et al 2021 however these concentration values were much higher than the representative gf levels in the surface water of the open ocean 0 8 107 atoms kg christl et al 2012 and simulated concentrations in the north sea in the 2010s 0 7 1 1 107 atoms kg christl et al 2015b derived from a global surface ocean model higher nr derived 236u concentrations 4 21 9 59 107 atoms kg mainly occurred in the sub surface layer of the skagerrak and kattegat as well as the bottom inflows along transects from the danish straits to the northern baltic proper the lowest nr derived 236u concentrations 0 61 1 31 107 atoms kg were observed in the bothnian bay and the bottom of skagerrak predominated by the baltic freshwater and atlantic water respectively 3 3 inventories of 236u and 233u in the modern baltic sea based on the observation data in 2018 2019 we extrapolated the spatial distributions of 236u and 233u concentrations as well as gf derived and nr derived 236u concentrations throughout the baltic sea using a 3d estimation tool in ocean data view 5 3 0 the 3d estimation was implemented as a fast weighted averaging procedure and used a specified high resolution topography dataset of the baltic sea latitude 1 longitude 2 depth 5 m seifert et al 2001 the total dissolved 236u and 233u inventories in the modern baltic seawater were thereby estimated to be 316 25 g and 1 96 0 25 g respectively the gf derived and nr derived 236u accounted for 44 9 4 2 142 13 g and 55 1 13 0 174 40 g of the total 236u in the baltic sea respectively 4 discussions 4 1 behaviors of u in the baltic sea the mixing diagram of 238u concentration vs salinity fig 2a indicates that uranium has conservative behaviors in the oxic waters e g surface waters of the baltic sea where uranium is present in vi oxidation state as highly soluble uranyl carbonate complexes djogić et al 1986 however in the middle and northern baltic sea regions 10 20 of 238u was scavenged from the sulfidic deep waters in 2018 2019 and this fraction could be up to 40 reported by anderson et al 1989 and dellwig et al 2021 the baltic bottom water is permanently hypoxic and periodically anoxic as its renewal only relies on the irregularly strong barotropic inflow events or so called major baltic inflows carstensen et al 2014 meier et al 2019 the recent investigations on the water column and sediments of the central baltic sea dellwig et al 2021 lin et al 2021b suggested that the uranium depletion in sulfidic waters arises from the redox driven processes in the water column and diagenesis driven removal in the sediment 1 the soluble u vi in the water column can be reduced to insoluble u iv by sulfides and deposited on the seabed as particulate forms anderson et al 1989 and 2 the dissolved uranium can be removed from the sulfidic porewaters into sediments leading to a diffusion of dissolved uranium from bottom waters to the porewaters barnes and cochran 1990 klinkhammer and palmer 1991 lovley et al 1991 the major baltic inflows can temporally oxygenate the euxinic baltic bottom water suppress the removal of uranium from the water column and remobilize a part of the scavenged uranium in the surface sediments 20 50 leading to a release of uranium from the uppermost porewaters to the water column dellwig et al 2021 however the remobilization of sedimentary uranium is quite limited and temporal which slightly elevates the 238u concentrations in the near seabed waters dellwig et al 2021 the uranium depletion recurs after the reestablishment of the bottom euxinia in the central baltic sea region dellwig et al 2021 the baltic sediments in the anoxic sub basins generally act as a net sink for natural and anthropogenic uranium isotopes our previous investigation on the baltic sediments indicated that 589 43 g of 236u gf derived 266 5 g nr derived 323 43 g were scavenged from the baltic seawater to the sediments lin et al 2021b the comparable atomic ratios of 236u 238u 233u 238u and 233u 236u section 3 1 between the bottom waters and surface sediments in the central baltic sea revealed no significant isotopic fractionation for uranium during the scavenging processes the 233u 236u atomic ratio is not affected by the scavenging processes and thus can still be used as a robust signature for tracing the water mass movement and identifying emission sources of anthropogenic uranium hain et al 2020 qiao et al 2020b 4 2 source terms of 236u in the baltic sea in addition to a negligible natural background the majority of 236u in the baltic sea originates from gf related and nr related sources and enters the baltic sea through various pathways the gf derived 236u in the modern baltic seawater is potentially from 1 the dissolution of the directly deposited gf derived 236u on the baltic sea 2 the riverine inputs of gf derived 236u deposited on the catchment and 3 the oceanic transport of dissolved gf derived 236u in the north sea via baltic inflows the nr derived 236u in the modern baltic seawater may be attributed to 1 the marine transport of reprocessing derived 236u from the north sea 2 the dissolved 236u fallouts from the chernobyl accident both in baltic seawater and river waters from the catchment and 3 unreported discharges from local nuclear facilities or accidental leakages from dumped nuclear wastes in the following subsections we will further discuss the specific sources inputs and sinks outputs of gf derived and nr derived 236u investigate their related transport and mixing processes and perform the budget calculations for them respectively 4 3 nr derived 236u in the baltic sea 4 3 1 major inputs of nr derived 236u our recent study on the baltic sediments indicated that the 236u fallouts from the chernobyl accident were very limited in the baltic region and little chernobyl derived 236u was dissolved in the baltic seawater lin et al 2021b even though our earlier findings suggested a potential unaccounted nr derived 236u source in the baltic sea qiao et al 2021 the observations in 2018 2019 did not demonstrate distinctly high nr derived 236u concentrations in the baltic bottom water or freshwater indicating no significant releases of nr derived 236u from the local nuclear facilities or dumped nuclear wastes to the modern baltic sea both the spatial distribution of nr derived 236u fig 5 and the mixing diagram of nr derived 236u vs salinity fig 6 a suggested that the nr derived 236u in the modern baltic seawater should be mainly from the north sea more specifically two reprocessing plants rather than other riverine or benthonic sources 4 3 2 transport and mixing of nr derived 236u the nr derived 236u vs salinity diagram revealed that there were three endmembers for nr derived 236u in the baltic sea fig 6a the first endmember was the saline atlantic water characterized by low nr derived 236u concentrations 2 107 atoms kg the second endmember was the slightly less saline water jutland coastal water with high and variable nr derived 236u concentrations 3 5 16 107 atoms kg constrained by the upper and lower boundaries for the potential mixing lines red and blue dot lines in fig 6a the third endmember was the brackish baltic surface water with relatively constant nr derived 236u concentrations 1 5 3 5 107 atoms kg likely arising from the long residence time of saline water in the baltic sea due to the limitations in sampling frequency and spatial resolution the mixing diagram lost many details in the transition zone and southern baltic sea region to elaborate further on the transport mixing processes affecting nr derived 236u distribution the 3d ocean model hbm was used to simulate the dispersion of 236u discharges from sellafield and la hague it should be noted that there are methodological difficulties in distinguishing nr derived 236u from the reprocessing plants and those from other civil nuclear facilities in the observations but only the former ones were considered in our simulation for a more accurate description we prefer to use the term reprocessing derived 236u to represent nr derived 236u from the reprocessing plants in the simulation results the simulated water column results for 128 stations in the north baltic sea drew a full picture for the dispersion of reprocessing derived 236u by oceanic circulation fig s1 in the north sea higher 236u concentrations were restricted in the near shore areas rather than the central and northern regions by the coastal current transports 236u from sellafield and la hague was advected to the southern north sea by the scottish coastal current and english channel current respectively and further to the skagerrak along the western european coastline by jutland coastal current which agreed with the previous observations christl et al 2017 2015a upon arrival at the skagerrak the jutland coastal water tagged by reprocessing derived 236u was sandwiched into the surface brackish outflowing water and the bottom saline atlantic water due to the density stratification which was also confirmed by the earlier findings aarup et al 1996 dahlgaard et al 1995 stedmon et al 2010 the numerical modeling resolved an open question related to the mixing of nr derived 236u why the jutland coastal water had a variable endmember of nr derived 236u concentration fig 6a the jutland coastal water is a combination of the central southern north sea water and the english channel water aure 1998 thereby its endmember is determined by 1 the nr derived 236u concentrations in the central southern north sea water and english channel water and 2 the fractions of central southern north sea water and the english channel water the nr derived 236u concentrations in both central southern north sea water and english channel water were kept relatively stable during 2018 2019 as 236u discharge rates from two reprocessing plants were generally constant since the 2010s our recent investigation on the water mass compositions in the transition zone indicated that the fraction of the north sea water has negligible inter seasonal variability whereas obvious seasonality is observed in the fraction of the english channel water lin et al 2021a driven by the predominant southwesterly winds in the north sea more english channel water along with la hague derived 236u flows into the skagerrak in winter and vice versa in summer aure 1998 the variations in the simulated reprocessing derived 236u concentrations 6 19 107 atoms kg of jutland coastal water in 2018 were consistent with our observations 3 5 16 107 atoms kg and higher concentrations were observed in winter fig 7 a in addition both our observation and numerical modeling results revealed that the vertical mixings between the intermediate less saline jutland coastal water carrying relatively higher reprocessing signals and the bottom more saline atlantic water surface relatively fresh baltic outflowing water in the transition zone caused the inverted v shaped mixing lines 4 3 3 long term dynamics of nr derived 236u the long term exchange of nr derived 236u between the north sea and the baltic was investigated by the temporal evolution of simulated inventories in both seas as the 236u discharges from the two reprocessing plants have decreased since the 1970s fig 7c castrillejo et al 2020 our hindcast simulation revealed a significant decline of reprocessing derived 236u concentrations in the jutland coastal water fig 7b and the decreasing inventories of nr derived 236u in the north sea fig 7d from the max 42 7 kg to 1 52 kg and baltic sea fig 7e from the max 624 g to 211 g in recent 40 years the decrease of nr derived 236u was much slower in the baltic sea than the north sea owing to a much longer water residence time in the baltic sea 30 years than the north sea 1 2 years the narrow and shallow channels of the danish straits restrict the bottom saline inflows driven by either the horizontal density gradients observed in summer feistel et al 2006 or storms mainly in winter mohrholz 2018 limited water renewal endows the baltic sea with a strong memory effect and favors trapping the aged pollutions in the central baltic sea the numerical modeling indicated that by the end of 2018 up to 57 of reprocessing derived 236u present in the baltic sea originated from the discharges before 1990 in contrast almost 100 of reprocessing derived 236u in the north sea was released within the recent 30 years in the hbm model even though the endmember for the jutland coastal water varied largely for individual inflows the monthly imported exported reprocessing derived 236u was marginal 10 compared to the nr derived 236u budget of the baltic sea since the 1990s and could not significantly change the endmember for the baltic surface water this was also supported by our observations on the central baltic sea where the distribution of nr derived 236u was relatively even figs 5 and 6a qiao et al 2021 estimated that the unknown local source contributed 200 47 g of nr derived 236u to the baltic sea which was at the same level as the total nr derived 236u inventory obtained in this work considering the notable differences in sampling scales periods depths and locations endmember settings and modeling approaches between the two studies fig s2 and table s2 the unknown source of nr derived 236u is likely the aged reprocessing derived 236u trapped in the central baltic sea the direct evidence is the much lower 129i nr derived 236u atomic ratios in the surface waters of the middle baltic sea region 113 370 than those of the transition zone 1202 2608 in 2015 qiao et al 2021 our preliminary estimation suggested that the saline fraction of the surface waters of the central baltic sea carried at least 20 years older reprocessing signals than the saline waters of the transition zone fig s3 which generally agreed with the simulated water age results by meier 2007 the endmember of jutland coastal water for the aged reprocessing signal should be much higher than that for the modern signal leading to the large deviation of 236u 238u atomic ratios in the surface of the central baltic sea between the observations and the calculated results by the endmember mixing model adopted in our previous work qiao et al 2021 4 3 4 budget calculation for nr derived 236u our budget calculation indicates a net input of 211 g of reprocessing derived 236u to the baltic sea and 323 43 g of nr derived 236u scavenged from the baltic seawater to the sediments during 1971 2018 table 2 in general there was a surplus of 174 211 323 286 g for the observed inventory of nr derived 236u 174 40 g in the modern baltic seawater which most likely originate from the underestimated inputs from sellafield due to the lack of its discharge history before 1970 castrillejo et al 2020 and the undocumented discharges from the local nuclear facilities the overall 236u budget scheme in the modern baltic sea 2018 2019 is shown in fig 8 the annual net output of nr derived 236u to the north sea was estimated as 11 g year average value during 1981 2018 in hindcast simulation based on the investigation on the baltic sediments the scavenged nr derived 236u was estimated to be 5 3 g year assuming that the scavenging rate of nr derived 236u by the anoxic sediments was 2 7 1011 atom m2 year in 2018 lin et al 2021b and an average hypoxic area of 49 000 km2 in the baltic sea conley et al 2009 therefore the baltic sea lost 5 3 11 16 3 g of nr derived 236u in 2018 considering that the anoxia in the middle baltic sea region will likely persist due to the large legacy of nutrients helcom 2018a the loss of nr derived 236u in the baltic sea water will continue at least in this decade 4 4 gf derived 236u in the baltic sea 4 4 1 major inputs of gf derived 236u the mixing diagram of gf derived 236u vs salinity fig 6b showed slightly higher gf derived 236u concentrations in the brackish waters of the baltic sea baltic surface water baltic bottom water and baltic outflow water than the incoming saline and fresh waters atlantic water jutland coastal water and baltic freshwater this phenomenon suggested that the present gf derived 236u in the main body of the baltic sea did not originate from the current inflowing waters but an old gf derived 236u input unfortunately the historical atmospheric deposition riverine input and oceanic transport of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea are not well constrained due to a lack of observation data therefore we only made a rough estimation for different inputs of gf derived 236u according to the areal inventory of gf derived 236u in the black forest peat core 9 0 1012 atoms m2 quinto et al 2013 the total atmospheric depositions of gf derived 236u on the baltic sea and its catchment were estimated to be 1 4 kg 393 000 km2 and 5 8 kg 1630 000 km2 respectively lin et al 2021b with the predominant deposition occurring in the 1950s 1960s quinto et al 2013 hain et al 2020 ohno et al 2021 for the gf derived 236u deposited on the baltic sea a maximum of 47 g of gf derived 236u directly reached the seabed corresponding to the sedimentary inventory of gf derived 236u before 1970 lin et al 2021b and the rest 1 35 kg should be dissolved in the baltic seawater for the gf derived 236u deposited on the catchment the mixing diagram suggested a low gf derived 236u concentration 107 atoms kg in the river runoff of the baltic sea which was close to the extrapolated level in the elbe river water to the north sea 107 atoms kg christl et al 2017 assuming an average runoff of 454 km3 year johansson 2016 the annual riverine input of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea was estimated to be 1 8 g year in 2018 which was a minor contribution to the modern baltic seawater inventory 266 5 g for oceanic transport a net output of gf derived 236u from the baltic sea to the north sea was estimated over the past five decades see details in section 4 4 2 hence we concluded that the dissolution of deposited gf derived 236u in the baltic seawater should be the major input of gf derived 236u 4 4 2 long term dynamics of gf derived 236u different from the reprocessing derived 236u there are still some knowledge gaps in the historical inputs of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea therefore it was not feasible to perform a long term hindcast simulation for gf derived 236u without reliable input functions instead we used sedimentary records to uncover the temporal evolution of gf derived 236u in the baltic sea the reported gf derived 236u records resolved from coral and sediment cores suggested a general exponential decrease of gf derived 236u in global marine systems since the 1980s winkler et al 2012 sakaguchi et al 2016 nomura et al 2017 lin et al 2021b a comparison fig 6b and c between the simulated gf derived 236u concentrations in the surface layer of the north sea 55 n 5 e data from christl et al 2015b and the reconstructed gf derived 236u concentrations in the bottom waters of the gotland basin and the landsort deep lin et al 2021b revealed a longer effective half life of gf derived 236u in the baltic sea 21 33 years than the north sea 11 years this should also be related to the strong memory effect of the baltic sea similar to nr derived 236u higher gf derived 236u concentrations in the baltic brackish waters might represent the aged gf derived 236u signals trapped in the central baltic sea due to the limited water renewal based on the differences between the simulated level in the north sea and the resolved level in the baltic sea we could roughly estimate the exchange of gf derived 236u between the two seas the annual import of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea was estimated by multiplying the simulated gf derived 236u concentrations in the north sea with the mean baltic inflow 634 km3 year dahlgaard 2002 due to the homogenous distribution of gf derived 236u in the main body of the baltic sea fig 5 and 6b arising from its slow water circulation we assumed that the baltic outflowing water had the same gf derived 236u concentrations as the baltic bottom waters thereby the annual export of gf derived 236u from the baltic sea was calculated by multiplying the resolved concentrations in the central baltic sea with the mean baltic outflow 1107 km3 year dahlgaard 2002 the net decadal flux of gf derived 236u between the two seas was estimated to be 73 13 g 23 15 g 63 18 g 52 2 g and 44 3 g for the past five decades respectively positive negative values represent input to output from the baltic sea in total a net output of gf derived 236u 108 41 g from the baltic sea was obtained during 1971 2018 4 4 3 budget calculation for gf derived 236u regarding the gf derived 236u budget of the baltic sea during 1971 2018 we found a deficit of 1353 108 266 142 837 g for the observed inventory of the modern baltic seawater 142 13 g when taking all available inputs dissolution of the atmospheric deposition 1353 g and outputs oceanic transport 108 41 scavenging process 266 5 into account it should be noted that this deficit could be even larger if there were significant historical riverine inputs an overestimated atmospheric deposition and or an underestimated sedimentary inventory of gf derived 236u in the baltic seawater might be the major contributors to this deficit in 2018 2019 the annual riverine input of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea was estimated to be 1 8 g fig 8 the annual net output of gf derived 236u from the baltic sea was estimated as 5 5 0 3 g based on the aforementioned calculations the annual deposition rate of gf derived 236u to the baltic sediments was estimated to be 3 5 1 5 g lin et al 2021b in summary the baltic sea lost 5 5 3 5 1 8 7 2 1 5 g of gf derived 236u in the year of 2018 similar to the case of nr derived 236u the loss of gf derived 236u in the baltic sea water will likely continue in this decade 5 conclusions and perspectives in this work based on the large scale observation and long term 3d numerical simulation we obtained in depth knowledge on the source terms transport mixing and fate of anthropogenic u in the baltic sea the major findings of this work include 1 the budget calculations for anthropogenic 236u in the modern baltic seawater indicate that the nuclear weapon testing and civil nuclear industries have comparable contributions 142 13 g and 174 40 g primarily via the global atmospheric deposition in the 1950s 1960s and liquid discharges from the european reprocessing plants since the 1970s respectively 2 limited water renewal results in a strong memory effect of the baltic sea retaining the aged 236u signals as well as other pollutants nutrients for decades and the previously unknown nr derived 236u in the baltic sea should be the reprocessing derived 236u discharged in the mid 1990s 3 there is a notable sink of uranium from the water column to anoxic sediments in the baltic sea which is the major contributor to the loss of 236u in the baltic seawater our preliminary results also demonstrate the potentials of reprocessing derived 236u and 129i to trace the water mass movement mixing and estimate the water ages in the baltic sea combining field observations and 3d ocean modeling will enable us to further investigate the transit passages and circulation timescales of saline water in different sub basins of the baltic sea providing fundamental knowledge of the pollutant dynamics in the baltic sea to the decision makers for the environmental management in the baltic region our observations reveal that uranium has unconservative behaviors in the sulfidic waters of the baltic sea however this shortcoming will not affect the robustness of using 233u 236u atomic ratios for tracing the water mass movement and identifying emission sources of anthropogenic uranium in the baltic sea as no significant isotopic fractionation occurs in the uranium scavenging processes besides although the uranium depletion in the central baltic sea may increase the 129i nr derived 236u atomic ratio by up to 66 100 100 40 100 resulting in underestimated water age considering the rapid increase two orders of magnitude of the reprocessing derived 129i 236u atomic ratios in the inflowing waters since the 1970s the introduced uncertainties for the water age estimation is negligible 1 3 years nevertheless for a more accurate prediction of the spatiotemporal distribution of 236u in the baltic sea coupling sedimentation model with 3d ocean model should be considered in the future numerical simulations where parameterization and verification for the uranium scavenging

16353,the baltic sea receives substantial amounts of hazardous substances and nutrients which accumulate for decades and persistently impair the baltic ecosystems with long half lives and high solubility anthropogenic uranium isotopes 236u and 233u are ideal tracers to depict the ocean dynamics in the baltic sea and the associated impacts on the fates of contaminants however their applications in the baltic sea are hampered by the inadequate source term information this study reports the first three dimensional distributions of 236u and 233u in the baltic sea 2018 2019 and the first long term hindcast simulation for reprocessing derived 236u dispersion in the north baltic sea 1971 2018 using 233u 236u fingerprints we distinguish 236u from the nuclear weapon testing and civil nuclear industries which have comparable contributions 142 13 and 174 40 g to the 236u inventory in modern baltic seawater budget calculations for 236u inputs since the 1950s indicate that the major 236u sources in the baltic sea are the atmospheric fallouts 1 35 kg and discharges from nuclear reprocessing plants 211 g and there is a continuous sink of 236u to the anoxic sediments 589 43 g our findings also indicate that the limited water renewal endows the baltic sea a strong memory effect retaining aged 236u signals and the previously unknown 236u in the baltic sea is likely attributed to the retention of the mid 1990s discharges from the nuclear reprocessing plants our preliminary results demonstrate the power of 236u 129i dual tracer in investigating water mass mixing and estimating water age in the baltic sea and this work provides fundamental knowledge for future 236u tracer studies in the baltic sea graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords baltic sea u 236 u 233 tracer pollutant dynamics 1 introduction the baltic sea is a semi enclosed marginal sea in northern europe comprised of a series of shallow sub basins divided by sills the inputs of freshwater from the vast catchment and saline water from the north sea result in a density stratified water structure burchard et al 2005 meier 2007 mohrholz et al 2015 limited water exchange and 30 year water residence time franck et al 1987 make the baltic sea vulnerable to anthropogenic disturbances via river runoff and atmospheric deposition substantial amounts of hazardous substances and nutrients enter the baltic sea and accumulate for decades helcom 2018a through the discharges from the highly populated 85 million residents catchment areas interactions between natural variability anthropogenic pressures and climate change lead to stronger stratification less o2 rich saline inflows and increasing eutrophication and deoxygenation of bottom waters since the 1980s carstensen et al 2014 helcom 2021 slow water circulation plays a significant role in determining the fates of nutrients pollutants in the baltic sea helcom 2018b consequently efforts have been dedicated to using the radionuclides 137cs 99tc 129i and 236u namely those discharged from the two european nuclear reprocessing plants at sellafield and la hague as oceanic tracers to track the formation transport and mixing of water masses in the baltic sea yi et al 2011 qiao et al 2017 2020a 2021 compared with the commonly used tracers in the baltic sea including salinity temperature nutrients and dissolved organic matters aarup et al 1996 højerslev et al 1996 aure 1998 meier 2005 2007 stedmon et al 2010 kristiansen and aas 2015 the reprocessing derived radionuclides are characterized by extremely low natural backgrounds nonequilibrium dispersion states in the ocean and accessible discharge histories in particular their well constrained point source releases are favorable for the hindcast simulations with reliable input functions to depict the large scale and long term hydrodynamics in the baltic sea among the reprocessing derived radionuclides 129i t½ 15 7 ma and 236u t½ 23 4 ma are promising candidates with long radioactive half lives i e no decay correction needed and high solubility in addition the reverse temporal discharging trends from the reprocessing plants between 129i and 236u lead to a monotonic increase of reprocessing derived 129i 236u atomic ratios in the north sea since the 1970s christl et al 2015c making 129i 236u atomic ratio an ideal chronologic tracer the combination of 129i and 236u has been used to quantify the circulation timescale of atlantic waters in the arctic ocean casacuberta et al 2016 wefing et al 2021 and can be potentially applied for estimating the ages of the saline inflowing waters from the north sea to the baltic sea which were only calculated by three dimensional 3d ocean models meier 2007 2005 but not verified by any observation data up to now there have been numerous works about the sources distributions speciation transport and tracer applications of 129i in the baltic sea hou et al 2002 2007 hansen et al 2011 yi et al 2013a 2013b 2011 but little information is known about 236u during the atomic era significant amounts of 236u have been released into the environment by human nuclear activities 236u is mainly produced by thermal neutron capture reaction 235u n γ 236u in nuclear reactors nrs and fast neutron reaction 238u n 3n 236u in nuclear explosions steier et al 2008 sakaguchi et al 2009 as a result the two primary sources of anthropogenic 236u in the environment are global fallout gf from atmospheric nuclear weapons testing 900 2100 kg sakaguchi et al 2009 christl et al 2012 winkler et al 2012 casacuberta et al 2014 and the authorized discharges from the reprocessing plants 260 kg castrillejo et al 2020 however the ubiquitous gf derived 236u interferes with the point source released reprocessing derived 236u in observations christl et al 2015a until recently the accessible measurement of another anthropogenic uranium isotope 233u t u 233 0 16 ma in environmental samples by accelerator mass spectrometry provided a new possibility to discriminate 236u sources between gf and nr hain et al 2020 233u is primarily produced by thermal neutron capture reaction 232th n γ 233u in some thorium based prototype reactors and fast neutron reaction 235u n 3n 233u in nuclear explosions hain et al 2020 in contrast to 236u almost no 233u is produced in commercial nrs and released by reprocessing plants and the only substantial release of 233u 7 15 kg lin et al 2021b is from the tests of 233u fueled devices and thermonuclear weapons using enriched uranium as tamper material hain et al 2020 this difference makes the 233u 236u atomic ratio a source specific fingerprint allowing possible distinction between different emission sources for 236u hain et al 2020 qiao et al 2020b 2021 lin et al 2021b 2021c the representative 233u 236u atomic ratio for the integrated gf signal was suggested to be 1 40 0 15 10 2 by recent research on a peat core black forest germany and a coral core kume island japan hain et al 2020 the reactor modeling result and documented la hague discharge data indicate that the 233u 236u atomic ratio in the nr related releases from normal operations and accidents should be at the level of 10 8 10 6 naegeli 2004 hain et al 2020 helcom 2020 this is supported by relatively low 233u 236u atomic ratios avg 0 12 0 01 10 2 measured in the seawater and sediments close to sellafield hain et al 2020 using a binary end member mixing algorithm the gf derived and nr derived 236u signals can be quantified in a multiple source environment e g the baltic sea and the greenland coast hain et al 2020 qiao et al 2020b 2021 lin et al 2021b and thus facilitating their tracer applications in the ocean due to the limitations of measurement techniques in the past observations of 236u and 233u in the baltic sea are scarce qiao et al 2017 and lin et al 2021b investigated the levels and distribution of 236u in the danish coastal waters and temporal evolution of 236u and 233u in the central baltic sea respectively they demonstrated that the baltic sea receives 236u from both gf and reprocessing plants a follow up study by qiao et al 2021 reported the distributions of 236u and 233u in the surface waters of the baltic sea and suggested an unknown local nr derived 236u source e g the undocumented discharges from local nuclear facilities or accidental leakages from nuclear waste dumping however there are still many knowledge gaps of the 236u and 233u in the baltic sea e g their 3d distributions major input output fluxes and budgets in seawater in addition pinpointing the source of the unknown nr derived 236u in the baltic sea requires further investigation to ease the public concern on radiological safety hence systematic observations of 236u and 233u become the prerequisite of their tracer applications in the baltic sea in this work we present the first dataset of 3d distribution of 236u and 233u in the modern baltic sea 2018 2019 using the novel 233u 236u signature we aim to locate the source terms of 236u and quantify their contributions to the total 236u budget in the baltic seawater by combining observation and numerical modeling we also seek to uncover the transport and mixing processes related to the dispersion of nr derived 236u from the north sea to the baltic sea thus providing a better understanding of the dynamics and fates of contaminants in the baltic sea 2 material and methods 2 1 seawater sampling to investigate the spatial distributions of 236u and 233u in the baltic sea 125 seawater samples were collected from 35 stations depth files in the baltic sea during 2018 2019 table 1 the scientific expeditions were carried out by the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi the national institute of aquatic resources at technical university of denmark dtu aqua the finnish environment institute and radiation and nuclear safety authority syke and stuk and the leibniz institute for baltic sea research warnemünde iow germany based on the sampling periods and geographical distribution these samples could be grouped into three transects transect 1 from the skagerrak to western gotland basin in the winter of 2018 transect 2 from the bothnian bay to the gulf of finland in the summer of 2019 and transect 3 from the arkona basin to the western gotland basin in the winter of 2019 fig 1 the sampling area covers all major regions of the baltic sea including the transition zone between the north sea and baltic sea skagerrak kattegat and danish straits the southern baltic sea region arkona basin bornholm basin and south baltic proper the middle baltic sea region northern baltic proper western gotland basin and eastern gotland basin and the northern baltic sea region archipelago sea åland sea bothnian sea bothnian bay and gulf of finland to facilitate the presentation of results and discussions we identified six water masses in the baltic sea based on the salinity and geographical locations in the transition zone the atlantic water salinity 34 5 jutland coastal water salinity 32 34 5 and baltic inflowing outflowing water salinity 15 32 are three dominating water masses aarup et al 1996 the atlantic water dominates the bottom of skagerrak and kattegat and originates from a southeastward branch of the norwegian atlantic current expanding along the slope of the norwegian trench andersson 2007 the jutland coastal water is comprised of the central southern north sea waters and the runoff influenced english channel water which transports waters from the southern north sea to the transition zone by the jutland coastal current aure 1998 the main body of the baltic sea is separated by a permanent halocline into the baltic bottom water salinity 9 15 and baltic surface water salinity 5 9 which are influenced by the saline inflows from the transition zone less saline brackish water from the northern baltic region and large freshwater supply from the rivers the baltic freshwater salinity 5 is mainly distributed in the bothnian bay and the estuary of neva river in the gulf of finland 2 2 determination of 238u 236u and 233u 238u concentrations in seawater samples were directly measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 8800 icp qqq after 20 50 times dilution for the determination of ultra trace levels of 236u and 233u an optimized radiochemical separation procedure was utilized to extract uranium isotopes from 4 5 9 l seawater samples qiao et al 2015 lin et al 2021c which is detailed in supporting information procedure blanks in a total of nineteen were prepared in every batch typically seven samples of analysis using ultrapure water following the same analytical procedure special measures were implemented to reduce the backgrounds of 236u and 233u including purification of chemicals utilization of laminar flow bench and acid boiling for glassware lin et al 2021c less than 1 95 ng of 238u 2 79 106 atoms of 236u and 8 94 103 atoms of 233u were detected in the procedure blanks which were negligible compared to the uranium isotopes measured in our seawater samples the accelerator mass spectrometry measurements of the atomic ratios of 236u 238u and 233u 238u were carried out at the vienna environmental research accelerator vera facility in the university of vienna using the established setup and method for actinides steier et al 2019 hain et al 2020 238u was also used as an intrinsic tracer to obtain the chemical yield of uranium which was on an average of 70 in this work the robustness of the analytical method was verified by repeatedly analyzing a quality control sample 2018184 baltic seawater provided by the federal maritime and hydrographic agency of germany together with the seawater samples in this work lin et al 2021c the background subtraction and uncertainty calculation for the actual uranium concentrations and isotope ratios are detailed in supporting information 2 3 hindcast simulation in this work a 3d ocean circulation model hiromb boos model hbm was applied to simulate the dispersion of reprocessing derived 236u in the north baltic sea more details of the hbm model setup simulation and validation are given in supporting information hbm is a well calibrated operational model for storm surge forecast oil spill forecast warning service in denmark and germany berg and poulsen 2012 she and murawski 2018 murawski et al 2021 the model has three nested layers 1 a 2d barotropic model covering the north atlantic shelf sea in 6 nautical mile resolution to provide wind induced sea level for the 3d regional model 2 a 3d north baltic sea model in 3 nautical mile resolution which is two way nested with two high resolution sub domains 3 two 0 5 nautical mile model sub domains in the wadden sea and the transition zone between the north sea and the baltic sea the dynamic two way nesting with high resolution is essential for resolving the narrow danish straits and simulating the water exchange between the north sea and the baltic sea she et al 2007 two point sources were set for the two european reprocessing plants at la hague and sellafield the annual discharges of 236u from two point sources were based on the reconstructed data from shell records by castrillejo et al 2020 and a constant discharge rate was assumed for each point source within a specific year as sellafield is located out of the north baltic sea domain the corresponding point source was moved to the upper left corner of the domain a loss rate of 50 and a lag time of 1 year were assumed for the transport of 236u from sellafield to its new location as suggested by christl et al 2015b the model was simulated from 1971 to 2018 and validated with the observed nr derived 236u concentrations in transect 1 3 results 3 1 levels and distributions of 238u 236u 233u concentrations and 236u 238u 233u 238u atomic ratios an overview of the concentrations of 238u 236u and 233u as well as the atomic ratios of 236u 238u 233u 238u and 233u 236u in the baltic sea in 2018 2019 is given in table s1 the 238u concentrations ranged between 0 3 and 3 8 μg kg and showed a strong correlation with salinity r2 0 999 fig 2 a in the surface waters depth 10 m of the baltic sea the intercept of linear fitting suggested an average riverine 238u concentration of 0 06 μg kg however compared to the calculated 238u concentrations from the surface 238u salinity correlation negative offsets were apparent avg 15 for measured 238u concentrations in the sulfidic deep waters of the central baltic sea and the offsets showed a strong connection with sulfide concentrations fig 2b and c the measured 236u 238u and 233u 238u atomic ratios 2 42 25 8 10 9 and 1 42 22 5 10 11 respectively in the baltic seawater collected in 2018 2019 were significantly higher than their natural background ratios of 10 14 10 10 and 10 14 10 11 respectively steier et al 2008 hain et al 2020 suggesting the dominance of anthropogenic 236u and 233u in the baltic sea 236u 238u and 233u 238u atomic ratios in this work were comparable to the reported values in baltic surface waters in 2014 2015 5 47 52 4 10 9 and 0 77 28 6 10 11 respectively qiao et al 2021 the obtained 236u 238u 14 8 16 6 10 9 and 233u 238u 7 60 9 82 10 11 atomic ratios in the bottom waters of the gotland basin and the landsort deep were also consistent with the values 14 5 16 3 10 9 and 7 54 10 8 10 11 respectively previously determined in the 2018 segments of sediment cores collected at the same sites lin et al 2021b the measured 236u 1 99 8 75 107 atoms kg and 233u 1 31 3 73 105 atoms kg concentrations in this study were also similar to the previously determined levels in the surface waters of the baltic sea in 2011 2016 3 31 12 5 107 atoms kg and 0 46 5 63 105 atoms kg respectively qiao et al 2017 2021 a comparison of currently available 236u datasets fig 3 indicated that the north sea and the baltic sea have higher 236u concentrations than the inflowing eastern north atlantic central waters to the north sea as the eastern north atlantic central waters solely carry gf signal castrillejo et al 2018 the elevated 236u concentrations in the north sea and the baltic sea should be attributed to the regional sources i e reprocessing plants the 236u concentrations in the baltic sea were slightly lower than those in the north sea and relatively high 236u concentrations 5 107 atoms kg were observed in the jutland coastal water baltic inflowing outflowing water and part of baltic bottom water along the passage from the danish straits to the gotland basin fig 4 suggesting the transport of 236u from the north sea to the baltic sea the 233u concentrations were distributed within a narrow range 2 15 3 50 105 atoms kg throughout the baltic sea with slightly lower levels in the atlantic water and baltic freshwater 3 2 levels and distributions of 233u 236u atomic ratios gf derived and nr derived 236u concentrations the atomic ratios of 233u 236u in the baltic sea were within 0 18 0 97 10 2 in 2018 2019 reflecting contributions of 236u from both gf and nr sources higher 233u 236u atomic ratios as observed in the bothnian bay indicated higher relative contributions of gf derived 236u whereas lower 233u 236u atomic ratios in the jutland coastal water baltic inflow water and baltic bottom water reflected the relatively strong influences of nr derived 236u in the transition zone and southern baltic region fig 5 using 233u 236u atomic ratio in a binary mixing algorithm consisting of gf derived 236u 233u 236u 1 40 10 2 and nr derived 236u 233u 236u 10 6 as endmembers the gf derived and nr derived 236u concentrations in all seawater samples were calculated see details in supporting information which varied within 0 93 2 66 107 and 0 61 6 90 107 atoms kg respectively fig 5 in the brackish waters of the baltic sea baltic inflowing outflowing water baltic surface water and baltic bottom water the gf derived 236u concentrations 1 48 2 66 107 atoms kg were evenly distributed whereas the freshwater and saline sources atlantic water and jutland coastal water had slightly lower gf derived 236u concentrations 0 93 1 66 107 atoms kg the gf derived 236u concentrations 1 8 2 5 107 atoms kg in the surface waters of the central baltic sea in 2018 2019 were consistent with the reported values 1 2 3 9 107 atoms kg in 2011 2016 qiao et al 2021 however these concentration values were much higher than the representative gf levels in the surface water of the open ocean 0 8 107 atoms kg christl et al 2012 and simulated concentrations in the north sea in the 2010s 0 7 1 1 107 atoms kg christl et al 2015b derived from a global surface ocean model higher nr derived 236u concentrations 4 21 9 59 107 atoms kg mainly occurred in the sub surface layer of the skagerrak and kattegat as well as the bottom inflows along transects from the danish straits to the northern baltic proper the lowest nr derived 236u concentrations 0 61 1 31 107 atoms kg were observed in the bothnian bay and the bottom of skagerrak predominated by the baltic freshwater and atlantic water respectively 3 3 inventories of 236u and 233u in the modern baltic sea based on the observation data in 2018 2019 we extrapolated the spatial distributions of 236u and 233u concentrations as well as gf derived and nr derived 236u concentrations throughout the baltic sea using a 3d estimation tool in ocean data view 5 3 0 the 3d estimation was implemented as a fast weighted averaging procedure and used a specified high resolution topography dataset of the baltic sea latitude 1 longitude 2 depth 5 m seifert et al 2001 the total dissolved 236u and 233u inventories in the modern baltic seawater were thereby estimated to be 316 25 g and 1 96 0 25 g respectively the gf derived and nr derived 236u accounted for 44 9 4 2 142 13 g and 55 1 13 0 174 40 g of the total 236u in the baltic sea respectively 4 discussions 4 1 behaviors of u in the baltic sea the mixing diagram of 238u concentration vs salinity fig 2a indicates that uranium has conservative behaviors in the oxic waters e g surface waters of the baltic sea where uranium is present in vi oxidation state as highly soluble uranyl carbonate complexes djogić et al 1986 however in the middle and northern baltic sea regions 10 20 of 238u was scavenged from the sulfidic deep waters in 2018 2019 and this fraction could be up to 40 reported by anderson et al 1989 and dellwig et al 2021 the baltic bottom water is permanently hypoxic and periodically anoxic as its renewal only relies on the irregularly strong barotropic inflow events or so called major baltic inflows carstensen et al 2014 meier et al 2019 the recent investigations on the water column and sediments of the central baltic sea dellwig et al 2021 lin et al 2021b suggested that the uranium depletion in sulfidic waters arises from the redox driven processes in the water column and diagenesis driven removal in the sediment 1 the soluble u vi in the water column can be reduced to insoluble u iv by sulfides and deposited on the seabed as particulate forms anderson et al 1989 and 2 the dissolved uranium can be removed from the sulfidic porewaters into sediments leading to a diffusion of dissolved uranium from bottom waters to the porewaters barnes and cochran 1990 klinkhammer and palmer 1991 lovley et al 1991 the major baltic inflows can temporally oxygenate the euxinic baltic bottom water suppress the removal of uranium from the water column and remobilize a part of the scavenged uranium in the surface sediments 20 50 leading to a release of uranium from the uppermost porewaters to the water column dellwig et al 2021 however the remobilization of sedimentary uranium is quite limited and temporal which slightly elevates the 238u concentrations in the near seabed waters dellwig et al 2021 the uranium depletion recurs after the reestablishment of the bottom euxinia in the central baltic sea region dellwig et al 2021 the baltic sediments in the anoxic sub basins generally act as a net sink for natural and anthropogenic uranium isotopes our previous investigation on the baltic sediments indicated that 589 43 g of 236u gf derived 266 5 g nr derived 323 43 g were scavenged from the baltic seawater to the sediments lin et al 2021b the comparable atomic ratios of 236u 238u 233u 238u and 233u 236u section 3 1 between the bottom waters and surface sediments in the central baltic sea revealed no significant isotopic fractionation for uranium during the scavenging processes the 233u 236u atomic ratio is not affected by the scavenging processes and thus can still be used as a robust signature for tracing the water mass movement and identifying emission sources of anthropogenic uranium hain et al 2020 qiao et al 2020b 4 2 source terms of 236u in the baltic sea in addition to a negligible natural background the majority of 236u in the baltic sea originates from gf related and nr related sources and enters the baltic sea through various pathways the gf derived 236u in the modern baltic seawater is potentially from 1 the dissolution of the directly deposited gf derived 236u on the baltic sea 2 the riverine inputs of gf derived 236u deposited on the catchment and 3 the oceanic transport of dissolved gf derived 236u in the north sea via baltic inflows the nr derived 236u in the modern baltic seawater may be attributed to 1 the marine transport of reprocessing derived 236u from the north sea 2 the dissolved 236u fallouts from the chernobyl accident both in baltic seawater and river waters from the catchment and 3 unreported discharges from local nuclear facilities or accidental leakages from dumped nuclear wastes in the following subsections we will further discuss the specific sources inputs and sinks outputs of gf derived and nr derived 236u investigate their related transport and mixing processes and perform the budget calculations for them respectively 4 3 nr derived 236u in the baltic sea 4 3 1 major inputs of nr derived 236u our recent study on the baltic sediments indicated that the 236u fallouts from the chernobyl accident were very limited in the baltic region and little chernobyl derived 236u was dissolved in the baltic seawater lin et al 2021b even though our earlier findings suggested a potential unaccounted nr derived 236u source in the baltic sea qiao et al 2021 the observations in 2018 2019 did not demonstrate distinctly high nr derived 236u concentrations in the baltic bottom water or freshwater indicating no significant releases of nr derived 236u from the local nuclear facilities or dumped nuclear wastes to the modern baltic sea both the spatial distribution of nr derived 236u fig 5 and the mixing diagram of nr derived 236u vs salinity fig 6 a suggested that the nr derived 236u in the modern baltic seawater should be mainly from the north sea more specifically two reprocessing plants rather than other riverine or benthonic sources 4 3 2 transport and mixing of nr derived 236u the nr derived 236u vs salinity diagram revealed that there were three endmembers for nr derived 236u in the baltic sea fig 6a the first endmember was the saline atlantic water characterized by low nr derived 236u concentrations 2 107 atoms kg the second endmember was the slightly less saline water jutland coastal water with high and variable nr derived 236u concentrations 3 5 16 107 atoms kg constrained by the upper and lower boundaries for the potential mixing lines red and blue dot lines in fig 6a the third endmember was the brackish baltic surface water with relatively constant nr derived 236u concentrations 1 5 3 5 107 atoms kg likely arising from the long residence time of saline water in the baltic sea due to the limitations in sampling frequency and spatial resolution the mixing diagram lost many details in the transition zone and southern baltic sea region to elaborate further on the transport mixing processes affecting nr derived 236u distribution the 3d ocean model hbm was used to simulate the dispersion of 236u discharges from sellafield and la hague it should be noted that there are methodological difficulties in distinguishing nr derived 236u from the reprocessing plants and those from other civil nuclear facilities in the observations but only the former ones were considered in our simulation for a more accurate description we prefer to use the term reprocessing derived 236u to represent nr derived 236u from the reprocessing plants in the simulation results the simulated water column results for 128 stations in the north baltic sea drew a full picture for the dispersion of reprocessing derived 236u by oceanic circulation fig s1 in the north sea higher 236u concentrations were restricted in the near shore areas rather than the central and northern regions by the coastal current transports 236u from sellafield and la hague was advected to the southern north sea by the scottish coastal current and english channel current respectively and further to the skagerrak along the western european coastline by jutland coastal current which agreed with the previous observations christl et al 2017 2015a upon arrival at the skagerrak the jutland coastal water tagged by reprocessing derived 236u was sandwiched into the surface brackish outflowing water and the bottom saline atlantic water due to the density stratification which was also confirmed by the earlier findings aarup et al 1996 dahlgaard et al 1995 stedmon et al 2010 the numerical modeling resolved an open question related to the mixing of nr derived 236u why the jutland coastal water had a variable endmember of nr derived 236u concentration fig 6a the jutland coastal water is a combination of the central southern north sea water and the english channel water aure 1998 thereby its endmember is determined by 1 the nr derived 236u concentrations in the central southern north sea water and english channel water and 2 the fractions of central southern north sea water and the english channel water the nr derived 236u concentrations in both central southern north sea water and english channel water were kept relatively stable during 2018 2019 as 236u discharge rates from two reprocessing plants were generally constant since the 2010s our recent investigation on the water mass compositions in the transition zone indicated that the fraction of the north sea water has negligible inter seasonal variability whereas obvious seasonality is observed in the fraction of the english channel water lin et al 2021a driven by the predominant southwesterly winds in the north sea more english channel water along with la hague derived 236u flows into the skagerrak in winter and vice versa in summer aure 1998 the variations in the simulated reprocessing derived 236u concentrations 6 19 107 atoms kg of jutland coastal water in 2018 were consistent with our observations 3 5 16 107 atoms kg and higher concentrations were observed in winter fig 7 a in addition both our observation and numerical modeling results revealed that the vertical mixings between the intermediate less saline jutland coastal water carrying relatively higher reprocessing signals and the bottom more saline atlantic water surface relatively fresh baltic outflowing water in the transition zone caused the inverted v shaped mixing lines 4 3 3 long term dynamics of nr derived 236u the long term exchange of nr derived 236u between the north sea and the baltic was investigated by the temporal evolution of simulated inventories in both seas as the 236u discharges from the two reprocessing plants have decreased since the 1970s fig 7c castrillejo et al 2020 our hindcast simulation revealed a significant decline of reprocessing derived 236u concentrations in the jutland coastal water fig 7b and the decreasing inventories of nr derived 236u in the north sea fig 7d from the max 42 7 kg to 1 52 kg and baltic sea fig 7e from the max 624 g to 211 g in recent 40 years the decrease of nr derived 236u was much slower in the baltic sea than the north sea owing to a much longer water residence time in the baltic sea 30 years than the north sea 1 2 years the narrow and shallow channels of the danish straits restrict the bottom saline inflows driven by either the horizontal density gradients observed in summer feistel et al 2006 or storms mainly in winter mohrholz 2018 limited water renewal endows the baltic sea with a strong memory effect and favors trapping the aged pollutions in the central baltic sea the numerical modeling indicated that by the end of 2018 up to 57 of reprocessing derived 236u present in the baltic sea originated from the discharges before 1990 in contrast almost 100 of reprocessing derived 236u in the north sea was released within the recent 30 years in the hbm model even though the endmember for the jutland coastal water varied largely for individual inflows the monthly imported exported reprocessing derived 236u was marginal 10 compared to the nr derived 236u budget of the baltic sea since the 1990s and could not significantly change the endmember for the baltic surface water this was also supported by our observations on the central baltic sea where the distribution of nr derived 236u was relatively even figs 5 and 6a qiao et al 2021 estimated that the unknown local source contributed 200 47 g of nr derived 236u to the baltic sea which was at the same level as the total nr derived 236u inventory obtained in this work considering the notable differences in sampling scales periods depths and locations endmember settings and modeling approaches between the two studies fig s2 and table s2 the unknown source of nr derived 236u is likely the aged reprocessing derived 236u trapped in the central baltic sea the direct evidence is the much lower 129i nr derived 236u atomic ratios in the surface waters of the middle baltic sea region 113 370 than those of the transition zone 1202 2608 in 2015 qiao et al 2021 our preliminary estimation suggested that the saline fraction of the surface waters of the central baltic sea carried at least 20 years older reprocessing signals than the saline waters of the transition zone fig s3 which generally agreed with the simulated water age results by meier 2007 the endmember of jutland coastal water for the aged reprocessing signal should be much higher than that for the modern signal leading to the large deviation of 236u 238u atomic ratios in the surface of the central baltic sea between the observations and the calculated results by the endmember mixing model adopted in our previous work qiao et al 2021 4 3 4 budget calculation for nr derived 236u our budget calculation indicates a net input of 211 g of reprocessing derived 236u to the baltic sea and 323 43 g of nr derived 236u scavenged from the baltic seawater to the sediments during 1971 2018 table 2 in general there was a surplus of 174 211 323 286 g for the observed inventory of nr derived 236u 174 40 g in the modern baltic seawater which most likely originate from the underestimated inputs from sellafield due to the lack of its discharge history before 1970 castrillejo et al 2020 and the undocumented discharges from the local nuclear facilities the overall 236u budget scheme in the modern baltic sea 2018 2019 is shown in fig 8 the annual net output of nr derived 236u to the north sea was estimated as 11 g year average value during 1981 2018 in hindcast simulation based on the investigation on the baltic sediments the scavenged nr derived 236u was estimated to be 5 3 g year assuming that the scavenging rate of nr derived 236u by the anoxic sediments was 2 7 1011 atom m2 year in 2018 lin et al 2021b and an average hypoxic area of 49 000 km2 in the baltic sea conley et al 2009 therefore the baltic sea lost 5 3 11 16 3 g of nr derived 236u in 2018 considering that the anoxia in the middle baltic sea region will likely persist due to the large legacy of nutrients helcom 2018a the loss of nr derived 236u in the baltic sea water will continue at least in this decade 4 4 gf derived 236u in the baltic sea 4 4 1 major inputs of gf derived 236u the mixing diagram of gf derived 236u vs salinity fig 6b showed slightly higher gf derived 236u concentrations in the brackish waters of the baltic sea baltic surface water baltic bottom water and baltic outflow water than the incoming saline and fresh waters atlantic water jutland coastal water and baltic freshwater this phenomenon suggested that the present gf derived 236u in the main body of the baltic sea did not originate from the current inflowing waters but an old gf derived 236u input unfortunately the historical atmospheric deposition riverine input and oceanic transport of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea are not well constrained due to a lack of observation data therefore we only made a rough estimation for different inputs of gf derived 236u according to the areal inventory of gf derived 236u in the black forest peat core 9 0 1012 atoms m2 quinto et al 2013 the total atmospheric depositions of gf derived 236u on the baltic sea and its catchment were estimated to be 1 4 kg 393 000 km2 and 5 8 kg 1630 000 km2 respectively lin et al 2021b with the predominant deposition occurring in the 1950s 1960s quinto et al 2013 hain et al 2020 ohno et al 2021 for the gf derived 236u deposited on the baltic sea a maximum of 47 g of gf derived 236u directly reached the seabed corresponding to the sedimentary inventory of gf derived 236u before 1970 lin et al 2021b and the rest 1 35 kg should be dissolved in the baltic seawater for the gf derived 236u deposited on the catchment the mixing diagram suggested a low gf derived 236u concentration 107 atoms kg in the river runoff of the baltic sea which was close to the extrapolated level in the elbe river water to the north sea 107 atoms kg christl et al 2017 assuming an average runoff of 454 km3 year johansson 2016 the annual riverine input of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea was estimated to be 1 8 g year in 2018 which was a minor contribution to the modern baltic seawater inventory 266 5 g for oceanic transport a net output of gf derived 236u from the baltic sea to the north sea was estimated over the past five decades see details in section 4 4 2 hence we concluded that the dissolution of deposited gf derived 236u in the baltic seawater should be the major input of gf derived 236u 4 4 2 long term dynamics of gf derived 236u different from the reprocessing derived 236u there are still some knowledge gaps in the historical inputs of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea therefore it was not feasible to perform a long term hindcast simulation for gf derived 236u without reliable input functions instead we used sedimentary records to uncover the temporal evolution of gf derived 236u in the baltic sea the reported gf derived 236u records resolved from coral and sediment cores suggested a general exponential decrease of gf derived 236u in global marine systems since the 1980s winkler et al 2012 sakaguchi et al 2016 nomura et al 2017 lin et al 2021b a comparison fig 6b and c between the simulated gf derived 236u concentrations in the surface layer of the north sea 55 n 5 e data from christl et al 2015b and the reconstructed gf derived 236u concentrations in the bottom waters of the gotland basin and the landsort deep lin et al 2021b revealed a longer effective half life of gf derived 236u in the baltic sea 21 33 years than the north sea 11 years this should also be related to the strong memory effect of the baltic sea similar to nr derived 236u higher gf derived 236u concentrations in the baltic brackish waters might represent the aged gf derived 236u signals trapped in the central baltic sea due to the limited water renewal based on the differences between the simulated level in the north sea and the resolved level in the baltic sea we could roughly estimate the exchange of gf derived 236u between the two seas the annual import of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea was estimated by multiplying the simulated gf derived 236u concentrations in the north sea with the mean baltic inflow 634 km3 year dahlgaard 2002 due to the homogenous distribution of gf derived 236u in the main body of the baltic sea fig 5 and 6b arising from its slow water circulation we assumed that the baltic outflowing water had the same gf derived 236u concentrations as the baltic bottom waters thereby the annual export of gf derived 236u from the baltic sea was calculated by multiplying the resolved concentrations in the central baltic sea with the mean baltic outflow 1107 km3 year dahlgaard 2002 the net decadal flux of gf derived 236u between the two seas was estimated to be 73 13 g 23 15 g 63 18 g 52 2 g and 44 3 g for the past five decades respectively positive negative values represent input to output from the baltic sea in total a net output of gf derived 236u 108 41 g from the baltic sea was obtained during 1971 2018 4 4 3 budget calculation for gf derived 236u regarding the gf derived 236u budget of the baltic sea during 1971 2018 we found a deficit of 1353 108 266 142 837 g for the observed inventory of the modern baltic seawater 142 13 g when taking all available inputs dissolution of the atmospheric deposition 1353 g and outputs oceanic transport 108 41 scavenging process 266 5 into account it should be noted that this deficit could be even larger if there were significant historical riverine inputs an overestimated atmospheric deposition and or an underestimated sedimentary inventory of gf derived 236u in the baltic seawater might be the major contributors to this deficit in 2018 2019 the annual riverine input of gf derived 236u to the baltic sea was estimated to be 1 8 g fig 8 the annual net output of gf derived 236u from the baltic sea was estimated as 5 5 0 3 g based on the aforementioned calculations the annual deposition rate of gf derived 236u to the baltic sediments was estimated to be 3 5 1 5 g lin et al 2021b in summary the baltic sea lost 5 5 3 5 1 8 7 2 1 5 g of gf derived 236u in the year of 2018 similar to the case of nr derived 236u the loss of gf derived 236u in the baltic sea water will likely continue in this decade 5 conclusions and perspectives in this work based on the large scale observation and long term 3d numerical simulation we obtained in depth knowledge on the source terms transport mixing and fate of anthropogenic u in the baltic sea the major findings of this work include 1 the budget calculations for anthropogenic 236u in the modern baltic seawater indicate that the nuclear weapon testing and civil nuclear industries have comparable contributions 142 13 g and 174 40 g primarily via the global atmospheric deposition in the 1950s 1960s and liquid discharges from the european reprocessing plants since the 1970s respectively 2 limited water renewal results in a strong memory effect of the baltic sea retaining the aged 236u signals as well as other pollutants nutrients for decades and the previously unknown nr derived 236u in the baltic sea should be the reprocessing derived 236u discharged in the mid 1990s 3 there is a notable sink of uranium from the water column to anoxic sediments in the baltic sea which is the major contributor to the loss of 236u in the baltic seawater our preliminary results also demonstrate the potentials of reprocessing derived 236u and 129i to trace the water mass movement mixing and estimate the water ages in the baltic sea combining field observations and 3d ocean modeling will enable us to further investigate the transit passages and circulation timescales of saline water in different sub basins of the baltic sea providing fundamental knowledge of the pollutant dynamics in the baltic sea to the decision makers for the environmental management in the baltic region our observations reveal that uranium has unconservative behaviors in the sulfidic waters of the baltic sea however this shortcoming will not affect the robustness of using 233u 236u atomic ratios for tracing the water mass movement and identifying emission sources of anthropogenic uranium in the baltic sea as no significant isotopic fractionation occurs in the uranium scavenging processes besides although the uranium depletion in the central baltic sea may increase the 129i nr derived 236u atomic ratio by up to 66 100 100 40 100 resulting in underestimated water age considering the rapid increase two orders of magnitude of the reprocessing derived 129i 236u atomic ratios in the inflowing waters since the 1970s the introduced uncertainties for the water age estimation is negligible 1 3 years nevertheless for a more accurate prediction of the spatiotemporal distribution of 236u in the baltic sea coupling sedimentation model with 3d ocean model should be considered in the future numerical simulations where parameterization and verification for the uranium scavenging

16354,this study describes an integrated granular sludge and fixed biofilm igb reactor innovatively designed to carry out the anammox partial denitrification a pd process for nitrogen removal with mainstream municipal wastewater the igb a pd reactor consists of anammox granules inoculated in the lower region of reactor and an acclimated fixed biofilm positioned in the upper region compared to the other reported a pd systems for mainstream wastewater treatment this igb a pd reactor is notable due to its higher quality effluent with a total inorganic nitrogen tin of 3 mg l 1 and operation at a high nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 reads based metatranscriptomic analysis found that the expression values of hzsa and hdh key genes associated with anammox were much higher than other functional genes on nitrogen conversion confirming the major roles of the anammox bacteria in nitrogen bio removal in both regions of the reactor the nitrate reduction genes napa narg had expression values of 56 99 rpm which were similar to that of the nitrite reduction genes nirs nirk the expression reads from genes for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra nrfa and nirb were unexpectedly high and were over the half of the levels of reads from genes required for nitrate reduction kinetic assays confirmed that the granules had an anammox activity of 16 2 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1 and a nitrate reduction activity of 4 1 g n kg 1 vss d 1 while these values were changed to be 4 9 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1and 4 3 g n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively in the fixed biofilm mass flux determination found that pd and dnra was responsible for 50 and 25 of nitrate reduction respectively in the whole reactor consistent with high effluent quality and treatment efficiency via a nitrite loop metagenomic binning analysis revealed that new and unidentified anammox species affiliated with candidatus brocadia were the dominant anammox organisms myxococcota and planctomycetota were the principal organisms associated with the pd and dnra processes respectively graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox partial denitrification dnra mainstream wastewater igb bioreactor meta omics 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which is the oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions using nitrite as electron acceptor is a resource efficient biological wastewater treatment technology for sustainable nitrogen removal due to its no requirements for external organics addition and aeration siegrist et al 2008 kartal et al 2010 given that nitrite is not common in typical wastewaters aerobic partial nitritation pn was considered to be an effective pretreatment method that transfer half of the influent ammonium to nitrite for anammox lackner et al 2014 cao et al 2017 the partial nitritation anammox pn a is now becoming the practical alternative to traditional nitrification denitrification in full scale application for the advantages of neutral or even positive energy balance lackner et al 2014 pn a has been widely implemented in dewatering liquor from anaerobic digesters in the sidestream of wwtp but the application of full scale mainstream pn a was still limited ali et al 2015 cao et al 2017 one of the major concerns is the high effluent nitrate concentrations resulting in total inorganic nitrogen tin exceeding the stringent discharge standard in china ma et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 trinh et al 2021 despite splitting the pn a in two different reactors can avoid the nitrate production by nitrifiers in anammox reactor there still is 11 nitrate production by anammox process strous et al 1998 recently partial denitrification pd no3 no2 has been reported as an effective approach for reducing the nitrate produced by anammox and its output can be fed back into the anammox process du et al 2019 thus anammox coupled with pd a pd in anoxic system is a promising process to achieve the effluent tin satisfying discharge stand from mainstream wastewater when connected to the aerobic pn system ji et al 2020 pn operation under mainstream conditions has been intensively studied duan et al 2019 jin et al 2019 li et al 2021 however despite the use of a pd in mainstream wastewater treatment receiving increasing attention cao et al 2020 it is still an open question how to achieve high effluent quality with high nitrogen removal rate nrr in a one stage anoxic bioreactor the anammox granule has been extensively used in high nitrogen loading rate reactor which would strengthen the communication and cooperation of the anammox bacteria due to its high cell density kartal et al 2011 lackner et al 2014 recent study confirmed the feasibility of using sidestream anammox granules to start up mainstream up flow reactors and achieve highest volumetric nitrogen removal rate of mainstream treatment cheng et al 2020 however whether the mainstream anammox granules reactor can achieve the required effluent tin quality will be the next issue since the dominate anammox bacteria in granules would be r strategy and normally with high growth rate and low nitrogen affinity reino and carrera 2017 zhang and okabe 2020 co culture the k strategy anammox bacteria with high nitrogen affinity could be an effective approach to improve the effluent tin quality gottshall et al 2021 however compared to the r strategy anammox bacteria the k strategy anammox bacteria grows slower and is more difficult to self aggregate which would result it washout from the reactor oshiki et al 2016 zhang and okabe 2020 the addition of carrier materials has been reported as an economic and effective approach that can significantly enhance high affinity anammox bacteria retention kosgey et al 2021 therefore we proposed to build an integrated granular sludge and fixed biofilm igb reactor could be used to achieve enhanced nitrogen removal performance with high nrr and low effluent tin simultaneously more specifically anammox granules as inoculum are positioned in the underpart of the up flow reactor for high nrr while a fixed biofilm as high affinity anammox bacteria retention facilitator is positioned in the upside for the effluent polish the pd bacteria has been observed as the symbiotic bacteria in almost all the reported anammox system wang et al 2016 lawson et al 2017 li et al 2017 given there is organic in mainstream wastewater the pd bacteria would play a key role in the igb reactor for both granules and fixed biofilm sections herein the goals in this study were to develop an igb reactor to carry out anammox partial denitrification a pd and explore its performance in treating mainstream municipal wastewater subsequently the potential mechanisms causing functional differences between granules and fixed biofilm were further analyzed by linking the community profiles gene expression and physiological characteristics of the granules and fixed biofilm using meta omics analysis finally kinetic assays and mass balance evaluation were conducted to identify the relative contributions associated with either the granules or fixed biofilm to overall nitrogen removal and unveil the nitrogen transformation flux the results of this study will determine if this approach is a practical alternative for mainstream wastewater treatment and in addition shed light on the microbial community critical for its function 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an igb a pd reactor was established with an effective height to inner diameter ratio of 7 and operated more than 200 days fig 1 the sampling ports from bottom to top represented the height of 5 20 and 40 cm respectively it was operated in continuous up flow mode the inoculant anammox granular sludge was obtained from a lab scale anammox granular sludge reactor with an influent nh4 n concentration as 150 mg l 1 zhuang et al 2020 the synthetic wastewater was prepared as described by van de graaf et al 1996 complete operation of the reactor consisted of two phases in phase i the influent concentration of nh4 n and no2 n were 50 mg l 1 and 60 mg l 1 respectively to promote anammox adaptation during relative lower nitrogen loading until the nh4 n removal efficiency became higher than 90 in phase ii polypropylene fiber was added as biomass carriers and positioned within the upper 40 of the reactor s effective volume to explore the flexibility of the igb a pd reactor to treat mainstream wastewater during phase ii nh4 n no2 n and bod sodium acetate were set at 25 30 and 60 mg l 1 concentrations respectively to mimic the mainstream wastewater after partial nitritation treatment kouba et al 2017 jin et al 2019 shear forces via increasing temporarily reflux rate were applied to regulate the thickness and biomass of fixed biofilm the volatile suspended solids vss concentration hydraulic retention time hrt inflow rate effluent recirculation ratio influent ph and liquid temperature in reactor were set as 15 8 1 2 g l 1 1 5 h 20 l d 1 1 0 7 5 0 5 20 25 respectively 2 2 dna and rna extraction and sequencing the sludge samples in phase i day 65 as well as the granules and fixed biofilm samples in phase ii day 200 were collected in duplicate for dna and rna extraction from the igb a pd reactor genomic dna from granules and fixed biofilm was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mo bio laboratorieps inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the total rna of granular sludge and the fixed biofilm was extracted using the powermicrobiome rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa the dna or rna of each sludge sample were extracted in duplicate and mixed for library establishing the dna and rna libraries were sequenced on a novaseq 6000 illumina at magigene guangzhou china to generate 150 nt paired end reads raw dna and rna sequences can be found at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under prjna736868 2 3 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis raw reads were quality filtered using sickle version 1 33 joshi and fass 2011 as described by bhattacharjee et al 2017 diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample rna reads against a custom manually curated database of nitrogen cycle relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains 11 key enzymes associated with anammox nitrification and partial denitrification created as referred to li et al 2020 kaiju version 1 5 0 was used to taxonomic assignment analyze based on reads menzel et al 2016 high quality metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance was determined as described in li et al 2018 checkm was used to assess the completeness and quality of each mag parks et al 2015 taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using gtdb tk v1 1 0 chaumeil et al 2019 open reading frames orfs were predicted from bins using prodigal version 2 6 3 with default parameters hyatt et al 2010 annotation of the scaffolded genome bins was performed using metapathways version 2 0 against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway kegg database konwar et al 2013 the abundance and relative gene expression of each mag was predicted using bbduk with the parameters mkf 1 0 k 31 and normalized by sequencing depth zhou et al 2020 genome wide average nucleotide identity gani and average amino acid identity aai were used to differentiate the anammox draft genomes as described in li et al 2020 mega x was used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the hzsa gene using along with reference sequences of anammox bacteria kumar et al 2018 2 4 anammox kinetic assay batch experiments were used to further explore the apparent kinetic characteristics of anammox in granules and fixed biofilm to decrease the bias from diffusion limitation the granules and biofilm remained the original form in ex situ serum bottles to mimicked the in situ condition the initial nh4 n concentration was limiting and set at 5 10 15 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 the initial no2 n was in excess with the no2 n nh4 n ratio 1 5 the experiments were conducted in 120 ml serum bottles which were sealed using a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal the headspace of the sealed bottle was purged with n2 gas to remove do biomass concentration was approximately 1 g vss l 1 with 80 ml of nutrient medium the bottles were stirred on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm with the chamber temperature of 30 1 c the concentration of nh4 n was measured at regular intervals and fitted to a simplified kinetic equation eq 1 to estimate the apparent maximum ammonium consumption rates v max app the apparent half saturation constants of ammonium k m app values with levenberg marquardt in addition the measured nh4 n concentrations in lower granules and upper fixed biofilm regions of igb a pd reactor were each substituted into the kinetic equation to obtain the in situ rate of nh4 n consumption in each region 1 v v max app s s k m app where v v max app k m app and s were the rate of ammonium consumption the maximum ammonium consumption rates the apparent half saturation constants of ammonium and the concentration of ammonium respectively 2 5 mass balance calculations to determine the nitrogen transformation flux in the system a mass balance evaluation was performed in both granule and fixed biofilm regions of the reactor when the reactor performed stable in phase ii we in situ determined the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in granules section fixed biofilm section and junction section to avoid the bias from the hydraulic characteristic difference compared using ex situ two stage system in the granules it was assumed that the nh4 n was consumed by anammox thus the consumed amounts of nh4 n can be deduced by the difference value between the influent and effluent nh4 n of granules zone according to the previously established stoichiometric parameter strous et al 1998 see detail in text s2 the initial ratio consumption of no2 n to nh4 n by anammox in iteration calculation was set 1 32 subsequently the feedback from the nitrite producing by pd and the feeding nitrite consuming value would polish the ratio after multiple iterations the final ratio of consumed nh4 n and no2 n was obtained to further explore the fate of the no3 n produced by anammox the in situ rates of denitrification nitrate reduced to gaseous form nitrogen shapleigh 2013 partial denitrification only nitrate to nitrite and dnra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium were firstly determined using nox reduction specific activity experiments shi et al 2013 castro barros et al 2017 in brief the no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the lower region granules zone of reactor were firstly determined then the determined concentration values were used as the initial no3 n and no2 n concentrations for two different batch reduction experiments in the nitrate reduction assay the concentrations of no3 n were measured at regular intervals to calculate the rate of nitrate reduction for the nitrite reduction assay the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n were measured to calculate the rate of nitrite reduction and the rate of ammonium production v dnra respectively hence the specific activity of denitrification v d is equivalent to the nitrite reduction rate minus dnra rate the specific pd activity v pd is equivalent to the nitrate reduction rate minus the nitrite reduction rate then given the reactor was operated in continuous mode the reduced no3 n flux to denitrification pd and dnra were calculated based on the ratios of v d v pd and v dnra respectively according to wang et al 2020b and sheng et al 2021 as shown in eq 2 4 the bod flux was calculated by relating nox reduction reaction stoichiometries which was described in text s2 the same steps were conducted to evaluate the nitrogen transformation fate in the fixed biofilm 2 f d f v d v d v pd v dnra 3 f pd f v pd v d v pd v dnra 4 f dnra f v pd v d v pd v dnra where f d f pd and f dnra were the no3 n flux to denitrification pd and dnra respectively f were the amount of no3 n transformation 2 6 analytical methods all the liquid samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter before analysis for nh4 n no2 n and no3 n using standard methods apha 2005 bod was determined using a bod q analyzer ll is zhongke dexin china all tests were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the igb a pd reactor critical performance characteristics of the integrated fixed film granular sludge igb anammox partial denitrification a pd reactor are shown in fig 2 during phase i day 1 to day 67 which had an influent nh4 n of 48 2 3 3 mg l 1 and no2 n of 62 3 8 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no2 n rapidly increased and then stabilized at 91 0 and 90 1 respectively with the effluent accumulated no3 n of 14 9 3 3 mg l 1 which indicated that inoculated anammox biomass had adapted to the relatively lower total nitrogen concentration during phase ii day 68 to day 205 the bod and fixed biofilm carrier materials were added the influent nh4 n and no2 n were further decreased to be 25 9 1 9 mg l 1 and 29 0 3 6 mg l 1 during this phase the effluent concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and bod gradually decreased and eventually stabilized at 0 8 0 4 mg l 1 0 4 0 3 mg l 1 2 1 1 3 mg l 1 and 1 0 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 as a consequence the average tin removal efficiency reached a maximal value of 94 0 and there was an average effluent tin of 3 3 mg l 1 values which satisfy the strictest discharge standard in china tin 10 mg l 1 in addition the average nitrogen removal rate nrr reached as high as 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 which was significantly higher than the values reported for other mainstream a pd systems ji et al 2018 du et al 2020 3 2 profile of nitrogen transformation genes the expression of the key genes for anammox nitrification and partial denitrification were determined using metatranscriptomic analysis the relative expression abundance was evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm zhuang et al 2020 as expected compare to phase i the expressions of hydrazine synthase gene hzsa and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh the key functional genes for anammox strous et al 2006 maalcke et al 2016 were lower in phase ii likely due to the lower influent nitrogen concentration fig 3 while the hzsa and hdh expressed significantly higher in granules 6966 6 rpm and 4506 164 rpm respectively than fixed biofilm 5718 6 rpm and 2472 104 rpm respectively which suggests higher anammox activity in granules than that of the fixed biofilm the gene of ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa was expectedly expressed at very low levels rpm 3 in both phase i and phase ii due to the anaerobic condition to gain insight into nitrate reduction activity the expression of the related genes for nitrate reduction napa narg nitrite reduction nirs nirk and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nirb nrfa were evaluated fig 3 as there is the addition of organic in phase ii the above denitrification genes showed higher expression level than phase i expect to nirs the expression of nitrate reductase in granules and fixed biofilm were 99 2 3 5 and 55 7 1 4 rpm respectively which was comparable to the expression values of nitrite reductase of 103 8 8 4 and 68 7 3 7 rpm respectively the expression ratios of nirs nirk napa narg in granules and fixed biofilm were 1 0 and 1 2 respectively both of which was less than the ranges of 2 0 2 5 yang et al 2020 wang et al 2020a indicating pd with nitrite accumulation could be achieved in this reactor interestingly the sum expression value of nirb and nrfa in granules and fixed biofilm were 55 7 1 1 and 69 7 3 9 rpm respectively which is over the half of the sum expression value of napa and narg in granules and fixed biofilm this relative expression level of the dnra genes is significantly greater than previously reported values in anoxic biosystems yang et al 2020 wang et al 2020b suggesting dnra could play an important role in achieving high effluent quality this is because the nitrate produced from anammox could be reduced to ammonium via dnra which can be removed via anammox allowing the effluent tin further is decreased 3 3 genome based key nitrogen cycle genes analysis metagenomic assembly yielded 28 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags table s1 taxonomic results showed three anammox genomes designated as amx1 amx2 and amx3 amx1 and amx2 were both affiliated with the genus candidatus brocadia while the amx3 was affiliated with the genus ca kuenenia after the long term operation the abundances of amx1 and amx2 were increase from 0 1 in phase i to 3 8 in phase ii while the amx3 was decrease significantly from 8 2 to 0 1 this result suggested that the dominate anammox population was shift from ca kuenenia in phase i to ca brocadia in phase ii likely related to the decrease in nitrogen loading rate from phase i to phase ii zhang and okabe 2020 in the granules 12 42 of the rna reads were from amx1 this was about twice that in the fixed biofilm 6 86 but amx1 was still the dominant organism here as well amx2 had a gene expression of 0 50 in both granules and fixed biofilm fig 4 a amx1 and amx2 showed average gani and aai value of 91 and 87 respectively in genome comparisons with their closest sequenced relatives fig s1 both these values are below the established species cutoff of gani of 96 5 and aai of 95 0 varghese et al 2015 cabal et al 2018 suggesting that amx1 and amx2 represent new species of anammox bacteria amx3 was classified as the ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis what s more hzsa is usually regarded as a suitable gene marker to investigate the diversity of anammox bacteria in a certain system bhattacharjee et al 2017 here the hzsa was used to assess the niche partitioning of the recovered anammox draft genomes by alignment with known hzsa it was shown that the hzsa from the amx1 aligned with 94 nucleotide identities to high affinity anammox bacteria of ca brocadia sapporoensis fig s2 which been reported has a significantly higher growth rate than ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis narita et al 2017 this was high likely to be the main reason to explain why the amx1 become dominated in phase ii in compare to phase i organisms are more active in phase ii except to anammox bacteria mags affiliated with myxococcota myx1 which encoded the functional genes for denitrification was enriched and responsible for the abundance 11 3 15 7 and gene expression 4 7 10 7 in the phase ii fig 4 what s more the transcription ratio of nirk to napa narg in myx1 were 1 0 and 0 8 in both granules and fixed biofilm respectively it has been reported that pd can be conducted by truncated denitrifiers which lack nitrite reductase or via progressive onset po denitrifiers organisms which possess the complete denitrification pathway but show what has been termed po denitrification liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 that is the nitrite reductase gene could be inhibited by the residue nitrate in the bioreactor leading the transitory nitrite accumulation during nitrate dependent denitrification process li et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge the accumulation of nitrite in denitrification was more commonly conducted by po denitrifiers rather than truncated denitrifiers zhang et al 2020 in addition the metabolic conditions in this study including carbon type sodium acetate low initial c n ratio 1 1 the relative shorter reaction time hrt of 1 5 h and the residual effluent nitrate 2 1 1 3 mg l 1 are all favorable for pd process to take place via po denitrifiers hence it can be concluded that po denitrification mainly due to the presence of myx1 was the major pathway responsible for the partial denitrification by regulating the nitrite reductase expression zhang et al 2020 bacteria containing the key dnra gene nrfa or nirb were numerically dominant occurring in 13 mags and accounted for more than 5 0 of the total dna reads in the phase ii fig 4 the most highly occurring member of this group was pla1 which was affiliated with planctomycetota pla1 harbors the complete dnra metabolic pathway and had a dna read of 0 6 1 9 and its gene expression of 2 9 11 6 these results suggested that dnra as represented by pla1 were not negligible and consequently important for achieving high effluent quality in this reactor 3 4 kinetic assays and nitrogen transformation flux of the igb a pd system to better understand the nitrogen transformation flux in the igb a pd reactor the nitrogen flux was evaluated based on the tested in situ rates and previously determined metabolism values fig 5 the concentrations of nh4 n in the lower and upper regions of the reactor were determined and substituted into the anammox simplified kinetic equation eq 1 to calculate the in situ anammox activity of the granules and fixed biofilm table 1 calculations showed that granules had an anammox activity of 16 2 2 3 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1 which was significantly higher than the fixed biofilm which had an activity of 4 9 0 4 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1 in addition the apparent half saturation constant of km app of the anammox for ammonium in the fixed biofilm was 2 6 mg l 1 which was lower than the 7 0 mg l 1 determined for the granules likely due to the enrichment of high affinity species and larger specific area in fixed biofilm fig s3 indicating the additional polish function for anammox substrate removal was occurred in the fixed biofilm section the nitrate reduction rates for granules and fixed biofilm were determined to be 4 0 0 5 g n kg 1 vss d 1 and 4 3 0 2 g n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively table 1 these values were as 4 fold high as that value of nitrite reduction indicating that 75 of the nitrate was not further reduced to the more reduced products than nitrite in both sites the dnra activity in both granules and fixed biofilm was also calculated and had considerable values of 1 0 0 1 g n kg 1 vss d 1 and 1 1 0 2 g n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively indicating that dnra accounted for 25 of the nitrate reduction these results indicated the anammox producing nitrate are highly likely transformed by various modes of nitrate reductions that are denitrification 25 pd 50 and dnra 25 occurring in both granules and fixed biofilm and these complementary physiological activities were the major drivers of the high efficiency of tin removal which was consistent with the meta omics result 3 5 implication of this work in this study an igb a pd reactor was built to treat mainstream wastewater long term operation confirmed the reactor has an effective performance producing high quality effluent with tin of 3 mg l 1 and a nrr of 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 which was higher than previously reported a pd systems ji et al 2018 du et al 2020 metagenomic combined metatranscriptomic analysis showed that the effectively retention of anammox bacteria was achieving in both granules and fixed biofilm in addition to the pd bacteria the dnra bacteria was unexpectedly found in the reactor recently dnra process were reported in several high strength anammox reactors keren et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 but it has rarely been detected in the mainstream a pd system du et al 2020 in this study both meta omics and kinetic assays tools indicate that the dnra possess play an undeniably important role to eliminate 25 of the nitrate produced by anammox leading to an improvement in effluent quality it has been reported that bod no3 n ratios of 7 with nitrate 100 μm is a key factor promoting dnra van den berg et al 2015 jia et al 2020 thus the active dnra occurrence may highly likely be attributed to the high ratio bod no3 n up to 10 and nitrate concentration low to 70 μm in some micro environments in the igb a pd reactor based on the determined concentration values during the phase ii from the perspective of the reactor operation the observation that the co occurs of anammox bacteria pd bacteria and dnra bacteria provides some important clues about factors maintaining the functional bacteria balance in the igb a pd bioreactor that is controlling of certain parameters that can achieve effective retention the anammox bacteria such as solids retention time srt and inflow rates or maintain the proper abundance of heterotrophic pd bacteria and dnra bacteria by controlling the organic carbon type and its concentration fig 5 showed the estimated mass flux in the a pd bioreactor overall the majority of the tin approximately 78 was removed in the lower region of the igb a pd reactor by anammox granules while the fixed biofilm was responsible for the removal of an additional approximately 16 of the total tin this suggested that the granules with high nitrogen removal activity are the dominant site of the nrr in the reactor while the fixed biofilm harbored high affinity community including anammox bacteria pd bacteria and dnra bacteria is critical to the improvement of effluent quality this combination of granules and fixed biofilm in single reactor is termed multilevel a pd and produces an effective performance for nitrogen removal treatment from mainstream wastewater based on the work described here the municipal wastewater treatment process allowing igb a pd reactor that could potentially be implemented in wwtps is shown in fig 6 in this process the influent of the igb a pd reactor is proposed from the full nitritation effluent after dilution by 40 raw real municipal wastewater while the mainstream municipal wastewater used in this work is synthetic in order to verify the proof of concept of the novel reactor system further studies on the igb a pd reactor performance treating the actual mainstream wastewater after pn treatment are recommended for the full scaling in next step 4 conclusion in this work the operational characteristics of an integrated granular sludge and fixed biofilm igb anammox partial denitrification a pd reactor which has the potential to work with mainstream municipal wastewaters were comprehensively reported excellent effluent quality of 3 mg l 1 of total effluent nitrogen was obtained with a nrr of 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 combined metatranscriptomic and metagenomic analyses showed that dnra anammox and pd were coupled in both the granules and fixed biofilm portions of the reactor kinetic assays and mass balance evaluation found that pd and dnra was responsible for 50 and 25 of nitrate reduction respectively in the reactor which is critical for polishing tin in the effluent multilevel a pd in which both granules and fixed biofilms possess a pd is responsible for the superior performance of this reactor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work

16354,this study describes an integrated granular sludge and fixed biofilm igb reactor innovatively designed to carry out the anammox partial denitrification a pd process for nitrogen removal with mainstream municipal wastewater the igb a pd reactor consists of anammox granules inoculated in the lower region of reactor and an acclimated fixed biofilm positioned in the upper region compared to the other reported a pd systems for mainstream wastewater treatment this igb a pd reactor is notable due to its higher quality effluent with a total inorganic nitrogen tin of 3 mg l 1 and operation at a high nitrogen removal rate nrr of 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 reads based metatranscriptomic analysis found that the expression values of hzsa and hdh key genes associated with anammox were much higher than other functional genes on nitrogen conversion confirming the major roles of the anammox bacteria in nitrogen bio removal in both regions of the reactor the nitrate reduction genes napa narg had expression values of 56 99 rpm which were similar to that of the nitrite reduction genes nirs nirk the expression reads from genes for dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra nrfa and nirb were unexpectedly high and were over the half of the levels of reads from genes required for nitrate reduction kinetic assays confirmed that the granules had an anammox activity of 16 2 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1 and a nitrate reduction activity of 4 1 g n kg 1 vss d 1 while these values were changed to be 4 9 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1and 4 3 g n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively in the fixed biofilm mass flux determination found that pd and dnra was responsible for 50 and 25 of nitrate reduction respectively in the whole reactor consistent with high effluent quality and treatment efficiency via a nitrite loop metagenomic binning analysis revealed that new and unidentified anammox species affiliated with candidatus brocadia were the dominant anammox organisms myxococcota and planctomycetota were the principal organisms associated with the pd and dnra processes respectively graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox partial denitrification dnra mainstream wastewater igb bioreactor meta omics 1 introduction anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox which is the oxidation of ammonium to nitrogen gas under anaerobic conditions using nitrite as electron acceptor is a resource efficient biological wastewater treatment technology for sustainable nitrogen removal due to its no requirements for external organics addition and aeration siegrist et al 2008 kartal et al 2010 given that nitrite is not common in typical wastewaters aerobic partial nitritation pn was considered to be an effective pretreatment method that transfer half of the influent ammonium to nitrite for anammox lackner et al 2014 cao et al 2017 the partial nitritation anammox pn a is now becoming the practical alternative to traditional nitrification denitrification in full scale application for the advantages of neutral or even positive energy balance lackner et al 2014 pn a has been widely implemented in dewatering liquor from anaerobic digesters in the sidestream of wwtp but the application of full scale mainstream pn a was still limited ali et al 2015 cao et al 2017 one of the major concerns is the high effluent nitrate concentrations resulting in total inorganic nitrogen tin exceeding the stringent discharge standard in china ma et al 2017 qiu et al 2020 trinh et al 2021 despite splitting the pn a in two different reactors can avoid the nitrate production by nitrifiers in anammox reactor there still is 11 nitrate production by anammox process strous et al 1998 recently partial denitrification pd no3 no2 has been reported as an effective approach for reducing the nitrate produced by anammox and its output can be fed back into the anammox process du et al 2019 thus anammox coupled with pd a pd in anoxic system is a promising process to achieve the effluent tin satisfying discharge stand from mainstream wastewater when connected to the aerobic pn system ji et al 2020 pn operation under mainstream conditions has been intensively studied duan et al 2019 jin et al 2019 li et al 2021 however despite the use of a pd in mainstream wastewater treatment receiving increasing attention cao et al 2020 it is still an open question how to achieve high effluent quality with high nitrogen removal rate nrr in a one stage anoxic bioreactor the anammox granule has been extensively used in high nitrogen loading rate reactor which would strengthen the communication and cooperation of the anammox bacteria due to its high cell density kartal et al 2011 lackner et al 2014 recent study confirmed the feasibility of using sidestream anammox granules to start up mainstream up flow reactors and achieve highest volumetric nitrogen removal rate of mainstream treatment cheng et al 2020 however whether the mainstream anammox granules reactor can achieve the required effluent tin quality will be the next issue since the dominate anammox bacteria in granules would be r strategy and normally with high growth rate and low nitrogen affinity reino and carrera 2017 zhang and okabe 2020 co culture the k strategy anammox bacteria with high nitrogen affinity could be an effective approach to improve the effluent tin quality gottshall et al 2021 however compared to the r strategy anammox bacteria the k strategy anammox bacteria grows slower and is more difficult to self aggregate which would result it washout from the reactor oshiki et al 2016 zhang and okabe 2020 the addition of carrier materials has been reported as an economic and effective approach that can significantly enhance high affinity anammox bacteria retention kosgey et al 2021 therefore we proposed to build an integrated granular sludge and fixed biofilm igb reactor could be used to achieve enhanced nitrogen removal performance with high nrr and low effluent tin simultaneously more specifically anammox granules as inoculum are positioned in the underpart of the up flow reactor for high nrr while a fixed biofilm as high affinity anammox bacteria retention facilitator is positioned in the upside for the effluent polish the pd bacteria has been observed as the symbiotic bacteria in almost all the reported anammox system wang et al 2016 lawson et al 2017 li et al 2017 given there is organic in mainstream wastewater the pd bacteria would play a key role in the igb reactor for both granules and fixed biofilm sections herein the goals in this study were to develop an igb reactor to carry out anammox partial denitrification a pd and explore its performance in treating mainstream municipal wastewater subsequently the potential mechanisms causing functional differences between granules and fixed biofilm were further analyzed by linking the community profiles gene expression and physiological characteristics of the granules and fixed biofilm using meta omics analysis finally kinetic assays and mass balance evaluation were conducted to identify the relative contributions associated with either the granules or fixed biofilm to overall nitrogen removal and unveil the nitrogen transformation flux the results of this study will determine if this approach is a practical alternative for mainstream wastewater treatment and in addition shed light on the microbial community critical for its function 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation an igb a pd reactor was established with an effective height to inner diameter ratio of 7 and operated more than 200 days fig 1 the sampling ports from bottom to top represented the height of 5 20 and 40 cm respectively it was operated in continuous up flow mode the inoculant anammox granular sludge was obtained from a lab scale anammox granular sludge reactor with an influent nh4 n concentration as 150 mg l 1 zhuang et al 2020 the synthetic wastewater was prepared as described by van de graaf et al 1996 complete operation of the reactor consisted of two phases in phase i the influent concentration of nh4 n and no2 n were 50 mg l 1 and 60 mg l 1 respectively to promote anammox adaptation during relative lower nitrogen loading until the nh4 n removal efficiency became higher than 90 in phase ii polypropylene fiber was added as biomass carriers and positioned within the upper 40 of the reactor s effective volume to explore the flexibility of the igb a pd reactor to treat mainstream wastewater during phase ii nh4 n no2 n and bod sodium acetate were set at 25 30 and 60 mg l 1 concentrations respectively to mimic the mainstream wastewater after partial nitritation treatment kouba et al 2017 jin et al 2019 shear forces via increasing temporarily reflux rate were applied to regulate the thickness and biomass of fixed biofilm the volatile suspended solids vss concentration hydraulic retention time hrt inflow rate effluent recirculation ratio influent ph and liquid temperature in reactor were set as 15 8 1 2 g l 1 1 5 h 20 l d 1 1 0 7 5 0 5 20 25 respectively 2 2 dna and rna extraction and sequencing the sludge samples in phase i day 65 as well as the granules and fixed biofilm samples in phase ii day 200 were collected in duplicate for dna and rna extraction from the igb a pd reactor genomic dna from granules and fixed biofilm was extracted using the fastdna spin kit for soil mo bio laboratorieps inc usa according to the manufacturer s instructions the total rna of granular sludge and the fixed biofilm was extracted using the powermicrobiome rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc usa the dna or rna of each sludge sample were extracted in duplicate and mixed for library establishing the dna and rna libraries were sequenced on a novaseq 6000 illumina at magigene guangzhou china to generate 150 nt paired end reads raw dna and rna sequences can be found at the national center for biotechnology information ncbi website under prjna736868 2 3 metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis raw reads were quality filtered using sickle version 1 33 joshi and fass 2011 as described by bhattacharjee et al 2017 diamond version 0 8 34 buchfink et al 2015 was used to compare sample rna reads against a custom manually curated database of nitrogen cycle relative enzymes with the e value cut off 10 5 the database contains 11 key enzymes associated with anammox nitrification and partial denitrification created as referred to li et al 2020 kaiju version 1 5 0 was used to taxonomic assignment analyze based on reads menzel et al 2016 high quality metagenomic assembled genomes mags were recovered and their abundance was determined as described in li et al 2018 checkm was used to assess the completeness and quality of each mag parks et al 2015 taxonomic assignment of the mags was carried out using gtdb tk v1 1 0 chaumeil et al 2019 open reading frames orfs were predicted from bins using prodigal version 2 6 3 with default parameters hyatt et al 2010 annotation of the scaffolded genome bins was performed using metapathways version 2 0 against kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway kegg database konwar et al 2013 the abundance and relative gene expression of each mag was predicted using bbduk with the parameters mkf 1 0 k 31 and normalized by sequencing depth zhou et al 2020 genome wide average nucleotide identity gani and average amino acid identity aai were used to differentiate the anammox draft genomes as described in li et al 2020 mega x was used to construct a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the hzsa gene using along with reference sequences of anammox bacteria kumar et al 2018 2 4 anammox kinetic assay batch experiments were used to further explore the apparent kinetic characteristics of anammox in granules and fixed biofilm to decrease the bias from diffusion limitation the granules and biofilm remained the original form in ex situ serum bottles to mimicked the in situ condition the initial nh4 n concentration was limiting and set at 5 10 15 25 50 and 100 mg l 1 the initial no2 n was in excess with the no2 n nh4 n ratio 1 5 the experiments were conducted in 120 ml serum bottles which were sealed using a butyl rubber septa and aluminum crimp seal the headspace of the sealed bottle was purged with n2 gas to remove do biomass concentration was approximately 1 g vss l 1 with 80 ml of nutrient medium the bottles were stirred on a rotary shaker at 180 rpm with the chamber temperature of 30 1 c the concentration of nh4 n was measured at regular intervals and fitted to a simplified kinetic equation eq 1 to estimate the apparent maximum ammonium consumption rates v max app the apparent half saturation constants of ammonium k m app values with levenberg marquardt in addition the measured nh4 n concentrations in lower granules and upper fixed biofilm regions of igb a pd reactor were each substituted into the kinetic equation to obtain the in situ rate of nh4 n consumption in each region 1 v v max app s s k m app where v v max app k m app and s were the rate of ammonium consumption the maximum ammonium consumption rates the apparent half saturation constants of ammonium and the concentration of ammonium respectively 2 5 mass balance calculations to determine the nitrogen transformation flux in the system a mass balance evaluation was performed in both granule and fixed biofilm regions of the reactor when the reactor performed stable in phase ii we in situ determined the concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n in granules section fixed biofilm section and junction section to avoid the bias from the hydraulic characteristic difference compared using ex situ two stage system in the granules it was assumed that the nh4 n was consumed by anammox thus the consumed amounts of nh4 n can be deduced by the difference value between the influent and effluent nh4 n of granules zone according to the previously established stoichiometric parameter strous et al 1998 see detail in text s2 the initial ratio consumption of no2 n to nh4 n by anammox in iteration calculation was set 1 32 subsequently the feedback from the nitrite producing by pd and the feeding nitrite consuming value would polish the ratio after multiple iterations the final ratio of consumed nh4 n and no2 n was obtained to further explore the fate of the no3 n produced by anammox the in situ rates of denitrification nitrate reduced to gaseous form nitrogen shapleigh 2013 partial denitrification only nitrate to nitrite and dnra dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium were firstly determined using nox reduction specific activity experiments shi et al 2013 castro barros et al 2017 in brief the no3 n and no2 n concentrations in the lower region granules zone of reactor were firstly determined then the determined concentration values were used as the initial no3 n and no2 n concentrations for two different batch reduction experiments in the nitrate reduction assay the concentrations of no3 n were measured at regular intervals to calculate the rate of nitrate reduction for the nitrite reduction assay the concentrations of no2 n and nh4 n were measured to calculate the rate of nitrite reduction and the rate of ammonium production v dnra respectively hence the specific activity of denitrification v d is equivalent to the nitrite reduction rate minus dnra rate the specific pd activity v pd is equivalent to the nitrate reduction rate minus the nitrite reduction rate then given the reactor was operated in continuous mode the reduced no3 n flux to denitrification pd and dnra were calculated based on the ratios of v d v pd and v dnra respectively according to wang et al 2020b and sheng et al 2021 as shown in eq 2 4 the bod flux was calculated by relating nox reduction reaction stoichiometries which was described in text s2 the same steps were conducted to evaluate the nitrogen transformation fate in the fixed biofilm 2 f d f v d v d v pd v dnra 3 f pd f v pd v d v pd v dnra 4 f dnra f v pd v d v pd v dnra where f d f pd and f dnra were the no3 n flux to denitrification pd and dnra respectively f were the amount of no3 n transformation 2 6 analytical methods all the liquid samples were passed through a 0 45 μm filter before analysis for nh4 n no2 n and no3 n using standard methods apha 2005 bod was determined using a bod q analyzer ll is zhongke dexin china all tests were performed in triplicate and the results were expressed as mean standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of the igb a pd reactor critical performance characteristics of the integrated fixed film granular sludge igb anammox partial denitrification a pd reactor are shown in fig 2 during phase i day 1 to day 67 which had an influent nh4 n of 48 2 3 3 mg l 1 and no2 n of 62 3 8 mg l 1 the removal efficiencies of nh4 n and no2 n rapidly increased and then stabilized at 91 0 and 90 1 respectively with the effluent accumulated no3 n of 14 9 3 3 mg l 1 which indicated that inoculated anammox biomass had adapted to the relatively lower total nitrogen concentration during phase ii day 68 to day 205 the bod and fixed biofilm carrier materials were added the influent nh4 n and no2 n were further decreased to be 25 9 1 9 mg l 1 and 29 0 3 6 mg l 1 during this phase the effluent concentration of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and bod gradually decreased and eventually stabilized at 0 8 0 4 mg l 1 0 4 0 3 mg l 1 2 1 1 3 mg l 1 and 1 0 mg l 1 respectively fig 2 as a consequence the average tin removal efficiency reached a maximal value of 94 0 and there was an average effluent tin of 3 3 mg l 1 values which satisfy the strictest discharge standard in china tin 10 mg l 1 in addition the average nitrogen removal rate nrr reached as high as 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 which was significantly higher than the values reported for other mainstream a pd systems ji et al 2018 du et al 2020 3 2 profile of nitrogen transformation genes the expression of the key genes for anammox nitrification and partial denitrification were determined using metatranscriptomic analysis the relative expression abundance was evaluated by normalizing the annotated reads to reads per million total reads rpm zhuang et al 2020 as expected compare to phase i the expressions of hydrazine synthase gene hzsa and hydrazine dehydrogenase hdh the key functional genes for anammox strous et al 2006 maalcke et al 2016 were lower in phase ii likely due to the lower influent nitrogen concentration fig 3 while the hzsa and hdh expressed significantly higher in granules 6966 6 rpm and 4506 164 rpm respectively than fixed biofilm 5718 6 rpm and 2472 104 rpm respectively which suggests higher anammox activity in granules than that of the fixed biofilm the gene of ammonia monooxygenase subunit a amoa was expectedly expressed at very low levels rpm 3 in both phase i and phase ii due to the anaerobic condition to gain insight into nitrate reduction activity the expression of the related genes for nitrate reduction napa narg nitrite reduction nirs nirk and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium nirb nrfa were evaluated fig 3 as there is the addition of organic in phase ii the above denitrification genes showed higher expression level than phase i expect to nirs the expression of nitrate reductase in granules and fixed biofilm were 99 2 3 5 and 55 7 1 4 rpm respectively which was comparable to the expression values of nitrite reductase of 103 8 8 4 and 68 7 3 7 rpm respectively the expression ratios of nirs nirk napa narg in granules and fixed biofilm were 1 0 and 1 2 respectively both of which was less than the ranges of 2 0 2 5 yang et al 2020 wang et al 2020a indicating pd with nitrite accumulation could be achieved in this reactor interestingly the sum expression value of nirb and nrfa in granules and fixed biofilm were 55 7 1 1 and 69 7 3 9 rpm respectively which is over the half of the sum expression value of napa and narg in granules and fixed biofilm this relative expression level of the dnra genes is significantly greater than previously reported values in anoxic biosystems yang et al 2020 wang et al 2020b suggesting dnra could play an important role in achieving high effluent quality this is because the nitrate produced from anammox could be reduced to ammonium via dnra which can be removed via anammox allowing the effluent tin further is decreased 3 3 genome based key nitrogen cycle genes analysis metagenomic assembly yielded 28 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags table s1 taxonomic results showed three anammox genomes designated as amx1 amx2 and amx3 amx1 and amx2 were both affiliated with the genus candidatus brocadia while the amx3 was affiliated with the genus ca kuenenia after the long term operation the abundances of amx1 and amx2 were increase from 0 1 in phase i to 3 8 in phase ii while the amx3 was decrease significantly from 8 2 to 0 1 this result suggested that the dominate anammox population was shift from ca kuenenia in phase i to ca brocadia in phase ii likely related to the decrease in nitrogen loading rate from phase i to phase ii zhang and okabe 2020 in the granules 12 42 of the rna reads were from amx1 this was about twice that in the fixed biofilm 6 86 but amx1 was still the dominant organism here as well amx2 had a gene expression of 0 50 in both granules and fixed biofilm fig 4 a amx1 and amx2 showed average gani and aai value of 91 and 87 respectively in genome comparisons with their closest sequenced relatives fig s1 both these values are below the established species cutoff of gani of 96 5 and aai of 95 0 varghese et al 2015 cabal et al 2018 suggesting that amx1 and amx2 represent new species of anammox bacteria amx3 was classified as the ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis what s more hzsa is usually regarded as a suitable gene marker to investigate the diversity of anammox bacteria in a certain system bhattacharjee et al 2017 here the hzsa was used to assess the niche partitioning of the recovered anammox draft genomes by alignment with known hzsa it was shown that the hzsa from the amx1 aligned with 94 nucleotide identities to high affinity anammox bacteria of ca brocadia sapporoensis fig s2 which been reported has a significantly higher growth rate than ca kuenenia stuttgartiensis narita et al 2017 this was high likely to be the main reason to explain why the amx1 become dominated in phase ii in compare to phase i organisms are more active in phase ii except to anammox bacteria mags affiliated with myxococcota myx1 which encoded the functional genes for denitrification was enriched and responsible for the abundance 11 3 15 7 and gene expression 4 7 10 7 in the phase ii fig 4 what s more the transcription ratio of nirk to napa narg in myx1 were 1 0 and 0 8 in both granules and fixed biofilm respectively it has been reported that pd can be conducted by truncated denitrifiers which lack nitrite reductase or via progressive onset po denitrifiers organisms which possess the complete denitrification pathway but show what has been termed po denitrification liu et al 2013 lycus et al 2017 that is the nitrite reductase gene could be inhibited by the residue nitrate in the bioreactor leading the transitory nitrite accumulation during nitrate dependent denitrification process li et al 2018 to the best of our knowledge the accumulation of nitrite in denitrification was more commonly conducted by po denitrifiers rather than truncated denitrifiers zhang et al 2020 in addition the metabolic conditions in this study including carbon type sodium acetate low initial c n ratio 1 1 the relative shorter reaction time hrt of 1 5 h and the residual effluent nitrate 2 1 1 3 mg l 1 are all favorable for pd process to take place via po denitrifiers hence it can be concluded that po denitrification mainly due to the presence of myx1 was the major pathway responsible for the partial denitrification by regulating the nitrite reductase expression zhang et al 2020 bacteria containing the key dnra gene nrfa or nirb were numerically dominant occurring in 13 mags and accounted for more than 5 0 of the total dna reads in the phase ii fig 4 the most highly occurring member of this group was pla1 which was affiliated with planctomycetota pla1 harbors the complete dnra metabolic pathway and had a dna read of 0 6 1 9 and its gene expression of 2 9 11 6 these results suggested that dnra as represented by pla1 were not negligible and consequently important for achieving high effluent quality in this reactor 3 4 kinetic assays and nitrogen transformation flux of the igb a pd system to better understand the nitrogen transformation flux in the igb a pd reactor the nitrogen flux was evaluated based on the tested in situ rates and previously determined metabolism values fig 5 the concentrations of nh4 n in the lower and upper regions of the reactor were determined and substituted into the anammox simplified kinetic equation eq 1 to calculate the in situ anammox activity of the granules and fixed biofilm table 1 calculations showed that granules had an anammox activity of 16 2 2 3 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1 which was significantly higher than the fixed biofilm which had an activity of 4 9 0 4 g nh4 n kg 1 vss d 1 in addition the apparent half saturation constant of km app of the anammox for ammonium in the fixed biofilm was 2 6 mg l 1 which was lower than the 7 0 mg l 1 determined for the granules likely due to the enrichment of high affinity species and larger specific area in fixed biofilm fig s3 indicating the additional polish function for anammox substrate removal was occurred in the fixed biofilm section the nitrate reduction rates for granules and fixed biofilm were determined to be 4 0 0 5 g n kg 1 vss d 1 and 4 3 0 2 g n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively table 1 these values were as 4 fold high as that value of nitrite reduction indicating that 75 of the nitrate was not further reduced to the more reduced products than nitrite in both sites the dnra activity in both granules and fixed biofilm was also calculated and had considerable values of 1 0 0 1 g n kg 1 vss d 1 and 1 1 0 2 g n kg 1 vss d 1 respectively indicating that dnra accounted for 25 of the nitrate reduction these results indicated the anammox producing nitrate are highly likely transformed by various modes of nitrate reductions that are denitrification 25 pd 50 and dnra 25 occurring in both granules and fixed biofilm and these complementary physiological activities were the major drivers of the high efficiency of tin removal which was consistent with the meta omics result 3 5 implication of this work in this study an igb a pd reactor was built to treat mainstream wastewater long term operation confirmed the reactor has an effective performance producing high quality effluent with tin of 3 mg l 1 and a nrr of 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 which was higher than previously reported a pd systems ji et al 2018 du et al 2020 metagenomic combined metatranscriptomic analysis showed that the effectively retention of anammox bacteria was achieving in both granules and fixed biofilm in addition to the pd bacteria the dnra bacteria was unexpectedly found in the reactor recently dnra process were reported in several high strength anammox reactors keren et al 2020 ahmad et al 2021 but it has rarely been detected in the mainstream a pd system du et al 2020 in this study both meta omics and kinetic assays tools indicate that the dnra possess play an undeniably important role to eliminate 25 of the nitrate produced by anammox leading to an improvement in effluent quality it has been reported that bod no3 n ratios of 7 with nitrate 100 μm is a key factor promoting dnra van den berg et al 2015 jia et al 2020 thus the active dnra occurrence may highly likely be attributed to the high ratio bod no3 n up to 10 and nitrate concentration low to 70 μm in some micro environments in the igb a pd reactor based on the determined concentration values during the phase ii from the perspective of the reactor operation the observation that the co occurs of anammox bacteria pd bacteria and dnra bacteria provides some important clues about factors maintaining the functional bacteria balance in the igb a pd bioreactor that is controlling of certain parameters that can achieve effective retention the anammox bacteria such as solids retention time srt and inflow rates or maintain the proper abundance of heterotrophic pd bacteria and dnra bacteria by controlling the organic carbon type and its concentration fig 5 showed the estimated mass flux in the a pd bioreactor overall the majority of the tin approximately 78 was removed in the lower region of the igb a pd reactor by anammox granules while the fixed biofilm was responsible for the removal of an additional approximately 16 of the total tin this suggested that the granules with high nitrogen removal activity are the dominant site of the nrr in the reactor while the fixed biofilm harbored high affinity community including anammox bacteria pd bacteria and dnra bacteria is critical to the improvement of effluent quality this combination of granules and fixed biofilm in single reactor is termed multilevel a pd and produces an effective performance for nitrogen removal treatment from mainstream wastewater based on the work described here the municipal wastewater treatment process allowing igb a pd reactor that could potentially be implemented in wwtps is shown in fig 6 in this process the influent of the igb a pd reactor is proposed from the full nitritation effluent after dilution by 40 raw real municipal wastewater while the mainstream municipal wastewater used in this work is synthetic in order to verify the proof of concept of the novel reactor system further studies on the igb a pd reactor performance treating the actual mainstream wastewater after pn treatment are recommended for the full scaling in next step 4 conclusion in this work the operational characteristics of an integrated granular sludge and fixed biofilm igb anammox partial denitrification a pd reactor which has the potential to work with mainstream municipal wastewaters were comprehensively reported excellent effluent quality of 3 mg l 1 of total effluent nitrogen was obtained with a nrr of 0 8 0 1 kg n m 3 d 1 combined metatranscriptomic and metagenomic analyses showed that dnra anammox and pd were coupled in both the granules and fixed biofilm portions of the reactor kinetic assays and mass balance evaluation found that pd and dnra was responsible for 50 and 25 of nitrate reduction respectively in the reactor which is critical for polishing tin in the effluent multilevel a pd in which both granules and fixed biofilms possess a pd is responsible for the superior performance of this reactor declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments this work
