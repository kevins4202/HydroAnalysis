190,sub resolution porosity srp is a ubiquitous yet often ignored feature in digital rock physics it embodies the trade off between image resolution and field of view and it is a direct result of choosing an imaging resolution that is larger than the smallest pores in a heterogeneous rock sample in this study we investigate the impacts of srp on multiphase flow in porous rocks to do so we use our newly developed multiphase micro continuum model to perform first of a kind direct numerical simulations of two phase flow in porous samples containing srp we show that srp properties porosity permeability wettability can impact predicted absolute permeabilities fluid breakthrough times residual saturations and relative permeabilities by factors of 2 1 5 3 and 20 respectively in particular our results reveal that srp can function as a persistent connector preventing the formation of isolated wetting fluid domains during drainage thus dramatically increasing relative permeabilities to both fluids at low saturations overall our study confirms previous evidence that flow within the srp cannot be disregarded without incurring significant errors in numerical predictions or experimental analyses of multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media keywords porous media sub resolution porosity multiphase flow relative permeability multi scale micro continuum 1 introduction the emergence of digital rock physics drp has revolutionized the way we study porous media it is now possible to directly characterize the pore structure of subsurface systems and perform three dimensional direct numerical simulations of fluid flow in digital models of rock samples that approach the size of a representative elementary volume rev as such drp has transformed our capacity to characterize and predict fluid flow in soils sedimentary rocks hydrocarbon reservoirs and engineered porous systems mehmani et al 2020 han et al 2020 the computation of rock transport parameters including absolute permeability spanne et al 1994 dispersion coefficients bijeljic et al 2013 soulaine et al 2021a relative permeabilities and capillary pressures raeini et al 2014 prodanović et al 2014 has had direct impacts in the fields of reservoir engineering hydrology and co 2 sequestration blunt et al 2013 soulaine et al 2021b 1 1 rock imaging techniques and sub resolution porosity drp is made possible by advances in high resolution imaging techniques notably x ray microtomography xct baker et al 2012 singh et al 2018 kohanpur and valocchi 2020 and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy fib sem cnudde and boone 2013 kelly et al 2016 welch et al 2017 ruspini et al 2021 the first method xct involves recording hundreds or thousands of two dimensional 2 d x ray projections through a sample that are then computationally reconstructed to create a 3 d image this method enables detailed volumetric representations of rock core samples spanning several cubic millimeters with a resolution of about 1 x 1 x 1 micrometers wildenschild and sheppard 2013 blunt et al 2013 the second method fib sem involves repeated etching and imaging of a sample through alternating application of focused ion beams and scanning electron microscopy at considerably smaller scales it yields images spanning 5 cubic micrometers with an associated resolution of 5 x 5 x 5 nanometers dewers et al 2012 however the associated repeated etching procedure means that fib sem is a destructive imaging technique these two techniques highlight an important limitation of current imaging techniques the existence of an unavoidable trade off between image resolution and field of view the inherent complexity of most natural rocks further complicates the imaging and characterization process more often than not rocks such as sandstones carbonates and shales exhibit heterogeneities that span several length scales bear 1988 mousavi et al 2013 akbarabadi et al 2017 beckingham et al 2017 some of which cannot be properly resolved by the aforementioned imaging techniques a common way to simplify the imaging process while accounting for these heterogeneities is to designate a cutoff voxel size that resolves the largest pores within a given rock sample or other features of interest such as cracks or fractures while simultaneously acting as a filter for any pores smaller than that particular size these small pores which are not individually resolved are then designated sub resolution porosity srp and labeled as a third phase in the rock pore srp system during the eventual segmentation of sample images the final result is a reconstructed image with an acceptable trade off between resolution and field of view scheibe et al 2015 until recently and despite its abundance in reconstructed natural rock samples srp was generally assumed to have little influence on rock hydraulic properties predicted from flow simulations most computational models were based on the simplifying assumption that transport within the srp is dominated by diffusion and thus contributes negligibly to fluid flow haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 gouze et al 2008 shabro et al 2011 gjetvaj et al 2015 however recent studies have shown that this assumption breaks down whenever srp contributes significantly to the rock s percolating path by forming bridges between resolved pore spaces churcher et al 1991 tanino and blunt 2012 wu et al 2019 in these cases srp can impact permeability by a factor larger than 2 even when contributing only 2 of the total porosity soulaine et al 2016 in addition recent evidence suggests that srp also can have important impacts on multiphase flow as shown by observations of dramatic changes in relative permeability curves and overall flow behavior associated with differences in srp wetting properties in mixed wet or strongly wetting rocks zou et al 2018 rücker et al 2019 fan et al 2020 garfi et al 2020 1 2 multiscale models a potential path towards resolving the influence of srp on hydrologic processes is provided by sustained efforts to develop numerical techniques designed to account for this feature combined with steady advances in high performance parallel computing arbogast 1993a b moctezuma berthier et al 2004 javadpour 2009 bauer et al 2011 jiang et al 2013b in particular the development of multiscale dual porosity pore network models d pnm has allowed for relatively fast and accurate assessment of the permeability of rocks containing multiscale heterogeneity békri et al 1995 classical pnms rely on approximating the 3 dimensional resolved pore space through a series of ideally shaped pore nodes and throats fatt 1956 the result is a system where the relevant fluid dynamics can be readily solved through idealized equations for flow dong and blunt 2009 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 jiang et al 2012 blunt et al 2013 huang et al 2016 suo et al 2020 in d pnms the presence of srp is accounted for through the implementation of an additional fine scale pore network ioannidis and chatzis 2000 jiang et al 2013 prodanović et al 2014 sadeghnejad and gostick 2020 moslemipour and sadeghnejad 2020 or through the creation of micro links forming percolation paths between large pores bultreys et al 2015 xu et al 2021 accurate definition of srp connectivity within these networks remains a challenge zhao et al 2017 petrovskyy et al 2020 as by definition there are no discernible features from which to inform assignments of pore network topology within the srp the expansion of multiscale models into multiphase flow further complicates matters as the effects of capillarity and wettability need to be modeled through representative relative permeability and capillary pressure models in order to obtain accurate flow representations within the srp carrillo et al 2020 for this reason the few studies that implemented multiphase d pnms have relied on the assumption of quasi static fluid displacement an assumption valid for simulating flow at low capillary numbers mehmani et al 2013 bultreys et al 2015 xu et al 2021 and where both phases are effectively set at a given saturation these studies have leveraged d pnms to study how the amount and distribution of srp affects the relative permeability behavior of artificial rock samples mehmani and prodanović 2014 and how srp characterization and connectivity affect the wetting properties of natural rocks bultreys et al 2016 song et al 2021 isah et al 2020 unfortunately due to the simplifying assumptions of d pnms outlined above extension of these studies to dynamic systems with mixed wet srp or systems with viscously dominated flow remains impossible the micro continuum approach presents an alternative route to simulating dynamic flow processes in systems with srp this approach relies on locally averaged navier stokes equations that asymptotically approach darcy s law in regions with srp and the navier stokes equations in fully resolved pores this model has proven fairly flexible and has been used to evaluate the effects of static knackstedt et al 2006 apourvari and arns 2014 scheibe et al 2015 soulaine and tchelepi 2016 kang et al 2019 singh 2019 reactive soulaine et al 2017 noiriel and soulaine 2021 trinchero et al 2021 and deformable carrillo and bourg 2019 srp on the permeability of heterogeneous porous media furthermore through careful consideration of capillary and viscous effects within the srp i e fluid mobility relative permeabilities and capillary pressures recent investigations have successfully expanded and validated the micro continuum approach for situations involving the flow of multiple fluids in multiscale porous media soulaine et al 2018 carrillo et al 2020 carrillo and bourg 2021b a in this approach the impact of simplifying model assumptions is greatly reduced relative to the d pnm approach at the expense of relatively high computational costs as such this approach allows for the simulation of dynamic multiscale systems in domain sizes that approach that of an rev 1 3 objective of this paper in this study we leverage the capabilities of the multiphase micro continuum approach to systematically examine the influence of srp properties permeability porosity wettability on direct numerical simulation predictions of multiphase flow in a digital model of a carbonate rock in particular we characterize the rock s absolute permeability relative permeability curves residual permeabilities and fluid breakthrough times on the 30 mm 3 scale of an xct image we hypothesize that the srp properties outlined above have even greater impacts on multiphase flow than on single phase flow such that their neglect or misrepresentation leads to inaccurate predictions of rock hydraulic properties to the best of our knowledge this is the first application of direct numerical simulations to multiphase flow in rock samples containing unresolved porosity and the first computational effort to systematically examine the impacts of srp wetting properties on the aforementioned rock flow properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model the multiphase micro continuum framework for incompressible immiscible flow in rigid porous media consists of three volume averaged partial differential equations they describe the conservation and transport of fluid mass eq 1 fluid saturation eq 2 and fluid momentum eq 3 once implemented in a suitable numerical solver these equations are used to solve for the single field pressure p the single field fluid velocity u and the wetting fluid saturation α w a full description of the model can be found in carrillo et al 2020 here we have 1 u 0 2 ϕ α w t α w u ϕ α w α n u r 0 3 1 ϕ ρ u t ρ ϕ u u p s μ k 1 u f c where the subscripts w and n refer to the wetting and non wetting fluids ϕ is the cell porosity ρ is the single field density μ k 1 is the drag coefficient of the unresolved porous media a function of the cell permeability saturation and fluid viscosities f c are the capillary forces and s μ u u t is the averaged single field shear stress tensor lastly u r is the fluid relative velocity i e the cell averaged difference in velocity between the wetting and non wetting fluids here gravity is neglected and the phrase single field refers to averaged variables that depend on the local saturation density and viscosity of both fluids within a given cell maes and soulaine 2019 a key feature of eqs 1 3 is that they are valid in control volumes that contain any combination of the three relevant phases porous solid wetting fluid non wetting fluid meaning that they can be applied to systems that contain both solid free ϕ 1 and porous regions ϕ 1 due to the scale separation hypothesis whitaker 1986 this unique set of equations tends towards distinct solutions in solid free and porous regions notably the single field momentum equation tends to a solution that can be asymptotically matched to the two phase navier stokes equations in solid free regions and two phase darcy s law in porous regions carrillo et al 2020 4 ρ u t ρ u u p s f c if ϕ 1 u k μ p f c if ϕ 1 as such the multiphase micro continuum model is ideally suited for simulating multiphase flow in xct images that contain srp as illustrated schematically in fig 1 the asymptotic matching noted above requires appropriate definitions of the relative velocity u r drag force μ k 1 u and capillary forces f c these variables reflect the influence of sub grid scale structure and dynamics including the fluid distribution and the impact of porous micro structure on flow within the srp for this reason these parameters are defined differently in the solid free region ϕ 1 and porous regions ϕ 1 in particular the single field drag force is negligible in solid free regions and in porous regions depends on absolute k 0 and relative permeabilities k r i within the srp 5 μ k 1 0 if ϕ 1 k 0 1 k r w μ w k r n μ n 1 if ϕ 1 the capillary forces within the solid free region are proportional to the surface tension γ and the curvature of the fluid fluid interface as described by the continuum surface force formulation brackbill et al 1992 in the porous region capillary forces are a function of the fluid mobilities m i k 0 k i r μ i m m w m n and the average capillary pressure p c 6 f c γ n ˆ w n α w if ϕ 1 m 1 m w α n m n α

at the srp surface following the approach developed by horgue et al 2014 where t w a l l and n w a l l are the tangential and normal directions relative to the srp surface the specification of the contact angle at non porous rock surfaces θ r follows a similar implementation the relative fluid velocity is given by 8 u r c α max u α w α w if ϕ 1 ϕ 1 m w α w m n α n p m w α n α w m n α w α n p c m w α w m n α n p c α w if ϕ 1 where c α is an interface compression parameter used in the volume of fluid method typically set to values between 1 and 4 and the expression within the srp is imposed by asymptotic matching to two phase darcy s law carrillo et al 2020 closure of the system of equations presented above requires appropriate constitutive models to solve for p c and k r i within the srp for simplicity we use the well known van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 9 k r n 1 α w 1 2 1 α w 1 m 2 m 10 k r w α w 1 2 1 1 α w 1 m m 2 11 p c p c 0 α w 1 m 1 1 m where m is a wetting parameter that controls the internal wettability of the srp and p c 0 is the entry capillary pressure of the srp the srp is internally water wet if m 1 intermediate wet at m 1 and oil wet if m 1 note that the sign of the entry capillary pressure was changed for values of m 1 to prevent unphysical parameterizations where the srp is both water wet and oil wet at the same time finally we note that the formulation of an accurate interfacial condition between a solid free region and an unsaturated porous region see fig 1 is still an active area of research our formulation proposes a suitable approximation of said condition by 1 ensuring mass and stress continuity across the porous interface and 2 upscaling the relevant capillary forces and surface tension force discontinuity into an apparent contact angle θ p the effects of pore surface roughness aperture interfacial energies thin films and adsorption dynamics can be potentially included and upscaled into θ p by using the theory developed in wenzel 1936 whyman et al 2008 cassie and baxter 1944 zou et al 2015 and or alratrout et al 2018 however the integration of such models is outside the scope of this investigation further discussion on the multiphase interfacial condition at the porous interface can be found in carrillo et al 2020 soulaine et al 2018 carrillo and bourg 2021b 2 2 numerical implementation the mathematical model presented in section 2 1 was numerically implemented in openfoam a free parallel c simulation platform that uses the finite volume method to discretize and solve partial differential equations in three dimensional grids mass conservation and incompressibility eqs 1 and 3 were ensured through the pressure implicit splitting operator piso algorithm issa 1986 the evolution of the fluid fluid interface eq 2 was solved using the multidimensional universal limiter of explicit solution mules algorithm márquez and fich 2013 and a piecewise linear interface calculation plic compression scheme both which help sharpen the interface and keep the simulation numerically stable numerical stability was also ensured by limiting the global courant number to a maximum of 0 15 in all our simulations and by using a second order linear upwind scheme to discretize the remaining equations grid convergence analysis results are shown in the supplemental information extensive validation of the modeling framework is presented in carrillo et al 2020 and the open source implementation is available from the author s github repository carrillo 2020 2 3 studied rock sample simulations were performed on a reconstructed 3 d xct sample of an estaillades carbonate rock obtained from bultreys 2016 through the digital rock portal this sample was 7 mm in diameter and was scanned with a ugct s hector micro ct scanner this set of images has been used in several previous d pnm studies bultreys et al 2015 2016 the sample 1000 by 1000 by 1000 voxels 3 1 μ m per voxel is ideally suited for our purposes as it is a mono mineralic calcite rock containing both intergranular macropores and unresolved intragranular micropores i e srp voxels containing solid rock resolved pores and unresolved pores were identified through a 3 phase segmentation procedure following the steps outlined in bultreys et al 2015 this yielded a sample with 56 2 solid rock voxels 11 8 porous voxels and 32 microporous voxels fig 2 due to the computational cost associated with performing direct numerical simulations on such a large physical space we extracted a 200 by 200 by 200 voxel sub sample from the original sample in order to perform our simulations this representative sub sample was extracted from the cartesian center of the sample starting in projection number 750 and ending in projection 950 the computational cost was further reduced by removing all grid cells corresponding to solid rock voxels in the resulting computational mesh yielding a sample of about 3 2 million cells see fig 3 in order to maintain adequate mesh resolution while properly representing the mobile fluid fluid interface within the open pore space we implemented a dynamic mesh refinement algorithm that allowed the mesh to become up to 16 times finer at said interface no mesh refinement was carried out within the srp lastly as is customary for these types of simulations and to properly control the flow rate into the sample we added two buffer regions at the inlet top and outlet bottom boundaries of our samples the other 4 sample sides were defined with no flow boundary conditions 3 base simulation setup and upscaling 3 1 base simulation parameterization the main purpose of our simulations is to perform a sensitivity analysis of the impact of srp properties on single and multiphase flow at the scale of the full digital rock image hereafter referred to as the macroscopic scale for this we first introduce a base simulation that will be parameterized using experimental values and then used as a template for the systematic variation of srp properties this workflow is conceptually similar to the one performed in hashemi et al 2021 our base simulation involves the injection of oil into a fully water saturated rock sample at a constant rate of 0 1 μ l s 1 until the simulation reaches a steady state the choice of the labels oil and water is arbitrary our main goal is to examine the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids the advancing fluid is non wetting θ p and θ r 90 in our base simulation but the wettability of the solid by the two fluids is reversed in some of our simulations the rock and fluid properties are summarized in tables 1 2 the subsequent sensitivity analysis was performed by independently modifying the srp s porosity ϕ 0 to 1 absolute permeability k 0 1 0 12 to 1 0 17 m 2 internal wetting properties m 0 2 to 1 5 in eqs 9 and 11 and the contact angles formed by fluid fluid interfaces on the external surface of srp and impermeable rock domains θ p and θ r 30 to 150 the decoupling of the contact angle at the srp and impermeable rock surfaces allows the investigation of mixed wet systems song and kovscek 2015 huang et al 2016 akbarabadi et al 2017 and establishes the possibility of defining a roughness or saturation dependent contact angle in future studies wenzel 1936 whyman et al 2008 the decoupling of internal m and surface θ wetting properties allows us to differentiate between macroscopic and microscopic wetting effects where θ impacts multiphase flow in the solid free domain and m impacts multiphase flow within the srp lastly we carried out additional single phase flow simulations for each case where we varied the srp porosity and permeability this was necessary to calculate each case s absolute permeability and relative permeability curves see section 3 2 on average each multiphase simulation ran for approximately 120 h on ten 28 core broadwell xeon nodes 3 2 calculation of absolute permeability and relative permeability curves relative permeabilities were calculated through modification of the upscaling approach presented in raeini et al 2014 where macroscopic relative permeability k r i is defined as the ratio between the apparent permeability k i calculated from transient multi phase flow experiments and the upscaled absolute permeability k 0 calculated from steady state single phase flow experiments 12 k r i k i k 0 q i δ p i q i s δ p i s in eq 12 the subscript i identifies properties pertaining to either fluid and the subscript s refers to quantities obtained from single phase experiments furthermore q i u n α i d a is the volumetric fluid flow rate of phase i passing through an area a into the porous medium and δ p i is the pressure drop in phase i across said medium the latter is defined as follows 13 δ p i 1 q i v f p f c u d v f i 1 q i v f d d t ρ u s μ k 1 u u d v f i where v f is the fluid volume of the sample excluding the buffer zones a drag term μ k 1 u is included eq 13 to account for the momentum dissipation i e pressure drop induced by the presence of srp in the sample the calculation of δ p i s follows eq 13 sans the capillary force term relative permeability curves were constructed by matching each k r i value to the corresponding saturation in the porous medium at a specific point in time this so called unsteady approach where k r i values are not calculated at steady state amaefule and handy 1982 johnson et al 1959 enables calculating relative permeability curves without needing to carry out a distinct steady state multiphase simulation for each data point a current necessity across numerical frameworks for rock models with realistically complex pore structures given current computational capabilities however this comes at the expense of accuracy or more precisely at a risk that the resulting relative permeability curves may be sensitive to fluid flow rate diamantopoulos and durner 2012 to minimize the impact of this approximation we focus on characterizing the sensitivity of k r i to different srp properties as opposed to absolute values of k r i 4 impact of srp on absolute permeability in the following three sections we quantify the effects of srp properties on the rock s overall absolute permeability this section relative permeability curves section 5 and time dependent saturation profiles section 7 for the remainder of this study each simulation case is identified by the variable that is changed with respect to the base simulation established in section 3 1 and parameterized according to tables 1 and 2 we now start by evaluating the effect of srp on the rock s absolute permeability fig 4 shows that the sample s absolute permeability is overestimated by 57 if the srp is neglected and assumed to be open pore space ϕ 1 and underestimated by 34 if it is ignored and assumed to be impermeable ϕ 0 where the former s permeability more than doubles the latter the overall trend in fig 4 is fairly intuitive as the srp s porosity and or permeability increase so does the rock s absolute permeability this is in line with the findings of mehmani and prodanović 2014 and soulaine et al 2016 however whereas some previous studies have observed that srp can have a disproportionately large impact on permeability implying that it forms key percolation pathways for single phase flow soulaine et al 2016 the factor of 2 impact of srp on absolute permeability observed here is consistent with the predictions of the well known kozeny carman kc equation where k k c k b a s e 0 58 1 and 1 68 for ϕ 0 0 5 and 1 respectively this implies that the srp is relatively uniformly distributed in the studied rock sample in close agreement with bultreys et al 2016 as examined in the following sections greater impacts of srp are observed in systems with multiple fluid phases where srp wettability and relative permeability become key factors controlling fluid flow 5 impact of srp on relative permeability curves changes in sample relative permeability as a function of srp porosity wetting properties and absolute permeability are not particularly intuitive these often involve non linear behaviors brought about by the combination of capillary forces and the sample s geometry throughout the following discussion we will see that the srp has two primarily competing effects it can enhance flow by connecting otherwise isolated macroscopic flow paths but it also can reduce flow by being less permeable than the open pore space we will show that the balance between these two roles is strongly dictated by srp properties the four sets of relative permeability curves present in fig 5 exhibit two distinct behaviors reflecting different responses to changes in srp properties in one observed behavior the curves for both fluids shift up or down in the same direction with respect to the y axis this implies that the sample becomes more or less permeable to both phases simultaneously in the other observed behavior the water and oil relative permeability curves shift up or down in opposite directions indicating that an increased permeability to one fluid is associated with a decreased permeability to the other fluid 5 1 sensitivity to srp absolute permeability fig 5a demonstrates that an increase in srp absolute permeability enhances the relative permeability curves of both oil and water this enhancement occurs in addition to the enhancement in absolute permeability presented in fig 4 the enhancement of water relative permeability is entirely expected as the srp is water wet and mostly water saturated in this scenario such that greater srp permeability naturally facilitates the flow of water the enhancement of oil permeability is less intuitive since oil minimally accesses the srp in this scenario this enhancement is likely indirect i e greater srp permeability facilitates water drainage from the open pore space which in turn facilitates the flow of oil in other words displacement of water from large pores can now occur through the srp this process though relatively inefficient is facilitated by a higher srp permeability we note that both effects essentially disappear at srp permeabilities below 10 17 m 2 as shown in fig si1 in the supporting information in short srp permeability is only important if it is sufficiently large that flow can actually occur within the srp 5 2 sensitivity to srp s internal wettability fig 5b shows that an increase in srp internal wettability from oil wetting m 1 to water wetting m 1 also enhances the flow potential of both fluids this effect is likely analogous to that observed for srp absolute permeability a more hydrophilic srp should remain more fully water saturated and hence more permeable to water because of the impact of saturation on relative permeability within the srp represented using eqs 9 10 as in fig 5a this greater ability of water to flow through the srp indirectly facilitates oil flow likely by aiding water drainage from the open pore space the reasoning of this last point is analogous to the one above 5 3 sensitivity to srp and rock surface contact angles fig 5c shows that the relative permeability curves shift in opposite directions in response to changes in the external wettability of the rock or srp surfaces specifically as the pore walls become more hydrophobic permeability to water decreases while permeability to oil increases the impact on oil flow is relatively small likely because of the partial cancellation of two competing effects more hydrophobic surfaces should inhibit oil flow by causing this flow to occur preferentially in smaller pores or closer to the pore walls simultaneously more hydrophobic surfaces should enhance oil flow by minimizing the tendency towards trapping of oil droplets through capillary effects therefore we posit that a decrease in capillary number ca and or a decrease in sample homogeneity would likely enhance the trapping effect and may reverse the order of the oil relative permeability curves the impact on water flow is larger a counter intuitive observation if water flows predominantly within the srp the impact of surface contact angles on water flow should be minimal alternatively if water flows predominantly in the open pore space surface contact angles should have relatively minor impact on relative permeability to water because of the competing effects noted above in the case of oil in fact an increase in water relative permeability with θ opposite to that observed here was reported by fan et al 2020 bakhshian and hosseini 2019 zhao et al 2018 a possible explanation of our results is that residual water flow in our simulated system relies on the combination of srp and residual macropore water flow whereas the studies noted above consider systems with no srp in such systems water retained in the open pore space through capillary forces such as in capillary film coatings on rough pore walls tokunaga and wan 1997 khishvand et al 2016 may represent a key residual flow path that would be eliminated in systems with hydrophobic pore walls 5 4 sensitivity to srp porosity the effects of modulating srp internal porosity between 0 to 1 are shown in fig 5d the overall magnitude of the relative permeability changes is in close agreement with mehmani and prodanović 2014 where the authors found that the addition of pore clogging srp can modify the relative permeability of the wetting and non wetting phases by about a factor of 2 we note again that this effect occurs in addition to the significant impact of srp porosity on absolute permeability presented in fig 4 in addition to this significant influence of srp porosity on relative permeability our results also show unexpected complexity in particular the impact of srp porosity on water flow is non monotonous with minimum water relative permeabilities observed at either ϕ 0 or 1 and larger water relative permeabilities observed at intermediate ϕ values this observation is consistent with the expected trend if residual water flow relies on a combination of both srp and residual macropore water as suggested above values ϕ 0 or 1 would inhibit water flow by eliminating the srp water component of these residual flow paths 6 impact of srp on residual relative permeability as noted above our results strongly suggest that the srp can function as an efficient and persistent connector between otherwise disconnected water bodies particularly at low water saturations we call this increase in permeability the srp enhanced relative permeability a key manifestation of this is the persistence of significant relative permeability in the water phase at water saturations below 0 5 in agreement with experimental observations for rocks with significant microporosity bennion and bachu 2010 in contrast pore network model simulations of multiphase flow generally predict that relative permeability to water is nearly zero at water saturations below 0 2 to 0 5 prodanović et al 2014 huang et al 2016 a convenient way to characterize this effect is by ranking the relative permeabilities of water once each system has achieved a steady state as seen in fig 6 the overarching trend is clear increasing the srp s permeability to water increasing absolute permeability or srp wettability with higher values of m also increases the steady state relative permeability of said fluid up to 20 times the reason for this is not obvious as higher srp permeability should lead to higher displacement of the defending fluid lower residual saturations and thus lower not higher steady state permeabilities this leads us to believe that increasing the flow capability of the srp also leads to the creation of enhanced percolation pathways that are persistent and remain connected throughout the sample even at low water saturations this enhanced permeability effect is heavily influenced by the srp pore size wettability and the resulting entry capillary pressure where water favorable entry pressures m 1 p c 0 0 increase this effect and non favorable capillary pressures m 1 p c 0 0 diminish it this phenomenon is consistent with experiments in mixed wet porous media alratrout et al 2018 and somewhat analogous to thin film flow in soils where small amounts of water facilitate transport above the soil s water table tokunaga and wan 1997 lebeau and konrad 2010 through capillary effects however our current simulation setup does not allow us to comment on what would happen to this effect as a result of dynamic changes in sample wettability over time this persistence of significant residual relative permeability to water has potentially important implications in the physics of soil drying or et al 2013 and in hydrocarbon recovery from tight sandstone formations tian et al 2019 7 impact of srp on dynamic saturation evolution the presence of srp has the following competing effects on the evolution of oil saturation within the sample during oil flooding 1 it increases the residual saturation of its wetting phase be it oil or water by acting as a fluid reservoir that defends itself against the non wetting phase 2 it decreases the residual saturation of the defending fluid phase by adding additional inter pore connectivity and outflow routes mehmani and prodanović 2014 the balance between these two effects is dictated by the flow properties of the srp fig 7 shows that fluid injection into the sample follows two characteristic behaviors 1 an initial linear increase in saturation where the slope is primarily dictated by the injection rate 2 a non linear plateauing slope dictated by the slow drainage of the defending fluid through the srp and flow of the injected fluid into the srp which are influenced by the srp s flow properties the transition point between these two primary flow mechanisms is dictated by the breakthrough time the point at which the injected fluid first reaches the sample s outlet boundary the next two sections will leverage the information within the oil flooding saturation curves in fig 7 to study the effects of the srp on the dynamic and static properties of these experiments 7 1 impact on breakthrough time we now present a general ranking of the breakthrough times for oil flooding as a function of srp properties obtained from the results in fig 7 and figure si2 the samples are well distributed around the standard base case and obey the following trends the slowest breakthrough times correspond to cases with oil wetting surface contact angles where the oil explores more of the porous medium before reaching the outlet in agreement with experimental observations of multiphase flow in bead packs and micromodels with no srp zhao et al 2016 hu et al 2017 these are followed by the sample case with no srp where the reasoning is the same as above sample cases with a less water wet srp decreasing m or with lower srp permeability or porosity further decrease the breakthrough times by limiting the ability of water to drain through the srp such that the oil explores less of the sample before reaching the outlet the effects of dynamic contact angle hysteresis is not evaluated here and will be investigated in future work overall our results show that oil breakthrough times are sensitive to srp parameters 30 even though drainage occurs predominantly in the larger pores a result that has potentially important implications in enhanced oil recovery and geologic co 2 sequestration 7 2 impact on residual saturations finally we observe in fig 8 and fig si3 that residual water saturations are highly correlated with oil breakthrough times samples with faster breakthrough times generally have higher residual water saturations at steady state the reasoning behind this behavior is very similar to the one developed to explain the difference in oil breakthrough times if more residual defending fluid is present the invading fluid explores less of the available space and hence travels through the sample more rapidly overall this analysis indicates that srp has a considerable impact on a sample s residual saturations 400 strongly implying that it should not be neglected during the design of subsurface fluid extraction and sequestration processes 8 conclusions in this paper we studied the effects of xct sub resolution porosity srp on a rock s absolute permeability relative permeability residual saturations and fluid breakthrough times our results quantify how these four properties react to changes in the porosity permeability and wettability of the srp one notable finding is that srp can function as a persistent connector between otherwise isolated fluid clusters during multiphase flow even at low saturations these results were obtained from numerical simulations performed with our newly developed multiphase micro continuum framework to the best of our knowledge this is the first two phase flow model and study to take into account srp without having to rely on a quasi static assumption or simplified pore network models as such this investigation establishes a framework for performing two phase flow simulations in digital rock systems that have two characteristic length scales potential improvements to our methodology include the simulation of larger and more diverse rock samples a very attainable task due to the current continuous and rapid growth of high performance computing resources finally our results suggest potentially fruitful opportunities for future work aimed at quantifying the effects of srp on upscaled capillary pressure curves and broadening the investigated parameter space to different types of rocks involving different geometries different amounts of srp and different srp induced connectivity these avenues will more extensively test the conclusions presented in this study

190,sub resolution porosity srp is a ubiquitous yet often ignored feature in digital rock physics it embodies the trade off between image resolution and field of view and it is a direct result of choosing an imaging resolution that is larger than the smallest pores in a heterogeneous rock sample in this study we investigate the impacts of srp on multiphase flow in porous rocks to do so we use our newly developed multiphase micro continuum model to perform first of a kind direct numerical simulations of two phase flow in porous samples containing srp we show that srp properties porosity permeability wettability can impact predicted absolute permeabilities fluid breakthrough times residual saturations and relative permeabilities by factors of 2 1 5 3 and 20 respectively in particular our results reveal that srp can function as a persistent connector preventing the formation of isolated wetting fluid domains during drainage thus dramatically increasing relative permeabilities to both fluids at low saturations overall our study confirms previous evidence that flow within the srp cannot be disregarded without incurring significant errors in numerical predictions or experimental analyses of multiphase flow in heterogeneous porous media keywords porous media sub resolution porosity multiphase flow relative permeability multi scale micro continuum 1 introduction the emergence of digital rock physics drp has revolutionized the way we study porous media it is now possible to directly characterize the pore structure of subsurface systems and perform three dimensional direct numerical simulations of fluid flow in digital models of rock samples that approach the size of a representative elementary volume rev as such drp has transformed our capacity to characterize and predict fluid flow in soils sedimentary rocks hydrocarbon reservoirs and engineered porous systems mehmani et al 2020 han et al 2020 the computation of rock transport parameters including absolute permeability spanne et al 1994 dispersion coefficients bijeljic et al 2013 soulaine et al 2021a relative permeabilities and capillary pressures raeini et al 2014 prodanović et al 2014 has had direct impacts in the fields of reservoir engineering hydrology and co 2 sequestration blunt et al 2013 soulaine et al 2021b 1 1 rock imaging techniques and sub resolution porosity drp is made possible by advances in high resolution imaging techniques notably x ray microtomography xct baker et al 2012 singh et al 2018 kohanpur and valocchi 2020 and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy fib sem cnudde and boone 2013 kelly et al 2016 welch et al 2017 ruspini et al 2021 the first method xct involves recording hundreds or thousands of two dimensional 2 d x ray projections through a sample that are then computationally reconstructed to create a 3 d image this method enables detailed volumetric representations of rock core samples spanning several cubic millimeters with a resolution of about 1 x 1 x 1 micrometers wildenschild and sheppard 2013 blunt et al 2013 the second method fib sem involves repeated etching and imaging of a sample through alternating application of focused ion beams and scanning electron microscopy at considerably smaller scales it yields images spanning 5 cubic micrometers with an associated resolution of 5 x 5 x 5 nanometers dewers et al 2012 however the associated repeated etching procedure means that fib sem is a destructive imaging technique these two techniques highlight an important limitation of current imaging techniques the existence of an unavoidable trade off between image resolution and field of view the inherent complexity of most natural rocks further complicates the imaging and characterization process more often than not rocks such as sandstones carbonates and shales exhibit heterogeneities that span several length scales bear 1988 mousavi et al 2013 akbarabadi et al 2017 beckingham et al 2017 some of which cannot be properly resolved by the aforementioned imaging techniques a common way to simplify the imaging process while accounting for these heterogeneities is to designate a cutoff voxel size that resolves the largest pores within a given rock sample or other features of interest such as cracks or fractures while simultaneously acting as a filter for any pores smaller than that particular size these small pores which are not individually resolved are then designated sub resolution porosity srp and labeled as a third phase in the rock pore srp system during the eventual segmentation of sample images the final result is a reconstructed image with an acceptable trade off between resolution and field of view scheibe et al 2015 until recently and despite its abundance in reconstructed natural rock samples srp was generally assumed to have little influence on rock hydraulic properties predicted from flow simulations most computational models were based on the simplifying assumption that transport within the srp is dominated by diffusion and thus contributes negligibly to fluid flow haggerty and gorelick 1995 carrera et al 1998 gouze et al 2008 shabro et al 2011 gjetvaj et al 2015 however recent studies have shown that this assumption breaks down whenever srp contributes significantly to the rock s percolating path by forming bridges between resolved pore spaces churcher et al 1991 tanino and blunt 2012 wu et al 2019 in these cases srp can impact permeability by a factor larger than 2 even when contributing only 2 of the total porosity soulaine et al 2016 in addition recent evidence suggests that srp also can have important impacts on multiphase flow as shown by observations of dramatic changes in relative permeability curves and overall flow behavior associated with differences in srp wetting properties in mixed wet or strongly wetting rocks zou et al 2018 rücker et al 2019 fan et al 2020 garfi et al 2020 1 2 multiscale models a potential path towards resolving the influence of srp on hydrologic processes is provided by sustained efforts to develop numerical techniques designed to account for this feature combined with steady advances in high performance parallel computing arbogast 1993a b moctezuma berthier et al 2004 javadpour 2009 bauer et al 2011 jiang et al 2013b in particular the development of multiscale dual porosity pore network models d pnm has allowed for relatively fast and accurate assessment of the permeability of rocks containing multiscale heterogeneity békri et al 1995 classical pnms rely on approximating the 3 dimensional resolved pore space through a series of ideally shaped pore nodes and throats fatt 1956 the result is a system where the relevant fluid dynamics can be readily solved through idealized equations for flow dong and blunt 2009 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 jiang et al 2012 blunt et al 2013 huang et al 2016 suo et al 2020 in d pnms the presence of srp is accounted for through the implementation of an additional fine scale pore network ioannidis and chatzis 2000 jiang et al 2013 prodanović et al 2014 sadeghnejad and gostick 2020 moslemipour and sadeghnejad 2020 or through the creation of micro links forming percolation paths between large pores bultreys et al 2015 xu et al 2021 accurate definition of srp connectivity within these networks remains a challenge zhao et al 2017 petrovskyy et al 2020 as by definition there are no discernible features from which to inform assignments of pore network topology within the srp the expansion of multiscale models into multiphase flow further complicates matters as the effects of capillarity and wettability need to be modeled through representative relative permeability and capillary pressure models in order to obtain accurate flow representations within the srp carrillo et al 2020 for this reason the few studies that implemented multiphase d pnms have relied on the assumption of quasi static fluid displacement an assumption valid for simulating flow at low capillary numbers mehmani et al 2013 bultreys et al 2015 xu et al 2021 and where both phases are effectively set at a given saturation these studies have leveraged d pnms to study how the amount and distribution of srp affects the relative permeability behavior of artificial rock samples mehmani and prodanović 2014 and how srp characterization and connectivity affect the wetting properties of natural rocks bultreys et al 2016 song et al 2021 isah et al 2020 unfortunately due to the simplifying assumptions of d pnms outlined above extension of these studies to dynamic systems with mixed wet srp or systems with viscously dominated flow remains impossible the micro continuum approach presents an alternative route to simulating dynamic flow processes in systems with srp this approach relies on locally averaged navier stokes equations that asymptotically approach darcy s law in regions with srp and the navier stokes equations in fully resolved pores this model has proven fairly flexible and has been used to evaluate the effects of static knackstedt et al 2006 apourvari and arns 2014 scheibe et al 2015 soulaine and tchelepi 2016 kang et al 2019 singh 2019 reactive soulaine et al 2017 noiriel and soulaine 2021 trinchero et al 2021 and deformable carrillo and bourg 2019 srp on the permeability of heterogeneous porous media furthermore through careful consideration of capillary and viscous effects within the srp i e fluid mobility relative permeabilities and capillary pressures recent investigations have successfully expanded and validated the micro continuum approach for situations involving the flow of multiple fluids in multiscale porous media soulaine et al 2018 carrillo et al 2020 carrillo and bourg 2021b a in this approach the impact of simplifying model assumptions is greatly reduced relative to the d pnm approach at the expense of relatively high computational costs as such this approach allows for the simulation of dynamic multiscale systems in domain sizes that approach that of an rev 1 3 objective of this paper in this study we leverage the capabilities of the multiphase micro continuum approach to systematically examine the influence of srp properties permeability porosity wettability on direct numerical simulation predictions of multiphase flow in a digital model of a carbonate rock in particular we characterize the rock s absolute permeability relative permeability curves residual permeabilities and fluid breakthrough times on the 30 mm 3 scale of an xct image we hypothesize that the srp properties outlined above have even greater impacts on multiphase flow than on single phase flow such that their neglect or misrepresentation leads to inaccurate predictions of rock hydraulic properties to the best of our knowledge this is the first application of direct numerical simulations to multiphase flow in rock samples containing unresolved porosity and the first computational effort to systematically examine the impacts of srp wetting properties on the aforementioned rock flow properties 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical model the multiphase micro continuum framework for incompressible immiscible flow in rigid porous media consists of three volume averaged partial differential equations they describe the conservation and transport of fluid mass eq 1 fluid saturation eq 2 and fluid momentum eq 3 once implemented in a suitable numerical solver these equations are used to solve for the single field pressure p the single field fluid velocity u and the wetting fluid saturation α w a full description of the model can be found in carrillo et al 2020 here we have 1 u 0 2 ϕ α w t α w u ϕ α w α n u r 0 3 1 ϕ ρ u t ρ ϕ u u p s μ k 1 u f c where the subscripts w and n refer to the wetting and non wetting fluids ϕ is the cell porosity ρ is the single field density μ k 1 is the drag coefficient of the unresolved porous media a function of the cell permeability saturation and fluid viscosities f c are the capillary forces and s μ u u t is the averaged single field shear stress tensor lastly u r is the fluid relative velocity i e the cell averaged difference in velocity between the wetting and non wetting fluids here gravity is neglected and the phrase single field refers to averaged variables that depend on the local saturation density and viscosity of both fluids within a given cell maes and soulaine 2019 a key feature of eqs 1 3 is that they are valid in control volumes that contain any combination of the three relevant phases porous solid wetting fluid non wetting fluid meaning that they can be applied to systems that contain both solid free ϕ 1 and porous regions ϕ 1 due to the scale separation hypothesis whitaker 1986 this unique set of equations tends towards distinct solutions in solid free and porous regions notably the single field momentum equation tends to a solution that can be asymptotically matched to the two phase navier stokes equations in solid free regions and two phase darcy s law in porous regions carrillo et al 2020 4 ρ u t ρ u u p s f c if ϕ 1 u k μ p f c if ϕ 1 as such the multiphase micro continuum model is ideally suited for simulating multiphase flow in xct images that contain srp as illustrated schematically in fig 1 the asymptotic matching noted above requires appropriate definitions of the relative velocity u r drag force μ k 1 u and capillary forces f c these variables reflect the influence of sub grid scale structure and dynamics including the fluid distribution and the impact of porous micro structure on flow within the srp for this reason these parameters are defined differently in the solid free region ϕ 1 and porous regions ϕ 1 in particular the single field drag force is negligible in solid free regions and in porous regions depends on absolute k 0 and relative permeabilities k r i within the srp 5 μ k 1 0 if ϕ 1 k 0 1 k r w μ w k r n μ n 1 if ϕ 1 the capillary forces within the solid free region are proportional to the surface tension γ and the curvature of the fluid fluid interface as described by the continuum surface force formulation brackbill et al 1992 in the porous region capillary forces are a function of the fluid mobilities m i k 0 k i r μ i m m w m n and the average capillary pressure p c 6 f c γ n ˆ w n α w if ϕ 1 m 1 m w α n m n α

at the srp surface following the approach developed by horgue et al 2014 where t w a l l and n w a l l are the tangential and normal directions relative to the srp surface the specification of the contact angle at non porous rock surfaces θ r follows a similar implementation the relative fluid velocity is given by 8 u r c α max u α w α w if ϕ 1 ϕ 1 m w α w m n α n p m w α n α w m n α w α n p c m w α w m n α n p c α w if ϕ 1 where c α is an interface compression parameter used in the volume of fluid method typically set to values between 1 and 4 and the expression within the srp is imposed by asymptotic matching to two phase darcy s law carrillo et al 2020 closure of the system of equations presented above requires appropriate constitutive models to solve for p c and k r i within the srp for simplicity we use the well known van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 9 k r n 1 α w 1 2 1 α w 1 m 2 m 10 k r w α w 1 2 1 1 α w 1 m m 2 11 p c p c 0 α w 1 m 1 1 m where m is a wetting parameter that controls the internal wettability of the srp and p c 0 is the entry capillary pressure of the srp the srp is internally water wet if m 1 intermediate wet at m 1 and oil wet if m 1 note that the sign of the entry capillary pressure was changed for values of m 1 to prevent unphysical parameterizations where the srp is both water wet and oil wet at the same time finally we note that the formulation of an accurate interfacial condition between a solid free region and an unsaturated porous region see fig 1 is still an active area of research our formulation proposes a suitable approximation of said condition by 1 ensuring mass and stress continuity across the porous interface and 2 upscaling the relevant capillary forces and surface tension force discontinuity into an apparent contact angle θ p the effects of pore surface roughness aperture interfacial energies thin films and adsorption dynamics can be potentially included and upscaled into θ p by using the theory developed in wenzel 1936 whyman et al 2008 cassie and baxter 1944 zou et al 2015 and or alratrout et al 2018 however the integration of such models is outside the scope of this investigation further discussion on the multiphase interfacial condition at the porous interface can be found in carrillo et al 2020 soulaine et al 2018 carrillo and bourg 2021b 2 2 numerical implementation the mathematical model presented in section 2 1 was numerically implemented in openfoam a free parallel c simulation platform that uses the finite volume method to discretize and solve partial differential equations in three dimensional grids mass conservation and incompressibility eqs 1 and 3 were ensured through the pressure implicit splitting operator piso algorithm issa 1986 the evolution of the fluid fluid interface eq 2 was solved using the multidimensional universal limiter of explicit solution mules algorithm márquez and fich 2013 and a piecewise linear interface calculation plic compression scheme both which help sharpen the interface and keep the simulation numerically stable numerical stability was also ensured by limiting the global courant number to a maximum of 0 15 in all our simulations and by using a second order linear upwind scheme to discretize the remaining equations grid convergence analysis results are shown in the supplemental information extensive validation of the modeling framework is presented in carrillo et al 2020 and the open source implementation is available from the author s github repository carrillo 2020 2 3 studied rock sample simulations were performed on a reconstructed 3 d xct sample of an estaillades carbonate rock obtained from bultreys 2016 through the digital rock portal this sample was 7 mm in diameter and was scanned with a ugct s hector micro ct scanner this set of images has been used in several previous d pnm studies bultreys et al 2015 2016 the sample 1000 by 1000 by 1000 voxels 3 1 μ m per voxel is ideally suited for our purposes as it is a mono mineralic calcite rock containing both intergranular macropores and unresolved intragranular micropores i e srp voxels containing solid rock resolved pores and unresolved pores were identified through a 3 phase segmentation procedure following the steps outlined in bultreys et al 2015 this yielded a sample with 56 2 solid rock voxels 11 8 porous voxels and 32 microporous voxels fig 2 due to the computational cost associated with performing direct numerical simulations on such a large physical space we extracted a 200 by 200 by 200 voxel sub sample from the original sample in order to perform our simulations this representative sub sample was extracted from the cartesian center of the sample starting in projection number 750 and ending in projection 950 the computational cost was further reduced by removing all grid cells corresponding to solid rock voxels in the resulting computational mesh yielding a sample of about 3 2 million cells see fig 3 in order to maintain adequate mesh resolution while properly representing the mobile fluid fluid interface within the open pore space we implemented a dynamic mesh refinement algorithm that allowed the mesh to become up to 16 times finer at said interface no mesh refinement was carried out within the srp lastly as is customary for these types of simulations and to properly control the flow rate into the sample we added two buffer regions at the inlet top and outlet bottom boundaries of our samples the other 4 sample sides were defined with no flow boundary conditions 3 base simulation setup and upscaling 3 1 base simulation parameterization the main purpose of our simulations is to perform a sensitivity analysis of the impact of srp properties on single and multiphase flow at the scale of the full digital rock image hereafter referred to as the macroscopic scale for this we first introduce a base simulation that will be parameterized using experimental values and then used as a template for the systematic variation of srp properties this workflow is conceptually similar to the one performed in hashemi et al 2021 our base simulation involves the injection of oil into a fully water saturated rock sample at a constant rate of 0 1 μ l s 1 until the simulation reaches a steady state the choice of the labels oil and water is arbitrary our main goal is to examine the flow of two immiscible and incompressible fluids the advancing fluid is non wetting θ p and θ r 90 in our base simulation but the wettability of the solid by the two fluids is reversed in some of our simulations the rock and fluid properties are summarized in tables 1 2 the subsequent sensitivity analysis was performed by independently modifying the srp s porosity ϕ 0 to 1 absolute permeability k 0 1 0 12 to 1 0 17 m 2 internal wetting properties m 0 2 to 1 5 in eqs 9 and 11 and the contact angles formed by fluid fluid interfaces on the external surface of srp and impermeable rock domains θ p and θ r 30 to 150 the decoupling of the contact angle at the srp and impermeable rock surfaces allows the investigation of mixed wet systems song and kovscek 2015 huang et al 2016 akbarabadi et al 2017 and establishes the possibility of defining a roughness or saturation dependent contact angle in future studies wenzel 1936 whyman et al 2008 the decoupling of internal m and surface θ wetting properties allows us to differentiate between macroscopic and microscopic wetting effects where θ impacts multiphase flow in the solid free domain and m impacts multiphase flow within the srp lastly we carried out additional single phase flow simulations for each case where we varied the srp porosity and permeability this was necessary to calculate each case s absolute permeability and relative permeability curves see section 3 2 on average each multiphase simulation ran for approximately 120 h on ten 28 core broadwell xeon nodes 3 2 calculation of absolute permeability and relative permeability curves relative permeabilities were calculated through modification of the upscaling approach presented in raeini et al 2014 where macroscopic relative permeability k r i is defined as the ratio between the apparent permeability k i calculated from transient multi phase flow experiments and the upscaled absolute permeability k 0 calculated from steady state single phase flow experiments 12 k r i k i k 0 q i δ p i q i s δ p i s in eq 12 the subscript i identifies properties pertaining to either fluid and the subscript s refers to quantities obtained from single phase experiments furthermore q i u n α i d a is the volumetric fluid flow rate of phase i passing through an area a into the porous medium and δ p i is the pressure drop in phase i across said medium the latter is defined as follows 13 δ p i 1 q i v f p f c u d v f i 1 q i v f d d t ρ u s μ k 1 u u d v f i where v f is the fluid volume of the sample excluding the buffer zones a drag term μ k 1 u is included eq 13 to account for the momentum dissipation i e pressure drop induced by the presence of srp in the sample the calculation of δ p i s follows eq 13 sans the capillary force term relative permeability curves were constructed by matching each k r i value to the corresponding saturation in the porous medium at a specific point in time this so called unsteady approach where k r i values are not calculated at steady state amaefule and handy 1982 johnson et al 1959 enables calculating relative permeability curves without needing to carry out a distinct steady state multiphase simulation for each data point a current necessity across numerical frameworks for rock models with realistically complex pore structures given current computational capabilities however this comes at the expense of accuracy or more precisely at a risk that the resulting relative permeability curves may be sensitive to fluid flow rate diamantopoulos and durner 2012 to minimize the impact of this approximation we focus on characterizing the sensitivity of k r i to different srp properties as opposed to absolute values of k r i 4 impact of srp on absolute permeability in the following three sections we quantify the effects of srp properties on the rock s overall absolute permeability this section relative permeability curves section 5 and time dependent saturation profiles section 7 for the remainder of this study each simulation case is identified by the variable that is changed with respect to the base simulation established in section 3 1 and parameterized according to tables 1 and 2 we now start by evaluating the effect of srp on the rock s absolute permeability fig 4 shows that the sample s absolute permeability is overestimated by 57 if the srp is neglected and assumed to be open pore space ϕ 1 and underestimated by 34 if it is ignored and assumed to be impermeable ϕ 0 where the former s permeability more than doubles the latter the overall trend in fig 4 is fairly intuitive as the srp s porosity and or permeability increase so does the rock s absolute permeability this is in line with the findings of mehmani and prodanović 2014 and soulaine et al 2016 however whereas some previous studies have observed that srp can have a disproportionately large impact on permeability implying that it forms key percolation pathways for single phase flow soulaine et al 2016 the factor of 2 impact of srp on absolute permeability observed here is consistent with the predictions of the well known kozeny carman kc equation where k k c k b a s e 0 58 1 and 1 68 for ϕ 0 0 5 and 1 respectively this implies that the srp is relatively uniformly distributed in the studied rock sample in close agreement with bultreys et al 2016 as examined in the following sections greater impacts of srp are observed in systems with multiple fluid phases where srp wettability and relative permeability become key factors controlling fluid flow 5 impact of srp on relative permeability curves changes in sample relative permeability as a function of srp porosity wetting properties and absolute permeability are not particularly intuitive these often involve non linear behaviors brought about by the combination of capillary forces and the sample s geometry throughout the following discussion we will see that the srp has two primarily competing effects it can enhance flow by connecting otherwise isolated macroscopic flow paths but it also can reduce flow by being less permeable than the open pore space we will show that the balance between these two roles is strongly dictated by srp properties the four sets of relative permeability curves present in fig 5 exhibit two distinct behaviors reflecting different responses to changes in srp properties in one observed behavior the curves for both fluids shift up or down in the same direction with respect to the y axis this implies that the sample becomes more or less permeable to both phases simultaneously in the other observed behavior the water and oil relative permeability curves shift up or down in opposite directions indicating that an increased permeability to one fluid is associated with a decreased permeability to the other fluid 5 1 sensitivity to srp absolute permeability fig 5a demonstrates that an increase in srp absolute permeability enhances the relative permeability curves of both oil and water this enhancement occurs in addition to the enhancement in absolute permeability presented in fig 4 the enhancement of water relative permeability is entirely expected as the srp is water wet and mostly water saturated in this scenario such that greater srp permeability naturally facilitates the flow of water the enhancement of oil permeability is less intuitive since oil minimally accesses the srp in this scenario this enhancement is likely indirect i e greater srp permeability facilitates water drainage from the open pore space which in turn facilitates the flow of oil in other words displacement of water from large pores can now occur through the srp this process though relatively inefficient is facilitated by a higher srp permeability we note that both effects essentially disappear at srp permeabilities below 10 17 m 2 as shown in fig si1 in the supporting information in short srp permeability is only important if it is sufficiently large that flow can actually occur within the srp 5 2 sensitivity to srp s internal wettability fig 5b shows that an increase in srp internal wettability from oil wetting m 1 to water wetting m 1 also enhances the flow potential of both fluids this effect is likely analogous to that observed for srp absolute permeability a more hydrophilic srp should remain more fully water saturated and hence more permeable to water because of the impact of saturation on relative permeability within the srp represented using eqs 9 10 as in fig 5a this greater ability of water to flow through the srp indirectly facilitates oil flow likely by aiding water drainage from the open pore space the reasoning of this last point is analogous to the one above 5 3 sensitivity to srp and rock surface contact angles fig 5c shows that the relative permeability curves shift in opposite directions in response to changes in the external wettability of the rock or srp surfaces specifically as the pore walls become more hydrophobic permeability to water decreases while permeability to oil increases the impact on oil flow is relatively small likely because of the partial cancellation of two competing effects more hydrophobic surfaces should inhibit oil flow by causing this flow to occur preferentially in smaller pores or closer to the pore walls simultaneously more hydrophobic surfaces should enhance oil flow by minimizing the tendency towards trapping of oil droplets through capillary effects therefore we posit that a decrease in capillary number ca and or a decrease in sample homogeneity would likely enhance the trapping effect and may reverse the order of the oil relative permeability curves the impact on water flow is larger a counter intuitive observation if water flows predominantly within the srp the impact of surface contact angles on water flow should be minimal alternatively if water flows predominantly in the open pore space surface contact angles should have relatively minor impact on relative permeability to water because of the competing effects noted above in the case of oil in fact an increase in water relative permeability with θ opposite to that observed here was reported by fan et al 2020 bakhshian and hosseini 2019 zhao et al 2018 a possible explanation of our results is that residual water flow in our simulated system relies on the combination of srp and residual macropore water flow whereas the studies noted above consider systems with no srp in such systems water retained in the open pore space through capillary forces such as in capillary film coatings on rough pore walls tokunaga and wan 1997 khishvand et al 2016 may represent a key residual flow path that would be eliminated in systems with hydrophobic pore walls 5 4 sensitivity to srp porosity the effects of modulating srp internal porosity between 0 to 1 are shown in fig 5d the overall magnitude of the relative permeability changes is in close agreement with mehmani and prodanović 2014 where the authors found that the addition of pore clogging srp can modify the relative permeability of the wetting and non wetting phases by about a factor of 2 we note again that this effect occurs in addition to the significant impact of srp porosity on absolute permeability presented in fig 4 in addition to this significant influence of srp porosity on relative permeability our results also show unexpected complexity in particular the impact of srp porosity on water flow is non monotonous with minimum water relative permeabilities observed at either ϕ 0 or 1 and larger water relative permeabilities observed at intermediate ϕ values this observation is consistent with the expected trend if residual water flow relies on a combination of both srp and residual macropore water as suggested above values ϕ 0 or 1 would inhibit water flow by eliminating the srp water component of these residual flow paths 6 impact of srp on residual relative permeability as noted above our results strongly suggest that the srp can function as an efficient and persistent connector between otherwise disconnected water bodies particularly at low water saturations we call this increase in permeability the srp enhanced relative permeability a key manifestation of this is the persistence of significant relative permeability in the water phase at water saturations below 0 5 in agreement with experimental observations for rocks with significant microporosity bennion and bachu 2010 in contrast pore network model simulations of multiphase flow generally predict that relative permeability to water is nearly zero at water saturations below 0 2 to 0 5 prodanović et al 2014 huang et al 2016 a convenient way to characterize this effect is by ranking the relative permeabilities of water once each system has achieved a steady state as seen in fig 6 the overarching trend is clear increasing the srp s permeability to water increasing absolute permeability or srp wettability with higher values of m also increases the steady state relative permeability of said fluid up to 20 times the reason for this is not obvious as higher srp permeability should lead to higher displacement of the defending fluid lower residual saturations and thus lower not higher steady state permeabilities this leads us to believe that increasing the flow capability of the srp also leads to the creation of enhanced percolation pathways that are persistent and remain connected throughout the sample even at low water saturations this enhanced permeability effect is heavily influenced by the srp pore size wettability and the resulting entry capillary pressure where water favorable entry pressures m 1 p c 0 0 increase this effect and non favorable capillary pressures m 1 p c 0 0 diminish it this phenomenon is consistent with experiments in mixed wet porous media alratrout et al 2018 and somewhat analogous to thin film flow in soils where small amounts of water facilitate transport above the soil s water table tokunaga and wan 1997 lebeau and konrad 2010 through capillary effects however our current simulation setup does not allow us to comment on what would happen to this effect as a result of dynamic changes in sample wettability over time this persistence of significant residual relative permeability to water has potentially important implications in the physics of soil drying or et al 2013 and in hydrocarbon recovery from tight sandstone formations tian et al 2019 7 impact of srp on dynamic saturation evolution the presence of srp has the following competing effects on the evolution of oil saturation within the sample during oil flooding 1 it increases the residual saturation of its wetting phase be it oil or water by acting as a fluid reservoir that defends itself against the non wetting phase 2 it decreases the residual saturation of the defending fluid phase by adding additional inter pore connectivity and outflow routes mehmani and prodanović 2014 the balance between these two effects is dictated by the flow properties of the srp fig 7 shows that fluid injection into the sample follows two characteristic behaviors 1 an initial linear increase in saturation where the slope is primarily dictated by the injection rate 2 a non linear plateauing slope dictated by the slow drainage of the defending fluid through the srp and flow of the injected fluid into the srp which are influenced by the srp s flow properties the transition point between these two primary flow mechanisms is dictated by the breakthrough time the point at which the injected fluid first reaches the sample s outlet boundary the next two sections will leverage the information within the oil flooding saturation curves in fig 7 to study the effects of the srp on the dynamic and static properties of these experiments 7 1 impact on breakthrough time we now present a general ranking of the breakthrough times for oil flooding as a function of srp properties obtained from the results in fig 7 and figure si2 the samples are well distributed around the standard base case and obey the following trends the slowest breakthrough times correspond to cases with oil wetting surface contact angles where the oil explores more of the porous medium before reaching the outlet in agreement with experimental observations of multiphase flow in bead packs and micromodels with no srp zhao et al 2016 hu et al 2017 these are followed by the sample case with no srp where the reasoning is the same as above sample cases with a less water wet srp decreasing m or with lower srp permeability or porosity further decrease the breakthrough times by limiting the ability of water to drain through the srp such that the oil explores less of the sample before reaching the outlet the effects of dynamic contact angle hysteresis is not evaluated here and will be investigated in future work overall our results show that oil breakthrough times are sensitive to srp parameters 30 even though drainage occurs predominantly in the larger pores a result that has potentially important implications in enhanced oil recovery and geologic co 2 sequestration 7 2 impact on residual saturations finally we observe in fig 8 and fig si3 that residual water saturations are highly correlated with oil breakthrough times samples with faster breakthrough times generally have higher residual water saturations at steady state the reasoning behind this behavior is very similar to the one developed to explain the difference in oil breakthrough times if more residual defending fluid is present the invading fluid explores less of the available space and hence travels through the sample more rapidly overall this analysis indicates that srp has a considerable impact on a sample s residual saturations 400 strongly implying that it should not be neglected during the design of subsurface fluid extraction and sequestration processes 8 conclusions in this paper we studied the effects of xct sub resolution porosity srp on a rock s absolute permeability relative permeability residual saturations and fluid breakthrough times our results quantify how these four properties react to changes in the porosity permeability and wettability of the srp one notable finding is that srp can function as a persistent connector between otherwise isolated fluid clusters during multiphase flow even at low saturations these results were obtained from numerical simulations performed with our newly developed multiphase micro continuum framework to the best of our knowledge this is the first two phase flow model and study to take into account srp without having to rely on a quasi static assumption or simplified pore network models as such this investigation establishes a framework for performing two phase flow simulations in digital rock systems that have two characteristic length scales potential improvements to our methodology include the simulation of larger and more diverse rock samples a very attainable task due to the current continuous and rapid growth of high performance computing resources finally our results suggest potentially fruitful opportunities for future work aimed at quantifying the effects of srp on upscaled capillary pressure curves and broadening the investigated parameter space to different types of rocks involving different geometries different amounts of srp and different srp induced connectivity these avenues will more extensively test the conclusions presented in this study

191,recent advances in the study of extreme values namely the metastatistical extreme value mev framework showed good performances for the estimation of extremes in several fields here we adopt mev for flood frequency analysis and leverage its intrinsic property of allowing for the choice of the distribution which best describes ordinary peaks to improve flood estimation to this end we develop a non parametric approach to select ex ante the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks between gamma and log normal the method relies on the tail ratio which we define as the ratio between the empirical 99th and 95th percentile of the ordinary peaks and is tested by using daily streamflow time series from 182 gauges in germany based on the value of the tail ratio index we choose either the gamma or the log normal distributions to represent the ordinary peaks in each gauge the approach correctly identifies the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks in a large majority of the analyzed basins and is robust to changes of the considered dataset the preliminary selection of the ordinary distribution based on the tail ratio index improves the estimation of frequent and rare floods with respect to mev applied with a single distribution not tailored on the specific statistical properties of the ordinary peaks finally by comparing the developed methodology with the standard generalized extreme value gev distribution we show that we are able to reduce the estimation uncertainty of high flood quantiles keywords flood frequency estimation extreme events flood hazard metastatistical extreme value distribution tail properties 1 introduction floods repeatedly cause severe property damages and loss of human lives across the world unisdr 2015 more than half a million deaths occurred due to these events and 2 8 billion people were affected globally between 1980 and 2009 doocy et al 2013 focusing on a more local scale germany has experienced several intense flood events in recent decades in hydrological terms the june 2013 flood can be regarded as the most severe flood over the last 60 years merz et al 2014 with high flood peaks in the elbe catchment in eastern germany the danube in the south the weser and the rhine in the western part of germany most recently in july 2021 heavy precipitation and severe thunderstorms induced flooding in western germany affecting more than 40 000 people and with at least 184 fatalities fekete and sandholz 2021 from an economical viewpoint whereas the august 2002 floods caused several billion euros losses thieken et al 2005 floods in 2021 caused financial losses for more than 30 billion euros dw 2021 a reliable assessment of natural hazards at the origin of such disasters is crucial to improve preparedness of societies in particular accurate estimation of flood magnitude and frequency is key for the design and management of engineering and hydraulic structures which are essential tools to reduce damages and thus protect a wide range of social and economic activities eash 1997 rosbjerg 2013 macdonald et al 2006 flood frequency analysis is usually performed according to the classical extreme value theory by fitting a distribution on either annual maxima e g cunnane 1973 villarini and smith 2010 seckin et al 2011 or a few values over a high threshold i e the peak over threshold approach davison and smith 1990 commonly used distributions are gumbel log normal pearson type iii gamma log pearson and gev bobée et al 1993 morrison and smith 2002 haktinar et al 2013 the possibility given by these approaches of inferring the upper tail of a distribution without knowing the whole stochastic underlying process is appealing and was necessary in time periods when only annual maxima were recorded however these approaches discard most of the information contained in the bulk of runoff events tarasova et al 2020 thus typically providing estimations affected by large uncertainty miniussi et al 2020 the limitations of traditional extreme value approaches have been highlighted by several studies e g klemeš 1974 iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2019 lombardo et al 2019 among others hu et al 2020 found that the estimation of the shape parameter of the gev distribution which chiefly controls its tail i e the part of the distribution which describes rare events is very sensitive to the sampling of flow data and highly affected by the length of the available time series this problem can lead to huge uncertainty for the estimation of low frequency quantiles thus prohibiting the gev to be a competitive candidate for the calculation of at site flood statistics when only short observational series are available renard et al 2013 as it occurs in large parts of the world müller and thompson 2016 recently developments in extreme value statistics and novel theoretical approaches to appraise extreme discharges have proposed to estimate maxima by leveraging the information content of the full distribution of events marani and ignaccolo 2015 basso et al 2016 thus making more effective use of the available data in particular the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 postulates that extremes emerge from the set of ordinary peaks i e all the independent values not annual maxima or peak over threshold values which are characterized by means of suitably selected probability distributions the flexibility of mev for the choice of the underlying distribution of ordinary events expressly allows for selecting the statistical model which better represents the upper tail of the distribution a pivotal feature for achieving a correct characterization of extreme events the importance of the upper tail behavior of a distribution for the description of extremes is further highlighted by the number of past and recent studies dealing with the subject e g smith et al 2018 wietzke et al 2020 to investigate the tail properties previous studies employed different graphical methods including the generalized hill ratio plot log log plot also called tail probability plot and the mean excess function el adlouni et al 2008 these graphical methods being based on visual interpretation lack objectivity and cannot be easily implemented when analyzing large datasets these drawbacks call for the development of robust and objective methods cook et al 2004 recent attempts towards this direction have been done for example nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 developed an automated procedure for the application of the mean excess function to investigate the tail properties of precipitation at the global scale wietzke et al 2020 made a detailed inter comparison of different upper tail indicators with the aim of indicating the most appropriate method they considered the shape parameter of the gev distribution the gini index eliazar and sokolova 2010 the obesity index cooke and nieboer 2011 and the upper tail ratio smith et al 2018 their findings eventually suggest that the gev shape parameter is the most suitable indicator for distinguishing between different tail behaviors this indicator has however the drawback of being parametric i e it requires the prior assumption of a distribution and it s fitting to the sample of maxima which entails notable uncertainties basso et al 2021 in this work we leverage the flexibility of mev in seeking for the optimal distribution of ordinary events and develop a methodology that enables selection ex ante of the best fitting ordinary peaks distribution related benefits for the estimation of flood quantiles are then evaluated we thus intend to provide indications on how to suitably apply the mev framework for the prediction of hydrologic extremes the article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the data and the methodology used in this study section 3 displays and discusses the results which are finally summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data we analyzed daily streamflow records from 182 gauges in germany tarasova et al 2018 which have time series longer than 30 years and less than 10 missing observations in each year we utilized hydrological years spanning from october to september the catchment sizes range from 30 to 23 842 km2 median value 581 km2 and the lengths of the time series are comprised between 37 and 64 years median value 61 years catchments in the dataset cover the whole of germany and its diverse climatic and physiographic conditions fig 1 a germany is influenced by its specific position between continental climate in the east and maritime climate in the west of the country the northwestern region of the country is dominated by circulation patterns linked to mid latitude cyclone rainfall that can cause river flooding rainfall varies from north to south and reach its maximum in the alpine forelands and southern scarplands with annual rainfall more than 2000 mm schädler et al 2012 in the alps annual rainfall amounts decrease from west to east fig 1b catchments in germany exhibit different flood regimes that dominate during particular seasons the central and western parts are dominated by winter floods the north and east areas experience spring and summer floods and the southern part of germany is dominated by summer floods beurton and thieken 2009 the study area includes small to medium sized catchments which react faster than large catchments to heavy precipitation and are thus characterized by a more intense flood hazard schädler et al 2012 2 2 the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution 2 2 1 theoretical framework in the present work we adopt a recently developed extreme value approach the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 for the study of peak flows this method postulates that extremes emerge from ordinary events i e all the independent values not annual maxima or peak over threshold values and treats as random variables both the parameters of the ordinary distributions and the number of event occurrences in each year this approach therefore leverages all the information content of the bulk of the events distribution i e not only of its tail as done in traditional extreme value distribution methods gnedenko 1943 coles 2001 the reader is referred to serinaldi et al 2020 for a systematic explanation of the underlying theory and the differences between traditional extreme value theory and mev moreover the mev framework allows for flexibility in the choice of the distribution of ordinary values by enabling the selection of the distribution that describes them best further details on this point are provided in the following sections the discrete formulation of the mev cumulative distribution function expressed as an average over the m observational years is zorzetto et al 2016 1 ζ x 1 m j 1 m f x θ n j where f x θ is the ordinary distribution of peak flows θ is a vector of parameters of this distribution notice that in the above formulation we adopt time invariant parameters of the ordinary distribution as the subscript j does not appear in θ and nj is the number of events within each year here considered variable across years theoretically mev can account for the inter annual variability of the ordinary distribution as well for a detailed discussion on the topic we refer to miniussi and marani 2020 however as the number of independent ordinary events peaks available in observed streamflow series is typically limited the advantages robust parameter estimation and uncertainty reduction of considering the whole sample for fitting the parameters of the ordinary distribution overcome those obtained from the use of yearly varying parameters miniussi et al 2020 in order to identify a set of independent ordinary events from daily streamflow records which are typically highly correlated we use the decorrelation procedure recommended by the guidelines of the us water resources council uswrc 1976 this is a well established method which has been adopted in many studies in different regions of the world see e g lang et al 1999 and miniussi et al 2020 at first we identify one peak within each time block of length t 5 days log a where a is the basin area in square miles is the minimum lag time required by the independence criterion and the value of t is rounded off to the nearest integer number this would result for german catchment sizes of one event peak each 6th to 9th day the second step consists in checking that the magnitude of the minimum flow between two consecutive peaks is lower than 75 of the lowest one to enable discarding secondary peaks which occur during recession events if this requirement is not fulfilled the smallest peak in the pair is eliminated the set of all peak discharge values obtained from this procedure constitutes the sample of ordinary events on which the ordinary distribution f x θ in eq 1 is then fitted in our dataset the average number of flood peaks per year resulting from this selection process ranges from 8 to 24 median value 17 and their mean inter arrival time is 23 days which is much larger than the required minimum lag time of 6 to 9 days for event independence uswrc 1976 2 2 2 ordinary distributions once the ordinary peaks are selected we must choose a distribution to describe their statistical properties miniussi et al 2020 identified the gamma distribution as the best performing distribution to model flood peaks in the conterminous united states yet they also suggested that the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks must be investigated before choosing the distribution that describes them best as mentioned mev allows for handling diverse ordinary distributions thus we leverage this flexibility of mev and examine as potential candidates for the set of german river basins the two parameters gamma and log normal distributions both these distributions are widely used for flood frequency analysis stedinger 1980 chen et al 2004 while exhibiting different characteristics especially for what concerns their tail properties being gamma a light tailed distribution el adlouni et al 2008 and the log normal akin to a heavy tailed one koutsoyiannis 2020 although gamma and log normal are used in this study as in a preliminary scrutiny they were found to be the most suitable distributions for the considered dataset the proposed approach applies to any other choice for the distributions of ordinary events the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution is davis 1959 hosking 1990 lancaster 1966 2 f x α β β α 0 x t α 1 e t β d t г α where α and β are respectively the shape and scale parameters and γ is the gamma function the cumulative distribution function of the log normal distribution is instead mcalister 1879 bobée et al 1993 3 f x μ σ ф l o g x μ σ where µ and σ are respectively the scale and shape parameters of the log normal distribution and ф is the standard normal distribution function we estimate parameters of the gamma and log normal distributions by fitting them on the sample of ordinary peaks selected as explained in section 2 2 by means of l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1990 the choice of l moments is motivated by their lower sensitivity to outliers and to limited sizes of the calibration samples when compared to maximum likelihood hosking and wallis 1997 2 3 tail ratio method and sensitivity analysis we propose and apply in this study a methodology that enables the choice of the best ordinary distribution to be used in eq 1 ex ante based on the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks this non parametric approach avoids the need to evaluate every time the goodness of fit of different distributions on randomly extracted samples of ordinary peaks rather it allows for appraising the behavior of the upper tail of the ordinary peaks a crucial step for the selection of the best ordinary distribution and thus choose a priori between gamma and log normal the most suitable distribution to characterize them the method relies on the calculation of the tail ratio index which is defined as the ratio between the empirical 99th and 95th percentiles of ordinary peaks similarly to the procedure suggested by nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 to evaluate the tail behavior of daily precipitation in the present study we tested different ratios 99th to 90th as in nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 99th to 95th and intermediate ratios with similar results in the end we found that in the case of flood peaks considering the ratio between the 99th and 95th percentile allows to describe best the upper tail of the distribution in our dataset the method is inspired by the upper tail ratio of smith et al 2018 although pursuing a different aim and with clear advantages when compared to it the upper tail ratio is defined as the ratio between the maximum event in the record and the empirical 10 years return level it is computed from annual maxima and is therefore sensitive to the observational sample size conversely our proposed method the tail ratio index is calculated accounting for the whole distribution of ordinary peaks first its definition is consistent with the rationale underlying the mev framework which considers extremes emerging from ordinary events second the whole set of ordinary peaks a median number of 1184 in the considered catchments is used in the tail ratio index instead of annual maxima which results in more robust calculations therefore we believe that the proposed method is transferrable to other areas with potential limitations in catchments characterized by drier conditions in which the low number of ordinary peaks might impair the robustness of its computation the steps involved in the establishment and evaluation of the proposed tail ratio method are the following 1 we select the best ordinary distribution for each station evaluating the goodness of fit of gamma and log normal distributions on the complete series of ordinary peaks by means of the skill score metric murphy and winkler 1992 hashino et al 2006 2 we calculate the tail ratio index of each series and seek a threshold to distinguish relatively lighter and heavier tailed distributions we choose to this purpose the threshold of the tail ratio index that allows maximizing the number of catchments for which the optimal i e the one with the highest skill score value distribution is selected 3 in order to evaluate the robustness of the threshold identified on the whole german dataset and the possibility to apply it to different datasets i e subsamples of the original one we randomly select for 100 times 50 of the basins and calculate again the threshold value obtained from each resampling 4 we check the capability of this threshold to correctly distinguish between catchments for which either the gamma or the log normal distributions are optimal as in step 2 by using the remaining 50 of the basins in the dataset as test catchments 2 4 cross validation and benchmarking in order to evaluate the predicting capabilities of the tested flood estimation approaches we perform a monte carlo experiment through which we extract 1000 times from the available data record 10 random years of observations which we use as calibration sample the remaining data are each time used as validation sample by means of this procedure any potential systematic variability in the time series is disregarded vogel et al 1993 haktanir et al 2013 zorzetto et al 2016 and the estimation uncertainty can be evaluated the length of the calibration sample was chosen as to have enough ordinary events to enable a robust estimation of the ordinary distributions parameters and at the same time to allow for the assessment of the estimation uncertainty of the different approaches in fact being the minimum length of the analyzed streamflow records equals to 30 years with a calibration sample longer than 10 e g 20 years we could not evaluate the estimation accuracy in a predictive fashion as no observed maximum would be associated with an empirical return period greater than 20 years in the validation sample moreover we stress that we aim at quantifying errors with respect to the empirical values as the performance e g in terms of accuracy improvement of an extreme value approach cannot be evaluated when quantiles with return periods higher than the empirical ones are taken into account furthermore assessing the accuracy of extreme value methods constrained on short calibration samples is pivotal for e g data scarce areas where only short time series are available we also benchmark mev estimations with the traditional gev approach which constitutes the suggested distribution for flood frequency analysis in germany petrow et al 2007 gev parameters are estimated by fitting the distribution through l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1990 on yearly maxima in the calibration sample in order to evaluate the estimation accuracy of both mev and gev we use the non dimensional error zorzetto et al 2016 which quantifies the performance of different models for each random extraction in the monte carlo experiment we calculate the non dimensional error ε x est x obs x obs between estimated and observed maxima in the validation sample which have a return period longer than the calibration sample size we finally pool together the non dimensional error values obtained for different ranges of the ratio t s between return period t and calibration sample size s 3 results and discussion we first apply the mev approach by using either a gamma or a log normal distribution for each of the 182 german gauges we then evaluate the capabilities of mev gamma fig 2 a and mev log normal fig 2b to estimate observed maxima in the validation sample we find that high quantiles are frequently underestimated by mev gamma see blue dots below the 45 line in fig 2a although this issue is addressed by using mev log normal overestimation prevails in the latter case the contrasting behavior of the two distributions suggests that the ordinary peaks are in some catchments characterized by lighter tails for which the gamma is a suitable distribution and the log normal has a too heavy tail and vice versa in other basins these results are consistent with previous findings highlighting that flood records may exhibit both light and heavy tail behaviors katz et al 2002 bernardara et al 2008 an example of this instance is provided in fig 3 the blue lines in fig 3a show that using a gamma distribution to fit the empirical distribution of ordinary peaks grey dots would lead to an underestimation of the exceedance probability of the largest flows this results into a significant underestimation of the largest annual maxima as shown in fig 3c the underestimation issues of the gamma distribution that we highlight here are in line with previous findings papalexiou et al 2013 the flood frequency curve is instead correctly estimated by using mev log normal fig 3d because the underlying log normal distribution is capable to correctly represent the empirical exceedance probability of the largest ordinary flows as represented in fig 3b this explanatory case highlights how the choice of a suboptimal distribution of ordinary peaks largely affects the estimation of maxima as also signaled by previous studies cunnane 1985 haddad and rahman 2011 hu et al 2020 which indicated the importance of selection of distribution for the estimation of high quantiles in fact when mev gamma is applied maxima are generally underestimated to a more or less large extent while the application of the log normal distribution allows for an accurate appraisal of high flood magnitudes hence the need of understanding ideally a priori what is the best distribution that should be used to describe the tail behavior of ordinary peaks an issue highlighted in past studies el adlouni et al 2008 to reach this goal we calculate the tail ratio index introduced in section 2 3 to evaluate the relative tail behavior of the distribution of ordinary peaks ex ante and independently from the mev procedure fig 4 visualizes the results of the procedure detailed in section 2 3 the blue line shows the fraction of cases for which the tail ratio index of the catchments in which the gamma distribution is identified as the best fitting one is lower than the corresponding value of the tail ratio index reported on the x axis for increasing values of the tail ratio index we are able to correctly match the best ordinary distribution for an increasing fraction of cases for the gamma distribution a symmetric and opposite comment can be done in the case of catchments where the log normal distribution is the most suitable one orange line in fig 4 ordinary peaks for which the log normal distribution is the best fit tend indeed to have higher values of tail ratio index and consequently the lower the threshold the most likely it is to correctly classify them it is important to note that the fraction of cases represented by the y axis in fig 4 refers to the number of catchments for which either distribution is the best not to the whole dataset the crossing point of these two curves identified with a black dashed line in fig 4 represents the threshold on the tail ratio index which allows for maximizing the number of catchments where the correct identification of the best fitting distribution of ordinary peaks can be obtained ex ante by means of the tail ratio index the identified threshold equals to 1 58 for the whole set of german basins allows for correctly identifying 74 of the catchments in each distribution group approximately 30 of the catchments for which the correct distribution of ordinary peaks is not identified based on the tail ratio index i e 14 out of 48 display values of the tail ratio index close to the threshold within the shaded region of fig 4 for the remaining cases the distribution of ordinary peaks indicates the possibility of a heavier tail than the one exhibited by most of the flood frequency curves generated in the monte carlo procedure in order to check the robustness of the selected threshold with the aim to apply it to different subsets of river basins we follow the procedure detailed in section 2 3 the thresholds obtained with this procedure span a narrow range between 1 51 and 1 62 grey shaded area in fig 4 with a median value of 1 57 red dashed line in fig 4 the identified threshold exhibits weak dependence on the subset of selected basins proving its capability to correctly distinguish ex ante between basins where either the gamma or the log normal distributions best fit the ordinary peaks these results show that the identified threshold is robust appropriate for german catchments and can thus be applied to different datasets other than the one used in this study following up on the previous analyses we hence split the whole set of case studies into two groups group 1 76 basins blue dots in fig 1 includes catchments with a tail ratio index lower than 1 58 for which we apply the mev gamma whereas group 2 106 basins yellow dots in fig 1 comprises catchments with values of the tail ratio index greater than 1 58 for which the mev log normal is used the performance of the mev approach after this a priori selection of the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks by means of the tail ratio index is illustrated in fig 5 a b quantile quantile qq plots in fig 5 show an improvement of the performance of mev when the distribution of ordinary peaks is chosen by considering the tail features of the underlying data versus neglecting them i e the performance increases between figs 2a b and 5a b these results agree to those of papalexiou et al 2013 who emphasized the importance of the upper part i e the tail of the probability distribution in particular the under and overestimation issues resulting from the application of mev gamma and mev log normal to the whole set of german case studies fig 2 largely decrease compared to the two classified groups we observe that errors reduce of a median value of 57 and 58 across all quantiles and 56 and 40 for high quantiles i e with ratio between the return period t and the calibration sample size s greater than 3 when these distributions are separately applied to group 1 and 2 this indicates that the preliminary selection of catchments exhibiting relatively lighter and heavier tails based on the tail ratio index is effective and allows for improving the estimation of floods in the mev framework we also compare these results with estimates obtained by means of the traditional gev distribution fig 5c d despite acknowledging the limitations of fitting a three parameter distribution on a relatively small sample this situation is not uncommon in hydrological practice e g kobierska et al 2018 the comparison between fig 5a b and 5c d shows that the preliminary selection of the distribution of ordinary peaks in the mev approach enables improved mev versus gev estimates especially in group 1 here mev gamma guarantees an average performance similar to gev dark blue and pink dots in fig 5a c and a remarkable decrease of the uncertainty of the estimate light blue and pink dots in fig 5a c these results are supported by previous findings basso et al 2021 who showed that mev exhibits lower uncertainty than gev a similar result is obtained for group 2 although in this case the uncertainty of mev log normal is comparable to that of gev especially for the largest flood values however gev is affected by larger uncertainty than mev log normal in cases where the magnitude of streamflow maxima for a same return period is smaller as highlighted by the following analysis in order to provide a more complete overview of the estimation accuracy of the three extreme value distributions we complement the qq plots in fig 5a d with fig 6 which shows the non dimensional error between observed and estimated quantiles for all random extractions in the monte carlo procedure and all the gauges zorzetto et al 2016 these results are also summarized in table 1 in both cases we pool the non dimensional error values in different ranges of the ratio t s between return period and calibration sample each of which includes at least 10 000 values mev gamma fig 6a and mev log normal fig 6d respectively under and overestimates when applied to the whole dataset fig 6a once again highlights that mev gamma if applied without accounting for the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks is affected by underestimation notice that dark blue dots in fig 6a tend to stay under the dashed black line which represents the unbiased result with a relative error equal to zero these results are in line with the findings of papalexiou et al 2013 when comparing the relative error of mev gamma fig 6b and gev fig 6c for the basins in group 1 or likewise the relative error of mev log normal fig 6e and gev fig 6f for the basins in group 2 we highlight that despite similar performances of mev and gev in terms of median values the latter is affected by much larger uncertainty these results agree with the findings of e g odry and arnaud 2017 who stressed the importance of a reduced uncertainty when estimating high flow values notably in group 1 the overestimation magnitude of mev gamma is the half of gev across all t s fig 6b c differences between the relative performance of mev log normal and gev are less pronounced in group 2 but substantially larger overestimation i e non dimensional error reaching a value of 6 can occur when employing gev we finally present the comparison between the non dimensional errors of mev applied on the whole dataset i e regardless of the observed tail of the distribution of ordinary peaks fig 6a d and of both mev gamma fig 6b and mev log normal fig 6e applied to their respective groups in this way we want to underline the benefits deriving from the flexibility of mev in the choice of a suitable distribution of ordinary peaks when the catchments within a dataset exhibit different tail properties remarkably we are able to significantly decrease both the underestimation by which mev gamma is affected when blindly applied to the whole dataset blue dots in fig 6b are closer to the dashed line than in fig 6a and its uncertainty range blue shaded area is narrower in fig 6b than in fig 6a and to slightly reduce on average the overestimation issues of mev log normal fig 6e these results are highly relevant as both underestimation and overestimation issues are drawbacks when estimating high return levels of hydrological variables in the first case because of the underestimation of risks papalexiou et al 2013 in the latter because of the enormous economic costs that can derive from applying design values which are larger than needed cho et al 2004 finally the subdivision into two groups of the set of german catchments by means of the tail ratio index here proposed to select the most suitable distribution of ordinary events in the mev approach exhibits a clear geographical organization fig 1 catchments for which a gamma distribution lighter tail is the most suitable are primarily located in the western part of germany fig 1 blue dots where winter floods triggered by precipitation on wet soils are dominant tarasova et al 2020 with some catchments also gathered in the alpine forelands catchments for which a log normal distribution which has a relatively heavier tail is the best choice are instead mostly located in the eastern and southern areas of the country fig 1 orange dots regions affected by the occurrence of vb cyclones hofstätter et al 2016 causing rare but intense rainfall on dry soils which produces large floods the geographical clustering we identified recalls the spatial pattern recently showed by tarasova et al 2020 for the differences among processes triggering ordinary frequent and upper tail floods in germany our results suggest that their postulated outcomes in terms of distinct distributions of ordinary events is well founded and confirm the possibility to improve estimation of upper tail floods in this context by means of a metastatistical extreme value approach although beyond the scope of this work a quantitative investigation of the consistency between the identified spatial patterns and of the mix of hydrological processes giving rise to distributions of floods and ordinary peaks with relatively lighter gamma and heavier log normal tails in specific areas of germany is a noteworthy research direction which is the subject of current work 4 conclusion in this study we adopted the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution for flood frequency analysis in a set of 182 catchments in germany our goal was to optimize this novel framework based on the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks to this end we developed a non parametric approach to select ex ante the ordinary distribution of streamflow peaks which allows for accurately estimating high flow quantiles the proposed method tail ratio index makes a step forward in the evaluation of the tail behavior in particular it leverages the information content of ordinary events and avoids any graphical evaluation hence allowing for the analysis of large datasets it enables a binary classification of ordinary distributions characterized by lighter versus heavier tails we identified a threshold that discriminates between these two categories and used it to choose ex ante if either a gamma or a log normal distribution is the most suitable for describing the ordinary events our approach correctly identifies the ordinary distribution in 74 of the basins in the dataset we proved that the proposed value of the threshold is robust to random resampling of the catchments used to determine it and can thus be reliably employed we deem the proposed tail ratio index to be applicable to select the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks in other regions of the world selecting the distribution of ordinary peaks by means of this approach allows for reducing underestimation and overestimation issues compared to a blind i e without investigating the tail features of the ordinary peaks application of mev to the whole dataset namely we reduce mev gamma underestimation and log normal overestimation issues of a median 57 and 58 respectively finally we benchmarked our results against the standard distribution used in flood frequency analysis i e the generalized extreme value gev distribution in 135 out of the 182 analyzed basins the use of a tailored ordinary distribution in the mev framework decreases the uncertainty and improves the estimation for return periods greater than the calibration sample these are both relevant features to achieve a reliable estimation of extreme floods by proposing and verifying an easy to use method to leverage knowledge on tail properties the study supports selection of the appropriate model to analyze ordinary peaks and floods in the mev framework it thus contributes to reduce under and overestimation of rarer floods improving our capability to reliably assess the hazard posed by infrequent hydrological events credit authorship contribution statement

191,recent advances in the study of extreme values namely the metastatistical extreme value mev framework showed good performances for the estimation of extremes in several fields here we adopt mev for flood frequency analysis and leverage its intrinsic property of allowing for the choice of the distribution which best describes ordinary peaks to improve flood estimation to this end we develop a non parametric approach to select ex ante the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks between gamma and log normal the method relies on the tail ratio which we define as the ratio between the empirical 99th and 95th percentile of the ordinary peaks and is tested by using daily streamflow time series from 182 gauges in germany based on the value of the tail ratio index we choose either the gamma or the log normal distributions to represent the ordinary peaks in each gauge the approach correctly identifies the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks in a large majority of the analyzed basins and is robust to changes of the considered dataset the preliminary selection of the ordinary distribution based on the tail ratio index improves the estimation of frequent and rare floods with respect to mev applied with a single distribution not tailored on the specific statistical properties of the ordinary peaks finally by comparing the developed methodology with the standard generalized extreme value gev distribution we show that we are able to reduce the estimation uncertainty of high flood quantiles keywords flood frequency estimation extreme events flood hazard metastatistical extreme value distribution tail properties 1 introduction floods repeatedly cause severe property damages and loss of human lives across the world unisdr 2015 more than half a million deaths occurred due to these events and 2 8 billion people were affected globally between 1980 and 2009 doocy et al 2013 focusing on a more local scale germany has experienced several intense flood events in recent decades in hydrological terms the june 2013 flood can be regarded as the most severe flood over the last 60 years merz et al 2014 with high flood peaks in the elbe catchment in eastern germany the danube in the south the weser and the rhine in the western part of germany most recently in july 2021 heavy precipitation and severe thunderstorms induced flooding in western germany affecting more than 40 000 people and with at least 184 fatalities fekete and sandholz 2021 from an economical viewpoint whereas the august 2002 floods caused several billion euros losses thieken et al 2005 floods in 2021 caused financial losses for more than 30 billion euros dw 2021 a reliable assessment of natural hazards at the origin of such disasters is crucial to improve preparedness of societies in particular accurate estimation of flood magnitude and frequency is key for the design and management of engineering and hydraulic structures which are essential tools to reduce damages and thus protect a wide range of social and economic activities eash 1997 rosbjerg 2013 macdonald et al 2006 flood frequency analysis is usually performed according to the classical extreme value theory by fitting a distribution on either annual maxima e g cunnane 1973 villarini and smith 2010 seckin et al 2011 or a few values over a high threshold i e the peak over threshold approach davison and smith 1990 commonly used distributions are gumbel log normal pearson type iii gamma log pearson and gev bobée et al 1993 morrison and smith 2002 haktinar et al 2013 the possibility given by these approaches of inferring the upper tail of a distribution without knowing the whole stochastic underlying process is appealing and was necessary in time periods when only annual maxima were recorded however these approaches discard most of the information contained in the bulk of runoff events tarasova et al 2020 thus typically providing estimations affected by large uncertainty miniussi et al 2020 the limitations of traditional extreme value approaches have been highlighted by several studies e g klemeš 1974 iliopoulou and koutsoyiannis 2019 lombardo et al 2019 among others hu et al 2020 found that the estimation of the shape parameter of the gev distribution which chiefly controls its tail i e the part of the distribution which describes rare events is very sensitive to the sampling of flow data and highly affected by the length of the available time series this problem can lead to huge uncertainty for the estimation of low frequency quantiles thus prohibiting the gev to be a competitive candidate for the calculation of at site flood statistics when only short observational series are available renard et al 2013 as it occurs in large parts of the world müller and thompson 2016 recently developments in extreme value statistics and novel theoretical approaches to appraise extreme discharges have proposed to estimate maxima by leveraging the information content of the full distribution of events marani and ignaccolo 2015 basso et al 2016 thus making more effective use of the available data in particular the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 postulates that extremes emerge from the set of ordinary peaks i e all the independent values not annual maxima or peak over threshold values which are characterized by means of suitably selected probability distributions the flexibility of mev for the choice of the underlying distribution of ordinary events expressly allows for selecting the statistical model which better represents the upper tail of the distribution a pivotal feature for achieving a correct characterization of extreme events the importance of the upper tail behavior of a distribution for the description of extremes is further highlighted by the number of past and recent studies dealing with the subject e g smith et al 2018 wietzke et al 2020 to investigate the tail properties previous studies employed different graphical methods including the generalized hill ratio plot log log plot also called tail probability plot and the mean excess function el adlouni et al 2008 these graphical methods being based on visual interpretation lack objectivity and cannot be easily implemented when analyzing large datasets these drawbacks call for the development of robust and objective methods cook et al 2004 recent attempts towards this direction have been done for example nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 developed an automated procedure for the application of the mean excess function to investigate the tail properties of precipitation at the global scale wietzke et al 2020 made a detailed inter comparison of different upper tail indicators with the aim of indicating the most appropriate method they considered the shape parameter of the gev distribution the gini index eliazar and sokolova 2010 the obesity index cooke and nieboer 2011 and the upper tail ratio smith et al 2018 their findings eventually suggest that the gev shape parameter is the most suitable indicator for distinguishing between different tail behaviors this indicator has however the drawback of being parametric i e it requires the prior assumption of a distribution and it s fitting to the sample of maxima which entails notable uncertainties basso et al 2021 in this work we leverage the flexibility of mev in seeking for the optimal distribution of ordinary events and develop a methodology that enables selection ex ante of the best fitting ordinary peaks distribution related benefits for the estimation of flood quantiles are then evaluated we thus intend to provide indications on how to suitably apply the mev framework for the prediction of hydrologic extremes the article is organized as follows in section 2 we describe the data and the methodology used in this study section 3 displays and discusses the results which are finally summarized in section 4 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data we analyzed daily streamflow records from 182 gauges in germany tarasova et al 2018 which have time series longer than 30 years and less than 10 missing observations in each year we utilized hydrological years spanning from october to september the catchment sizes range from 30 to 23 842 km2 median value 581 km2 and the lengths of the time series are comprised between 37 and 64 years median value 61 years catchments in the dataset cover the whole of germany and its diverse climatic and physiographic conditions fig 1 a germany is influenced by its specific position between continental climate in the east and maritime climate in the west of the country the northwestern region of the country is dominated by circulation patterns linked to mid latitude cyclone rainfall that can cause river flooding rainfall varies from north to south and reach its maximum in the alpine forelands and southern scarplands with annual rainfall more than 2000 mm schädler et al 2012 in the alps annual rainfall amounts decrease from west to east fig 1b catchments in germany exhibit different flood regimes that dominate during particular seasons the central and western parts are dominated by winter floods the north and east areas experience spring and summer floods and the southern part of germany is dominated by summer floods beurton and thieken 2009 the study area includes small to medium sized catchments which react faster than large catchments to heavy precipitation and are thus characterized by a more intense flood hazard schädler et al 2012 2 2 the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution 2 2 1 theoretical framework in the present work we adopt a recently developed extreme value approach the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution marani and ignaccolo 2015 zorzetto et al 2016 marra et al 2018 for the study of peak flows this method postulates that extremes emerge from ordinary events i e all the independent values not annual maxima or peak over threshold values and treats as random variables both the parameters of the ordinary distributions and the number of event occurrences in each year this approach therefore leverages all the information content of the bulk of the events distribution i e not only of its tail as done in traditional extreme value distribution methods gnedenko 1943 coles 2001 the reader is referred to serinaldi et al 2020 for a systematic explanation of the underlying theory and the differences between traditional extreme value theory and mev moreover the mev framework allows for flexibility in the choice of the distribution of ordinary values by enabling the selection of the distribution that describes them best further details on this point are provided in the following sections the discrete formulation of the mev cumulative distribution function expressed as an average over the m observational years is zorzetto et al 2016 1 ζ x 1 m j 1 m f x θ n j where f x θ is the ordinary distribution of peak flows θ is a vector of parameters of this distribution notice that in the above formulation we adopt time invariant parameters of the ordinary distribution as the subscript j does not appear in θ and nj is the number of events within each year here considered variable across years theoretically mev can account for the inter annual variability of the ordinary distribution as well for a detailed discussion on the topic we refer to miniussi and marani 2020 however as the number of independent ordinary events peaks available in observed streamflow series is typically limited the advantages robust parameter estimation and uncertainty reduction of considering the whole sample for fitting the parameters of the ordinary distribution overcome those obtained from the use of yearly varying parameters miniussi et al 2020 in order to identify a set of independent ordinary events from daily streamflow records which are typically highly correlated we use the decorrelation procedure recommended by the guidelines of the us water resources council uswrc 1976 this is a well established method which has been adopted in many studies in different regions of the world see e g lang et al 1999 and miniussi et al 2020 at first we identify one peak within each time block of length t 5 days log a where a is the basin area in square miles is the minimum lag time required by the independence criterion and the value of t is rounded off to the nearest integer number this would result for german catchment sizes of one event peak each 6th to 9th day the second step consists in checking that the magnitude of the minimum flow between two consecutive peaks is lower than 75 of the lowest one to enable discarding secondary peaks which occur during recession events if this requirement is not fulfilled the smallest peak in the pair is eliminated the set of all peak discharge values obtained from this procedure constitutes the sample of ordinary events on which the ordinary distribution f x θ in eq 1 is then fitted in our dataset the average number of flood peaks per year resulting from this selection process ranges from 8 to 24 median value 17 and their mean inter arrival time is 23 days which is much larger than the required minimum lag time of 6 to 9 days for event independence uswrc 1976 2 2 2 ordinary distributions once the ordinary peaks are selected we must choose a distribution to describe their statistical properties miniussi et al 2020 identified the gamma distribution as the best performing distribution to model flood peaks in the conterminous united states yet they also suggested that the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks must be investigated before choosing the distribution that describes them best as mentioned mev allows for handling diverse ordinary distributions thus we leverage this flexibility of mev and examine as potential candidates for the set of german river basins the two parameters gamma and log normal distributions both these distributions are widely used for flood frequency analysis stedinger 1980 chen et al 2004 while exhibiting different characteristics especially for what concerns their tail properties being gamma a light tailed distribution el adlouni et al 2008 and the log normal akin to a heavy tailed one koutsoyiannis 2020 although gamma and log normal are used in this study as in a preliminary scrutiny they were found to be the most suitable distributions for the considered dataset the proposed approach applies to any other choice for the distributions of ordinary events the cumulative distribution function of the gamma distribution is davis 1959 hosking 1990 lancaster 1966 2 f x α β β α 0 x t α 1 e t β d t г α where α and β are respectively the shape and scale parameters and γ is the gamma function the cumulative distribution function of the log normal distribution is instead mcalister 1879 bobée et al 1993 3 f x μ σ ф l o g x μ σ where µ and σ are respectively the scale and shape parameters of the log normal distribution and ф is the standard normal distribution function we estimate parameters of the gamma and log normal distributions by fitting them on the sample of ordinary peaks selected as explained in section 2 2 by means of l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1990 the choice of l moments is motivated by their lower sensitivity to outliers and to limited sizes of the calibration samples when compared to maximum likelihood hosking and wallis 1997 2 3 tail ratio method and sensitivity analysis we propose and apply in this study a methodology that enables the choice of the best ordinary distribution to be used in eq 1 ex ante based on the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks this non parametric approach avoids the need to evaluate every time the goodness of fit of different distributions on randomly extracted samples of ordinary peaks rather it allows for appraising the behavior of the upper tail of the ordinary peaks a crucial step for the selection of the best ordinary distribution and thus choose a priori between gamma and log normal the most suitable distribution to characterize them the method relies on the calculation of the tail ratio index which is defined as the ratio between the empirical 99th and 95th percentiles of ordinary peaks similarly to the procedure suggested by nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 to evaluate the tail behavior of daily precipitation in the present study we tested different ratios 99th to 90th as in nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 99th to 95th and intermediate ratios with similar results in the end we found that in the case of flood peaks considering the ratio between the 99th and 95th percentile allows to describe best the upper tail of the distribution in our dataset the method is inspired by the upper tail ratio of smith et al 2018 although pursuing a different aim and with clear advantages when compared to it the upper tail ratio is defined as the ratio between the maximum event in the record and the empirical 10 years return level it is computed from annual maxima and is therefore sensitive to the observational sample size conversely our proposed method the tail ratio index is calculated accounting for the whole distribution of ordinary peaks first its definition is consistent with the rationale underlying the mev framework which considers extremes emerging from ordinary events second the whole set of ordinary peaks a median number of 1184 in the considered catchments is used in the tail ratio index instead of annual maxima which results in more robust calculations therefore we believe that the proposed method is transferrable to other areas with potential limitations in catchments characterized by drier conditions in which the low number of ordinary peaks might impair the robustness of its computation the steps involved in the establishment and evaluation of the proposed tail ratio method are the following 1 we select the best ordinary distribution for each station evaluating the goodness of fit of gamma and log normal distributions on the complete series of ordinary peaks by means of the skill score metric murphy and winkler 1992 hashino et al 2006 2 we calculate the tail ratio index of each series and seek a threshold to distinguish relatively lighter and heavier tailed distributions we choose to this purpose the threshold of the tail ratio index that allows maximizing the number of catchments for which the optimal i e the one with the highest skill score value distribution is selected 3 in order to evaluate the robustness of the threshold identified on the whole german dataset and the possibility to apply it to different datasets i e subsamples of the original one we randomly select for 100 times 50 of the basins and calculate again the threshold value obtained from each resampling 4 we check the capability of this threshold to correctly distinguish between catchments for which either the gamma or the log normal distributions are optimal as in step 2 by using the remaining 50 of the basins in the dataset as test catchments 2 4 cross validation and benchmarking in order to evaluate the predicting capabilities of the tested flood estimation approaches we perform a monte carlo experiment through which we extract 1000 times from the available data record 10 random years of observations which we use as calibration sample the remaining data are each time used as validation sample by means of this procedure any potential systematic variability in the time series is disregarded vogel et al 1993 haktanir et al 2013 zorzetto et al 2016 and the estimation uncertainty can be evaluated the length of the calibration sample was chosen as to have enough ordinary events to enable a robust estimation of the ordinary distributions parameters and at the same time to allow for the assessment of the estimation uncertainty of the different approaches in fact being the minimum length of the analyzed streamflow records equals to 30 years with a calibration sample longer than 10 e g 20 years we could not evaluate the estimation accuracy in a predictive fashion as no observed maximum would be associated with an empirical return period greater than 20 years in the validation sample moreover we stress that we aim at quantifying errors with respect to the empirical values as the performance e g in terms of accuracy improvement of an extreme value approach cannot be evaluated when quantiles with return periods higher than the empirical ones are taken into account furthermore assessing the accuracy of extreme value methods constrained on short calibration samples is pivotal for e g data scarce areas where only short time series are available we also benchmark mev estimations with the traditional gev approach which constitutes the suggested distribution for flood frequency analysis in germany petrow et al 2007 gev parameters are estimated by fitting the distribution through l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1990 on yearly maxima in the calibration sample in order to evaluate the estimation accuracy of both mev and gev we use the non dimensional error zorzetto et al 2016 which quantifies the performance of different models for each random extraction in the monte carlo experiment we calculate the non dimensional error ε x est x obs x obs between estimated and observed maxima in the validation sample which have a return period longer than the calibration sample size we finally pool together the non dimensional error values obtained for different ranges of the ratio t s between return period t and calibration sample size s 3 results and discussion we first apply the mev approach by using either a gamma or a log normal distribution for each of the 182 german gauges we then evaluate the capabilities of mev gamma fig 2 a and mev log normal fig 2b to estimate observed maxima in the validation sample we find that high quantiles are frequently underestimated by mev gamma see blue dots below the 45 line in fig 2a although this issue is addressed by using mev log normal overestimation prevails in the latter case the contrasting behavior of the two distributions suggests that the ordinary peaks are in some catchments characterized by lighter tails for which the gamma is a suitable distribution and the log normal has a too heavy tail and vice versa in other basins these results are consistent with previous findings highlighting that flood records may exhibit both light and heavy tail behaviors katz et al 2002 bernardara et al 2008 an example of this instance is provided in fig 3 the blue lines in fig 3a show that using a gamma distribution to fit the empirical distribution of ordinary peaks grey dots would lead to an underestimation of the exceedance probability of the largest flows this results into a significant underestimation of the largest annual maxima as shown in fig 3c the underestimation issues of the gamma distribution that we highlight here are in line with previous findings papalexiou et al 2013 the flood frequency curve is instead correctly estimated by using mev log normal fig 3d because the underlying log normal distribution is capable to correctly represent the empirical exceedance probability of the largest ordinary flows as represented in fig 3b this explanatory case highlights how the choice of a suboptimal distribution of ordinary peaks largely affects the estimation of maxima as also signaled by previous studies cunnane 1985 haddad and rahman 2011 hu et al 2020 which indicated the importance of selection of distribution for the estimation of high quantiles in fact when mev gamma is applied maxima are generally underestimated to a more or less large extent while the application of the log normal distribution allows for an accurate appraisal of high flood magnitudes hence the need of understanding ideally a priori what is the best distribution that should be used to describe the tail behavior of ordinary peaks an issue highlighted in past studies el adlouni et al 2008 to reach this goal we calculate the tail ratio index introduced in section 2 3 to evaluate the relative tail behavior of the distribution of ordinary peaks ex ante and independently from the mev procedure fig 4 visualizes the results of the procedure detailed in section 2 3 the blue line shows the fraction of cases for which the tail ratio index of the catchments in which the gamma distribution is identified as the best fitting one is lower than the corresponding value of the tail ratio index reported on the x axis for increasing values of the tail ratio index we are able to correctly match the best ordinary distribution for an increasing fraction of cases for the gamma distribution a symmetric and opposite comment can be done in the case of catchments where the log normal distribution is the most suitable one orange line in fig 4 ordinary peaks for which the log normal distribution is the best fit tend indeed to have higher values of tail ratio index and consequently the lower the threshold the most likely it is to correctly classify them it is important to note that the fraction of cases represented by the y axis in fig 4 refers to the number of catchments for which either distribution is the best not to the whole dataset the crossing point of these two curves identified with a black dashed line in fig 4 represents the threshold on the tail ratio index which allows for maximizing the number of catchments where the correct identification of the best fitting distribution of ordinary peaks can be obtained ex ante by means of the tail ratio index the identified threshold equals to 1 58 for the whole set of german basins allows for correctly identifying 74 of the catchments in each distribution group approximately 30 of the catchments for which the correct distribution of ordinary peaks is not identified based on the tail ratio index i e 14 out of 48 display values of the tail ratio index close to the threshold within the shaded region of fig 4 for the remaining cases the distribution of ordinary peaks indicates the possibility of a heavier tail than the one exhibited by most of the flood frequency curves generated in the monte carlo procedure in order to check the robustness of the selected threshold with the aim to apply it to different subsets of river basins we follow the procedure detailed in section 2 3 the thresholds obtained with this procedure span a narrow range between 1 51 and 1 62 grey shaded area in fig 4 with a median value of 1 57 red dashed line in fig 4 the identified threshold exhibits weak dependence on the subset of selected basins proving its capability to correctly distinguish ex ante between basins where either the gamma or the log normal distributions best fit the ordinary peaks these results show that the identified threshold is robust appropriate for german catchments and can thus be applied to different datasets other than the one used in this study following up on the previous analyses we hence split the whole set of case studies into two groups group 1 76 basins blue dots in fig 1 includes catchments with a tail ratio index lower than 1 58 for which we apply the mev gamma whereas group 2 106 basins yellow dots in fig 1 comprises catchments with values of the tail ratio index greater than 1 58 for which the mev log normal is used the performance of the mev approach after this a priori selection of the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks by means of the tail ratio index is illustrated in fig 5 a b quantile quantile qq plots in fig 5 show an improvement of the performance of mev when the distribution of ordinary peaks is chosen by considering the tail features of the underlying data versus neglecting them i e the performance increases between figs 2a b and 5a b these results agree to those of papalexiou et al 2013 who emphasized the importance of the upper part i e the tail of the probability distribution in particular the under and overestimation issues resulting from the application of mev gamma and mev log normal to the whole set of german case studies fig 2 largely decrease compared to the two classified groups we observe that errors reduce of a median value of 57 and 58 across all quantiles and 56 and 40 for high quantiles i e with ratio between the return period t and the calibration sample size s greater than 3 when these distributions are separately applied to group 1 and 2 this indicates that the preliminary selection of catchments exhibiting relatively lighter and heavier tails based on the tail ratio index is effective and allows for improving the estimation of floods in the mev framework we also compare these results with estimates obtained by means of the traditional gev distribution fig 5c d despite acknowledging the limitations of fitting a three parameter distribution on a relatively small sample this situation is not uncommon in hydrological practice e g kobierska et al 2018 the comparison between fig 5a b and 5c d shows that the preliminary selection of the distribution of ordinary peaks in the mev approach enables improved mev versus gev estimates especially in group 1 here mev gamma guarantees an average performance similar to gev dark blue and pink dots in fig 5a c and a remarkable decrease of the uncertainty of the estimate light blue and pink dots in fig 5a c these results are supported by previous findings basso et al 2021 who showed that mev exhibits lower uncertainty than gev a similar result is obtained for group 2 although in this case the uncertainty of mev log normal is comparable to that of gev especially for the largest flood values however gev is affected by larger uncertainty than mev log normal in cases where the magnitude of streamflow maxima for a same return period is smaller as highlighted by the following analysis in order to provide a more complete overview of the estimation accuracy of the three extreme value distributions we complement the qq plots in fig 5a d with fig 6 which shows the non dimensional error between observed and estimated quantiles for all random extractions in the monte carlo procedure and all the gauges zorzetto et al 2016 these results are also summarized in table 1 in both cases we pool the non dimensional error values in different ranges of the ratio t s between return period and calibration sample each of which includes at least 10 000 values mev gamma fig 6a and mev log normal fig 6d respectively under and overestimates when applied to the whole dataset fig 6a once again highlights that mev gamma if applied without accounting for the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks is affected by underestimation notice that dark blue dots in fig 6a tend to stay under the dashed black line which represents the unbiased result with a relative error equal to zero these results are in line with the findings of papalexiou et al 2013 when comparing the relative error of mev gamma fig 6b and gev fig 6c for the basins in group 1 or likewise the relative error of mev log normal fig 6e and gev fig 6f for the basins in group 2 we highlight that despite similar performances of mev and gev in terms of median values the latter is affected by much larger uncertainty these results agree with the findings of e g odry and arnaud 2017 who stressed the importance of a reduced uncertainty when estimating high flow values notably in group 1 the overestimation magnitude of mev gamma is the half of gev across all t s fig 6b c differences between the relative performance of mev log normal and gev are less pronounced in group 2 but substantially larger overestimation i e non dimensional error reaching a value of 6 can occur when employing gev we finally present the comparison between the non dimensional errors of mev applied on the whole dataset i e regardless of the observed tail of the distribution of ordinary peaks fig 6a d and of both mev gamma fig 6b and mev log normal fig 6e applied to their respective groups in this way we want to underline the benefits deriving from the flexibility of mev in the choice of a suitable distribution of ordinary peaks when the catchments within a dataset exhibit different tail properties remarkably we are able to significantly decrease both the underestimation by which mev gamma is affected when blindly applied to the whole dataset blue dots in fig 6b are closer to the dashed line than in fig 6a and its uncertainty range blue shaded area is narrower in fig 6b than in fig 6a and to slightly reduce on average the overestimation issues of mev log normal fig 6e these results are highly relevant as both underestimation and overestimation issues are drawbacks when estimating high return levels of hydrological variables in the first case because of the underestimation of risks papalexiou et al 2013 in the latter because of the enormous economic costs that can derive from applying design values which are larger than needed cho et al 2004 finally the subdivision into two groups of the set of german catchments by means of the tail ratio index here proposed to select the most suitable distribution of ordinary events in the mev approach exhibits a clear geographical organization fig 1 catchments for which a gamma distribution lighter tail is the most suitable are primarily located in the western part of germany fig 1 blue dots where winter floods triggered by precipitation on wet soils are dominant tarasova et al 2020 with some catchments also gathered in the alpine forelands catchments for which a log normal distribution which has a relatively heavier tail is the best choice are instead mostly located in the eastern and southern areas of the country fig 1 orange dots regions affected by the occurrence of vb cyclones hofstätter et al 2016 causing rare but intense rainfall on dry soils which produces large floods the geographical clustering we identified recalls the spatial pattern recently showed by tarasova et al 2020 for the differences among processes triggering ordinary frequent and upper tail floods in germany our results suggest that their postulated outcomes in terms of distinct distributions of ordinary events is well founded and confirm the possibility to improve estimation of upper tail floods in this context by means of a metastatistical extreme value approach although beyond the scope of this work a quantitative investigation of the consistency between the identified spatial patterns and of the mix of hydrological processes giving rise to distributions of floods and ordinary peaks with relatively lighter gamma and heavier log normal tails in specific areas of germany is a noteworthy research direction which is the subject of current work 4 conclusion in this study we adopted the metastatistical extreme value mev distribution for flood frequency analysis in a set of 182 catchments in germany our goal was to optimize this novel framework based on the statistical properties of the ordinary peaks to this end we developed a non parametric approach to select ex ante the ordinary distribution of streamflow peaks which allows for accurately estimating high flow quantiles the proposed method tail ratio index makes a step forward in the evaluation of the tail behavior in particular it leverages the information content of ordinary events and avoids any graphical evaluation hence allowing for the analysis of large datasets it enables a binary classification of ordinary distributions characterized by lighter versus heavier tails we identified a threshold that discriminates between these two categories and used it to choose ex ante if either a gamma or a log normal distribution is the most suitable for describing the ordinary events our approach correctly identifies the ordinary distribution in 74 of the basins in the dataset we proved that the proposed value of the threshold is robust to random resampling of the catchments used to determine it and can thus be reliably employed we deem the proposed tail ratio index to be applicable to select the most suitable distribution of ordinary peaks in other regions of the world selecting the distribution of ordinary peaks by means of this approach allows for reducing underestimation and overestimation issues compared to a blind i e without investigating the tail features of the ordinary peaks application of mev to the whole dataset namely we reduce mev gamma underestimation and log normal overestimation issues of a median 57 and 58 respectively finally we benchmarked our results against the standard distribution used in flood frequency analysis i e the generalized extreme value gev distribution in 135 out of the 182 analyzed basins the use of a tailored ordinary distribution in the mev framework decreases the uncertainty and improves the estimation for return periods greater than the calibration sample these are both relevant features to achieve a reliable estimation of extreme floods by proposing and verifying an easy to use method to leverage knowledge on tail properties the study supports selection of the appropriate model to analyze ordinary peaks and floods in the mev framework it thus contributes to reduce under and overestimation of rarer floods improving our capability to reliably assess the hazard posed by infrequent hydrological events credit authorship contribution statement

192,fractured karst reservoirs play a significant role in hydrocarbon reserves and groundwater storage they often exhibit complex multiscale heterogeneities involving pores fractures and caves whose length scales range from microns to tens or hundreds of meters thus the study of fractured karst reservoirs is faced with a significant unresolved challenge in quantitatively characterizing the geometrical connectivity and hydraulic conductivity as well as their interrelationships in such strongly heterogeneous multicomponent systems in this paper we propose an analytical formulation to characterize the connectivity of discrete fracture cave networks building upon the excluded area concept of the percolation theory by implementing a state of the art computational model solving coupled navier stokes free flow and darcy porous media flow equations we numerically derive the permeability of a fractured and karstified porous media such that the relationship between the connectivity and permeability is further explored the high fidelity numerical model also permits us to elucidate the process of flow channelization within the fracture cave network the results show that the fracture cave network connectivity correlates to the permeability via a power law scaling for connected systems significant flow channeling occurs around the percolation threshold where the flow is dominated by a limited number of preferential pathways caves play a crucial role in the flow due to the fact that caves could globally enhance the network connectivity and locally serve as hotspots for high fluid velocity finally a semi analytical permeability model for fractured karst reservoirs is developed the results of our research and insights obtained have important implications for understanding the subsurface fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs keywords fractured karst reservoir discrete fracture cave network connectivity channelization permeability 1 introduction carbonate reservoirs as an important source for storing hydrocarbon and water contribute to about 60 and 25 of the world s hydrocarbon reserves and drinking water supply respectively al anzi et al 2003 ford and williams 1989 yao and huang 2017 they are commonly characterized by multiscale heterogeneities involving tectonic fractures and dissolution caves fig 1 loucks 1999 lyu et al 2017 smosna et al 2005 caves usually develop and connect with each other through fractures resulting in considerable porosity and permeability arbogast and lehr 2006 gulbransen et al 2010 huang et al 2011 as a result the fracture cave networks embedded in the low permeability rock matrix often serve as the major pathways for fluid flow and solute transport in karst reservoirs liu et al 2020 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 2016 while flow channelization occurs in a few major channels kossack et al 2001 liu et al 2020 lucia 2007 thus the fracture cave networks constitute the essential components that dominate both the permeability and flow structures in karst systems several theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to characterize the permeability of karst reservoirs in terms of porosity generally speaking three permeability prediction methods are used including the rock fabric petrophysical classification method lucia 2007 the percolation theory based method sahini and sahimi 2003 and the kozeny carman method carman 1956 however for fractured reservoirs fractures play an important role in fluid flow such that the actual permeability can be well beyond what would be expected from the conventional porosity based permeability prediction models lucia 1995 lucia 1983 illustrated this fact by comparing a plot of fracture porosity fracture permeability to three typical reservoir porosity permeability relationships see fig 2 it can be seen that the permeability of fractured karst reservoirs is much more sensitive to the changes in fracture porosity than those in reservoir porosity suggesting that the conventional porosity permeability models are prone to give biased results on the other hand over the past decades many theoretical and numerical investigations have indicated that the geometrical connectivity of fracture networks usually governs the bulk permeability and flow structures in fractured geological media berkowitz 1995 bour and davy 1997 1998 de dreuzy et al 2001a hestir and long 1990 lei et al 2017 liu et al 2016 the effects of fracture distributions with respect to the spatial organization density orientation and length on the fracture network connectivity and rock mass hydraulic properties have been extensively studied darcel et al 2003b davy et al 2010 de dreuzy et al 2001a 2001b 2012 erhel et al 2009 hyman 2020 margolin et al 1998 however for fractured karst reservoirs it is still poorly understood how the coexistence of factures and caves affects the bulk properties of the system including connectivity and permeability in this study we investigate this problem through a combined theoretical and numerical study of two dimensional 2d discrete fracture cave networks in our numerical simulation fluid flow through natural fractures and porous matrix is modeled based on darcy s law while the free flow in caves is computed by solving navier stokes equations the coupling between free flow and fractured porous media flow is achieved by applying the beavers joseph saffman bjs boundary conditions at the interface we propose an analytical expression of percolation parameter to characterize the connectivity of fracture cave networks on this basis we develop a semi analytical model for describing the permeability connectivity relationship the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the methods for discrete fracture cave network generation percolation parameter calculation and fluid flow simulation are elucidated in section 3 the model setup for simulating fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs is described this is followed by the presentation and analysis of simulation results in section 4 further discussion and conclusions are given in section 5 in addition appendices are provided at the end of this article to present more details about a demonstration of our model and the derivation of the semi analytical permeability model 2 methodology 2 1 fracture cave network representation in this study fractures and caves are geometrically conceptualized as linear bour and davy 1997 darcel et al 2003b and elliptical popov et al 2009a 2009b elements respectively in 2d space natural fracture cave systems often exhibit a broad spectrum of structural sizes i e fracture length and cave maximum axis length which may be described by power laws with the probability density functions n l f and n l c respectively given as bonnet et al 2001 bour and davy 1999 curl 1986 lei and wang 2016 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 1 n l f α f l f a f for l f l f min l f max 2 n l c α c l c a c for l c l c min l c max where l is the fracture length or cave maximum axis length α is the density term and a is the power law exponent the subscripts f and c denote fractures and caves respectively the only intrinsic characteristic length scales are the smallest and largest fracture or cave sizes i e l f min and l f max or l c min and l c max respectively extensive field observations suggest that a falls within 1 5 3 0 for fractures renshaw 1999 and 2 2 2 6 for caves curl 1986 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 the fracture porosity φf defined as the total area of fractures per unit area is related to the first moment of the density function of fracture lengths as lei et al 2020 ran et al 2014 3 φ f a f l 2 b f l 2 n l f l f d l f where a f is the total area of fractures length aperture within a square domain of area l 2 b f is the fracture aperture and l f is the fracture length the cave porosity φc i e total area of caves per unit area is defined as lin et al 2020 yao and huang 2017 4 φ c a c l 2 1 l 2 i 1 2 n c π n l c i l c i 2 η where a c is the total area of caves η is the length ratio between the major and minor axes is the union operator and n c is the total number of caves 2 2 percolation parameter of fracture cave networks it is widely known that the emergence of percolating clusters in fracture networks is closely related to the average intersections per fracture which can be used as the percolation parameter χ f to characterize the fracture network connectivity berkowitz 1995 bour and davy 1997 1998 hestir and long 1990 correspondingly the average excluded area is an effective measure of the average fracture intersections where the excluded area quantifies the potential for two objects to overlap in the system balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 for 2d fracture networks the excluded area of a fracture can be defined as the area around an existing fracture into which the center of another fracture is not allowed to enter if overlapping of the two fractures is forbidden balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 with more fractures included in a system of a finite domain area i e the excluded area of involved fractures increases the connection probability between these fractures and thus the percolation probability of the system enlarges the average excluded area of a fracture network is defined as the summation of excluded areas for all included structures i e all fractures averaged by the area of the finite sized model domain therefore the percolation parameter χ f i e the average excluded area as a connectivity metric for fracture networks with a power law length distribution is given as balberg et al 1984 bour and davy 1997 5 χ f n l f a ex f l 2 d l f 2 π n l f l f 2 l 2 d l f where a ex f is the excluded area for fractures of length l f and equals to 2l f 2 π balberg et al 1984 bour and davy 1997 the square length i e l f 2 gives more weight to larger fractures suggesting that larger fractures contribute more to the percolation parameter of fracture networks compared to shorter ones bour and davy 1997 the fracture system transitions from a disconnected state to a connected one as χ f exceeds the so called percolation threshold χ cr which has a value around 3 2 4 5 balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 based on the above derivation of the percolation parameter for a fracture network we speculate that the percolation parameter χ of a fracture cave network may also be related to its corresponding average excluded area that is the summation of excluded areas for all structures i e fractures and caves divided by the domain area therefore the percolation parameter χ of a fracture cave network contributed by all fractures and caves may be written as 6 χ n l a ex l 2 d l n l f a ex f l 2 d l f n l c a ex c l 2 d l c where a ex c is the excluded area of a cave here we name the first and the second term of the right hand side of eq 6 as χ f and χ c respectively these two parameters indicate the contributions of fractures and caves to the percolation parameter of a fracture cave system according to previous studies mack 1954 mack and bartlett 1956 torquato and jiao 2013 we use a common definition of excluded area for 2d convex structures i e a ex 2a c 2 2π where a and c are respectively the area and perimeter of each structure consequently the percolation parameter χ of a fracture cave network is written as 7 χ χ f χ c n l f 2 a f c f 2 2 π l 2 d l f n l c 2 a c c c 2 2 π l 2 d l c if the system consists of fractures only eq 7 can be reduced to eq 5 where the approximate value of fracture area and perimeter are zero and 2l f respectively fracture length l f in 2d fracture cave networks should contain those parts within caves because the excluded area of an object used to calculate χ is determined by its own geometrical attributes regardless of the truncation by other objects in the system balberg et al 1984 2 3 fluid flow in fracture cave systems we model fluid flow in discrete fracture cave systems by simultaneously solving both fractured porous media flow and free flow as well as their coupling at the interface darcy s law is used to model the laminar flow in both fracture networks and the porous matrix while navier stokes equations describe the free flow in the cave space the beavers joseph saffman bjs boundary conditions are used to couple the flow at the interface of the free and fractured porous domains the equations of coupled systems are solved using a finite element method huang et al 2011 yao et al 2010 we introduce the following dimensionless variables cimolin and discacciati 2013 x x l u u u p p ρ u 2 k k k m and dimensionless groups re ρ u l μ dp ρ k m u μ l db β l τ k m τ where u is the characteristic velocity at re 1 x is the length u is the flow velocity p is the pressure ρ is the fluid density k is the permeability including the matrix permeability k m and fracture permeability k f b f 2 12 μ is the fluid viscosity β is the resistance coefficient re and dp compare the inertial and viscous forces for the free flow and porous media flow respectively db describes the drag force at the interface between the porous media and caves τ is the unit tangential vector for the free flow navier stokes equations describing the single phase steady state flow of an incompressible fluid are given as 8 u c u c p c i 1 re u c t u c 0 9 u c 0 for the single phase steady state fluid flow in fractured porous media the continuity and momentum equations can be reduced as 10 dp k p f m 0 where the subscript fm denotes the mixture of fractures and matrix according to the conservation of mass and momentum beavers joseph saffman boundary conditions beavers and joseph 1967 jones 1973 saffman 1971 are imposed to couple the flow at the interface between the free and fractured porous domains 11 u f m n u c n n 1 r e u c t u c n p c p f m n u c t u c τ d b k u c u f m τ where n is the unit normal vector 2 4 characterization of hydraulic properties to quantify the role of fractures and caves in the hydraulic behavior of fractured karst systems we compute five sets of network scale metrics defined as follows 1 we take a frequency number i e n p 0 5 to measure the percolation threshold of fracture cave networks i e χ cr colecchio et al 2021 harter 2005 n p evaluates the frequency of occurrence for percolation where n p 0 5 means half of the stochastic realizations with the same combination of geometrical parameters i e a f φf a c φc and η in this study are connected a realization is considered as connected only if at least one spanning flow paths of large velocity exist since the flow rate in disconnected systems is extremely low due to the low permeability matrix as illustrated in section 4 3 the determination of such large velocity flow channels is based on the fluid velocity pattern figs s12 s16 in the supplementary material and fig 11 2 the second metric is the equivalent permeability k eq of fractured karstified porous media it measures the overall flow capacity of the system and is obtained by inverting darcy s law lang et al 2014 renard and de marsily 1997 12 k e q 1 d p u p in p o u t where u is the average dimensionless velocity at the outlet p in and p out are the dimensionless pressures at the inlet and outlet respectively 1 we also use two parameters χ c χ and k eq k f to analyze the contribution of caves to the connectivity and permeability of fractured karst reservoirs χ c χ is the ratio of connectivity contributed by caves χ c to that by both fractures and caves χ while k eq k f is the ratio of the equivalent permeability of fractured karstified systems k eq to that of pure fracture systems k f larger values of χ c χ and k eq k f mean that caves contribute more to the connectivity and permeability respectively 2 the fourth metric is the correlation dimension of the flow rate field d 2 it quantifies how the flow is spatially organized in the fracture cave networks bruderer weng et al 2004 jiang et al 2019 maillot et al 2016 wang et al 2017 and is calculated as bonnet et al 2001 cowie et al 1995 13 d 2 lim r 0 log k 1 m p k 2 log r where p k is the proportion of flow within an elementary area to the cumulative amount of flow in the entire domain and r is the ratio of the grid size to the domain size in this work we use a 30 by 30 square grid to calculate d 2 and thus r equals to 1 30 when d 2 2 the fluid flow is uniform over the 2d space while a smaller d 2 indicates a more localized flow field 1 the last metric is the ratio of the flow correlation dimension of the fractured karstified systems d 2 to that of the pure fracture systems d 2f it is used to investigate the role of cave porosity in flow channeling if d 2 d 2f 1 the flow channelization of the system is considered to be enhanced by caves otherwise if d 2 d 2f 1 the flow channelization is weakened by caves 3 model setup in this study we generate a series of 2d synthetic fracture cave networks in a square domain of size l fig 3 figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material we focus on the role of the fracture and cave size distributions only so the location and orientation of fractures and caves are assumed to be randomly distributed the effects of the fractal spatial distribution and anisotropic orientation distribution of fractures caves are beyond the current scope we first generate pure fracture networks and pure cave networks according to their geometrical statistics and then superimpose a fracture network and a cave network to create a fracture cave network table 1 summarizes the network parameters and the number of realizations the fracture length l f follows the power law distribution with the upper and lower bounds given by l f min l 50 and l f max 50 l respectively we investigate four fracture length exponent cases a f 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 and five fracture porosity scenarios φf 1 10 4 2 10 4 3 10 4 4 10 4 and 5 10 4 for each combination of a f and φf ten realizations are generated with the χ f value also derived therefore there are 200 pure fracture networks we consider two scenarios of cave geometries isotropy with η 1 or anisotropy with η 1 10 the major axis of caves obeys a power law bounded by l c min l 25 and l c max l 5 we consider one case of cave size exponent a c 2 4 considering its narrow range of 2 2 2 6 and four cave porosities φc 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 as a result 8 cave networks are created eventually 200 pure fracture networks and 1600 fracture cave networks i e in total 1800 networks are generated in our study the fracture cave networks investigated here include regimes below around and beyond the percolation threshold corresponding to disconnected transitional and connected systems respectively figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material fig 3 shows some typical examples of the generated fracture cave networks when a f is large the system is controlled by small sized fractures l f l as a f decreases the system becomes more dominated by large fractures with l f comparable to l the values of dimensionless parameters are taken as re 1 dp 2 5 10 21 db 2 1010 β 1 0 b f l 5 10 6 and k f k m 8 33 108 fractures and caves are orientated randomly i e nominally isotropic and the result is based on the average of ten realizations so the difference between flow along x and y direction is considered to be minor thus we compute the hydraulic properties by only exploring the case where a unit dimensionless pressure differential is imposed on the opposite boundary surfaces along the x direction and no flow conditions are applied to the remaining ones parallel to the x direction 4 results 4 1 flow characteristics in fracture cave networks to investigate the fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs we analyze the pressure and velocity distributions in the simulated fracture cave systems the fracture cave networks with a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 a c 2 4 φc 0 4 and various η e g η 1 and η 1 10 are selected to illustrate the distributions of pore pressure fig 4 and flow velocity fig 5 as shown in figs 4a and 4b the local pressure gradually decreases from the inlet to the outlet boundaries however the fluid pressure in caves remains constant without noticeable drop figs 4c and 4d this phenomenon can be clearly observed in figs a1e and a1f see appendix a it indicates that a cave acts as an equipotential body within the flow field due to the fact that the cave s permeability can be regarded as infinity popov et al 2009a therefore the infinitely permeable caves would provide obstruction free channels and reduce flow impedance of the system to facilitate the comparison flow velocity in the fracture cave networks is normalized with respect to the average flow velocity of the corresponding pure fracture network i e a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 a c 2 4 and φc 0 in this case the results show that the fluid moves much faster in fractures than that in caves and matrix figs 5a and 5b while the flow velocity in caves is higher than that in matrix figs 5c and 5d more explanations and discussions can be found in appendix a similar to fluid flow in fracture networks fractures serve as the main flow pathways of high velocity but caves play a critical role in enhancing flow velocity along fractures which will be further demonstrated in section 4 3 caves with different shapes i e η 1 and η 1 10 tend to exhibit similar flow characteristics figs 4 and 5 4 2 connectivity and equivalent permeability of fracture cave networks we investigate the relationship between the connectivity and equivalent permeability of fractured karst reservoirs based on direct numerical simulation and then try to identify the percolation threshold for fracture cave systems fig 6 shows the fraction of percolating realizations n p as a function of the percolation parameter χ it can be seen that n p increases considerably from 0 to 1 if χ gets close to the percolation threshold χ cr we determine the range of χ cr according to the intersection of the n p versus χ curve with the horizontal gray line n p 0 5 such that 3 28 χ cr 4 45 fig 7 shows the relationship between the equivalent permeability k eq and the percolation parameter χ of fracture cave systems for various values of a f φf φc and η each data point on this graph represents the average of ten realizations and the size of error bars ζ denotes 1 standard deviation the equivalent permeability k eq shows a strong correlation with the percolation parameter χ we characterize their correlation based on three different regimes a disconnected regime with χ χ cr a transitional regime with χ χ cr and a connected regime with χ χ cr if χ χ cr k eq is very small since the flow is controlled by the low permeability matrix if χ χ cr an abrupt increase in k eq over 3 4 orders of magnitude occurs indicating that the system transitions from a disconnected to a connected state if χ χ cr the network becomes well connected with large k eq we further evaluate the spread of k eq by analyzing the variation of the standard deviation ζ as a function of different geometrical parameters e g a f φf φc η and χ of fracture cave systems in fig 8 a the standard deviation ζ is large when χ approaches χ cr i e χ χ cr since percolating and non percolating realizations coexist for the same combination of network parameters as displayed in figs 8b and 8c if large or dense fractures prevail e g a f 1 5 or φf 5 10 4 the system is in general well connected with small fluctuation in permeability on the contrary if small or sparse fractures dominate e g a f 3 0 or φf 1 10 4 profound permeability fluctuations are observed exhibiting percolation like behavior ζ does not show a clear relationship with the cave porosity φc and the aspect ratio η figs 8d and 8e in fig 9 we analyze the contribution of caves to the connectivity and permeability of fractured karst reservoirs based on χ c χ and k eq k f we plot the variation of these two parameters against different geometrical properties i e a f φf φc η and χ generally χ is more ruled by χ f as indicated by the large variation of χ f compared to the narrow range of χ c see figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material χ c χ decreases with the increase of χ and the ratio is mostly less than 0 4 unless χ χ cr fig 9a the spread of χ c χ exposes a weak correlation with η but depends mostly on a f φf and φc generally increasing with the increment of a f and φc figs 9c and 9g and the reduction of φf fig 9e it can be seen that fig 9b when χ χ cr and χ χ cr the increment of permeability due to the existence of caves is limited within one order of magnitude furthermore when χ 4 45 i e upper bound of χ cr the permeability tends to increase with φc however for χ χ cr the permeability grows substantially up to 4 orders of magnitude since the fracture cave network is connected but the corresponding pure fracture network with all caves removed is disconnected this means that the presence of caves makes the system become connected with the increase of a f and φc the variation range of k eq k f generally increases figs 9d and 9h k eq k f is insensitive to η while it first increases and then decreases with an enlarged φf fig 9f this suggests that caves tend to play a critical role in transitioning the system from a disconnected to a connected state especially if small fractures and a large number of caves prevail 4 3 flow channeling in fracture cave networks we further analyze the flow channeling characteristics in fractured karst reservoirs associated with different combinations of fracture length exponent a f fracture porosity φf cave aspect ratio η and cave porosity φc the numerical results for the cases of φf 3 10 4 as given in figs 10 and 12 are taken as examples to elucidate the channelization phenomenon while the results for other cases of φf 1 10 4 2 10 4 4 10 4 5 10 4 are given in figs s4 s11 see the supplementary material fig 10 shows the distribution of pore pressure in the fractured karst reservoirs with φf 3 10 4 and different a f φc and η values it exhibits a heterogeneous pattern and the pressure decreases from the inlet to outlet boundaries along with the existence of local pressure perturbation influenced by the spatial organization of fractures and caves in addition we can find the pressure in caves tends to maintain a constant level indicating that the fluid flow through caves with almost no pressure drop consistent with our observations in section 4 1 it seems that the pressure distribution in the fractured karst media is strongly controlled by the network connectivity for a well connected system with χ χ cr e g a f 1 5 and 2 0 the pressure distribution is spatially homogenous while for a poorly connected system e g a f 2 5 it displays a strong heterogeneity over the space in fig 11 we show the fracture velocity distributions for different fracture cave networks if the fracture system is disconnected with χ χ cr e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 η 1 10 and φc 0 the flow rate in all fractures is almost 0 as φc increases noticeable flow rate is accommodated within the system that transitions from a non percolated to a percolated state e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 η 1 10 and φc 0 2 if the fracture system is well connected with χ χ cr e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 5 10 4 and φc 0 the flow velocity of each fracture is small as φc increases the flow rate enhances several times e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 5 10 4 and φc 0 4 these phenomena may be attributed to two main factors one is that the cave intensifies the network connectivity and the network shifts from a disconnected regime to a connected one the other is that the obstruction free cave diminishes the flow resistance and enhances the flow velocity within the network fig 12 shows the distribution of flow velocity in fracture cave networks with φf 3 10 4 and different a f φc and η values to facilitate the comparison and analysis velocities are normalized by the average velocity of the respective pure fracture network a network with no caves but the same fracture population in the networks that are below the percolation threshold with χ χ cr e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 φc 0 the pathways with relatively high flow rates are disconnected and thus fluid has to pass through the low permeability matrix that bridges disconnected structures e g fractures and caves so that the flow velocity is very low fig 11 if more caves are present i e φc increases the system starts to reach the percolation threshold i e χ χ cr such that some occasionally connected flow paths emerge with significantly high flow velocity e g the networks with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 φc 0 2 and η 1 10 in figs 11a and 12a in the meantime the disconnected fractures and dead end fractures have much lower velocities when the percolation parameter χ further enlarges to have χ 4 45 e g a f 2 5 φf 3 10 4 and φc 0 in fig 12a multiple pathways connecting the inlet and outlet boundaries appear and exhibit high flow rates with the increase of the cave porosity φc the network connectivity χ increases leading to more flow paths to appear and the flow rates within these paths tend to have a similar magnitude this indicates that the flow is structurally controlled by the network connectivity when χ is small in the fracture network that is much beyond the percolation threshold with χ 10 e g a f 1 5 2 0 φf 3 10 4 and φc 0 in fig 12a numerous flow paths emerge and flow rates are homogeneously distributed across the system as caves are introduced the number of new flow paths remains almost unchanged due to the limited connectivity increment but the flow field within the network becomes heterogeneous due to the local obstruction free caves intersecting with some fractures e g a f 1 5 2 0 φf 3 10 4 and φc 0 4 in fig 12a we further systematically analyze the effect of the network connectivity χ on the flow channelization in fractured karst reservoirs based on the flow channeling metric i e the correlation dimension of the flow field d 2 in fig 13 a we can see that with the increase of χ d 2 first decreases and then increases approaching lowest at the percolation threshold χ cr for the poorly connected fracture cave network χ 0 81 d 2 is close to 2 figs 13a when the network connectivity χ increases and reaches around χ cr d 2 decreases to its lowest value around 1 3 fig 13a several percolated channels span the system with high flow rates but the flow rates are extremely low for rest structures in the system e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 φc 0 2 and η 1 10 in fig 12 as χ further increases and becomes greater than χ cr d 2 increases fig 13a and more preferential flow paths with high flow rate show up fig 12 particularly for the networks with χ χ cr d 2 is near 2 fig 13a in addition we investigate the influence of caves on the flow channeling based on d 2 d 2f as shown in fig 13b the caves would strongly affect the degree of flow channelization exhibiting either a positive or a negative influence depending on the network connectivity for χ χ cr or χ 10 i e the system is either disconnected or well connected d 2 d 2f 1 fig 13b and d 2 gradually decreases with φc e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 1 10 4 and a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 in fig 13c it indicates that a stronger flow channeling occurs with the inclusion of caves where the corresponding flow velocity field gradually develops into a more heterogeneous pattern e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 1 10 4 in fig s8 also the network with a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 in fig s11 of the supplementary material on the other hand for χ cr χ 10 d 2 d 2f 1 fig 13b and d 2 gently increases with φc e g the network with a f 2 5 φf 3 10 4 in fig 13c it indicates that introducing caves into these systems leads to a reduced degree of flow channeling where more preferential flow pathways appear and tend to exhibit similar flow rates e g the network with a f 2 5 φf 3 10 4 in fig 12 4 4 a semi analytical equivalent permeability prediction model in the context of the percolation theory we further analyze the equivalent permeability k eq as a function of χ χ cr fig 14 in this study we take a mean value of χ cr 3 57 for the fracture cave system to derive the equivalent permeability prediction model its rationality is illustrated as follows first regarding a network with a small a f e g a f 1 5 it always has large fractures much larger than the system size i e without χ χ cr bour and davy 1997 in addition considering the relatively small range of χ cr and the difficulty to compute χ cr for systems with different combinations of geometrical parameters one may indeed treat χ cr as a constant as a first approximation such a mean value of χ cr 3 57 has been typically adopted for fracture networks in the literature balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 bour and davy 1997 and its suitability has also been examined in the literature bour and davy 1997 fig 14a shows that k eq varies with χ χ cr following a dual power law i e k eq χ χ cr ξ with ξ 2 0 for χ around χ cr i e χ χ cr 2 and ξ 1 0 for χ much larger than χ cr i e χ χ cr 2 we suspect that the steeper scaling regime i e ξ 2 0 is caused by the co existence of connected and disconnected realizations nearby χ cr 3 57 leading to the strong fluctuation in k eq and reduction of the averaged k eq thus we remove the disconnected realizations and replot the data inset of fig 14a then the relationship between k eq and χ χ cr globally follows a linear correlation as k eq χ χ cr 1 when it comes to the local scaling of k eq χ χ cr ξ it is found that ξ 1 3 for a f 3 0 and ξ 1 0 for a f 1 5 i e ξ drops from 1 3 to 1 0 with the decrease of a f from 3 0 to 1 5 we further develop a semi analytical solution the detailed derivation is given in appendix b to the permeability of fracture cave networks as 14 k e q ω k cr γ φ c e a f χ χ cr where k cr λb f 3 12lk m is the permeability of fracture networks when χ approaches χ cr from above with λ 3 being the number of critical red links lei et al 2020 ω and γ are constants in fig 14b the normalized permeability of all fracture cave networks are plotted against χ χ cr fitting a least squares curve in the form of eq 14 to the dataset we find ω 0 087 and γ 14 it can be seen from fig 14b that our semi analytical permeability formulation gives an excellent match to the numerical data the coefficient of determination r 2 0 98 5 discussion and conclusion in this paper we carried out a combined theoretical and numerical investigation of three key scientific questions regarding fractured karst reservoirs i how can we quantify the connectivity of fracture cave networks ii how does the geometry of fracture cave networks impact the flow structure iii what s the relationship between the permeability and connectivity of the system these issues are fundamentally important for understanding the fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs we derived a new analytical expression for the percolation parameter stemming from the excluded area method and demonstrated that it is a good proxy to the connectivity of fracture cave networks the fracture cave system transitions from a disconnected state to a connected regime when the percolation parameter progressively increases and exceeds the percolation threshold of 3 28 χ cr 4 45 it exhibits a good agreement with that of 3 2 4 5 for a system with monodisperse objects e g pure fracture networks balberg 1985 a sharp increase around 3 4 orders of magnitude with a large fluctuation of permeability occurs in the system around the percolation threshold i e χ χ cr as expected from the percolation theory masihi et al 2007 mourzenko et al 2011 stauffer and aharony 2018 our research extends the applicability of the excluded area method to multi component systems of complex geometries involving elements of different shapes which goes beyond previous modeling work applied for systems of simple geometries consisting of elements of a single shape bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001a xu and jiao 2019 based on our numerical results in section 4 we discovered that the geometrical connectivity of fracture cave networks serves as a key parameter that determines the degree of flow channeling in fractured karst reservoirs we adopted a quantitative metric i e the correlation dimension of the flow field d 2 to evaluate the flow channelization phenomenon the most profound region where preferential flows occur is around the percolation threshold i e χ χ cr where limited percolating paths carrying high flow rates are identified the changes in the percolation parameter χ influence which fractures and caves are included in the subnetwork connecting flow boundaries and accessible to fluid flow especially as the percolation parameter χ is far away from the percolation threshold χ cr i e the poorly connected χ χ cr or well developed χ χ cr fracture cave networks it indicates almost no highly permeable structures or large amount of flow channels are contained such that the flow field is quite homogeneous in addition we reported that the network connectivity also stands for an excellent metric to evaluate the permeability of fractured karst reservoirs a power law scaling relationship between k eq and χ χ cr for connected fracture cave systems is characterized by an exponent ξ 1 3 for systems ruled by small fractures i e a f 3 0 and ξ 1 0 for systems ruled by large fractures i e a f 1 5 corresponding well to the values suggested by the percolation theory stauffer and aharony 2018 and snow s model snow 1969 respectively when a f varies from 1 5 to 3 0 i e the connectivity is ruled by both small and large fractures ξ varies from 1 0 to 1 3 because the system becomes more dominated by small fractures the semi analytical permeability formulation developed in this study shows an excellent match to the results of direct numerical simulations our proposed method seems to be a promising alternative to other conventional models such as the rock fabric petrophysical classification method lucia 2007 the conventional percolation theory for porous media sahini and sahimi 2003 and the kozeny carman equation carman 1956 most of which predict lower permeability than expected if fractures are well connected in the systems lucia 2007 as compared to pure fracture networks caves play a critical role in affecting the hydraulic permeability and flow channelization in fracture cave networks the impacts of caves exerting on flow channeling in fractured karst reservoirs are classified into two categories i the caves enlarge the global network connectivity and ii they enhance the local fluid velocity if the percolation parameter χ is small e g χ 10 the variation of flow channelization is dominated by the cave enlarged network connectivity the degree of flow channeling first increases due to the cave increased connectivity χ close to χ cr where strong flow channelization occurs then decreases with the enlarged connectivity χ away from χ cr where flow field exhibits homogeneity if the percolation parameter χ is large e g χ 10 where the caves contribute little to the network connectivity the evolution of flow channelization is controlled by the cave enhanced fluid velocity that is the degree of flow channeling again increases with the inclusion of caves at this point the flow is primarily prevailed by the variations in the local hydrological properties instead of the structure of the networks besides the cave tends to play a non trivial role in enhancing the equivalent permeability if the system is close to the percolation threshold on the contrary it has less impacts in highly disconnected or well connected scenarios this is understandable because when the fracture cave network is not percolated i e χ χ cr the system has a series flow structure i e separated fractures and caves are linked by matrix such that the equivalent permeability is approximated by the harmonic mean of the permeability of different elements de marsily 1986 and more dominated by the low permeability matrix as for the well connected network i e χ χ cr the system has a parallel flow structure which consists of multiple traversing channels i e pure fracture pathways or mixed fracture cave passages the permeability is approximated by the arithmetic mean de marsily 1986 and thus controlled by the high permeability of fracture or fracture cave channels each individual channel is then ruled by the permeability of fractures which either form a percolating path directly or via linking caves as the system gradually approaches the percolation threshold from below i e χ χ cr resulting from the increment of cave porosity the system changes from a non percolating to a percolating regime with the permeability increasing over 3 4 orders of magnitude the transitional regime of fracture cave system i e χ χ cr is commonly observed in the field of hydrocarbon production from carbonate reservoirs that only a narrow swept volume and small fraction of recovery 14 4 is obtained li 2017 li et al 2018 suggesting that the effect of caves on fluid flow through fractured karst reservoirs is vital we are aware that assigning the same aperture to all fractures is highly idealized since nature fracture networks may involve a very broad range of variable apertures which tend to correlate with fracture lengths baghbanan and jing 2007 de dreuzy et al 2001b 2012 therefore we further conduct a preliminary investigation on the influence of variable fracture aperture on the equivalent permeability flow structures and flow channelization in fracture cave systems we also discuss the relative change for the influence of caves if considering variable fracture aperture the fracture aperture is correlated with fracture length by a power law function i e b f ηl f θ baghbanan and jing 2007 where θ varies between 0 5 and 2 0 here we adopt θ 0 5 which represents a sub linear aperture length scaling olson 2003 as to the case with correlated fracture length and aperture we keep its mean aperture equal to that of the constant fracture aperture scenario in addition we investigate the scenario with uncorrelated fracture aperture and length where the distribution of fracture apertures is kept the same as the correlated one but apertures are randomly assigned to fractures the fracture network with a f 2 0 and φf 3 10 4 and the fracture cave network with a f 2 0 φf 3 10 4 η 1 10 and φc 0 4 are selected to conduct the preliminary analysis the fracture aperture distributions of the constant correlated and uncorrelated scenarios are presented in fig s17 the results show that as to fracture networks k eq is largest for the correlated case but lowest for the uncorrelated one fig s18a with the inclusion of caves k eq for all scenarios increases fig s18a where its relative change i e k eq k f is most significant for the uncorrelated scheme but its absolute variation i e k eq k f is largest for the correlated one as to the influence of variable fracture aperture on the flow channelization the localized flow is most profound in the correlated network fig s18b where several flow paths carrying high flow rates exist fig s19a while for the constant and uncorrelated networks d 2 is relatively large fig s18b and the fluid flow seems to be homogeneous fig s19a when caves are taken into account the preferential flow is enhanced for all networks figs s18b and s19b but it becomes most significant i e d 2 d f is smallest in the correlated system figs s18b and s19b since the obstruction free cave enlarges flow rate greater along the fracture with wider aperture than that with smaller one as evidenced by the fact that k eq k f is hugest for the correlated one in fig s18a these results show that the distribution of variable fracture apertures could have strong impact on the fluid flow through fractured karst geological media therefore further works are planned to more comprehensively investigate such effects however the model developed in the current paper provides a good basis for further exploring additional factors such as variable initial fracture apertures kang et al 2019 fractal spatial organizations darcel et al 2003a davy et al 2010 anisotropic orientations lei et al 2014 as well as 3d systems de dreuzy et al 2012 hyman 2020 our current work may be extrapolated to 3d real fracture cave networks from the following two perspectives first the 2d simulation results may be relevant to some 3d geological systems that have longitudinal dimensions of characteristic scale that are much larger than the transversal ones e g joint networks in sedimentary layered rocks second the expression of the proposed percolation parameter for 2d systems can also be extended for 3d real fracture cave networks with the replacement of a ex 2a c 2 2π in eq 7 with vex 2 v sr where v s and r are respectively the volume surface area and mean curvature radius of the structure torquato and jiao 2013 to conclude we investigated how the geometrical attributes of fracture cave networks affect the connectivity permeability and flow channelization of fractured karst reservoirs we developed and verified a new analytical expression of the percolation parameter related to the length of fractures and the area and perimeter of caves to determine the connectivity of fracture cave systems with a broad size distribution flow channeling is primarily dominated by the network connectivity and strongly influenced by the cave porosity the equivalent permeability of connected networks shows a power law relationship with the connectivity i e χ χ cr characterized by an exponent of 1 0 1 3 we further developed a semi analytical solution to the equivalent permeability which shows a good consistency with our numerical simulations of coupled porous media and free flow the methods and observations presented in this paper have important implications for characterizing the geometrical and hydraulic properties of fractured karst reservoirs involved in many geoengineering activities such as hydrocarbon production and groundwater extraction in karstified

demonstrate our flow simulation based on an ideal fracture cave network with a persistent fracture horizontally placed across the domain of size l and a circular cave located at the center of the domain fig a1 a the cave diameter is l c l 5 and the fracture length is l f l the values of dimensionless parameters are taken as re 1 dp 2 5 10 21 db 2 1010 β 1 0 b f l 5 10 6 and k f k m 8 33 108 we investigate the flow velocity distribution in fractured karstified reservoirs by applying a unit dimensionless pressure differential on the opposite boundary surfaces along the horizontal direction i e x direction with no flow conditions on the remaining ones parallel to the flow direction since fluid velocity in the low permeability matrix is very slow the fluid flow mainly occurs along the preexisting fracture and cave therefore the flow flux q along the fracture and cave are almost the same at steady state according to q av where a and v are cross section area and flow velocity of the structural element i e fracture and cave and the cross section area of cave is much larger than fracture we would expect that the fluid flow along the fracture is much higher than that within the cave figs a1b and a1c in addition we can find the velocity at the fracture cave intersections is higher than that inside the cave figs a1b and a1c while the velocity is greater at the cave center than that at the cave boundaries perpendicular to the flow direction fig a1d as to the pore pressure within the network and in the fracture and cave along the middle horizontal line it is obviously observed

192,fractured karst reservoirs play a significant role in hydrocarbon reserves and groundwater storage they often exhibit complex multiscale heterogeneities involving pores fractures and caves whose length scales range from microns to tens or hundreds of meters thus the study of fractured karst reservoirs is faced with a significant unresolved challenge in quantitatively characterizing the geometrical connectivity and hydraulic conductivity as well as their interrelationships in such strongly heterogeneous multicomponent systems in this paper we propose an analytical formulation to characterize the connectivity of discrete fracture cave networks building upon the excluded area concept of the percolation theory by implementing a state of the art computational model solving coupled navier stokes free flow and darcy porous media flow equations we numerically derive the permeability of a fractured and karstified porous media such that the relationship between the connectivity and permeability is further explored the high fidelity numerical model also permits us to elucidate the process of flow channelization within the fracture cave network the results show that the fracture cave network connectivity correlates to the permeability via a power law scaling for connected systems significant flow channeling occurs around the percolation threshold where the flow is dominated by a limited number of preferential pathways caves play a crucial role in the flow due to the fact that caves could globally enhance the network connectivity and locally serve as hotspots for high fluid velocity finally a semi analytical permeability model for fractured karst reservoirs is developed the results of our research and insights obtained have important implications for understanding the subsurface fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs keywords fractured karst reservoir discrete fracture cave network connectivity channelization permeability 1 introduction carbonate reservoirs as an important source for storing hydrocarbon and water contribute to about 60 and 25 of the world s hydrocarbon reserves and drinking water supply respectively al anzi et al 2003 ford and williams 1989 yao and huang 2017 they are commonly characterized by multiscale heterogeneities involving tectonic fractures and dissolution caves fig 1 loucks 1999 lyu et al 2017 smosna et al 2005 caves usually develop and connect with each other through fractures resulting in considerable porosity and permeability arbogast and lehr 2006 gulbransen et al 2010 huang et al 2011 as a result the fracture cave networks embedded in the low permeability rock matrix often serve as the major pathways for fluid flow and solute transport in karst reservoirs liu et al 2020 yan et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 2016 while flow channelization occurs in a few major channels kossack et al 2001 liu et al 2020 lucia 2007 thus the fracture cave networks constitute the essential components that dominate both the permeability and flow structures in karst systems several theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to characterize the permeability of karst reservoirs in terms of porosity generally speaking three permeability prediction methods are used including the rock fabric petrophysical classification method lucia 2007 the percolation theory based method sahini and sahimi 2003 and the kozeny carman method carman 1956 however for fractured reservoirs fractures play an important role in fluid flow such that the actual permeability can be well beyond what would be expected from the conventional porosity based permeability prediction models lucia 1995 lucia 1983 illustrated this fact by comparing a plot of fracture porosity fracture permeability to three typical reservoir porosity permeability relationships see fig 2 it can be seen that the permeability of fractured karst reservoirs is much more sensitive to the changes in fracture porosity than those in reservoir porosity suggesting that the conventional porosity permeability models are prone to give biased results on the other hand over the past decades many theoretical and numerical investigations have indicated that the geometrical connectivity of fracture networks usually governs the bulk permeability and flow structures in fractured geological media berkowitz 1995 bour and davy 1997 1998 de dreuzy et al 2001a hestir and long 1990 lei et al 2017 liu et al 2016 the effects of fracture distributions with respect to the spatial organization density orientation and length on the fracture network connectivity and rock mass hydraulic properties have been extensively studied darcel et al 2003b davy et al 2010 de dreuzy et al 2001a 2001b 2012 erhel et al 2009 hyman 2020 margolin et al 1998 however for fractured karst reservoirs it is still poorly understood how the coexistence of factures and caves affects the bulk properties of the system including connectivity and permeability in this study we investigate this problem through a combined theoretical and numerical study of two dimensional 2d discrete fracture cave networks in our numerical simulation fluid flow through natural fractures and porous matrix is modeled based on darcy s law while the free flow in caves is computed by solving navier stokes equations the coupling between free flow and fractured porous media flow is achieved by applying the beavers joseph saffman bjs boundary conditions at the interface we propose an analytical expression of percolation parameter to characterize the connectivity of fracture cave networks on this basis we develop a semi analytical model for describing the permeability connectivity relationship the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the methods for discrete fracture cave network generation percolation parameter calculation and fluid flow simulation are elucidated in section 3 the model setup for simulating fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs is described this is followed by the presentation and analysis of simulation results in section 4 further discussion and conclusions are given in section 5 in addition appendices are provided at the end of this article to present more details about a demonstration of our model and the derivation of the semi analytical permeability model 2 methodology 2 1 fracture cave network representation in this study fractures and caves are geometrically conceptualized as linear bour and davy 1997 darcel et al 2003b and elliptical popov et al 2009a 2009b elements respectively in 2d space natural fracture cave systems often exhibit a broad spectrum of structural sizes i e fracture length and cave maximum axis length which may be described by power laws with the probability density functions n l f and n l c respectively given as bonnet et al 2001 bour and davy 1999 curl 1986 lei and wang 2016 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 1 n l f α f l f a f for l f l f min l f max 2 n l c α c l c a c for l c l c min l c max where l is the fracture length or cave maximum axis length α is the density term and a is the power law exponent the subscripts f and c denote fractures and caves respectively the only intrinsic characteristic length scales are the smallest and largest fracture or cave sizes i e l f min and l f max or l c min and l c max respectively extensive field observations suggest that a falls within 1 5 3 0 for fractures renshaw 1999 and 2 2 2 6 for caves curl 1986 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 the fracture porosity φf defined as the total area of fractures per unit area is related to the first moment of the density function of fracture lengths as lei et al 2020 ran et al 2014 3 φ f a f l 2 b f l 2 n l f l f d l f where a f is the total area of fractures length aperture within a square domain of area l 2 b f is the fracture aperture and l f is the fracture length the cave porosity φc i e total area of caves per unit area is defined as lin et al 2020 yao and huang 2017 4 φ c a c l 2 1 l 2 i 1 2 n c π n l c i l c i 2 η where a c is the total area of caves η is the length ratio between the major and minor axes is the union operator and n c is the total number of caves 2 2 percolation parameter of fracture cave networks it is widely known that the emergence of percolating clusters in fracture networks is closely related to the average intersections per fracture which can be used as the percolation parameter χ f to characterize the fracture network connectivity berkowitz 1995 bour and davy 1997 1998 hestir and long 1990 correspondingly the average excluded area is an effective measure of the average fracture intersections where the excluded area quantifies the potential for two objects to overlap in the system balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 for 2d fracture networks the excluded area of a fracture can be defined as the area around an existing fracture into which the center of another fracture is not allowed to enter if overlapping of the two fractures is forbidden balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 with more fractures included in a system of a finite domain area i e the excluded area of involved fractures increases the connection probability between these fractures and thus the percolation probability of the system enlarges the average excluded area of a fracture network is defined as the summation of excluded areas for all included structures i e all fractures averaged by the area of the finite sized model domain therefore the percolation parameter χ f i e the average excluded area as a connectivity metric for fracture networks with a power law length distribution is given as balberg et al 1984 bour and davy 1997 5 χ f n l f a ex f l 2 d l f 2 π n l f l f 2 l 2 d l f where a ex f is the excluded area for fractures of length l f and equals to 2l f 2 π balberg et al 1984 bour and davy 1997 the square length i e l f 2 gives more weight to larger fractures suggesting that larger fractures contribute more to the percolation parameter of fracture networks compared to shorter ones bour and davy 1997 the fracture system transitions from a disconnected state to a connected one as χ f exceeds the so called percolation threshold χ cr which has a value around 3 2 4 5 balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 based on the above derivation of the percolation parameter for a fracture network we speculate that the percolation parameter χ of a fracture cave network may also be related to its corresponding average excluded area that is the summation of excluded areas for all structures i e fractures and caves divided by the domain area therefore the percolation parameter χ of a fracture cave network contributed by all fractures and caves may be written as 6 χ n l a ex l 2 d l n l f a ex f l 2 d l f n l c a ex c l 2 d l c where a ex c is the excluded area of a cave here we name the first and the second term of the right hand side of eq 6 as χ f and χ c respectively these two parameters indicate the contributions of fractures and caves to the percolation parameter of a fracture cave system according to previous studies mack 1954 mack and bartlett 1956 torquato and jiao 2013 we use a common definition of excluded area for 2d convex structures i e a ex 2a c 2 2π where a and c are respectively the area and perimeter of each structure consequently the percolation parameter χ of a fracture cave network is written as 7 χ χ f χ c n l f 2 a f c f 2 2 π l 2 d l f n l c 2 a c c c 2 2 π l 2 d l c if the system consists of fractures only eq 7 can be reduced to eq 5 where the approximate value of fracture area and perimeter are zero and 2l f respectively fracture length l f in 2d fracture cave networks should contain those parts within caves because the excluded area of an object used to calculate χ is determined by its own geometrical attributes regardless of the truncation by other objects in the system balberg et al 1984 2 3 fluid flow in fracture cave systems we model fluid flow in discrete fracture cave systems by simultaneously solving both fractured porous media flow and free flow as well as their coupling at the interface darcy s law is used to model the laminar flow in both fracture networks and the porous matrix while navier stokes equations describe the free flow in the cave space the beavers joseph saffman bjs boundary conditions are used to couple the flow at the interface of the free and fractured porous domains the equations of coupled systems are solved using a finite element method huang et al 2011 yao et al 2010 we introduce the following dimensionless variables cimolin and discacciati 2013 x x l u u u p p ρ u 2 k k k m and dimensionless groups re ρ u l μ dp ρ k m u μ l db β l τ k m τ where u is the characteristic

characterization of hydraulic properties to quantify the role of fractures and caves in the hydraulic behavior of fractured karst systems we compute five sets of network scale metrics defined as follows 1 we take a frequency number i e n p 0 5 to measure the percolation threshold of fracture cave networks i e χ cr colecchio et al 2021 harter 2005 n p evaluates the frequency of occurrence for percolation where n p 0 5 means half of the stochastic realizations with the same combination of geometrical parameters i e a f φf a c φc and η in this study are connected a realization is considered as connected only if at least one spanning flow paths of large velocity exist since the flow rate in disconnected systems is extremely low due to the low permeability matrix as illustrated in section 4 3 the determination of such large velocity flow channels is based on the fluid velocity pattern figs s12 s16 in the supplementary material and fig 11 2 the second metric is the equivalent permeability k eq of fractured karstified porous media it measures the overall flow capacity of the system and is obtained by inverting darcy s law lang et al 2014 renard and de marsily 1997 12 k e q 1 d p u p in p o u t where u is the average dimensionless velocity at the outlet p in and p out are the dimensionless pressures at the inlet and outlet respectively 1 we also use two parameters χ c χ and k eq k f to analyze the contribution of caves to the connectivity and permeability of fractured karst reservoirs χ c χ is the ratio of connectivity contributed by caves χ c to that by both fractures and caves χ while k eq k f is the ratio of the equivalent permeability of fractured karstified systems k eq to that of pure fracture systems k f larger values of χ c χ and k eq k f mean that caves contribute more to the connectivity and permeability respectively 2 the fourth metric is the correlation dimension of the flow rate field d 2 it quantifies how the flow is spatially organized in the fracture cave networks bruderer weng et al 2004 jiang et al 2019 maillot et al 2016 wang et al 2017 and is calculated as bonnet et al 2001 cowie et al 1995 13 d 2 lim r 0 log k 1 m p k 2 log r where p k is the proportion of flow within an elementary area to the cumulative amount of flow in the entire domain and r is the ratio of the grid size to the domain size in this work we use a 30 by 30 square grid to calculate d 2 and thus r equals to 1 30 when d 2 2 the fluid flow is uniform over the 2d space while a smaller d 2 indicates a more localized flow field 1 the last metric is the ratio of the flow correlation dimension of the fractured karstified systems d 2 to that of the pure fracture systems d 2f it is used to investigate the role of cave porosity in flow channeling if d 2 d 2f 1 the flow channelization of the system is considered to be enhanced by caves otherwise if d 2 d 2f 1 the flow channelization is weakened by caves 3 model setup in this study we generate a series of 2d synthetic fracture cave networks in a square domain of size l fig 3 figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material we focus on the role of the fracture and cave size distributions only so the location and orientation of fractures and caves are assumed to be randomly distributed the effects of the fractal spatial distribution and anisotropic orientation distribution of fractures caves are beyond the current scope we first generate pure fracture networks and pure cave networks according to their geometrical statistics and then superimpose a fracture network and a cave network to create a fracture cave network table 1 summarizes the network parameters and the number of realizations the fracture length l f follows the power law distribution with the upper and lower bounds given by l f min l 50 and l f max 50 l respectively we investigate four fracture length exponent cases a f 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 and five fracture porosity scenarios φf 1 10 4 2 10 4 3 10 4 4 10 4 and 5 10 4 for each combination of a f and φf ten realizations are generated with the χ f value also derived therefore there are 200 pure fracture networks we consider two scenarios of cave geometries isotropy with η 1 or anisotropy with η 1 10 the major axis of caves obeys a power law bounded by l c min l 25 and l c max l 5 we consider one case of cave size exponent a c 2 4 considering its narrow range of 2 2 2 6 and four cave porosities φc 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4 as a result 8 cave networks are created eventually 200 pure fracture networks and 1600 fracture cave networks i e in total 1800 networks are generated in our study the fracture cave networks investigated here include regimes below around and beyond the percolation threshold corresponding to disconnected transitional and connected systems respectively figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material fig 3 shows some typical examples of the generated fracture cave networks when a f is large the system is controlled by small sized fractures l f l as a f decreases the system becomes more dominated by large fractures with l f comparable to l the values of dimensionless parameters are taken as re 1 dp 2 5 10 21 db 2 1010 β 1 0 b f l 5 10 6 and k f k m 8 33 108 fractures and caves are orientated randomly i e nominally isotropic and the result is based on the average of ten realizations so the difference between flow along x and y direction is considered to be minor thus we compute the hydraulic properties by only exploring the case where a unit dimensionless pressure differential is imposed on the opposite boundary surfaces along the x direction and no flow conditions are applied to the remaining ones parallel to the x direction 4 results 4 1 flow characteristics in fracture cave networks to investigate the fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs we analyze the pressure and velocity distributions in the simulated fracture cave systems the fracture cave networks with a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 a c 2 4 φc 0 4 and various η e g η 1 and η 1 10 are selected to illustrate the distributions of pore pressure fig 4 and flow velocity fig 5 as shown in figs 4a and 4b the local pressure gradually decreases from the inlet to the outlet boundaries however the fluid pressure in caves remains constant without noticeable drop figs 4c and 4d this phenomenon can be clearly observed in figs a1e and a1f see appendix a it indicates that a cave acts as an equipotential body within the flow field due to the fact that the cave s permeability can be regarded as infinity popov et al 2009a therefore the infinitely permeable caves would provide obstruction free channels and reduce flow impedance of the system to facilitate the comparison flow velocity in the fracture cave networks is normalized with respect to the average flow velocity of the corresponding pure fracture network i e a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 a c 2 4 and φc 0 in this case the results show that the fluid moves much faster in fractures than that in caves and matrix figs 5a and 5b while the flow velocity in caves is higher than that in matrix figs 5c and 5d more explanations and discussions can be found in appendix a similar to fluid flow in fracture networks fractures serve as the main flow pathways of high velocity but caves play a critical role in enhancing flow velocity along fractures which will be further demonstrated in section 4 3 caves with different shapes i e η 1 and η 1 10 tend to exhibit similar flow characteristics figs 4 and 5 4 2 connectivity and equivalent permeability of fracture cave networks we investigate the relationship between the connectivity and equivalent permeability of fractured karst reservoirs based on direct numerical simulation and then try to identify the percolation threshold for fracture cave systems fig 6 shows the fraction of percolating realizations n p as a function of the percolation parameter χ it can be seen that n p increases considerably from 0 to 1 if χ gets close to the percolation threshold χ cr we determine the range of χ cr according to the intersection of the n p versus χ curve with the horizontal gray line n p 0 5 such that 3 28 χ cr 4 45 fig 7 shows the relationship between the equivalent permeability k eq and the percolation parameter χ of fracture cave systems for various values of a f φf φc and η each data point on this graph represents the average of ten realizations and the size of error bars ζ denotes 1 standard deviation the equivalent permeability k eq shows a strong correlation with the percolation parameter χ we characterize their correlation based on three different regimes a disconnected regime with χ χ cr a transitional regime with χ χ cr and a connected regime with χ χ cr if χ χ cr k eq is very small since the flow is controlled by the low permeability matrix if χ χ cr an abrupt increase in k eq over 3 4 orders of magnitude occurs indicating that the system transitions from a disconnected to a connected state if χ χ cr the network becomes well connected with large k eq we further evaluate the spread of k eq by analyzing the variation of the standard deviation ζ as a function of different geometrical parameters e g a f φf φc η and χ of fracture cave systems in fig 8 a the standard deviation ζ is large when χ approaches χ cr i e χ χ cr since percolating and non percolating realizations coexist for the same combination of network parameters as displayed in figs 8b and 8c if large or dense fractures prevail e g a f 1 5 or φf 5 10 4 the system is in general well connected with small fluctuation in permeability on the contrary if small or sparse fractures dominate e g a f 3 0 or φf 1 10 4 profound permeability fluctuations are observed exhibiting percolation like behavior ζ does not show a clear relationship with the cave porosity φc and the aspect ratio η figs 8d and 8e in fig 9 we analyze the contribution of caves to the connectivity and permeability of fractured karst reservoirs based on χ c χ and k eq k f we plot the variation of these two parameters against different geometrical properties i e a f φf φc η and χ generally χ is more ruled by χ f as indicated by the large variation of χ f compared to the narrow range of χ c see figs s1 s3 in the supplementary material χ c χ decreases with the increase of χ and the ratio is mostly less than 0 4 unless χ χ cr fig 9a the spread of χ c χ exposes a weak correlation with η but depends mostly on a f φf and φc generally increasing with the increment of a f and φc figs 9c and 9g and the reduction of φf fig 9e it can be seen that fig 9b when χ χ cr and χ χ cr the increment of permeability due to the existence of caves is limited within one order of magnitude furthermore when χ 4 45 i e upper bound of χ cr the permeability tends to increase with φc however for χ χ cr the permeability grows substantially up to 4 orders of magnitude since the fracture cave network is connected but the corresponding pure fracture network with all caves removed is disconnected this means that the presence of caves makes the system become connected with the increase of a f and φc the variation range of k eq k f generally increases figs 9d and 9h k eq k f is insensitive to η while it first increases and then decreases with an enlarged φf fig 9f this suggests that caves tend to play a critical role in transitioning the system from a disconnected to a connected state especially if small fractures and a large number of caves prevail 4 3 flow channeling in fracture cave networks we further analyze the flow channeling characteristics in fractured karst reservoirs associated with different combinations of fracture length exponent a f fracture porosity φf cave aspect ratio η and cave porosity φc the numerical results for the cases of φf 3 10 4 as given in figs 10 and 12 are taken as examples to elucidate the channelization phenomenon while the results for other cases of φf 1 10 4 2 10 4 4 10 4 5 10 4 are given in figs s4 s11 see the supplementary material fig 10 shows the distribution of pore pressure in the fractured karst reservoirs with φf 3 10 4 and different a f φc and η values it exhibits a heterogeneous pattern and the pressure decreases from the inlet to outlet boundaries along with the existence of local pressure perturbation influenced by the spatial organization of fractures and caves in addition we can find the pressure in caves tends to maintain a constant level indicating that the fluid flow through caves with almost no pressure drop consistent with our observations in section 4 1 it seems that the pressure distribution in the fractured karst media is strongly controlled by the network connectivity for a well connected system with χ χ cr e g a f 1 5 and 2 0 the pressure distribution is spatially homogenous while for a poorly connected system e g a f 2 5 it displays a strong heterogeneity over the space in fig 11 we show the fracture velocity distributions for different fracture cave networks if the fracture system is disconnected with χ χ cr e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 η 1 10 and φc 0 the flow rate in all fractures is almost 0 as φc increases noticeable flow rate is accommodated within the system that transitions from a non percolated to a percolated state e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 η 1 10 and φc 0 2 if the fracture system is well connected with χ χ cr e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 5 10 4 and φc 0 the flow velocity of each fracture is small as φc increases the flow rate enhances several times e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 5 10 4 and φc 0 4 these phenomena may be attributed to two main factors one is that the cave intensifies the network connectivity and the network shifts from a disconnected regime to a connected one the other is that the obstruction free cave diminishes the flow resistance and enhances the flow velocity within the network fig 12 shows the distribution of flow velocity in fracture cave networks with φf 3 10 4 and different a f φc and η values to facilitate the comparison and analysis velocities are normalized by the average velocity of the respective pure fracture network a network with no caves but the same fracture population in the networks that are below the percolation threshold with χ χ cr e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 φc 0 the pathways with relatively high flow rates are disconnected and thus fluid has to pass through the low permeability matrix that bridges disconnected structures e g fractures and caves so that the flow velocity is very low fig 11 if more caves are present i e φc increases the system starts to reach the percolation threshold i e χ χ cr such that some occasionally connected flow paths emerge with significantly high flow velocity e g the networks with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 φc 0 2 and η 1 10 in figs 11a and 12a in the meantime the disconnected fractures and dead end fractures have much lower velocities when the percolation parameter χ further enlarges to have χ 4 45 e g a f 2 5 φf 3 10 4 and φc 0 in fig 12a multiple pathways connecting the inlet and outlet boundaries appear and exhibit high flow rates with the increase of the cave porosity φc the network connectivity χ increases leading to more flow paths to appear and the flow rates within these paths tend to have a similar magnitude this indicates that the flow is structurally controlled by the network connectivity when χ is small in the fracture network that is much beyond the percolation threshold with χ 10 e g a f 1 5 2 0 φf 3 10 4 and φc 0 in fig 12a numerous flow paths emerge and flow rates are homogeneously distributed across the system as caves are introduced the number of new flow paths remains almost unchanged due to the limited connectivity increment but the flow field within the network becomes heterogeneous due to the local obstruction free caves intersecting with some fractures e g a f 1 5 2 0 φf 3 10 4 and φc 0 4 in fig 12a we further systematically analyze the effect of the network connectivity χ on the flow channelization in fractured karst reservoirs based on the flow channeling metric i e the correlation dimension of the flow field d 2 in fig 13 a we can see that with the increase of χ d 2 first decreases and then increases approaching lowest at the percolation threshold χ cr for the poorly connected fracture cave network χ 0 81 d 2 is close to 2 figs 13a when the network connectivity χ increases and reaches around χ cr d 2 decreases to its lowest value around 1 3 fig 13a several percolated channels span the system with high flow rates but the flow rates are extremely low for rest structures in the system e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 3 10 4 φc 0 2 and η 1 10 in fig 12 as χ further increases and becomes greater than χ cr d 2 increases fig 13a and more preferential flow paths with high flow rate show up fig 12 particularly for the networks with χ χ cr d 2 is near 2 fig 13a in addition we investigate the influence of caves on the flow channeling based on d 2 d 2f as shown in fig 13b the caves would strongly affect the degree of flow channelization exhibiting either a positive or a negative influence depending on the network connectivity for χ χ cr or χ 10 i e the system is either disconnected or well connected d 2 d 2f 1 fig 13b and d 2 gradually decreases with φc e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 1 10 4 and a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 in fig 13c it indicates that a stronger flow channeling occurs with the inclusion of caves where the corresponding flow velocity field gradually develops into a more heterogeneous pattern e g the network with a f 3 0 φf 1 10 4 in fig s8 also the network with a f 1 5 φf 5 10 4 in fig s11 of the supplementary material on the other hand for χ cr χ 10 d 2 d 2f 1 fig 13b and d 2 gently increases with φc e g the network with a f 2 5 φf 3 10 4 in fig 13c it indicates that introducing caves into these systems leads to a reduced degree of flow channeling where more preferential flow pathways appear and tend to exhibit similar flow rates e g the network with a f 2 5 φf 3 10 4 in fig 12 4 4 a semi analytical equivalent permeability prediction model in the context of the percolation theory we further analyze the equivalent permeability k eq as a function of χ χ cr fig 14 in this study we take a mean value of χ cr 3 57 for the fracture cave system to derive the equivalent permeability prediction model its rationality is illustrated as follows first regarding a network with a small a f e g a f 1 5 it always has large fractures much larger than the system size i e without χ χ cr bour and davy 1997 in addition considering the relatively small range of χ cr and the difficulty to compute χ cr for systems with different combinations of geometrical parameters one may indeed treat χ cr as a constant as a first approximation such a mean value of χ cr 3 57 has been typically adopted for fracture networks in the literature balberg 1985 balberg et al 1984 bour and davy 1997 and its suitability has also been examined in the literature bour and davy 1997 fig 14a shows that k eq varies with χ χ cr following a dual power law i e k eq χ χ cr ξ with ξ 2 0 for χ around χ cr i e χ χ cr 2 and ξ 1 0 for χ much larger than χ cr i e χ χ cr 2 we suspect that the steeper scaling regime i e ξ 2 0 is caused by the co existence of connected and disconnected realizations nearby χ cr 3 57 leading to the strong fluctuation in k eq and reduction of the averaged k eq thus we remove the disconnected realizations and replot the data inset of fig 14a then the relationship between k eq and χ χ cr globally follows a linear correlation as k eq χ χ cr 1 when it comes to the local scaling of k eq χ χ cr ξ it is found that ξ 1 3 for a f 3 0 and ξ 1 0 for a f 1 5 i e ξ drops from 1 3 to 1 0 with the decrease of a f from 3 0 to 1 5 we further develop a semi analytical solution the detailed derivation is given in appendix b to the permeability of fracture cave networks as 14 k e q ω k cr γ φ c e a f χ χ cr where k cr λb f 3 12lk m is the permeability of fracture networks when χ approaches χ cr from above with λ 3 being the number of critical red links lei et al 2020 ω and γ are constants in fig 14b the normalized permeability of all fracture cave networks are plotted against χ χ cr fitting a least squares curve in the form of eq 14 to the dataset we find ω 0 087 and γ 14 it can be seen from fig 14b that our semi analytical permeability formulation gives an excellent match to the numerical data the coefficient of determination r 2 0 98 5 discussion and conclusion in this paper we carried out a combined theoretical and numerical investigation of three key scientific questions regarding fractured karst reservoirs i how can we quantify the connectivity of fracture cave networks ii how does the geometry of fracture cave networks impact the flow structure iii what s the relationship between the permeability and connectivity of the system these issues are fundamentally important for understanding the fluid flow in fractured karst reservoirs we derived a new analytical expression for the percolation parameter stemming from the excluded area method and demonstrated that it is a good proxy to the connectivity of fracture cave networks the fracture cave system transitions from a disconnected state to a connected regime when the percolation parameter progressively increases and exceeds the percolation threshold of 3 28 χ cr 4 45 it exhibits a good agreement with that of 3 2 4 5 for a system with monodisperse objects e g pure fracture networks balberg 1985 a sharp increase around 3 4 orders of magnitude with a large fluctuation of permeability occurs in the system around the percolation threshold i e χ χ cr as expected from the percolation theory masihi et al 2007 mourzenko et al 2011 stauffer and aharony 2018 our research extends the applicability of the excluded area method to multi component systems of complex geometries involving elements of different shapes which goes beyond previous modeling work applied for systems of simple geometries consisting of elements of a single shape bour and davy 1997 de dreuzy et al 2001a xu and jiao 2019 based on our numerical results in section 4 we discovered that the geometrical connectivity of fracture cave networks serves as a key parameter that determines the degree of flow channeling in fractured karst reservoirs we adopted a quantitative metric i e the correlation dimension of the flow field d 2 to evaluate the flow channelization phenomenon the most profound region where preferential flows occur is around the percolation threshold i e χ χ cr where limited percolating paths carrying high flow rates are identified the changes in the percolation parameter χ influence which fractures and caves are included in the subnetwork connecting flow boundaries and accessible to fluid flow especially as the percolation parameter χ is far away from the percolation threshold χ cr i e the poorly connected χ χ cr or well developed χ χ cr fracture cave networks it indicates almost no highly permeable structures or large amount of flow channels are contained such that the flow field is quite homogeneous in addition we reported that the network connectivity also stands for an excellent metric to evaluate the permeability of fractured karst reservoirs a power law scaling relationship between k eq and χ χ cr for connected fracture cave systems is characterized by an exponent ξ 1 3 for systems ruled by small fractures i e a f 3 0 and ξ 1 0 for systems ruled by large fractures i e a f 1 5 corresponding well to the values suggested by the percolation theory stauffer and aharony 2018 and snow s model snow 1969 respectively when a f varies from 1 5 to 3 0 i e the connectivity is ruled by both small and large fractures ξ varies from 1 0 to 1 3 because the system becomes more dominated by small fractures the semi analytical permeability formulation developed in this study shows an excellent match to the results of direct numerical simulations our proposed method seems to be a promising alternative to other conventional models such as the rock fabric petrophysical classification method lucia 2007 the conventional percolation theory for porous media sahini and sahimi 2003 and the kozeny carman equation carman 1956 most of which predict lower permeability than expected if fractures are well connected in the systems lucia 2007 as compared to pure fracture networks caves play a critical role in affecting the hydraulic permeability and flow channelization in fracture cave networks the impacts of caves exerting on flow channeling in fractured karst reservoirs are classified into two categories i the caves enlarge the global network connectivity and ii they enhance the local fluid velocity if the percolation parameter χ is small e g χ 10 the variation of flow channelization is dominated by the cave enlarged network connectivity the degree of flow channeling first increases due to the cave increased connectivity χ close to χ cr where strong flow channelization occurs then decreases with the enlarged connectivity χ away from χ cr where flow field exhibits homogeneity if the percolation parameter χ is large e g χ 10 where the caves contribute little to the network connectivity the evolution of flow channelization is controlled by the cave enhanced fluid velocity that is the degree of flow channeling again increases with the inclusion of caves at this point the flow is primarily prevailed by the variations in the local hydrological properties instead of the structure of the networks besides the cave tends to play a non trivial role in enhancing the equivalent permeability if the system is close to the percolation threshold on the contrary it has less impacts in highly disconnected or well connected scenarios this is understandable because when the fracture cave network is not percolated i e χ χ cr the system has a series flow structure i e separated fractures and caves are linked by matrix such that the equivalent permeability is approximated by the harmonic mean of the permeability of different elements de marsily 1986 and more dominated by the low permeability matrix as for the well connected network i e χ χ cr the system has a parallel flow structure which consists of multiple traversing channels i e pure fracture pathways or mixed fracture cave passages the permeability is approximated by the arithmetic mean de marsily 1986 and thus controlled by the high permeability of fracture or fracture cave channels each individual channel is then ruled by the permeability of fractures which either form a percolating path directly or via linking caves as the system gradually approaches the percolation threshold from below i e χ χ cr resulting from the increment of cave porosity the system changes from a non percolating to a percolating regime with the permeability increasing over 3 4 orders of magnitude the transitional regime of fracture cave system i e χ χ cr is commonly observed in the field of hydrocarbon production from carbonate reservoirs that only a narrow swept volume and small fraction of recovery 14 4 is obtained li 2017 li et al 2018 suggesting that the effect of caves on fluid flow through fractured karst reservoirs is vital we are aware that assigning the same aperture to all fractures is highly idealized since nature fracture networks may involve a very broad range of variable apertures which tend to correlate with fracture lengths baghbanan and jing 2007 de dreuzy et al 2001b 2012 therefore we further conduct a preliminary investigation on the influence of variable fracture aperture on the equivalent permeability flow structures and flow channelization in fracture cave systems we also discuss the relative change for the influence of caves if considering variable fracture aperture the fracture aperture is correlated with fracture length by a power law function i e b f ηl f θ baghbanan and jing 2007 where θ varies between 0 5 and 2 0 here we adopt θ 0 5 which represents a sub linear aperture length scaling olson 2003 as to the case with correlated fracture length and aperture we keep its mean aperture equal to that of the constant fracture aperture scenario in addition we investigate the scenario with uncorrelated fracture aperture and length where the distribution of fracture apertures is kept the same as the correlated one but apertures are randomly assigned to fractures the fracture network with a f 2 0 and φf 3 10 4 and the fracture cave network with a f 2 0 φf 3 10 4 η 1 10 and φc 0 4 are selected to conduct the preliminary analysis the fracture aperture distributions of the constant correlated and uncorrelated scenarios are presented in fig s17 the results show that as to fracture networks k eq is largest for the correlated case but lowest for the uncorrelated one fig s18a with the inclusion of caves k eq for all scenarios increases fig s18a where its relative change i e k eq k f is most significant for the uncorrelated scheme but its absolute variation i e k eq k f is largest for the correlated one as to the influence of variable fracture aperture on the flow channelization the localized flow is most profound in the correlated network fig s18b where several flow paths carrying high flow rates exist fig s19a while for the constant and uncorrelated networks d 2 is relatively large fig s18b and the fluid flow seems to be homogeneous fig s19a when caves are taken into account the preferential flow is enhanced for all networks figs s18b and s19b but it becomes most significant i e d 2 d f is smallest in the correlated system figs s18b and s19b since the obstruction free cave enlarges flow rate greater along the fracture with wider aperture than that with smaller one as evidenced by the fact that k eq k f is hugest for the correlated one in fig s18a these results show that the distribution of variable fracture apertures could have strong impact on the fluid flow through fractured karst geological media therefore further works are planned to more comprehensively investigate such effects however the model developed in the current paper provides a good basis for further exploring additional factors such as variable initial fracture apertures kang et al 2019 fractal spatial organizations darcel et al 2003a davy et al 2010 anisotropic orientations lei et al 2014 as well as 3d systems de dreuzy et al 2012 hyman 2020 our current work may be extrapolated to 3d real fracture cave networks from the following two perspectives first the 2d simulation results may be relevant to some 3d geological systems that have longitudinal dimensions of characteristic scale that are much larger than the transversal ones e g joint networks in sedimentary layered rocks second the expression of the proposed percolation parameter for 2d systems can also be extended for 3d real fracture cave networks with the replacement of a ex 2a c 2 2π in eq 7 with vex 2 v sr where v s and r are respectively the volume surface area and mean curvature radius of the structure torquato and jiao 2013 to conclude we investigated how the geometrical attributes of fracture cave networks affect the connectivity permeability and flow channelization of fractured karst reservoirs we developed and verified a new analytical expression of the percolation parameter related to the length of fractures and the area and perimeter of caves to determine the connectivity of fracture cave systems with a broad size distribution flow channeling is primarily dominated by the network connectivity and strongly influenced by the cave porosity the equivalent permeability of connected networks shows a power law relationship with the connectivity i e χ χ cr characterized by an exponent of 1 0 1 3 we further developed a semi analytical solution to the equivalent permeability which shows a good consistency with our numerical simulations of coupled porous media and free flow the methods and observations presented in this paper have important implications for characterizing the geometrical and hydraulic properties of fractured karst reservoirs involved in many geoengineering activities such as hydrocarbon production and groundwater extraction in karstified

demonstrate our flow simulation based on an ideal fracture cave network with a persistent fracture horizontally placed across the domain of size l and a circular cave located at the center of the domain fig a1 a the cave diameter is l c l 5 and the fracture length is l f l the values of dimensionless parameters are taken as re 1 dp 2 5 10 21 db 2 1010 β 1 0 b f l 5 10 6 and k f k m 8 33 108 we investigate the flow velocity distribution in fractured karstified reservoirs by applying a unit dimensionless pressure differential on the opposite boundary surfaces along the horizontal direction i e x direction with no flow conditions on the remaining ones parallel to the flow direction since fluid velocity in the low permeability matrix is very slow the fluid flow mainly occurs along the preexisting fracture and cave therefore the flow flux q along the fracture and cave are almost the same at steady state according to q av where a and v are cross section area and flow velocity of the structural element i e fracture and cave and the cross section area of cave is much larger than fracture we would expect that the fluid flow along the fracture is much higher than that within the cave

193,rough rock fractures have complex geometries which result in highly heterogeneous aperture fields to accurately estimate the permeability of such fractures heterogeneity of the aperture fields must be quantified in this study heterogeneity of single rough rock fractures is for the first time parametrized by connectivity metrics which quantify how connected the bounds of a heterogeneous field are we use 3000 individual realizations of synthetic aperture fields with different statistical parameters and compute three connectivity metrics based on percolation theory for each realization the sensitivity of the connectivity metrics with respect to the determining parameter i e the cutoff threshold is studied and the correlation between permeability of the fractures and the computed connectivity metrics is presented the results show that the θ connectivity metric predicts the permeability with higher accuracy all three studied connectivity metrics provide better permeability estimations when a larger aperture value is chosen as the cutoff threshold overall this study elucidates that using connectivity metrics provides a less expensive alternative to fluid flow simulations when an estimation of fracture permeability is desired keywords connectivity rough fractures permeability percolation theory 1 introduction accurately estimating the permeability of rough rock fractures is an important element of the design and implementation of projects such as oil and gas recovery javanmard et al 2019 nuclear waste disposal bear et al 1996 co2 geo sequestration rutqvist et al 2007 sohal et al 2021 and fracture dominated geothermal reservoirs such as enhanced geothermal systems kittilä et al 2020a b gischig et al 2020 kittilä et al 2019 amann et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 sahimi 2011 the most commonly used method for estimating the fracture permeability is the cubic law which assumes that the fracture walls are smooth and parallel boussinesq 1868 the cubic law relates the flow rate through a fracture to a corresponding hydraulic aperture e h which is assumed to be constant in the fracture plane witherspoon et al 1980 however rock fractures are known to be rough and non homogeneous in nature barton et al 1985 raven and gale 1985 pyrak nolte and morris 2000 vogler et al 2017 and therefore the hydraulic aperture in the cubic law is commonly estimated by the arithmetic mean of the aperture field numerous studies have shown that the cubic law only provides acceptable fracture permeability when the mean aperture is relatively large witherspoon et al 1980 pyrak nolte et al 1987 renshaw 1995 sisavath et al 2003 liu 2005 vogler et al 2016a this suggests that mean aperture alone is not capable of fully describing the heterogeneity of the aperture field in rough fractures with heterogeneous aperture fields the fluid flows through preferential paths which provide the least resistance to flow this causes the flow field in a rough fracture to be highly channelized meaning that most of the fluid flows through a small proportion of the fracture plane tsang 1984 tsang and tsang 1989 fluid flow channelling further increases when fractures deform under stress and contact areas expand unger and mase 1993 and vogler et al 2018 to capture the impact of the flow field heterogeneity and its impact on the fracture permeability estimation several permeability formulas were proposed that incorporate statistical parameters such as standard deviation of the aperture field rasouli and hosseinian 2011 xie et al 2015 fractional contact area zimmerman et al 1992 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 yeo 2001 and correlation length of the aperture field pyrak nolte and nolte 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 however studies in the context of porous media have shown that local permeability fields with almost identical arithmetic mean variance and semi variograms can have significantly different effective permeability values western et al 2001 krishnan and journel 2003 renard and allard 2013 this is attributed to the fact that these parameters fail to infer information about the continuity of flow paths between two locations within the porous medium even though this continuity is the main driver of the permeability for example the semi variogram provides information about the likelihood of two locations having similar values but does not provide any information about the values between the two locations this suggests that the conventional single and two point statistical parameters are not adequate to estimate the effective permeability of porous media to achieve a better understanding of the flow and transport properties of the field it is therefore important to gain information about the continuity of the flow paths which can be quantified with so called connectivity metrics saar and manga 1999 western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 davis et al 2011 bernabé and maineult 2015 renard and allard 2013 different metrics have been proposed to study the role of connectivity in flow and transport processes in porous media and fracture networks several studies mariethoz et al 2010 davis et al 2011 renard et al 2011 suggest that including the connectivity information inferred from the field observations in the regeneration of stochastic reservoir models results in more realistic outcomes it has been shown that connectivity metrics can provide efficient estimations of the flow and transport properties of both fractured berkowitz 2002 xu et al 2006 sanderson and nixon 2015 bisdom et al 2017 and intact reservoirs bernabé et al 2010 tyukhova and willmann 2016 king 1990 shows that there is a universal relationship between the connectivity effective permeability and well spacing for a simple sand body model of an oil reservoir he suggests that this finding can be of practical use for reservoir engineers in helping them estimate the recoverable oil without performing reservoir simulations for many realizations as is common practice ganguly and misra 2021 computed the connectivity of oil gas and water phases during a water alternating gas wag enhanced oil recovery experiment they found that using connectivity metrics in addition to conventionally used phase saturation values results in better estimation of efficiency of each injection cycle and therefore can be used to optimize the wag injection strategy it has been suggested that the concept of connectivity is also applicable to flow and transport in single rough fractures mourzenko et al 1996 bernabé et al 2011 however the idea has not yet been quantitatively explored quantifying the connectivity of different kinds of heterogeneous fields is commonly achieved using percolation theory king 1990 saar and manga 1999 saar et al 2001 walsh and saar 2008 sahimi 2011 davis et al 2011 a brief introduction of which is provided in section 2 3 while percolation theory has not been previously studied in the context of connectivity metrics in rough fractures it has been explored for the relationship between the percolation threshold and geometry of the fracture mourzenko et al 1996 studied the relationship between the size and properties of the so called percolating cluster in a rough fracture to the properties of self affine fracture surfaces in a later study mourzenko et al 1999 found a power law relationship between the heat conductivity of self affine fractures and the statistical parameters of the rough surfaces and aperture using percolation theory suggesting that percolation theory can be used to quantify transport processes in fractures mourzenko et al 2001 subsequently showed that the hydraulic aperture of self affine fractures can be described as a power law function of the fractional open area and the percolation probability where the power is a function of the surface roughness they mourzenko et al 2018 have also arrived at a relationship between the transport coefficient of rough fractures with gaussian spatial correlation and the geometrical characteristics of the fracture surfaces and the aperture previous studies mourzenko et al 1996 1999 2001 2018 used percolation theory to relate the indicators of flow and transport processes to the geometry of rough fractures however the potential relationship between the common connectivity metrics and indicators of flow and transport in rough fractures has not been explored moreover the geometry of the fractures in these studies was defined by the properties of the fracture surfaces however it is the geometry and topology of the aperture field rather than the two fracture surfaces that determine the physical processes inside the fracture rasouli and hosseinian 2011 in this study we investigate for the first time if common percolation based connectivity metrics can provide information about the permeability of deformed fractures to systematically and comprehensively study this subject with strong statistical reliability we utilized a large database of 3000 synthetic aperture fields with varying statistical properties such as standard deviation and correlation length the studied aperture fields also exhibit varying degrees of deformation under normal stress and hence have a range of fractional contact area which controls the connectivity of the field we then explore the appropriate ways to compute common connectivity metrics in single rough and deformed fractures and study the sensitivity of each connectivity metric to the determining percolation based parameter i e the cutoff threshold a comparison of the performance of the studied connectivity metrics in predicting permeability of rough fractures is presented 2 methodology to study the relationship between fracture permeability and connectivity we build upon a database of synthetic aperture fields from a previous study javanmard et al 2021 the process of aperture field generation and the fluid flow simulations are briefly presented in this section interested readers are referred to our previous publication for more in depth information about this database javanmard et al 2021 the three metrics employed to evaluate the connectivity of the fractures are then introduced in detail 2 1 generation of synthetic aperture fields log normally distributed random aperture fields are synthesized using the g stat package in r pebesma 2004 according to the specified parameters reported in table 1 the aperture fields are discretized by 401 401 160801 uniform square grid cells of size 0 25 by 0 25 mm2 in the xy plane fig 1c representing aperture fields of size 100 by 100 mm2 the generated aperture fields all have the same mean e 0 240 mm but two different standard deviations σ 0 070 and 0 170 mm which allows investigation of the impact of roughness on connectivity aperture roughness is quantified by the relative standard deviation σ e in this study zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 yeo 2001 wang and cardenas 2016 guo et al 2016 kling et al 2017 we have imposed isotropic exponential semi variograms on the generated aperture fields with 5 different ranges to generate aperture fields with different correlation lengths the correlation length of 1 mm corresponding to 0 01 of the dimension of the aperture fields represents a random uncorrelated field and is used to compare the behaviour of initially correlated and uncorrelated aperture fields for each set of statistical parameters 30 realizations of aperture fields are generated this data set of the aperture fields with different standard deviations and correlation lengths is used to study the effect of roughness and correlation length on the connectivity of the field the grid size is chosen carefully to be much smaller than the smallest correlation length of the aperture fields ensuring reliability of the results of deformation and fluid flow simulations prodanov et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis on the impact of the grid size on fluid flow simulations is presented in our previous publication javanmard et al 2021 a sensitivity analysis on the impact of the grid size on the results presented in this paper shows that the results incur a relative error of 2 3 5 compared to the results obtained from a grid size that is four times smaller table 1 in the supporting information considering the high computational cost of simulations employing finer resolutions the chosen grid size provides sufficiently high accuracies for this study the generated aperture fields are then numerically deformed under 10 distinct normal stress levels as presented in table 1 using pyco a contact mechanics model pastewka 2020 fig 1b c qualitatively illustrates the impact of normal loading on the aperture fields and the grid cells pyco computes the deformed aperture fields under specified normal stress using a boundary element method which is solved with a fast fourier transform fft based convolution weber et al 2018 kling et al 2018 grimm lima et al 2018 2020b a the elastic deformation of the aperture fields is modelled assuming mechanical properties of grimsel granodiorite with a young s modulus of 11 gpa and a poisson ratio of 0 25 vogler et al 2016b vogler 2016 vogler et al 2018 kling et al 2018 the first stress level is deliberately chosen to be low to bring the fracture sides into contact without altering the geometry of the aperture field the output of the contact mechanics simulation is 3000 individual realizations of aperture fields 10 stress levels 2 aperture standard deviations 5 aperture field correlation lengths and 30 realizations for each set of statistical properties which forms the database analysed for this study the first applied load on the fractures reduces the local apertures in the field without deformation although the aperture mean is reduced in this step all other statistical parameters e g the standard deviation and the spatial aperture distribution remain intact therefore the initially generated aperture fields are not included in the studied data set and the fractures under 0 5 kpa of normal stress are referred to as unloaded fractures hereafter the aperture field realizations exhibit varying amounts of fractional contact area between 0 to 24 due to the deformation caused by normal loading which considerably affects the resulting flow field channelling tsang 1984 oron and berkowitz 1998 and hence the connectivity of the aperture fields mourzenko et al 1996 2 2 fluid flow simulation numerical simulation of steady state single phase fully saturated fluid flow through the fractures are performed using the multiphysics object oriented simulation environment moose numerical modelling framework permann et al 2020 the saintbernard application which provides additional capabilities to moose schädle 2020 is used to handle the fracture grid the porousflow module in moose green et al 2018 wilkins et al 2020 is used to solve the local cubic law lcl equation dirichlet boundary conditions of constant fluid pressures are applied to the left and right boundaries and neumann boundary conditions of no flow are imposed to the top and bottom boundaries of the fractures fig 1a these boundary conditions enforce a flow direction from the left to the right side of the fracture field x axis direction the imposed fluid pressure difference between the lateral bounds of the model is 80 pa which ensures reynolds re numbers of less than unity for all realizations results of an lcl solution in planar fractures where the re number is less than unity are reported to be very similar to the solution of the navier stokes equations brush and thomson 2003 so the lcl is likely to constitute a reasonable approach for this study our fluid flow simulations provide the flow field in each fracture from which the flow rate into each fracture is computed the permeability of fractures are then calculated using darcy s law 1 q k a p μ where q is the volumetric flow rate m3 s k is the permeability m2 a is the cross sectional area of the fracture m2 p is the fluid pressure gradient over the length of the fracture pa m and μ is the dynamic fluid viscosity pa s 2 3 connectivity metrics percolation theory first introduced in statistical physics broadbent and hammersley 1957 provides the tools to model the connectivity of geometrically complex systems therefore before exploring the connectivity metrics a brief introduction to percolation theory is presented in the simplest form of percolation theory namely discrete percolation theory fig 2 a network is considered where the sites e g nodes can be regarded as either occupied or unoccupied occupied neighbouring sites then form a distinct cluster there are different ways of defining the neighbourhood two sites can be considered neighbours if they share a site node a bond edge or a face surface in 3d fields in a 2d model if the neighbourhood is defined when a bond is shared each site can have a maximum of 4 neighbours and if the neighbourhood is defined when a site is shared each site can have a maximum of 8 neighbours these types of neighbouring definition in 2d fields result in 4 and 8 neighbouring schemes respectively as illustrated in fig 2b c the cluster identification in this study follows the 8 neighbouring scheme fig 2 which is the more realistic approach in clustering the heterogeneous field percolation theory investigates how the shape and size of the clusters evolve as a function of probability of site occupation p and their impact on the overall properties of the network the percolation threshold p c for example is defined as an occupation probability at which the small and isolated clusters formed at lower occupation probabilities p p c coalesce and form a larger connected cluster that spans the entire field stauffer and aharony 1992 to apply percolation theory to a heterogeneous aperture field of a rough fracture a cutoff aperture threshold z is applied to the field designating grid cells as either open or closed to flow this threshold transforms the aperture field into a binary field of permeable and impermeable phases depending on the aperture values being above or below the chosen cutoff threshold respectively the cutoff threshold resulting in at least one cluster that connects the two sides of the fracture in the direction of flow is the percolation threshold the percolation threshold is commonly specified in the form of probability which in the context of rough fractures translates into the fraction of the permeable phase there usually exists only one percolating cluster in a heterogeneous field mourzenko et al 1996 and the percolation threshold indicates whether the fracture is open to flow however the percolation threshold does not provide any information on the connectivity or the permeability of the percolating fracture to obtain this information several percolation theory based connectivity metrics have previously been suggested in the literature this study investigates if these connectivity metrics can decipher information about the permeability of a fracture in a percolating regime connectivity metrics are commonly classified as either static structural or dynamic functional bracken et al 2013 renard and allard 2013 while static connectivity metrics are computed solely from the geometry of the field the dynamic connectivity metrics depend on the specific process under investigation and the applied boundary conditions the utilized connectivity metrics can infer information about the connectivity in the vicinity of specific points local metrics for example a well or the entire field global metrics the aim of this study is to investigate if the connectivity metrics can provide a good indication of the permeability of the entire field without the information from the fluid flow simulations or experiments therefore we only consider the most common global and static connectivity metrics as listed by renard at al renard and allard 2013 as follows 1 θ z defined as the probability of two sites e g nodes belonging to the largest cluster renard and allard 2013 willems et al 2017 the value of this metric can range from almost zero when all clusters are small and scattered to 1 when the whole field is in the permeable phase in some references this connectivity metric is called the percolation probability defined slightly differently from the probability of sites belonging to the percolating cluster and is calculated as the proportion of the volume in 3d of the percolating cluster to the total volume of the field king 1990 hovadik and larue 2007 sadeghnejad et al 2011 given this definition the connectivity metric is zero below the percolation threshold and its value can change from zero to one above the percolation threshold for percolating fractures both definitions i e two sites belonging to the largest cluster vs belonging to the percolating cluster result in identical values we have used the first definition in this study as it provides a more general quantification of connectivity of heterogeneous fields 2 γ z defined as the probability of a pair of sites distinct or not belonging to the same cluster this connectivity metric is referred to as two point correlation function in other studies davis et al 2011 specifically γ z is computed as the proportion of the number of connected pairs to all the pairs in the permeable phase 2 γ z 1 n p 2 i 1 n n i 2 where n p is the number of sites in the permeable phase n is the number of clusters and n i is the number of sites in cluster i the value of this connectivity metric can change continuously from almost zero when the clusters are small and isolated to one when the whole permeable phase belongs to the same cluster 3 i τ z integral scale of the connectivity function is a multi point statistical parameter this connectivity metric reports the average length of the continuous paths between the bounds of the heterogeneous field allard 1994 western et al 2001 the connectivity function τ h z indicates the probability that two sites separated by a distance lag vector of size h both have a value above the threshold z and are connected denoted by 3 τ h z p x x h z x h z z x z the integral scale of the connectivity function is defined as 4 i τ z 0 τ h z d h which expresses the average distance over which the points above threshold z are connected a large value of this connectivity metric implies that there are abundant connected bands within the field previous studies western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 showed that the connectivity function is only capable of properly capturing connectivity of the field when it is computed in the local or average direction of the flow in this study the connectivity function is computed in the average direction of the fluid flow along the x axis fig 1 for each directional lag distance h between 0 and 401 pixels the number of pixels in the same cluster with directional lag distance h is divided by the total number of pixel pairs in the permeable phase connected or not with the same directional lag distance once the connectivity function for the specific cutoff threshold is computed for all possible lag distances the integral of the function provides the integral scale of the connectivity function in this paper we normalize this connectivity metric by the length of the field so that its value can be readily compared with the other two connectivity metrics 3 results and discussions 3 1 connectivity metrics all three studied connectivity metrics are functions of the chosen cutoff threshold which transforms the aperture field into a binary field of permeable and impermeable phases highlighted in grey and colour respectively in fig 3a e fig 3 illustrates how the choice of the cutoff threshold affects the size of clusters and the connectivity function for one realization a critical probability exists in percolation theory fig 3c above which the investigated heterogeneous field percolates meaning that a cluster in the permeable phase spans the entire field in terms of the heterogeneous aperture fields the critical percolation probability or percolation threshold is the fraction of the fracture in the permeable phase above which a percolating cluster exists fig 3f shows how the connectivity function evolves versus the lag distance and the applied cutoff threshold quantified as the fraction of the permeable phase when fractures are in the percolating regime fig 3a b the connectivity function remains high for most lag distances and it never reaches zero at the largest possible lag distance since there is at least one cluster having the same length as the fracture when the fraction of the permeable phase is below the percolation threshold fig 3d e the connectivity function decreases quickly and reaches zero at a lag distance well below the length of the fracture meaning that no inter connected band is present between the left and right edges i e in the direction of the connectivity measurement of the model this is because the clusters are small and scattered and therefore as the lag distance increases the probability of two points being connected tends to zero table 2 shows how the three connectivity metrics and the number of clusters are affected by the choice of the cutoff thresholds presented in fig 3 it can be seen that as the fraction of the permeable phase is gradually decreased all three connectivity metrics also decrease and the number of clusters increases since the connectivity metrics are affected considerably by the cutoff threshold choosing an appropriate cutoff threshold is an important step in computing the connectivity of fractures however before investigating the impact of the cutoff threshold on the connectivity metrics we report on the percolation threshold of the studied data set 3 1 1 percolation threshold table 3 shows the average percolation threshold in terms of the probability of the permeable phase for aperture fields with different initial standard deviations and correlation lengths and under different loads to compute the percolation threshold of each realization the cutoff threshold was successively increased from zero aperture until the percolating cluster disappeared the probability of the permeable phase of the last percolating fracture is reported as the percolation threshold the analysis in line with previous studies on percolation thresholds of 2d finite grids renard and allard 2013 and rough fractures mourzenko et al 2018 shows that when more than about 50 of the fracture plane is open to flow on average the fractures are in the percolating regime the percolation threshold is affected by the size knudby et al 2006 sadeghnejad et al 2011 dimension king 1990 hovadik and larue 2007 renard and allard 2013 neighbourhood definition stauffer and aharony 1992 and the correlation length of the field harter 2005 hovadik and larue 2007 and thus it is difficult to compute and compare values among studies the percolation threshold observed in our study generally increases as the applied stress and the initial correlation length of the fractures increase this trend is caused by the fact that the fractional contact area of the fractures also increase as the initial correlation length and the stress increase javanmard et al 2021 this is in line with observations made by mourzenko et al 2018 who suggest that the percolation threshold depends on the fractional open space of the fracture the fractures with initially higher standard deviation generally have a lower percolation threshold this observation can again be linked to the fact that the aperture fields with initially higher standard deviations deform less under stress and therefore have a lower fractional contact area javanmard et al 2021 mourzenko et al 1996 suggest that the percolation threshold depends also on the roughness exponent of the fracture surfaces since the roughness in the current study is quantified by the relative standard deviation of the aperture field a direct comparison with the results presented by mourzenko et al 1996 is not possible 3 1 2 sensitivity to the cutoff threshold to compute the connectivity metrics a cutoff threshold needs to be chosen to divide the fracture plane into permeable and impermeable phases as demonstrated in table 2 and fig 2 the connectivity metrics of one particular realization are shown to be sensitive to the chosen cutoff threshold this section studies the sensitivity of different connectivity metrics to the cutoff thresholds of zero 10 20 and 30 μ m for the entire data set zero aperture can be considered a natural cutoff threshold for fractures which divides the aperture field into contact impermeable phase and flow permeable phase area mourzenko et al 1996 1999 thus the connectivity metrics computed with the cutoff threshold of zero aperture are considered the base case for the sensitivity analysis and therefore a closer look at the impact of different statistical parameters on the connectivity metrics based on a zero aperture cutoff threshold is presented fig 4 shows how the connectivity metrics with a cutoff threshold of zero change under applied normal load and for realizations with different initial correlation lengths and roughness values a cutoff threshold of zero results in the fracture plane being divided into contact and flow regions all connectivity metrics of the unloaded fractures show the maximum connectivity value of one the unloaded fractures have a few isolated contact points forming the impermeable phase and therefore one cluster covers the entire field which results in the maximum value of the connectivity metrics as the stress applied on the fracture increases the value of all the connectivity metrics reduces increasing normal stress increases the fractional contact area javanmard et al 2021 and thus reduces the fraction of the permeable phase and the size of clusters which result in lower connectivity values the reduction is much smaller for the connectivity metrics γ and i τ compared to the θ connectivity metric as isolated clusters are accounted for when computing γ and i τ whereas the θ connectivity metric only considers the size of the largest cluster accounting for the size of the smaller isolated clusters partially compensates the reduction observed in the size of the largest cluster in computation of γ and i τ connectivity metrics all three connectivity metrics show greater reduction in connectivity versus stress as the initial correlation length increases the value of the connectivity metrics is also lower for the fractures with initial higher standard deviation i e initially rougher aperture fields both trends reflect the observed changes in fractional contact area versus stress javanmard et al 2021 where the fractional contact area is smaller for fractures with lower initial correlation length and standard deviation although contact or zero aperture is a reasonable choice the cutoff thresholds applied in the context of porous media are generally non zero western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 hovadik and larue 2007 therefore this study also applies a range of non zero cutoff thresholds namely 10 20 and 30 μ m to the investigated data set the highest applied cutoff threshold 30 μ m results in 20 of the aperture fields being in the non percolating regime table 4 since we know from the fluid flow simulations that most of these fractures are open to flow it can be concluded that such a cutoff threshold artificially categorizes some fractures as non percolating therefor no higher cutoff thresholds are studied to quantify the sensitivity of different connectivity metrics to the chosen cutoff threshold the manhattan distance nisbet et al 2009 between the connectivity metrics for each cutoff threshold and the connectivity metric with zero aperture cutoff threshold was computed the manhattan distance was used for the sensitivity analysis in this study as it is an appropriate distance metric for high dimensional data as an example eq 5 shows how the manhattan distance was calculated for the sensitivity analysis of i τ connectivity metric with the calculation of the manhattan distance d for θ and γ being analogous 5 d i 1 n i τ z 0 i i τ z x i where d is the distance n is the number of realizations and x is replaced with the value of the cutoff threshold for example 10 20 and 30 μ m table 4 shows the sensitivity of the connectivity metric to the chosen cutoff threshold all connectivity metrics show sensitivity to the chosen cutoff threshold with the sensitivity of the θ connectivity metric being most pronounced increasing the cutoff threshold causes the largest cluster to shrink and more isolated and small clusters to appear fig 3 as explained before in computation of the θ connectivity metric only the size of the largest cluster is considered whereas in computation of the γ and i τ connectivity metrics the size of all clusters are taken into account which reduces the sensitivity of these connectivity metrics to the cutoff threshold the sensitivities of the two connectivity metrics γ and i τ to the cutoff threshold behave very similarly as the connectivity metric γ eq 2 and the connectivity function eq 3 are related according to eq 6 renard and allard 2013 it is logical that the connectivity metrics γ and i τ show very similar behaviour 6 h τ h γ n p 3 2 permeability estimation in this section we investigate how well the computed connectivity metrics can predict the permeability of fractures following the general concept of percolation theory and the relationships suggested by previous researchers mourzenko et al 2001 bernabé et al 2010 tyukhova and willmann 2016 the permeability is related to the connectivity through a power law relationship such as 7 k a x b where k is the permeability x is the connectivity metric and a and b are fitting coefficients building on these previous works the relationship between the permeability obtained from flow simulations on the investigated aperture fields as explained in section 2 2 and the computed connectivity metrics was computed the fitting coefficients a and b and the coefficient of determination r 2 for each cutoff threshold are reported in table 5 and a visual presentation of the fitted relationship to the connectivity metrics with a cutoff threshold of 30 μ m is presented in fig 5 the r 2 value for the correlation between permeability and the θ connectivity metric lies around 70 which only increases slightly as the cutoff threshold increases the accuracy of permeability prediction by γ and i τ connectivity metrics also generally increases with the cutoff threshold in general as the cutoff threshold increases the prediction accuracy of all three connectivity metrics also increases with increasing cutoff threshold the aperture field is increasingly removed from a binary separation solely based on contact and non contact area this observation is supported by previous research on fracture flow which shows that large regions with open apertures may not contribute to the flow field javanmard et al 2021 ishibashi et al 2015 watanabe et al 2009 numerical and experimental evidence further demonstrates that the fluid does not flow in the proximity of the contact points between the fracture surfaces li et al 2008 yeo 2001 therefore it seems that non zero cutoff thresholds are more suited to capture the real flow field than the zero cutoff threshold however care must be taken in choosing the cutoff threshold for the trade off between the accuracy of the permeability prediction and the percentage of the non percolating fractures table 4 as explained before higher cutoff thresholds may deem fracture realizations that are open to flow as non percolating therefore it is important to choose a cutoff threshold that optimally balances the accuracy of the permeability prediction and accuracy of the percolation status of the fracture the θ connectivity metric predicts the fracture permeability consistently with the highest accuracy i e highest r 2 value when compared to the other two connectivity metrics the strength of the θ connectivity metric can be attributed to the fact that it is computed solely based on the property of the largest percolating cluster while γ and i τ consider smaller and non percolating clusters as well in reality the isolated high aperture regions in the fracture plane may not contribute to the flow field equally if they are not connected amongst each other and can be seen as isolated regions of the fracture somewhat similar to disconnected pores in porous media thus accounting for them in the computation of connectivity metrics may not capture the physical processes occurring when fluids flow through fractures in general the connectivity metric that consistently predicts the fracture permeability with the highest accuracy is the θ connectivity metric although the value of this connectivity metric is more sensitive to the chosen cutoff threshold table 4 the coefficient of the determination is not considerably affected by this choice therefore the θ connectivity metric shows advantages over the γ and i τ connectivity metrics in predicting fracture permeability when the γ and i τ connectivity metrics are used for permeability predictions a higher cutoff threshold should be preferred to achieve higher prediction accuracies the computation of connectivity metrics does not require any additional information about the geometry of the fractures besides the information needed to perform fluid flow simulations however in contrast to fluid flow simulations computing the connectivity metrics is computationally inexpensive most programming languages already provide efficient functions for clustering 2d and 3d heterogeneous fields and once the clusters are identified computation of the connectivity metrics is quickly achieved in comparison performing simulations of fluid flow through fractures requires special simulation software e g lattice boltzmann simulators and some expertise on the part of the operator additional thought has to be given to 3d flow effects mass conservation and other problems therefore fluid flow simulations in rough fractures are computationally more complex and expensive compared to the computation of the connectivity metrics our study shows that the investigated connectivity metrics can be useful means in predicting the fracture permeability it should be noted that in this study we have attempted to predict the permeability of a large data set of rough and deformed fractures with large variations in geometrical properties solely by the value of a connectivity metric in reality the permeabilities of rough fractures under normal stresses are given by a complex function of different geometrical and topological parameters of the fracture therefore in most previously proposed fracture permeability models several parameters describing the properties of the fracture are included javanmard et al 2021 kling et al 2017 jin et al 2017 xie et al 2015 xiong et al 2011 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 although these fracture permeability models are more complex compared to the relationships presented in our study their accuracies in predicting permeability particularly for fractures deformed under stress are not much higher phillips et al 2021 javanmard et al 2021 our permeability predictions based on the connectivity metrics are already comparable to those predicted by the previously proposed significantly more complex models therefore we expect that including other critical parameters in a new permeability model besides the connectivity metrics can lead to more accurate permeability predictions this study has focused on the relationship between the connectivity metrics and the fracture permeability however it is worth to investigate the role of connectivity in other physical processes such as advective and diffusive solute and heat transport in rough fractures as has previously been done in the context of transport porous media knudby and carrera 2005 tyukhova and willmann 2016 another aspect of the current study that can be investigated further is the possible effect of the third dimension on the connectivity metrics 4 conclusion a large database of synthetic heterogeneous aperture fields of single rough fractures with different realistic statistical properties was investigated for the applicability of the connectivity concept from percolation theory the synthesized fracture aperture fields range from uncorrelated to highly correlated and have two different standard deviations to represent different fracture roughness levels the aperture fields were deformed under 10 distinct normal stress levels in a numerical experiment and exhibit fractional contact area ranging from zero to 24 the permeability of each realization was computed from the fluid flow simulations the following conclusions can be made from the results presented in this study connectivity metrics three commonly used global and static connectivity metrics based on percolation threshold namely the θ γ and i τ were defined and computed with four different cutoff thresholds for each rough and deformed aperture field realization appropriate choice of the cutoff threshold as higher cutoff thresholds cause more fractures to be in the non percolating regime care must be taken when choosing a cutoff threshold when the cutoff threshold is increased for the studied database more fractures that are open to flow based on the fluid flow simulations are categorized as non percolating therefore it should be noted that the optimum cutoff threshold should correctly classify fractures as percolating or non percolating sensitivity of the connectivity metrics to the chosen cutoff threshold the sensitivity of each connectivity metric to the chosen cutoff threshold was computed the θ connectivity metric shows the highest sensitivity to the chosen cutoff threshold although all three connectivity metrics are affected by the chosen cutoff threshold permeability prediction using connectivity metrics fracture permeability predictions from connectivity metrics by a power law relationship were performed with higher cutoff thresholds being found to be more accurate the θ connectivity metric predicts the fracture permeability with the highest accuracy compared to the other two connectivity metrics the accuracy of the permeability prediction employing the θ connectivity metric is almost unaffected by the chosen cutoff threshold and therefore the θ connectivity metric can be the preferred connectivity metric to predict fracture permeabilities when γ and i τ connectivity metrics are used it is recommended to choose a higher cutoff threshold as long as it does not artificially classify the fracture as non percolating credit authorship contribution statement hoda javanmard methodology formal

193,rough rock fractures have complex geometries which result in highly heterogeneous aperture fields to accurately estimate the permeability of such fractures heterogeneity of the aperture fields must be quantified in this study heterogeneity of single rough rock fractures is for the first time parametrized by connectivity metrics which quantify how connected the bounds of a heterogeneous field are we use 3000 individual realizations of synthetic aperture fields with different statistical parameters and compute three connectivity metrics based on percolation theory for each realization the sensitivity of the connectivity metrics with respect to the determining parameter i e the cutoff threshold is studied and the correlation between permeability of the fractures and the computed connectivity metrics is presented the results show that the θ connectivity metric predicts the permeability with higher accuracy all three studied connectivity metrics provide better permeability estimations when a larger aperture value is chosen as the cutoff threshold overall this study elucidates that using connectivity metrics provides a less expensive alternative to fluid flow simulations when an estimation of fracture permeability is desired keywords connectivity rough fractures permeability percolation theory 1 introduction accurately estimating the permeability of rough rock fractures is an important element of the design and implementation of projects such as oil and gas recovery javanmard et al 2019 nuclear waste disposal bear et al 1996 co2 geo sequestration rutqvist et al 2007 sohal et al 2021 and fracture dominated geothermal reservoirs such as enhanced geothermal systems kittilä et al 2020a b gischig et al 2020 kittilä et al 2019 amann et al 2018 zhao et al 2015 sahimi 2011 the most commonly used method for estimating the fracture permeability is the cubic law which assumes that the fracture walls are smooth and parallel boussinesq 1868 the cubic law relates the flow rate through a fracture to a corresponding hydraulic aperture e h which is assumed to be constant in the fracture plane witherspoon et al 1980 however rock fractures are known to be rough and non homogeneous in nature barton et al 1985 raven and gale 1985 pyrak nolte and morris 2000 vogler et al 2017 and therefore the hydraulic aperture in the cubic law is commonly estimated by the arithmetic mean of the aperture field numerous studies have shown that the cubic law only provides acceptable fracture permeability when the mean aperture is relatively large witherspoon et al 1980 pyrak nolte et al 1987 renshaw 1995 sisavath et al 2003 liu 2005 vogler et al 2016a this suggests that mean aperture alone is not capable of fully describing the heterogeneity of the aperture field in rough fractures with heterogeneous aperture fields the fluid flows through preferential paths which provide the least resistance to flow this causes the flow field in a rough fracture to be highly channelized meaning that most of the fluid flows through a small proportion of the fracture plane tsang 1984 tsang and tsang 1989 fluid flow channelling further increases when fractures deform under stress and contact areas expand unger and mase 1993 and vogler et al 2018 to capture the impact of the flow field heterogeneity and its impact on the fracture permeability estimation several permeability formulas were proposed that incorporate statistical parameters such as standard deviation of the aperture field rasouli and hosseinian 2011 xie et al 2015 fractional contact area zimmerman et al 1992 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 yeo 2001 and correlation length of the aperture field pyrak nolte and nolte 2016 wang and cardenas 2016 however studies in the context of porous media have shown that local permeability fields with almost identical arithmetic mean variance and semi variograms can have significantly different effective permeability values western et al 2001 krishnan and journel 2003 renard and allard 2013 this is attributed to the fact that these parameters fail to infer information about the continuity of flow paths between two locations within the porous medium even though this continuity is the main driver of the permeability for example the semi variogram provides information about the likelihood of two locations having similar values but does not provide any information about the values between the two locations this suggests that the conventional single and two point statistical parameters are not adequate to estimate the effective permeability of porous media to achieve a better understanding of the flow and transport properties of the field it is therefore important to gain information about the continuity of the flow paths which can be quantified with so called connectivity metrics saar and manga 1999 western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 davis et al 2011 bernabé and maineult 2015 renard and allard 2013 different metrics have been proposed to study the role of connectivity in flow and transport processes in porous media and fracture networks several studies mariethoz et al 2010 davis et al 2011 renard et al 2011 suggest that including the connectivity information inferred from the field observations in the regeneration of stochastic reservoir models results in more realistic outcomes it has been shown that connectivity metrics can provide efficient estimations of the flow and transport properties of both fractured berkowitz 2002 xu et al 2006 sanderson and nixon 2015 bisdom et al 2017 and intact reservoirs bernabé et al 2010 tyukhova and willmann 2016 king 1990 shows that there is a universal relationship between the connectivity effective permeability and well spacing for a simple sand body model of an oil reservoir he suggests that this finding can be of practical use for reservoir engineers in helping them estimate the recoverable oil without performing reservoir simulations for many realizations as is common practice ganguly and misra 2021 computed the connectivity of oil gas and water phases during a water alternating gas wag enhanced oil recovery experiment they found that using connectivity metrics in addition to conventionally used phase saturation values results in better estimation of efficiency of each injection cycle and therefore can be used to optimize the wag injection strategy it has been suggested that the concept of connectivity is also applicable to flow and transport in single rough fractures mourzenko et al 1996 bernabé et al 2011 however the idea has not yet been quantitatively explored quantifying the connectivity of different kinds of heterogeneous fields is commonly achieved using percolation theory king 1990 saar and manga 1999 saar et al 2001 walsh and saar 2008 sahimi 2011 davis et al 2011 a brief introduction of which is provided in section 2 3 while percolation theory has not been previously studied in the context of connectivity metrics in rough fractures it has been explored for the relationship between the percolation threshold and geometry of the fracture mourzenko et al 1996 studied the relationship between the size and properties of the so called percolating cluster in a rough fracture to the properties of self affine fracture surfaces in a later study mourzenko et al 1999 found a power law relationship between the heat conductivity of self affine fractures and the statistical parameters of the rough surfaces and aperture using percolation theory suggesting that percolation theory can be used to quantify transport processes in fractures mourzenko et al 2001 subsequently showed that the hydraulic aperture of self affine fractures can be described as a power law function of the fractional open area and the percolation probability where the power is a function of the surface roughness they mourzenko et al 2018 have also arrived at a relationship between the transport coefficient of rough fractures with gaussian spatial correlation and the geometrical characteristics of the fracture surfaces and the aperture previous studies mourzenko et al 1996 1999 2001 2018 used percolation theory to relate the indicators of flow and transport processes to the geometry of rough fractures however the potential relationship between the common connectivity metrics and indicators of flow and transport in rough fractures has not been explored moreover the geometry of the fractures in these studies was defined by the properties of the fracture surfaces however it is the geometry and topology of the aperture field rather than the two fracture surfaces that determine the physical processes inside the fracture rasouli and hosseinian 2011 in this study we investigate for the first time if common percolation based connectivity metrics can provide information about the permeability of deformed fractures to systematically and comprehensively study this subject with strong statistical reliability we utilized a large database of 3000 synthetic aperture fields with varying statistical properties such as standard deviation and correlation length the studied aperture fields also exhibit varying degrees of deformation under normal stress and hence have a range of fractional contact area which controls the connectivity of the field we then explore the appropriate ways to compute common connectivity metrics in single rough and deformed fractures and study the sensitivity of each connectivity metric to the determining percolation based parameter i e the cutoff threshold a comparison of the performance of the studied connectivity metrics in predicting permeability of rough fractures is presented 2 methodology to study the relationship between fracture permeability and connectivity we build upon a database of synthetic aperture fields from a previous study javanmard et al 2021 the process of aperture field generation and the fluid flow simulations are briefly presented in this section interested readers are referred to our previous publication for more in depth information about this database javanmard et al 2021 the three metrics employed to evaluate the connectivity of the fractures are then introduced in detail 2 1 generation of synthetic aperture fields log normally distributed random aperture fields are synthesized using the g stat package in r pebesma 2004 according to the specified parameters reported in table 1 the aperture fields are discretized by 401 401 160801 uniform square grid cells of size 0 25 by 0 25 mm2 in the xy plane fig 1c representing aperture fields of size 100 by 100 mm2 the generated aperture fields all have the same mean e 0 240 mm but two different standard deviations σ 0 070 and 0 170 mm which allows investigation of the impact of roughness on connectivity aperture roughness is quantified by the relative standard deviation σ e in this study zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 yeo 2001 wang and cardenas 2016 guo et al 2016 kling et al 2017 we have imposed isotropic exponential semi variograms on the generated aperture fields with 5 different ranges to generate aperture fields with different correlation lengths the correlation length of 1 mm corresponding to 0 01 of the dimension of the aperture fields represents a random uncorrelated field and is used to compare the behaviour of initially correlated and uncorrelated aperture fields for each set of statistical parameters 30 realizations of aperture fields are generated this data set of the aperture fields with different standard deviations and correlation lengths is used to study the effect of roughness and correlation length on the connectivity of the field the grid size is chosen carefully to be much smaller than the smallest correlation length of the aperture fields ensuring reliability of the results of deformation and fluid flow simulations prodanov et al 2014 a sensitivity analysis on the impact of the grid size on fluid flow simulations is presented in our previous publication javanmard et al 2021 a sensitivity analysis on the impact of the grid size on the results presented in this paper shows that the results incur a relative error of 2 3 5 compared to the results obtained from a grid size that is four times smaller table 1 in the supporting information considering the high computational cost of simulations employing finer resolutions the chosen grid size provides sufficiently high accuracies for this study the generated aperture fields are then numerically deformed under 10 distinct normal stress levels as presented in table 1 using pyco a contact mechanics model pastewka 2020 fig 1b c qualitatively illustrates the impact of normal loading on the aperture fields and the grid cells pyco computes the deformed aperture fields under specified normal stress using a boundary element method which is solved with a fast fourier transform fft based convolution weber et al 2018 kling et al 2018 grimm lima et al 2018 2020b a the elastic deformation of the aperture fields is modelled assuming mechanical properties of grimsel granodiorite with a young s modulus of 11 gpa and a poisson ratio of 0 25 vogler et al 2016b vogler 2016 vogler et al 2018 kling et al 2018 the first stress level is deliberately chosen to be low to bring the fracture sides into contact without altering the geometry of the aperture field the output of the contact mechanics simulation is 3000 individual realizations of aperture fields 10 stress levels 2 aperture standard deviations 5 aperture field correlation lengths and 30 realizations for each set of statistical properties which forms the database analysed for this study the first applied load on the fractures reduces the local apertures in the field without deformation although the aperture mean is reduced in this step all other statistical parameters e g the standard deviation and the spatial aperture distribution remain intact therefore the initially generated aperture fields are not included in the studied data set and the fractures under 0 5 kpa of normal stress are referred to as unloaded fractures hereafter the aperture field realizations exhibit varying amounts of fractional contact area between 0 to 24 due to the deformation caused by normal loading which considerably affects the resulting flow field channelling tsang 1984 oron and berkowitz 1998 and hence the connectivity of the aperture fields mourzenko et al 1996 2 2 fluid flow simulation numerical simulation of steady state single phase fully saturated fluid flow through the fractures are performed using the multiphysics object oriented simulation environment moose numerical modelling framework permann et al 2020 the saintbernard application which provides additional capabilities to moose schädle 2020 is used to handle the fracture grid the porousflow module in moose green et al 2018 wilkins et al 2020 is used to solve the local cubic law lcl equation dirichlet boundary conditions of constant fluid pressures are applied to the left and right boundaries and neumann boundary conditions of no flow are imposed to the top and bottom boundaries of the fractures fig 1a these boundary conditions enforce a flow direction from the left to the right side of the fracture field x axis direction the imposed fluid pressure difference between the lateral bounds of the model is 80 pa which ensures reynolds re numbers of less than unity for all realizations results of an lcl solution in planar fractures where the re number is less than unity are reported to be very similar to the solution of the navier stokes equations brush and thomson 2003 so the lcl is likely to constitute a reasonable approach for this study our fluid flow simulations provide the flow field in each fracture from which the flow rate into each fracture is computed the permeability of fractures are then calculated using darcy s law 1 q k a p μ where q is the volumetric flow rate m3 s k is the permeability m2 a is the cross sectional area of the fracture m2 p is the fluid pressure gradient over the length of the fracture pa m and μ is the dynamic fluid viscosity pa s 2 3 connectivity metrics percolation theory first introduced in statistical physics broadbent and hammersley 1957 provides the tools to model the connectivity of geometrically complex systems therefore before exploring the connectivity metrics a brief introduction to percolation theory is presented in the simplest form of percolation theory namely discrete percolation theory fig 2 a network is considered where the sites e g nodes can be regarded as either occupied or unoccupied occupied neighbouring sites then form a distinct cluster there are different ways of defining the neighbourhood two sites can be considered neighbours if they share a site node a bond edge or a face surface in 3d fields in a 2d model if the neighbourhood is defined when a bond is shared each site can have a maximum of 4 neighbours and if the neighbourhood is defined when a site is shared each site can have a maximum of 8 neighbours these types of neighbouring definition in 2d fields result in 4 and 8 neighbouring schemes respectively as illustrated in fig 2b c the cluster identification in this study follows the 8 neighbouring scheme fig 2 which is the more realistic approach in clustering the heterogeneous field percolation theory investigates how the shape and size of the clusters evolve as a function of probability of site occupation p and their impact on the overall properties of the network the percolation threshold p c for example is defined as an occupation probability at which the small and isolated clusters formed at lower occupation probabilities p p c coalesce and form a larger connected cluster that spans the entire field stauffer and aharony 1992 to apply percolation theory to a heterogeneous aperture field of a rough fracture a cutoff aperture threshold z is applied to the field designating grid cells as either open or closed to flow this threshold transforms the aperture field into a binary field of permeable and impermeable phases depending on the aperture values being above or below the chosen cutoff threshold respectively the cutoff threshold resulting in at least one cluster that connects the two sides of the fracture in the direction of flow is the percolation threshold the percolation threshold is commonly specified in the form of probability which in the context of rough fractures translates into the fraction of the permeable phase there usually exists only one percolating cluster in a heterogeneous field mourzenko et al 1996 and the percolation threshold indicates whether the fracture is open to flow however the percolation threshold does not provide any information on the connectivity or the permeability of the percolating fracture to obtain this information several percolation theory based connectivity metrics have previously been suggested in the literature this study investigates if these connectivity metrics can decipher information about the permeability of a fracture in a percolating regime connectivity metrics are commonly classified as either static structural or dynamic functional bracken et al 2013 renard and allard 2013 while static connectivity metrics are computed solely from the geometry of the field the dynamic connectivity metrics depend on the specific process under investigation and the applied boundary conditions the utilized connectivity metrics can infer information about the connectivity in the vicinity of specific points local metrics for example a well or the entire field global metrics the aim of this study is to investigate if the connectivity metrics can provide a good indication of the permeability of the entire field without the information from the fluid flow simulations or experiments therefore we only consider the most common global and static connectivity metrics as listed by renard at al renard and allard 2013 as follows 1 θ z defined as the probability of two sites e g nodes belonging to the largest cluster renard and allard 2013 willems et al 2017 the value of this metric can range from almost zero when all clusters are small and scattered to 1 when the whole field is in the permeable phase in some references this connectivity metric is called the percolation probability defined slightly differently from the probability of sites belonging to the percolating cluster and is calculated as the proportion of the volume in 3d of the percolating cluster to the total volume of the field king 1990 hovadik and larue 2007 sadeghnejad et al 2011 given this definition the connectivity metric is zero below the percolation threshold and its value can change from zero to one above the percolation threshold for percolating fractures both definitions i e two sites belonging to the largest cluster vs belonging to the percolating cluster result in identical values we have used the first definition in this study as it provides a more general quantification of connectivity of heterogeneous fields 2 γ z defined as the probability of a pair of sites distinct or not belonging to the same cluster this connectivity metric is referred to as two point correlation function in other studies davis et al 2011 specifically γ z is computed as the proportion of the number of connected pairs to all the pairs in the permeable phase 2 γ z 1 n p 2 i 1 n n i 2 where n p is the number of sites in the permeable phase n is the number of clusters and n i is the number of sites in cluster i the value of this connectivity metric can change continuously from almost zero when the clusters are small and isolated to one when the whole permeable phase belongs to the same cluster 3 i τ z integral scale of the connectivity function is a multi point statistical parameter this connectivity metric reports the average length of the continuous paths between the bounds of the heterogeneous field allard 1994 western et al 2001 the connectivity function τ h z indicates the probability that two sites separated by a distance lag vector of size h both have a value above the threshold z and are connected denoted by 3 τ h z p x x h z x h z z x z the integral scale of the connectivity function is defined as 4 i τ z 0 τ h z d h which expresses the average distance over which the points above threshold z are connected a large value of this connectivity metric implies that there are abundant connected bands within the field previous studies western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 showed that the connectivity function is only capable of properly capturing connectivity of the field when it is computed in the local or average direction of the flow in this study the connectivity function is computed in the average direction of the fluid flow along the x axis fig 1 for each directional lag distance h between 0 and 401 pixels the number of pixels in the same cluster with directional lag distance h is divided by the total number of pixel pairs in the permeable phase connected or not with the same directional lag distance once the connectivity function for the specific cutoff threshold is computed for all possible lag distances the integral of the function provides the integral scale of the connectivity function in this paper we normalize this connectivity metric by the length of the field so that its value can be readily compared with the other two connectivity metrics 3 results and discussions 3 1 connectivity metrics all three studied connectivity metrics are functions of the chosen cutoff threshold which transforms the aperture field into a binary field of permeable and impermeable phases highlighted in grey and colour respectively in fig 3a e fig 3 illustrates how the choice of the cutoff threshold affects the size of clusters and the connectivity function for one realization a critical probability exists in percolation theory fig 3c above which the investigated heterogeneous field percolates meaning that a cluster in the permeable phase spans the entire field in terms of the heterogeneous aperture fields the critical percolation probability or percolation threshold is the fraction of the fracture in the permeable phase above which a percolating cluster exists fig 3f shows how the connectivity function evolves versus the lag distance and the applied cutoff threshold quantified as the fraction of the permeable phase when fractures are in the percolating regime fig 3a b the connectivity function remains high for most lag distances and it never reaches zero at the largest possible lag distance since there is at least one cluster having the same length as the fracture when the fraction of the permeable phase is below the percolation threshold fig 3d e the connectivity function decreases quickly and reaches zero at a lag distance well below the length of the fracture meaning that no inter connected band is present between the left and right edges i e in the direction of the connectivity measurement of the model this is because the clusters are small and scattered and therefore as the lag distance increases the probability of two points being connected tends to zero table 2 shows how the three connectivity metrics and the number of clusters are affected by the choice of the cutoff thresholds presented in fig 3 it can be seen that as the fraction of the permeable phase is gradually decreased all three connectivity metrics also decrease and the number of clusters increases since the connectivity metrics are affected considerably by the cutoff threshold choosing an appropriate cutoff threshold is an important step in computing the connectivity of fractures however before investigating the impact of the cutoff threshold on the connectivity metrics we report on the percolation threshold of the studied data set 3 1 1 percolation threshold table 3 shows the average percolation threshold in terms of the probability of the permeable phase for aperture fields with different initial standard deviations and correlation lengths and under different loads to compute the percolation threshold of each realization the cutoff threshold was successively increased from zero aperture until the percolating cluster disappeared the probability of the permeable phase of the last percolating fracture is reported as the percolation threshold the analysis in line with previous studies on percolation thresholds of 2d finite grids renard and allard 2013 and rough fractures mourzenko et al 2018 shows that when more than about 50 of the fracture plane is open to flow on average the fractures are in the percolating regime the percolation threshold is affected by the size knudby et al 2006 sadeghnejad et al 2011 dimension king 1990 hovadik and larue 2007 renard and allard 2013 neighbourhood definition stauffer and aharony 1992 and the correlation length of the field harter 2005 hovadik and larue 2007 and thus it is difficult to compute and compare values among studies the percolation threshold observed in our study generally increases as the applied stress and the initial correlation length of the fractures increase this trend is caused by the fact that the fractional contact area of the fractures also increase as the initial correlation length and the stress increase javanmard et al 2021 this is in line with observations made by mourzenko et al 2018 who suggest that the percolation threshold depends on the fractional open space of the fracture the fractures with initially higher standard deviation generally have a lower percolation threshold this observation can again be linked to the fact that the aperture fields with initially higher standard deviations deform less under stress and therefore have a lower fractional contact area javanmard et al 2021 mourzenko et al 1996 suggest that the percolation threshold depends also on the roughness exponent of the fracture surfaces since the roughness in the current study is quantified by the relative standard deviation of the aperture field a direct comparison with the results presented by mourzenko et al 1996 is not possible 3 1 2 sensitivity to the cutoff threshold to compute the connectivity metrics a cutoff threshold needs to be chosen to divide the fracture plane into permeable and impermeable phases as demonstrated in table 2 and fig 2 the connectivity metrics of one particular realization are shown to be sensitive to the chosen cutoff threshold this section studies the sensitivity of different connectivity metrics to the cutoff thresholds of zero 10 20 and 30 μ m for the entire data set zero aperture can be considered a natural cutoff threshold for fractures which divides the aperture field into contact impermeable phase and flow permeable phase area mourzenko et al 1996 1999 thus the connectivity metrics computed with the cutoff threshold of zero aperture are considered the base case for the sensitivity analysis and therefore a closer look at the impact of different statistical parameters on the connectivity metrics based on a zero aperture cutoff threshold is presented fig 4 shows how the connectivity metrics with a cutoff threshold of zero change under applied normal load and for realizations with different initial correlation lengths and roughness values a cutoff threshold of zero results in the fracture plane being divided into contact and flow regions all connectivity metrics of the unloaded fractures show the maximum connectivity value of one the unloaded fractures have a few isolated contact points forming the impermeable phase and therefore one cluster covers the entire field which results in the maximum value of the connectivity metrics as the stress applied on the fracture increases the value of all the connectivity metrics reduces increasing normal stress increases the fractional contact area javanmard et al 2021 and thus reduces the fraction of the permeable phase and the size of clusters which result in lower connectivity values the reduction is much smaller for the connectivity metrics γ and i τ compared to the θ connectivity metric as isolated clusters are accounted for when computing γ and i τ whereas the θ connectivity metric only considers the size of the largest cluster accounting for the size of the smaller isolated clusters partially compensates the reduction observed in the size of the largest cluster in computation of γ and i τ connectivity metrics all three connectivity metrics show greater reduction in connectivity versus stress as the initial correlation length increases the value of the connectivity metrics is also lower for the fractures with initial higher standard deviation i e initially rougher aperture fields both trends reflect the observed changes in fractional contact area versus stress javanmard et al 2021 where the fractional contact area is smaller for fractures with lower initial correlation length and standard deviation although contact or zero aperture is a reasonable choice the cutoff thresholds applied in the context of porous media are generally non zero western et al 2001 knudby and carrera 2005 hovadik and larue 2007 therefore this study also applies a range of non zero cutoff thresholds namely 10 20 and 30 μ m to the investigated data set the highest applied cutoff threshold 30 μ m results in 20 of the aperture fields being in the non percolating regime table 4 since we know from the fluid flow simulations that most of these fractures are open to flow it can be concluded that such a cutoff threshold artificially categorizes some fractures as non percolating therefor no higher cutoff thresholds are studied to quantify the sensitivity of different connectivity metrics to the chosen cutoff threshold the manhattan distance nisbet et al 2009 between the connectivity metrics for each cutoff threshold and the connectivity metric with zero aperture cutoff threshold was computed the manhattan distance was used for the sensitivity analysis in this study as it is an appropriate distance metric for high dimensional data as an example eq 5 shows how the manhattan distance was calculated for the sensitivity analysis of i τ connectivity metric with the calculation of the manhattan distance d for θ and γ being analogous 5 d i 1 n i τ z 0 i i τ z x i where d is the distance n is the number of realizations and x is replaced with the value of the cutoff threshold for example 10 20 and 30 μ m table 4 shows the sensitivity of the connectivity metric to the chosen cutoff threshold all connectivity metrics show sensitivity to the chosen cutoff threshold with the sensitivity of the θ connectivity metric being most pronounced increasing the cutoff threshold causes the largest cluster to shrink and more isolated and small clusters to appear fig 3 as explained before in computation of the θ connectivity metric only the size of the largest cluster is considered whereas in computation of the γ and i τ connectivity metrics the size of all clusters are taken into account which reduces the sensitivity of these connectivity metrics to the cutoff threshold the sensitivities of the two connectivity metrics γ and i τ to the cutoff threshold behave very similarly as the connectivity metric γ eq 2 and the connectivity function eq 3 are related according to eq 6 renard and allard 2013 it is logical that the connectivity metrics γ and i τ show very similar behaviour 6 h τ h γ n p 3 2 permeability estimation in this section we investigate how well the computed connectivity metrics can predict the permeability of fractures following the general concept of percolation theory and the relationships suggested by previous researchers mourzenko et al 2001 bernabé et al 2010 tyukhova and willmann 2016 the permeability is related to the connectivity through a power law relationship such as 7 k a x b where k is the permeability x is the connectivity metric and a and b are fitting coefficients building on these previous works the relationship between the permeability obtained from flow simulations on the investigated aperture fields as explained in section 2 2 and the computed connectivity metrics was computed the fitting coefficients a and b and the coefficient of determination r 2 for each cutoff threshold are reported in table 5 and a visual presentation of the fitted relationship to the connectivity metrics with a cutoff threshold of 30 μ m is presented in fig 5 the r 2 value for the correlation between permeability and the θ connectivity metric lies around 70 which only increases slightly as the cutoff threshold increases the accuracy of permeability prediction by γ and i τ connectivity metrics also generally increases with the cutoff threshold in general as the cutoff threshold increases the prediction accuracy of all three connectivity metrics also increases with increasing cutoff threshold the aperture field is increasingly removed from a binary separation solely based on contact and non contact area this observation is supported by previous research on fracture flow which shows that large regions with open apertures may not contribute to the flow field javanmard et al 2021 ishibashi et al 2015 watanabe et al 2009 numerical and experimental evidence further demonstrates that the fluid does not flow in the proximity of the contact points between the fracture surfaces li et al 2008 yeo 2001 therefore it seems that non zero cutoff thresholds are more suited to capture the real flow field than the zero cutoff threshold however care must be taken in choosing the cutoff threshold for the trade off between the accuracy of the permeability prediction and the percentage of the non percolating fractures table 4 as explained before higher cutoff thresholds may deem fracture realizations that are open to flow as non percolating therefore it is important to choose a cutoff threshold that optimally balances the accuracy of the permeability prediction and accuracy of the percolation status of the fracture the θ connectivity metric predicts the fracture permeability consistently with the highest accuracy i e highest r 2 value when compared to the other two connectivity metrics the strength of the θ connectivity metric can be attributed to the fact that it is computed solely based on the property of the largest percolating cluster while γ and i τ consider smaller and non percolating clusters as well in reality the isolated high aperture regions in the fracture plane may not contribute to the flow field equally if they are not connected amongst each other and can be seen as isolated regions of the fracture somewhat similar to disconnected pores in porous media thus accounting for them in the computation of connectivity metrics may not capture the physical processes occurring when fluids flow through fractures in general the connectivity metric that consistently predicts the fracture permeability with the highest accuracy is the θ connectivity metric although the value of this connectivity metric is more sensitive to the chosen cutoff threshold table 4 the coefficient of the determination is not considerably affected by this choice therefore the θ connectivity metric shows advantages over the γ and i τ connectivity metrics in predicting fracture permeability when the γ and i τ connectivity metrics are used for permeability predictions a higher cutoff threshold should be preferred to achieve higher prediction accuracies the computation of connectivity metrics does not require any additional information about the geometry of the fractures besides the information needed to perform fluid flow simulations however in contrast to fluid flow simulations computing the connectivity metrics is computationally inexpensive most programming languages already provide efficient functions for clustering 2d and 3d heterogeneous fields and once the clusters are identified computation of the connectivity metrics is quickly achieved in comparison performing simulations of fluid flow through fractures requires special simulation software e g lattice boltzmann simulators and some expertise on the part of the operator additional thought has to be given to 3d flow effects mass conservation and other problems therefore fluid flow simulations in rough fractures are computationally more complex and expensive compared to the computation of the connectivity metrics our study shows that the investigated connectivity metrics can be useful means in predicting the fracture permeability it should be noted that in this study we have attempted to predict the permeability of a large data set of rough and deformed fractures with large variations in geometrical properties solely by the value of a connectivity metric in reality the permeabilities of rough fractures under normal stresses are given by a complex function of different geometrical and topological parameters of the fracture therefore in most previously proposed fracture permeability models several parameters describing the properties of the fracture are included javanmard et al 2021 kling et al 2017 jin et al 2017 xie et al 2015 xiong et al 2011 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 although these fracture permeability models are more complex compared to the relationships presented in our study their accuracies in predicting permeability particularly for fractures deformed under stress are not much higher phillips et al 2021 javanmard et al 2021 our permeability predictions based on the connectivity metrics are already comparable to those predicted by the previously proposed significantly more complex models therefore we expect that including other critical parameters in a new permeability model besides the connectivity metrics can lead to more accurate permeability predictions this study has focused on the relationship between the connectivity metrics and the fracture permeability however it is worth to investigate the role of connectivity in other physical processes such as advective and diffusive solute and heat transport in rough fractures as has previously been done in the context of transport porous media knudby and carrera 2005 tyukhova and willmann 2016 another aspect of the current study that can be investigated further is the possible effect of the third dimension on the connectivity metrics 4 conclusion a large database of synthetic heterogeneous aperture fields of single rough fractures with different realistic statistical properties was investigated for the applicability of the connectivity concept from percolation theory the synthesized fracture aperture fields range from uncorrelated to highly correlated and have two different standard deviations to represent different fracture roughness levels the aperture fields were deformed under 10 distinct normal stress levels in a numerical experiment and exhibit fractional contact area ranging from zero to 24 the permeability of each realization was computed from the fluid flow simulations the following conclusions can be made from the results presented in this study connectivity metrics three commonly used global and static connectivity metrics based on percolation threshold namely the θ γ and i τ were defined and computed with four different cutoff thresholds for each rough and deformed aperture field realization appropriate choice of the cutoff threshold as higher cutoff thresholds cause more fractures to be in the non percolating regime care must be taken when choosing a cutoff threshold when the cutoff threshold is increased for the studied database more fractures that are open to flow based on the fluid flow simulations are categorized as non percolating therefore it should be noted that the optimum cutoff threshold should correctly classify fractures as percolating or non percolating sensitivity of the connectivity metrics to the chosen cutoff threshold the sensitivity of each connectivity metric to the chosen cutoff threshold was computed the θ connectivity metric shows the highest sensitivity to the chosen cutoff threshold although all three connectivity metrics are affected by the chosen cutoff threshold permeability prediction using connectivity metrics fracture permeability predictions from connectivity metrics by a power law relationship were performed with higher cutoff thresholds being found to be more accurate the θ connectivity metric predicts the fracture permeability with the highest accuracy compared to the other two connectivity metrics the accuracy of the permeability prediction employing the θ connectivity metric is almost unaffected by the chosen cutoff threshold and therefore the θ connectivity metric can be the preferred connectivity metric to predict fracture permeabilities when γ and i τ connectivity metrics are used it is recommended to choose a higher cutoff threshold as long as it does not artificially classify the fracture as non percolating credit authorship contribution statement hoda javanmard methodology formal

certain nonwetting fluids fluid solid chemical interactions lead to pinning of fluid interfaces and the fairly enhanced hysteresis observed for some nonwetting fluids overall this study suggests that contact angle is a result of the interplay between pore geometry and the forces deforming the fluid interface including surface chemical interactions and thus despite traditional practice contact angle alone is not always an accurate metric for wettability keywords multi phase flow contact angle hysteresis wettability thermodynamics youngs equation 1 introduction flow of immiscible fluids through a porous matrix is of great importance in many natural and engineered processes such as water uptake in plant roots secondary oil recovery from reservoir rocks co2 sequestration water purification water retention in soil and ink spreading on paper to name a few e g singh et al 2019 one of the conditions that distinguishes this flow is the significance of capillary forces that act on the contact line of fluids and porous solids in the slow flow regime capillary forces dominate other forces such as gravitational and viscous contributions and can be the main driving force in a variety of small scale processes arising in hydrology biology and environmental science and engineering capillary forces are strongly affected by wettability of the pore walls one of the most important properties of a porous medium that controls the dynamics of slow fluid displacement and determines the magnitude of the external force required to induce flow wettability indicates the relative tendency of fluids to adhere to a solid and is conventionally quantified by the angle the fluid interface forms with the solid surface in mechanical equilibrium fluids with a contact angle smaller than 90 are thus known as wetting fluids if the contact angle of the interface exceeds 90 the fluid is considered nonwetting singh et al 2019 in the natural environment for example wettability state determines trapping potential for secure storage of co2 in the subsurface a water wet formation has the potential to effectively trap large amounts of supercritical co2 a nonwetting fluid however if the formation has undergone wettability alteration and is no longer dominantly water wet the capillary trapping mechanism can be significantly affected decreasing the trapping potential an increase in contact angle can also greatly enhance buoyancy effects and thereby decrease storage security as co2 more easily will migrate upwards through potential escape pathways faults and structural or engineered defects similar wettability effects may be encountered in groundwater remediation enhanced oil recovery operations etc in the so called quasi static flow regime it is sometimes effective to model the flow as a series of fluid configurations at equilibrium state with different force balance and saturation level associated with each state primkulov et al 2019 the contact angle for the situation of stable fluid configurations is termed static for a smooth and homogeneous surface the static contact angle is traditionally assumed to be an invariant property of a system this means that it is not influenced by the geometry of the system or non capillary forces such as pinning forces and fluid pressure induced by external sources acting on the interfaces this assumption partly stems from the work of thomas young young 1805 in which he asserted that the contact angle depends only on the materials and in no other way on the conditions of the problem however several recent studies aided by advances in pore scale imaging technologies have recognized that contact angle values also depend on geometry and or kinetics of flow and that a distribution of contact angles exist at static conditions within a uniformly wet porous material blunt et al 2019 alratrout et al 2018 2017 scanziani et al 2017 armstrong et al 2021 yet there is still no consensus regarding the effect of phenomena such as contact line pinning and contact angle hysteresis on average contact angle measurements contact angle hysteresis is defined solely as the difference between advancing and receding contact angles for a contact line moving in opposite direction at the same velocity eral and oh 2013 on the basis of young s assertion it is common practice to use contact angle as an input parameter for pinpointing the free fluid interfaces in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of multiphase flow although the treatment of interfaces in both theoretical and numerical studies is well established the description of contact lines and the correspondingly distributed contact angles is still under development huber et al 2016 because of a historical lack of direct contact angle measurements inside pores most current models suffer uncertainty regarding the detailed understanding of the location and nature of contact angles in porous media thus contact angle is often ignored i e the porous medium is assumed to be water wet or treated as an input parameter to numerical models simply to capture the effect of capillary pressure saturation pc s hysteresis in the latter case distinct constant values are applied for each branch of the pc s curve based on simplified measurements such as the drop plate method and usbm united states bureau of mines e g donaldson et al 1969 and amott indices amott 1959 yet a robust pore scale numerical model requires knowledge of in situ distributed contact angle values for different modes during flow to better understand how contact angle varies during multi phase flow this work presents experimentally measured distributions of contact angles inside a porous matrix at different flow stages using x ray micro computed tomography imaging based on these measurements we propose an alternative perspective on contact angle the geometry perspective which supports a more comprehensive interpretation of the data obtained specifically by helping us assess the effects of interfacial curvature and pore structure on contact angle 2 methods this study uses existing datasets based on the works of paustian 2018 paustian et al 2021 schlüter et al 2016 and meisenheimer et al 2020 the reconstructed 3d images acquired from x ray micro tomography are processed according to the procedures described in the above mentioned sources image processing included contrast enhancement filtering and segmentation details were reported in the cited publications 2 1 fluid flow experiments the quasi static flow experiments are conducted using randomly packed soda lime silica glass beads the glass beads are naturally water wet hydrophilic however for part of the study the wettability of the beads was altered paustian 2018 so some experiments were conducted using a water wet system and some in a fractionally wet system to change the wettability hydrophobization the surface of the glass beads was chemically treated with trichloro octadecyl silane flow experiments were conducted by infusing or withdrawing wetting fluid to achieve the desired saturation at constant low flow rates table 1 for most experiments the flow was stopped at various saturation stages to allow the interfaces to relax prior to imaging satisfying the quasi static flow assumption table 1 summarizes experiment characteristics for each dataset 2 2 contact angle measurements the local contact angles are measured using an algorithm based on the work of scanziani et al 2017 which was further developed as discussed in behnoudfar 2020 briefly the algorithm consists of the following steps 1 the contact points defined as the point of intersection of the three fluid fluid solid phases are identified within the segmented three dimensional images 2 a contact line is created from all of the points identified in step 1 3 for each contact point a 2d slice is generated which is normal to the contact line at each point of contact 4 the contact angle is then automatically measured on this slice through the wetting phase these steps are depicted in fig 1 the algorithm is applied to measure several hundred in situ contact angles in the entire imaged section for each water saturation state sw further detail is provided in behnoudfar 2020 2 3 mean curvature to calculate the average mean curvature of an interface the triangular discretized surface is locally approximated by a quadratic form the eigenvalues of the quadratic form correspond to the principal curvatures due to the inherent limits of x ray imaging as well as potential unavoidable segmentation errors the curvature values that are close to the solid bead surface are not as accurate as the curvatures further away from the beads to account for this li et al 2018 developed a method that weighted the average curvatures based on their distance to a solid surface and also further reduced the effect of proximity to the solid surfaces by clipping the surfaces thus the distance of each triangle to the edge of the surface is measured and triangles that fall within 20 of the maximum distance from the edge are removed prior to calculating the distance weighted curvature average the choice of 20 of the maximum distance was addressed in detail in li et al 2018 and resulted in estimated curvatures with accuracy overall of 94 5 and for pores with radii in excess of 50 voxels the accuracy is increased to 99 8 as compared to externally measured pressure transducer values 3 results and discussion to understand how contact angle evolves during quasi static flow this section presents the measurements for four different fluid pairs i dodecane water in a water wet two phase system ii decane water air in three phase system one water wet and one fractionally wet iii soltrol water air in three phase water wet system and iv air water in a two phase water wet system the section then explores the correlation between contact angle fluid fluid curvature and pore structure 3 1 hysteresis patterns a consistent trend in the average contact angle values is evident for decane water and dodecane water in both the two phase and three phase systems containing only water wet beads figs 2 a d during the drainage cycle the contact angle initially decreases rapidly by 20 30 and then becomes monotonic as oil invades the system during imbibition it gradually rises eventually approaching the value observed at the beginning of drainage thus forming a loop this trend is also seen in the fractionally wet system for those interfaces in contact with the water wet non chemically treated beads fig 2 g however the separation between the drainage and imbibition contact angles becomes relatively minor near the oil wet chemically treated beads by contrast soltrol water and air water pairs display a completely different behavior and exhibit little difference between the drainage and imbibition contact angles fig 3 the air water system also differs in that the contact angle associated with imbibition is lower than drainage unlike what is observed for the oil water systems these observed patterns initially led us to the important question why is contact angle hysteresis so much more pronounced in the dodecane decane nonwetting phase systems compared to the systems where soltrol or air act as the nonwetting phase fig 2 also shows the distributions of contact angles associated with each datapoint illustrated in the average contact angle plots looking at the transitions of the distribution curves for the fractionally wet system we notice an interesting effect as imbibition progresses the distribution evolves from a peak with an average below 90 fig 2 i sw 0 04 into a peak with an average above 90 sw 0 93 which is unexpected for water wet beads also we observe an inflection point for imbibition sw 0 17 at which the former peak becomes less significant and the latter starts to grow the peak above 90 averages about the same value as the oil wet beads 130 one possible explanation for this peak transitioning could be that the fluid fluid interfaces at a point of contact are not solely influenced by the surfaces close to the contact point but also by adjacent surfaces there are three possible pore types in a fractionally wet system in terms of wettability the pores that are formed by water wet beads type 1 those that are formed by a mixture of water wet and oil wet beads type 2 and finally the pores that are formed by only oil wet beads type 3 one could hypothesize that at lower saturation states of the wetting phase the majority of contact points are located inside type 1 pores since the water phase tends to accumulate in the corners of water wet beads to minimize the surface free energy this would then correspond to the peak with an average contact angle below 90 in the distribution plot at high saturations of wetting phase end of imbibition the nonwetting phase tends to escape to the regions dominated by oil wet beads pore type 2 and 3 resulting in contact points located in proximity of oil wet surfaces and shifting the average contact angle towards values above 90 we note that in terms of accuracy of the contact angle measurements each data point shown in the average contact angle plots fig 2 is the result of hundreds of measurements made directly from the images for each saturation state as discussed in behnoudfar 2020 the general measurement error associated with the method was shown to be roughly 5 the spread of contact angle distribution observed in our data is consistent with the findings of other researchers blunt et al 2019 alratrout et al 2018 2017 scanziani et al 2017 and as we show in the next section it is a function of the variations in geometry interfacial curvature and pore size 3 2 conical pore model in order to explain the characteristic patterns of contact angle variation observed we focus on the geometrical relationship between interfacial curvature pore structure and the contact angle to characterize this relationship we approximate the pores using an idealized geometry an approach often favorably used in pore network modeling to simulate multiphase flow in porous media because flow processes are easier to describe in these simple constructs than in a real geometry the sought relationship is obviously more complicated for real porous media however simplified models such as pore networks have proven to be powerful tools for developing valuable insight into complex multiphase flow phenomena oren et al 1998 a conical capillary with variable cone angle is used here to approximate the pores we chose this model because it can represent either a pore body or a pore neck by assigning different values to the convergence angle ϕ the contact angle θ is related to the pore radius at the wetting front wetted pore radius r curvature of the interface r and convergence angle of the pores ϕ representing topography as expressed in the following equation dullien 2012 1 θ cos 1 r r φ which follows directly from the geometry of the menisci as shown in fig 4 the contact angle is estimated on a slice perpendicular to the contact line which is essentially a 2d cross section of the pore that includes the wetting and non wetting fluids within it this pore cross section is locally approximated with this conical capillary containing a meniscus see fig 4 the wetted pore radius is the radius of the cone at the wetting front and is obtained by measuring the distance between the contact points on each pore wall the convergence angle of the pore is obtained by measuring the angle between the two tangent lines at the points of contact the proposed model presents a new perspective in terms of our concept of contact angle variation it suggests that contact angle is simply another angle formed by the interface of fluids and the solid surface a perspective that allows us to view it as purely a geometry problem instead of thinking of it in terms of only interfacial forces in a cylindrical pore ϕ 0 the curvature of the interface and wetted pore radius each affects the angle this is illustrated in fig 5 in which the two variables are each changed separately one at a time while the other is kept constant fig 5 a shows the effect of curvature on the resulting contact angle for a fixed pore radius whereas fig 5 b shows how changes in pore radii control contact angle for a fixed curvature evidently increasing the pore radius causes a decrease in contact angle while decreasing the curvature increases the contact angle the combination of these effects determines the final value of the contact angle the following sections separately examine the variations of the three factors r r and ϕ for dodecane water and air water the two systems that showed contrasting behaviors then these factors are used in the above mentioned model to calculate the contact angle and compare the resulting values to observed trends 3 3 wetted pore radius r variation fig 6 demonstrates different configurations of wetting phase during imbibition as it transitions from a web of pendular rings to the funicular stage e g urso et al 1999 as flow develops the fluid fluid interfaces move from corner locations to larger pore spaces consequently the pore cross sectional area at the wetting front is expected to increase this is confirmed by measuring the average pore radius at the wetting front or wetted pore radius fig 7 a b it is evident that there is greater separation in the average pore radius between drainage and imbibition for the air water system compared to the dodecane water system this suggests a difference in their displacement patterns because the two systems consist of similar bead packs with the same size distributions this difference must be due to distinct differences in pore and throat occupancy i e differences in displacement patterns are due to affinity of the different nonwetting fluids for smaller vs larger pores in each system 3 4 interfacial curvature r variation and the effect of pinning the curvature measurements revealed another important difference between the two systems the separation of curvature values between drainage and imbibition or curvature hysteresis was found to be significantly greater for the dodecane water system fig 7 c d it is apparent that during the initial stages of drainage the fluid fluid curvature increased rapidly over a very small change in saturation conversely during imbibition the curvature drops sharply at the beginning of the process our data suggests that this steep rise and drop in curvature might be phenomenologically linked with the pinning of fluid fluid interfaces an observation also confirmed by other studies primkulov et al 2019 oren et al 1998 nadkarni and garoff 1992 willett et al 2003 boruvka and neumann 1977 hilpert et al 2003 closer inspection via image analysis of the dodecane water system during early stages of imbibition revealed that the interfaces remain almost fixed in place while the curvature decreases and the contact angle adjusts to a new value fig 8 illustrates one example of such events at a location near a pore neck as the capillary pressure decreases the oil water interface red surface relaxes into a less curved shape and appears to be swelling up the contact angle at the point denoted by the red circle in the image cross section increases from 39 8 to 82 0 during this process the subsequent sudden rise in saturation not shown in the figure suggests a haines jump type of event haines jumps happen when one phase passes from a pore neck into a wider pore body thereby rapidly displacing the other phase resulting in a sudden rise or drop in saturation a phenomenon first recognized more than 80 years ago haines 1930 3 5 model predictions based on this pore scale information we are now able to estimate the average contact angle at each saturation state θ based on the mean values of wetted pore radius r fluid fluid curvature r and cone angle φ averaged over the imaged volume using the following relatively simple equation 2 θ cos 1 r r φ these model predictions are also illustrated in fig 7 and figs 7 g h present the calculated contact angles from eq 2 specifically for dodecane water and air water systems interestingly the model correctly predicts very little hysteresis between the imbibition and drainage contact angles for the air water system and much more pronounced hysteresis for the dodecane water system eq 2 also reproduces the drainage contact angles very well for the dodecane water system during imbibition deviation of the interfaces from the symmetrical meniscus form assumed in the model would result in under prediction of the contact angle air water contact angles are slightly over predicted for both branches possibly for similar reason despite these limitations the obtained trends agreed surprisingly well with contact angles measured based on image analysis it should be emphasized that the purpose here is to identify phenomenologically the variables controlling the contact angle not necessarily to develop an accurate prediction of absolute values of contact angles thus we find that the above relationship eq 2 can be used to explain the observed conundrum of substantially different contact angle hysteresis between the air water and dodecane water systems the low contact angle hysteresis for the air water system fig 7 h is the result of less curvature hysteresis fig 7 d which for this fluid pair is slightly countered by wetted pore radius separation fig 7 b conversely the dramatically more pronounced curvature hysteresis in the dodecane water system fig 7 c appears to be the main cause of the greater contact angle hysteresis observed in this system fig 7 g the origins of this enhanced curvature hysteresis are further discussed below fig 7 also helps explain the flipping of drainage and imbibition contact angle curves for the air water system compared to the other fluid pairs a trend we conclude originates from the smaller imbibition associated wetted pore radius compared to the drainage associated values a feature we do not observe for the other fluid pairs 3 6 origins of contact angle hysteresis although the relationship eq 2 discussed here helps to identify the variables controlling contact angle it does not provide definitive information regarding the underlying causes for the variation in those variables in particular the fairly dominant fluid fluid curvature hysteresis based on current understanding static contact angle hysteresis is mainly attributed to surface chemical heterogeneity and roughness acting as sources of contact line pinning drelich 2019 but even in the absence of such characteristics nearly all surfaces exhibit measurable hysteresis due to the adhesive bond between the liquid and solid created during wetting recession of the contact line can break this bond another form of pinning can happen when one fluid passes from a narrow opening in the pore throat into a wider pore body displacing the other fluid i e the ink bottle effect extrand 2004 this often occurs during flow in porous media and is usually accompanied by haines jumps two observations from our results suggest that the fluid solid surface molecular interactions and their chemical properties lie at the root of the curvature hysteresis conundrum explored in this work first the contrasting difference between the hysteresis patterns for dodecane water and soltrol water systems result only from changing one of the fluids in the system while other variables are unchanged second the chemical treatment of the solid surface in the fractionally wet system significantly decreases the contact angle hysteresis fig 2 g there are several reports in the literature providing evidence of the dominant role of molecular structure and substrate induced rearrangement on contact line movement kinetics gao and mccarthy 2006 tavana 2004 lam et al 2001 zheng et al 2019 belman et al 2012 jiménez ángeles and firoozabadi 2016 some n alkanes are known to show complex time dependent behavior in contact with solid due to their flexible chain like structure tavana 2004 lam et al 2001 zheng et al 2019 using molecular dynamics simulations zheng et al 2019 reported that in a decane water silica system decane molecules can undergo three moving mechanisms in the close vicinity of the solid rolling up piston like or shear movement in the shear case decane molecules are forced by the substrate to rearrange themselves flat resulting in the strongest interaction with the surface as well as pinning of the contact line soltrol on the other hand is a mixture of branched chain alkanes with a higher number of carbon atoms compared to dodecane we hypothesize that this different chemical structure decreases the interaction with the solid surface for the case of hydrophobicized beads in the fractionally wet system the existence of a covalently attached monolayer of trichloro octadecyl silane could be responsible for the observed lower hysteresis in a similar case of tris trimethylsiloxy silylethyldimethylsilane treated surface previously reported in gao et al 2006 essentially no contact angle hysteresis was observed the authors proposed that the attached groups can rotate freely and the surface can therefore be regarded as liquid like allowing the fluid to slide easily it is worth mentioning that mahani et al 2015 also recognizes the effect of chemical bonding on pinning of interfaces and the resulting oil clay contact angle changes during the low salinity waterflooding process in enhanced oil recovery based on this existing evidence we conclude that the enhanced curvature hysteresis and the resulting effect on contact angle hysteresis is caused by chemical interactions between the nonwetting fluid and the surface of the porous medium for certain nonwetting phases the analyses presented combined with existing evidence in the literature explains why we observe significant curvature hysteresis and thus significant contact angle hysteresis in the decane and dodecane systems and limited hysteresis in the air and soltrol systems 4 conclusion x ray tomography was used to image pore scale drainage and imbibition displacements using a variety of fluid pairs in packed glass bead samples image analysis was used to measure curvatures wetted pore radii contact angles and convergence angles to demonstrate that traditional understanding of contact angles and contact angle hysteresis is flawed the simple force balance underlying the young s contact angle criterion cannot always describe the complicated situations where pinning forces deform interfaces and system geometry influences the contact angle we observed that contact angle hysteresis is pronounced for some fluid fluid pairs regardless of whether the fluids exist in a two phase or three phase fluid configuration specifically we present evidence that contact angles vary with saturation during both drainage and imbibition for certain nonwetting phases where sufficient data is available the trajectories form a loop between drainage and imbibition conditions this is a finding that is in stark contrast to how contact angles have historically been treated 1 as a single constant value that is a function solely of the porous medium or 2 as bimodal but constant values representing drainage and imbibition using a simplified geometry to estimate wetted pore radius we have shown that a relatively simple mathematical relationship can qualitatively model the trends observed and helped untangle the drivers behind enhanced contact angle hysteresis enhanced contact angle hysteresis was observed for decane water and dodecane water systems while almost absent for air water and soltrol water systems we hypothesize that these differences are mainly due to enhanced curvature hysteresis in the decane and dodecane systems this in turn is caused by differences in the fluid s chemical composition leading to the resulting pinning that happens for certain nonwetting phases the findings reported here and the proposed interactions responsible for contact angle hysteresis may be influenced by the varying surface chemistry of different porous media and as such further research is needed to extend this hypothesis broadly to other porous media including natural geologic formations further work is also needed to tease out which types of nonwetting fluids will exhibit enhanced contact angle hysteresis and thus the practical relevance of these findings to modeling of engineering scenarios such as groundwater remediation co2 sequestration and oil recovery where is it necessary to rethink the role of contact angles and

through a porous matrix is of great importance in many natural and engineered processes such as water uptake in plant roots secondary oil recovery from reservoir rocks co2 sequestration water purification water retention in soil and ink spreading on paper to name a few e g singh et al 2019 one of the conditions that distinguishes this flow is the significance of capillary forces that act on the contact line of fluids and porous solids in the slow flow regime capillary forces dominate other forces such as gravitational and viscous contributions and can be the main driving force in a variety of small scale processes arising in hydrology biology and environmental science and engineering capillary forces are strongly affected by wettability of the pore walls one of the most important properties of a porous medium that controls the dynamics of slow fluid displacement and determines the magnitude of the external force required to induce flow wettability indicates the relative tendency of fluids to adhere to a solid and is conventionally quantified by the angle the fluid interface forms with the solid surface in mechanical equilibrium fluids with a contact angle smaller than 90 are thus known as wetting fluids if the contact angle of the interface exceeds 90 the fluid is considered nonwetting singh et al 2019 in the natural environment for example wettability state determines trapping potential for secure storage of co2 in the subsurface a water wet formation has the potential to effectively trap large amounts of supercritical co2 a nonwetting fluid however if the formation has undergone wettability alteration and is no longer dominantly water wet the capillary trapping mechanism can be significantly affected decreasing the trapping potential an increase in contact angle can also greatly enhance buoyancy effects and thereby decrease storage security as co2 more easily will migrate upwards through potential escape pathways faults and structural or engineered defects similar wettability effects may be encountered in groundwater remediation enhanced oil recovery operations etc in the so called quasi static flow regime it is sometimes effective to model the flow as a series of fluid configurations at equilibrium state with different force balance and saturation level associated with each state primkulov et al 2019 the contact angle for the situation of stable fluid configurations is termed static for a smooth and homogeneous surface the static contact angle is traditionally assumed to be an invariant property of a system this means that it is not influenced by the geometry of the system or non capillary forces such as pinning forces and fluid pressure induced by external sources acting on the interfaces this assumption partly stems from the work of thomas young young 1805 in which he asserted that the contact angle depends only on the materials and in no other way on the conditions of the problem however several recent studies aided by advances in pore scale imaging technologies have recognized that contact angle values also depend on geometry and or kinetics of flow and that a distribution of contact angles exist at static conditions within a uniformly wet porous material blunt et al 2019 alratrout et al 2018 2017 scanziani et al 2017 armstrong et al 2021 yet there is still no consensus regarding the effect of phenomena such as contact line pinning and contact angle hysteresis on average contact angle measurements contact angle hysteresis is defined solely as the difference between advancing and receding contact angles for a contact line moving in opposite direction at the same velocity eral and oh 2013 on the basis of young s assertion it is common practice to use contact angle as an input parameter for pinpointing the free fluid interfaces in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation of multiphase flow although the treatment of interfaces in both theoretical and numerical studies is well established the description of contact lines and the correspondingly distributed contact angles is still under development huber et al 2016 because of a historical lack of direct contact angle measurements inside pores most current models suffer uncertainty regarding the detailed understanding of the location and nature of contact angles in porous media thus contact angle is often ignored i e the porous medium is assumed to be water wet or treated as an input parameter to numerical models simply to capture the effect of capillary pressure saturation pc s hysteresis in the latter case distinct constant values are applied for each branch of the pc s curve based on simplified measurements such as the drop plate method and usbm united states bureau of mines e g donaldson et al 1969 and amott indices amott 1959 yet a robust pore scale numerical model requires knowledge of in situ distributed contact angle values for different modes during flow to better understand how contact angle varies during multi phase flow this work presents experimentally measured distributions of contact angles inside a porous matrix at different flow stages using x ray micro computed tomography imaging based on these measurements we propose an alternative perspective on contact angle the geometry perspective which supports a more comprehensive interpretation of the data obtained specifically by helping us assess the effects of interfacial curvature and pore structure on contact angle 2 methods this study uses existing datasets based on the works of paustian 2018 paustian et al 2021 schlüter et al 2016 and meisenheimer et al 2020 the reconstructed 3d images acquired from x ray micro tomography are processed according to the procedures described in the above mentioned sources image processing included contrast enhancement filtering and segmentation details were reported in the cited publications 2 1 fluid flow experiments the quasi static flow experiments are conducted using randomly packed soda lime silica glass beads the glass beads are naturally water wet hydrophilic however for part of the study the wettability of the beads was altered paustian 2018 so some experiments were conducted using a water wet system and some in a fractionally wet system to change the wettability hydrophobization the surface of the glass beads was chemically treated with trichloro octadecyl silane flow experiments were conducted by infusing or withdrawing wetting fluid to achieve the desired saturation at constant low flow rates table 1 for most experiments the flow was stopped at various saturation stages to allow the interfaces to relax prior to imaging satisfying the quasi static flow assumption table 1 summarizes experiment characteristics for each dataset 2 2 contact angle measurements the local contact angles are measured using an algorithm based on the work of scanziani et al 2017 which was further developed as discussed in behnoudfar 2020 briefly the algorithm consists of the following steps 1 the contact points defined as the point of intersection of the three fluid fluid solid phases are identified within the segmented three dimensional images 2 a contact line is created from all of the points identified in step 1 3 for each contact point a 2d slice is generated which is normal to the contact line at each point of contact 4 the contact angle is then automatically measured on this slice through the wetting phase these steps are depicted in fig 1 the algorithm is applied to measure several hundred in situ contact angles in the entire imaged section for each water saturation state sw further detail is provided in behnoudfar 2020 2 3 mean curvature to calculate the average mean curvature of an interface the triangular discretized surface is locally approximated by a quadratic form the eigenvalues of the quadratic form correspond to the principal curvatures due to the inherent limits of x ray imaging as well as potential unavoidable segmentation errors the curvature values that are close to the solid bead surface are not as accurate as the curvatures further away from the beads to account for this li et al 2018 developed a method that weighted the average curvatures based on their distance to a solid surface and also further reduced the effect of proximity to the solid surfaces by clipping the surfaces thus the distance of each triangle to the edge of the surface is measured and triangles that fall within 20 of the maximum distance from the edge are removed prior to calculating the distance weighted curvature average the choice of 20 of the maximum distance was addressed in detail in li et al 2018 and resulted in estimated curvatures with accuracy overall of 94 5 and for pores with radii in excess of 50 voxels the accuracy is increased to 99 8 as compared to externally measured pressure transducer values 3 results and discussion to understand how contact angle evolves during quasi static flow this section presents the measurements for four different fluid pairs i dodecane water in a water wet two phase system ii decane water air in three phase system one water wet and one fractionally wet iii soltrol water air in three phase water wet system and iv air water in a two phase water wet system the section then explores the correlation between contact angle fluid fluid curvature and pore structure 3 1 hysteresis patterns a consistent trend in the average contact angle values is evident for decane water and dodecane water in both the two phase and three phase systems containing only water wet beads figs 2 a d during the drainage cycle the contact angle initially decreases rapidly by 20 30 and then becomes monotonic as oil invades the system during imbibition it gradually rises eventually approaching the value observed at the beginning of drainage thus forming a loop this trend is also seen in the fractionally wet system for those interfaces in contact with the water wet non chemically treated beads fig 2 g however the separation between the drainage and imbibition contact angles becomes relatively minor near the oil wet chemically treated beads by contrast soltrol water and air water pairs display a completely different behavior and exhibit little difference between the drainage and imbibition contact angles fig 3 the air water system also differs in that the contact angle associated with imbibition is lower than drainage unlike what is observed for the oil water systems these observed patterns initially led us to the important question why is contact angle hysteresis so much more pronounced in the dodecane decane nonwetting phase systems compared to the systems where soltrol or air act as the nonwetting phase fig 2 also shows the distributions of contact angles associated with each datapoint illustrated in the average contact angle plots looking at the transitions of the distribution curves for the fractionally wet system we notice an interesting effect as imbibition progresses the distribution evolves from a peak with an average below 90 fig 2 i sw 0 04 into a peak with an average above 90 sw 0 93 which is unexpected for water wet beads also we observe an inflection point for imbibition sw 0 17 at which the former peak becomes less significant and the latter starts to grow the peak above 90 averages about the same value as the oil wet beads 130 one possible explanation for this peak transitioning could be that the fluid fluid interfaces at a point of contact are not solely influenced by the surfaces close to the contact point but also by adjacent surfaces there are three possible pore types in a fractionally wet system in terms of wettability the pores that are formed by water wet beads type 1 those that are formed by a mixture of water wet and oil wet beads type 2 and finally the pores that are formed by only oil wet beads type 3 one could hypothesize that at lower saturation states of the wetting phase the majority of contact points are located inside type 1 pores since the water phase tends to accumulate in the corners of water wet beads to minimize the surface free energy this would then correspond to the peak with an average contact angle below 90 in the distribution plot at high saturations of wetting phase end of imbibition the nonwetting phase tends to escape to the regions dominated by oil wet beads pore type 2 and 3 resulting in contact points located in proximity of oil wet surfaces and shifting the average contact angle towards values above 90 we note that in terms of accuracy of the contact angle measurements each data point shown in the average contact angle plots fig 2 is the result of hundreds of measurements made directly from the images for each saturation state as discussed in behnoudfar 2020 the general measurement error associated with the method was shown to be roughly 5 the spread of contact angle distribution observed in our data is consistent with the findings of other researchers blunt et al 2019 alratrout et al 2018 2017 scanziani et al 2017 and as we show in the next section it is a function of the variations in geometry interfacial curvature and pore size 3 2 conical pore model in order to explain the characteristic patterns of contact angle variation observed we focus on the geometrical relationship between interfacial curvature pore structure and the contact angle to characterize this relationship we approximate the pores using an idealized geometry an approach often favorably used in pore network modeling to simulate multiphase flow in porous media because flow processes are easier to describe in these simple constructs than in a real geometry the sought relationship is obviously more complicated for real porous media however simplified models such as pore networks have proven to be powerful tools for developing valuable insight into complex multiphase flow phenomena oren et al 1998 a conical capillary with variable cone angle is used here to approximate the pores we chose this model because it can represent either a pore body or a pore neck by assigning different values to the convergence angle ϕ the contact angle θ is related to the pore radius at the wetting front wetted pore radius r curvature of the interface r and convergence angle of the pores ϕ representing topography as expressed in the following equation dullien 2012 1 θ cos 1 r r φ which follows directly from the geometry of the menisci as shown in fig 4 the contact angle is estimated on a slice perpendicular to the contact line which is essentially a 2d cross section of the pore that includes the wetting and non wetting fluids within it this pore cross section is locally approximated with this conical capillary containing a meniscus see fig 4 the wetted pore radius is the radius of the cone at the wetting front and is obtained by measuring the distance between the contact points on each pore wall the convergence angle of the pore is obtained by measuring the angle between the two tangent lines at the points of contact the proposed model presents a new perspective in terms of our concept of contact angle variation it suggests that contact angle is simply another angle formed by the interface of fluids and the solid surface a perspective that allows us to view it as purely a geometry problem instead of thinking of it in terms of only interfacial forces in a cylindrical pore ϕ 0 the curvature of the interface and wetted pore radius each affects the angle this is illustrated in fig 5 in which the two variables are each changed separately one at a time while the other is kept constant fig 5 a shows the effect of curvature on the resulting contact angle for a fixed pore radius whereas fig 5 b shows how changes in pore radii control contact angle for a fixed curvature evidently increasing the pore radius causes a decrease in contact angle while decreasing the curvature increases the contact angle the combination of these effects determines the final value of the contact angle the following sections separately examine the variations of the three factors r r and ϕ for dodecane water and air water the two systems that showed contrasting behaviors then these factors are used in the above mentioned model to calculate the contact angle and compare the resulting values to observed trends 3 3 wetted pore radius r variation fig 6 demonstrates different configurations of wetting phase during imbibition as it transitions from a web of pendular rings to the funicular stage e g urso et al 1999 as flow develops the fluid fluid interfaces move from corner locations to larger pore spaces consequently the pore cross sectional area at the wetting front is expected to increase this is confirmed by measuring the average pore radius at the wetting front or wetted pore radius fig 7 a b it is evident that there is greater separation in the average pore radius between drainage and imbibition for the air water system compared to the dodecane water system this suggests a difference in their displacement patterns because the two systems consist of similar bead packs with the same size distributions this difference must be due to distinct differences in pore and throat occupancy i e differences in displacement patterns are due to affinity of the different nonwetting fluids for smaller vs larger pores in each system 3 4 interfacial curvature r variation and the effect of pinning the curvature measurements revealed another important difference between the two systems the separation of curvature values between drainage and imbibition or curvature hysteresis was found to be significantly greater for the dodecane water system fig 7 c d it is apparent that during the initial stages of drainage the fluid fluid curvature increased rapidly over a very small change in saturation conversely during imbibition the curvature drops sharply at the beginning of the process our data suggests that this steep rise and drop in curvature might be phenomenologically linked with the pinning of fluid fluid interfaces an observation also confirmed by other studies primkulov et al 2019 oren et al 1998 nadkarni and garoff 1992 willett et al 2003 boruvka and neumann 1977 hilpert et al 2003 closer inspection via image analysis of the dodecane water system during early stages of imbibition revealed that the interfaces remain almost fixed in place while the curvature decreases and the contact angle adjusts to a new value fig 8 illustrates one example of such events at a location near a pore neck as the capillary pressure decreases the oil water interface red surface relaxes into a less curved shape and appears to be swelling up the contact angle at the point denoted by the red circle in the image cross section increases from 39 8 to 82 0 during this process the subsequent sudden rise in saturation not shown in the figure suggests a haines jump type of event haines jumps happen when one phase passes from a pore neck into a wider pore body thereby rapidly displacing the other phase resulting in a sudden rise or drop in saturation a phenomenon first recognized more than 80 years ago haines 1930 3 5 model predictions based on this pore scale information we are now able to estimate the average contact angle at each saturation state θ based on the mean values of wetted pore radius r fluid fluid curvature r and cone angle φ averaged over the imaged volume using the following relatively simple equation 2 θ cos 1 r r φ these model predictions are also illustrated in fig 7 and figs 7 g h present the calculated contact angles from eq 2 specifically for dodecane water and air water systems interestingly the model correctly predicts very little hysteresis between the imbibition and drainage contact angles for the air water system and much more pronounced hysteresis for the dodecane water system eq 2 also reproduces the drainage contact angles very well for the dodecane water system during imbibition deviation of the interfaces from the symmetrical meniscus form assumed in the model would result in under prediction of the contact angle air water contact angles are slightly over predicted for both branches possibly for similar reason despite these limitations the obtained trends agreed surprisingly well with contact angles measured based on image analysis it should be emphasized that the purpose here is to identify phenomenologically the variables controlling the contact angle not necessarily to develop an accurate prediction of absolute values of contact angles thus we find that the above relationship eq 2 can be used to explain the observed conundrum of substantially different contact angle hysteresis between the air water and dodecane water systems the low contact angle hysteresis for the air water system fig 7 h is the result of less curvature hysteresis fig 7 d which for this fluid pair is slightly countered by wetted pore radius separation fig 7 b conversely the dramatically more pronounced curvature hysteresis in the dodecane water system fig 7 c appears to be the main cause of the greater contact angle hysteresis observed in this system fig 7 g the origins of this enhanced curvature hysteresis are further discussed below fig 7 also helps explain the flipping of drainage and imbibition contact angle curves for the air water system compared to the other fluid pairs a trend we conclude originates from the smaller imbibition associated wetted pore radius compared to the drainage associated values a feature we do not observe for the other fluid pairs 3 6 origins of contact angle hysteresis although the relationship eq 2 discussed here helps to identify the variables controlling contact angle it does not provide definitive information regarding the underlying causes for the variation in those variables in particular the fairly dominant fluid fluid curvature hysteresis based on current understanding static contact angle hysteresis is mainly attributed to surface chemical heterogeneity and roughness acting as sources of contact line pinning drelich 2019 but even in the absence of such characteristics nearly all surfaces exhibit measurable hysteresis due to the adhesive bond between the liquid and solid created during wetting recession of the contact line can break this bond another form of pinning can happen when one fluid passes from a narrow opening in the pore throat into a wider pore body displacing the other fluid i e the ink bottle effect extrand 2004 this often occurs during flow in porous media and is usually accompanied by haines jumps two observations from our results suggest that the fluid solid surface molecular interactions and their chemical properties lie at the root of the curvature hysteresis conundrum explored in this work first the contrasting difference between the hysteresis patterns for dodecane water and soltrol water systems result only from changing one of the fluids in the system while other variables are unchanged second the chemical treatment of the solid surface in the fractionally wet system significantly decreases the contact angle hysteresis fig 2 g there are several reports in the literature providing evidence of the dominant role of molecular structure and substrate induced rearrangement on contact line movement kinetics gao and mccarthy 2006 tavana 2004 lam et al 2001 zheng et al 2019 belman et al 2012 jiménez ángeles and firoozabadi 2016 some n alkanes are known to show complex time dependent behavior in contact with solid due to their flexible chain like structure tavana 2004 lam et al 2001 zheng et al 2019 using molecular dynamics simulations zheng et al 2019 reported that in a decane water silica system decane molecules can undergo three moving mechanisms in the close vicinity of the solid rolling up piston like or shear movement in the shear case decane molecules are forced by the substrate to rearrange themselves flat resulting in the strongest interaction with the surface as well as pinning of the contact line soltrol on the other hand is a mixture of branched chain alkanes with a higher number of carbon atoms compared to dodecane we hypothesize that this different chemical structure decreases the interaction with the solid surface for the case of hydrophobicized beads in the fractionally wet system the existence of a covalently attached monolayer of trichloro octadecyl silane could be responsible for the observed lower hysteresis in a similar case of tris trimethylsiloxy silylethyldimethylsilane treated surface previously reported in gao et al 2006 essentially no contact angle hysteresis was observed the authors proposed that the attached groups can rotate freely and the surface can therefore be regarded as liquid like allowing the fluid to slide easily it is worth mentioning that mahani et al 2015 also recognizes the effect of chemical bonding on pinning of interfaces and the resulting oil clay contact angle changes during the low salinity waterflooding process in enhanced oil recovery based on this existing evidence we conclude that the enhanced curvature hysteresis and the resulting effect on contact angle hysteresis is caused by chemical interactions between the nonwetting fluid and the surface of the porous medium for certain nonwetting phases the analyses presented combined with existing evidence in the literature explains why we observe significant curvature hysteresis and thus significant contact angle hysteresis in the decane and dodecane systems and limited hysteresis in the air and soltrol systems 4 conclusion x ray tomography was used to image pore scale drainage and imbibition displacements using a variety of fluid pairs in packed glass bead samples image analysis was used to measure curvatures wetted pore radii contact angles and convergence angles to demonstrate that traditional understanding of contact angles and contact angle hysteresis is flawed the simple force balance underlying the young s contact angle criterion cannot always describe the complicated situations where pinning forces deform interfaces and system geometry influences the contact angle we observed that contact angle hysteresis is pronounced for some fluid fluid pairs regardless of whether the fluids exist in a two phase or three phase fluid configuration specifically we present evidence that contact angles vary with saturation during both drainage and imbibition for certain nonwetting phases where sufficient data is available the trajectories form a loop between drainage and imbibition conditions this is a finding that is in stark contrast to how contact angles have historically been treated 1 as a single constant value that is a function solely of the porous medium or 2 as bimodal but constant values representing drainage and imbibition using a simplified geometry to estimate wetted pore radius we have shown that a relatively simple mathematical relationship can qualitatively model the trends observed and helped untangle the drivers behind enhanced contact angle hysteresis enhanced contact angle hysteresis was observed for decane water and dodecane water systems while almost absent for air water and soltrol water systems we hypothesize that these differences are mainly due to enhanced curvature hysteresis in the decane and dodecane systems this in turn is caused by differences in the fluid s chemical composition leading to the resulting pinning that happens for certain nonwetting phases the findings reported here and the proposed interactions responsible for contact angle hysteresis may be influenced by the varying surface chemistry of different porous media and as such further research is needed to extend this hypothesis broadly to other porous media including natural geologic formations further work is also needed to tease out which types of nonwetting fluids will exhibit enhanced contact angle hysteresis and thus the practical relevance of these findings to modeling of engineering scenarios such as groundwater remediation co2 sequestration and oil recovery where is it necessary to rethink the role of contact angles and their representation in model predictions based on numerical simulation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
