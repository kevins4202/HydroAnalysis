8110,study area the yellow river china study focus the yellow river as the second longest river of china is of vital importance to maintain regional water security with the influence of climate change and intense human activities there will be an increasing severe water shortage which would bring challenges to regional water resources management in this study an interactive fuzzy bi level water resources management fuzzybiwrm model with a hierarchical structure has been proposed for water resources planning to satisfy the conflicting requirements of decision makers and quantify the trade offs in a top down decision making process new hydrological insights the results show that there would be conflicts of water allocations among riparian provinces in the yellow river region due to the increasing severe water shortage the allocated water for all riparian provinces will decrease especially for provinces with high water consumption accordingly the proportional structure of water use by sectors in a province will also change the proportion of water used for agriculture will decrease firstly although the fuzzybiwrm model can generate fairer water resources allocation schemes the water demands of the provinces with powerful economy would be firstly met to ensure maximum economic benefits shandong province would not face too much financial losses but shaanxi and shanxi would suffer the most economic damages with more than 20 followed by henan with an economic loss of 11 keywords hierarchical decision making water resources allocation multi periodic scenario water use equality 1 introduction the global water scarcity has been becoming increasingly severe in the past several years on account of the growing population rising food demands rapid economic development higher standards of living and excessive water abstractions barbieri et al 2019 srinivasan et al 2012 wada et al 2016 in the last century global water consumption has dramatically increased sixfold and is still increasing at a rate of 1 annually wada et al 2016 in addition climate change such as global warming will further exacerbate water shortages by changing the precipitation evaporation soil moisture and runoff to cause an uneven distribution of global water resources jin et al 2018 a long term water scarcity that the level of available water from nature is consistently below the demands for water will put societal and human developments in a dangerous situation omer et al 2020 with the rapidly growing economy and population in the world china is also facing a serious water shortage problem the per capita available water in china is only 2062 m3 that is a quarter of the world average but the water consumption per unit of gross domestic product is three times the world average chen et al 2020 liu and yang 2012 in addition an unevenly distribution of water resources influenced by the monsoonal climate further aggravates the divergence of water allocation the available water resources in northern china account for less than 20 of total water resources in china the yellow river as the second longest river in china and a major freshwater source in the north of china is of vital importance for the human living and sustainable economic development it provides fresh water for more than 1 68 hundred million people and 17 of irrigated agricultural lands however the per capita available water resources about approximately 530 m3 in the yellow river region is only half of the standard in water scarce regions chen et al 2020 especially it is less than 400 m3 in some riparian densely populated provinces along the yellow river such as henan shandong and hebei that means these provinces are in extreme water scarcity sarpong et al 2020 due to excessive water withdrawals in riparian provinces the exploitation rate of the yellow river has been almost 80 most areas of the yellow river basin are water stressful and experiencing water insecurity which bring challenges to the water resources management in this region liu et al 2014 numerous researches indicate that climate change and human impacts would largely affect the available water resources in the yellow river li et al 2008 lv et al 2019 meng et al 2016 shi and wang 2015 wang et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2009 during the last years the net runoff of the whole yellow river has been decreasing at a rate of 7 21 10 8 m3 per year and human impacts such as the overutilization of water and underlying surface changes are responsible for more than 90 of the decrease kong et al 2016 the increased evapotranspiration and decrease of precipitation as a result of global warming are also reasons for the decreasing runoffs in the yellow river shi et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 indicated that climate change would exacerbate a more uneven distribution of water resources in the yellow river by changing local hydrologic cycles jin et al 2018 showed that the global warming will bring a minor increase of precipitation in the yellow river source region but the runoff in this region will decrease due to the human activities the decreasing runoff and a more uneven water distribution due to climate change and human impacts is making it difficult for the equitable and sustainable water resources allocation in the yellow river the current water allocation plan in the yellow river is named 87 scheme which has been in use since the 1990 s it is a centralized controlling water resources management scheme as the result of consultations among the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc as the major and high level administration authority and riparian provinces as the main water withdrawers it sets the upper limits of water withdrawals for riparian provinces along the yellow river and the upper limit of water abstractions for every riparian province will be increased decreased in a wet dry year based on a simple proportionate principle to adapt the uncertainty of future available water resources after applying such a scheme of water resources allocation the phenomenon of drying up in the lower yellow river has never happened however decreasing runoff due to climate change and human activities bring another potential crisis to the water resources allocation in the yellow river in the past several years the economy of different regions has been developed and the structure of water use has changed with increasingly stressed water resources the 87 scheme with a simple proportionate principle may not fully meet the rising demands of different regions and is not a reasonable inter regional water allocation scheme an outdated water allocation scheme in which the upper limit of water abstractions is fixed based on the experience of past thirty years may not adapt to the new crisis brought by climate changes and human impacts in the future to support the decision making of water allocation in the yellow river region a lot of researches have been performed xu et al 2002 proposed a dynamics model of water resources system to simulate the water resources in the yellow river and analyzed the relationships between regional water demands and supplies based on a consideration of inter annual variability of water resources shao et al 2009 proposed a collection of flexible limits for water scarcity in the yellow river yang 2011 developed a multi objective optimization model to manage water resources to meet the ecological water demand in the yellow river delta yang and yang 2010 used an interactive fuzzy approach to address a multi objective optimization problem of water resources planning in the yellow river delta niu et al 2016 developed a water resources management model based on a fuzzy boundary interval programming method in hetao basin which was an important agricultural region in the yellow river in the yellow river region the water resources management system is controlled by governmental decision makers e g the yrcc and provincial water resources management agencies with different controlling powers over the final decisions the decision making process is made by a top down way from the high level to the low level the objectives of the high level decision makers dms are firstly met and the lower level dms must follow the high level s decisions however the demands of the lower level dms should be considered by the upper level dms because multiple dms usually have different objectives and their own preferences it is difficult to identify a satisfactory solution accepted by all dms although previous studies have provided insightful suggestions on water resources planning in the yellow river some of their study areas are only some important regions of the yellow river region and there still lacks a water resources management model to address the sequential decision making issues and balance the conflicts among different administration level dms from the whole yellow river perspective developing such an effective hierarchical water management model is highly desired in this study an interactive fuzzy bi level water resources management model named fuzzybiwrm model is proposed to generate optimal water allocation schemes and to solve conflicting objectives from water management agencies at different administration levels in the yellow river the developed model depicts the sequential decision making structure of the water resources planning in the yellow river it can address the conflicts of upper level dm yrcc and lower level dms provincial water management agencies in water allocation planning it can fully consider the equality of water use among all riparian provinces along the yellow river for obtaining equitable plans of water resource assignment the water resources re allocations in each province for four main water use sectors including industry agriculture resident and eco environment are also conducted with the consideration of economies and eco environmental values and environmental capacity of pollutants in addition multi period water use scenario analyses was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of future decreasing available water resources on water allocation plans the results from the developed model will provide effective suggestions for adjustment of future water use structure and generation of optimal strategies for water resources management in a sustainable and equitable way in the yellow river 2 overview of the study area 2 1 the geographic conditions of the yellow river region the yellow river fig 1 as the second largest river in china originates from the north bayan har mountains of qinghai tibet plateau and traverses across nine provinces including an autonomous region and ends in the bohai sea stretching about 5464 kilometers with a basin area of 752 443 km2 from the northwest to the southeast the geographic and climatic differences of the whole yellow river region are obvious most of the northwest yellow river region belongs to a semiarid arid climate while it is a semi humid climate in the southeast sun et al 2001 the average annual precipitation in the yellow river basin is about 470 mm which is less than half of that in the yangtze river basin sun et al 2001 zhang et al 2020a 2020b the natural climatic conditions of the yellow river are in mark contrast with those of the yangtze river because of the imbalanced distribution of water resources between southern and northern china affected by the climatic differences the yellow river is of vital importance in water resource provision for political economic and cultural development in northern china there are a lot of storage and diversion facilities along the yellow river responsible for the transfer of water about 30 large hydraulic facilities have been built on the mainstream of the yellow river as shown in fig 1 there are three extra large irrigation districts with irrigation areas greater than 300 000 square meters the river supplies water resources for approximately 12 of chinese population and approximately 17 of the agricultural areas chen et al 2020 omer et al 2020 the water resources are also unevenly distributed among the upper middle and lower reaches of the yellow river which contribute to 56 42 and 2 of the total runoff respectively yang et al 2010 the differences of the population density and economic development further exacerbate the discrepancy of water resources allocation among riparian provinces effective assignments of limited water resources to satisfy the requirements of ever increasing water demands in the yellow river region is challenging 2 2 water management structure of the yellow river the water resources allocation of the yellow river is mainly organized by yrcc a governmental agency of ministry of water resources of china through consultations with riparian provinces the initial water allocations are made by yrcc to maintain the ecological functions of the yellow river and to satisfy the water demands of riparian provinces the provincial water use rights are then reallocated by various departments of water management at different executive levels within each province until allocated to the final water users the reallocated water resources are detailly divided into different water use indices for sectors e g industrial water index agricultural water index and domestic water index eco environmental water index and so on by water management departments at different administrative levels although the higher level dms i e yrcc can make eventual decisions to maximize the profit of water use of the entire yellow river they need to have consultations with the riparian provinces and fully consider the water demands of the lower level dms the lower level dms would request as much as water from yrcc to meet their own demands to maximize economic benefits and simultaneously follow the decisions of yrcc such a water resources management process is hierarchical and sequential from the upper to the lower levels the higher level dm i e yrcc prefers to allocate water to the provinces with the highest economic rewards to maximize the total system profits and would make their decisions at first while the lower level dms i e all riparian provinces want to obtain as much as water to maximize their own profits the objectives of the two level dms can not be satisfied simultaneously the existing 1987 water allocation plan of the yellow river for the nine provinces is listed in table 1 in the 1987 scheme the total annual runoff of the yellow river is assumed to be 58 billion m3 except for the 21 billion m3 of water used for sediment treatment of the yellow river channel the maximum water supply capacity to riparian provinces is 37 billion m3 yrcc 2008 with the consideration of uncertainty due to natural variability such a water allocation scheme will be adjusted based on a proportionate principle in a wet year water withdrawals of all provinces are proportionally increased while they are all proportionally decreased in a dry year such a water allocation scheme has proved to be strikingly successful for water resources management of the yellow river for example in the past twenty years the discharge of the yellow river has never broken off however with the ever increasing population rapid economic growth and the decreasing runoff of the yellow river the existing water allocation scheme based on a proportionate principle can not effectively address the contradiction between water supplies and demands in this study we developed an interactive two level water resources management model to satisfy the conflicting objectives of dms in a bi level decision making process using the proposed model adjustment of the existing water allocation scheme is evaluated and future water resource management mode in responding to water scarcity issues in the yellow river is discussed the study area represents the nine provinces which mainly withdraw water from the yellow river the shaded areas in fig 1 3 the interactive fuzzy bi level water management model of the yellow river 3 1 model formulation an interactive fuzzy bi level water resources management model fuzzybiwrm has been developed which has a hierarchical structure involving dms in the upper and the lower levels to make decisions in order the two level dms are relatively independent and their objectives are often conflicting the upper level dm has a priority over the whole decision making process and the lower level dms are subject to the upper level dm s decisions meanwhile decisions of the upper level dms are also impacted by the lower level dms a general bi level linear programming model is formulated as follows the upper level model 1 max x f u x y ax by where x and y are vectors of decision variables y is solved by eq 2 a and b are both constant coefficient vectors and f u is the objective function of the upper level model the lower level model 2 max y f l x y cx dy where x and y are decision variable vectors x is solved by eq 1 c and d are both constant coefficient vectors and f l is the objective function of the lower level model subject to 3 a 1 x a 2 y b x y 0 where b is a constant vector and both of a 1 and a 2 are constant matrices the proposed model aims to achieving optimal and equal water resources allocation plans for industrial agricultural residential and ecological uses in nine riparian provinces in the yellow river and satisfying the conflicting objectives of the two level dms in order to reflect the effects of future climate changes on water resources management a multi period scenario of water scarcity is designed which represents three planning periods with increasing water shortages and decreasing available water resources in the yellow river the model formulation of the fuzzybiwrm model is as follows in the first level the yrcc prefers to maximize the total profits of the whole water resources system the objective function f u of the upper level model is as follows 4 max f u i 1 9 t 1 3 e it pq it where e it is the economic efficiency coefficient per unit of water use in province i in period t 100 million chinese yuan 100 million m3 shown in table 2 and pq it is the decision variable of the upper level model representing the initially available water amounts for province i in period t 100 million m3 from the yellow river the constraints of the upper level model are as follows 1 the constraint of available water resources in the yellow river the total quantity of available water from the yr for provinces should not exceed the amounts of assignable water resources in period t 5 i 9 pq it tq t t where tq t is the total available water resources in the entire yr basin in period t 2 the constraint of provincial water demands the initial allocated water resources to province i must meet the minimum water demands of all interior sectors i e industry agriculture resident and eco environment in period t 6 dmin it pq it dmax it i and t where dmin it and dmax it are the minimum and maximum water demands of province i in period t 100 million m3 respectively 3 the constraint of equitable distribution of water for riparian provinces due to the uneven economic development of different provinces few emphases are placed on the water demands of the provinces with backward industrial structures in general the upper level decision makers need to make sure the maximum benefits of water use including economic benefits ecological benefits and etc balance the tradeoffs among multiple lower water use sectors and ensure the regional water use safety the eastern provinces are usually economically developed and have high demands for water it is preferable to allocate more water to these eastern provinces than to other provinces to reflect the water use equity and make sure the water use right of economically behind provinces the equality of water allocations should be guaranteed it is incorporated in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model by introduction of a modified gini coefficient based on water allocation equity 7 i 1 9 i 2 i i 9 pq it pq i t 9 i 9 pq it g t where g is the modified gini coefficient which is a pre determined parameter by the high level dms table 2 in the lower level the dms riparian provinces want to maximize the profits of water uses among various sectors within each province 8 m ax f l i 1 9 t 1 3 w it i 1 9 t 1 3 j 1 4 b ijt q ijt η ij j 1 4 costw ijt q ijt j 1 3 k 1 3 ξ ijk q ijt cdw kt where f l is the goals of the

is the reallocated water resources for sector j of province i in period t b the constraint of water pollution discharge the emissions of pollutant k should not exceed the pollution bearing capacity of

12 dumin ijt θ ij dmin it dumax ijt θ ij dmax it where θ ij is the ratio of water uses for sector j of province i 3 2 solution method in this study an interactive fuzzy approach by shih et al 1996 is used to solve the developed fuzzybiwrm model it can make a compromise between the two level dms with conflicting objectives to find a solution for satisfy the whole system the upper level dms receive priority in making decisions the lower level dms must follow the decisions from the upper level dms and try to find their optimal solutions due to the conflicting objectives between two level dms the lower level dms need to interact with the upper level dms and ask the latter to adjust their decisions by considering the lower level dms needs until there is a solution accepted by all dms the solution processes for a bi level model are as follows a to calculate the optimal solutions of the upper level and lower level models independently there is an assumption that the optimal solutions of the upper level model with the objective eq 1 and constraint eq 3 are x u y u and f u and those of the lower level model with the objective eq 2 and constraint eq 3 are x l y l and f l ideally an optimal solution of the bi level model can be found when the upper level model and the lower level model have a same solution however it is a very rare case since the objectives of different dms are generally conflicting the upper level dms have the priority over the whole system the requirements of lower level dms can not be satisfied when the upper level dm s objectives are firstly met consequently both the upper level and lower level dms need to make certain sacrifices the upper level dm should make compromises by specifying tolerances of their solutions and the lower level dms need to find their solutions within a given tolerance range b to build the fuzzy membership function of x u the upper level dms specify the tolerances p 1 and p 2 of x u and allow x to change in the range of x u p 1 x u p 2 to make concessions for the lower level dms x u is the most preferred solution for the upper level dms and x u p 1 and x u p 2 are the worst acceptable solutions the fuzzy membership function of x u is as follows 13 μ x x x x u p 1 p 1 if x u p 1 x x u x u p 2 x p 2 if x u x x u p 2 0 if x x u p 1 or x x u p 2 c to build the fuzzy membership of the upper level goal f u and the lower level goal f l for the maximization problem f u of the upper level all solutions are acceptable when the f u f u the least preferred solutions for the upper level dms is to give up their best objective f u and fully consider the demands of the lower level dms when the upper level dms only want to satisfy the objective function of lower level dms the least desirable solution f u f u x l y l is obtained which will be the tolerance of the objective of the upper level model when f u f u all solutions are rejected by the upper level dms the preference of f u in range f u f u is assumed to be linearly increasing the fuzzy membership function of f u is as follows 14 μ f u f u 1 if f u f u f u f u f u f u if f u f u f u 0 if f u f u when the lower level dms only want to find their optimal solutions under the solutions of upper level model x u y u the least acceptable solution of lower level f l f l x u y u is obtained similarly the fuzzy membership function of f l can be built as follows 15 μ f l f l 1 if f l f l f l f l f l f l if f l f l f l 0 if f l f l d introducing the fuzzy max min operator λ after steps a to c the original bi level model is reformed into a problem to seek the acceptable degrees of satisfaction for x u f u and f l simultaneously the original two level model is thus converted into the following form 16 max α β γ s t a 1 x a 2 y b x y 0 μ x x α i μ f u f u β μ f l f l γ 0 α 1 0 β 1 0 γ 1 where α β γ are the acceptable degrees of satisfaction for x u f u and f l i is a vector with same dimension as x the min operator is introduced to aggregate the satisfactory levels simultaneously λ min α β γ so that a bi level model is reformulated as follows 17 max λ s t a 1 x a 2 y b x y 0 μ x x λ i μ f u f u λ μ f l f l λ 0 λ 1 through the steps a d and solving the model eq 17 we can get the optimal solutions of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model in the developed fuzzybiwrm model if there are no feasible solutions the upper level dms can increase the tolerance of their optimal solutions x u by specifying larger p 1 and p 2 values 3 3 problem statements the developed fuzzybiwrm model is applied for water resources planning in the yellow river the available data and information are derived from china statistical yearbooks and provincial water resources bulletins the two level dms include yrcc and riparian provinces the water resources in the yellow river are distributed to nine provinces including qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan shandong hebei including tianjin to meet their water use demands the planning horizon includes three periods for reflecting the scenario of decreasing available water resources generally the water allocation scheme of government is made yearly form this july to the next june thus the length of each period is one hydrological year every period represents a low flow year in different degrees the water resources in provinces are re allocated to four water use sectors including industry agriculture resident and eco environment three kinds of pollutants are considered in the process of water use including wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen compounds among four water use sectors no pollutants are assumed to be emitted from the eco environment sector the economic efficiency coefficient e it will increase at a yearly rate of 1 and 2 in the future due to advancement of technologies the available water resources of a hydrological year can be allocated largely depending on the runoff estimations of that year and the coordination of various water storage facilities along the river according to the china water resources bulletin and the studies of liu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020a 2020b the natural runoff of the yellow river has a strong spatial and temporal variability with changes from 70 5 the upper yellow river contributes more than 60 of streamflow for the whole region the streamflow of the lower river is usually largely affected by the storage of upper hydraulic facilities and water withdraws along the river the average streamflow changes of the upper hydrological stations are used to represent the natural water supply of the yellow river thus the total available water resources in the entire yr basin in period t tq t are assumed to decrease at rates of 5 and 10 in the second and third periods for reflecting the increasingly severe water shortages and decreasing available water resources in the yellow river respectively during the three periods t 1 t 2 t 3 the total available water resources in the entire yr basin in period t tq is 37 00 35 15 and 31 64 billion m3 respectively with the development of water saving technologies and the stricter regulations for water conservation the minimum and maximum water demands dmin it and dmax it will both decrease at a rate of 1 and 2 in the second and third periods the water use cost of sector j of province i in period t costw ijt will increase at rates of 50 and 100 in the second and third periods due to the increasing water scarcity the disposal costs of pollutant k in period t cdw kt will also increase at rates of 50 and 100 in the second and third periods due to the stricter pollutant discharge regulations the maximum pollution carrying capacity maxp ikt will decrease at the rates of 10 and 20 in the second and third periods for protecting environmentally sensitive waters of which pollution carrying capacities will decrease due to the decreasing runoffs in the future the input pollution coefficient ξ ijk and other model input parameters are all listed in supplementary materials 4 results analyses and discussions 4 1 model solutions the solution of only upper level model and only lower level model are shown in tables 3 7 the optimal solutions for two objectives of upper level and lower level dms corresponding to three models including only upper level model and only lower model and the bi level fuzzybiwrm model are shown in table 3 in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the trade offs between the upper level dm yrcc and lower level dms riparian provinces are quantified by the λ which represents the overall acceptable satisfactory degree of the solutions for the whole system when the gini coefficient for water allocation equality is 0 3 and the acceptable tolerances of p 1 p 2 10 billion cubic meters the optimal solutions of upper level objective f u 0 1 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and lower level objective f l o 3 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and the overall acceptable satisfactory degree λ of the solutions obtained from the proposed fuzzybiwrm model is 0 71 the larger the λ value the more satisfactory the solutions for the yrcc the economic quantification of the objective function is based on the per capita gross domestic product and provincial populations while for the riparian provinces it is quantified by product values of four water use sectors there are no connects between the two objective functions of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model when the water resources allocation process is absolutely controlled by the yrcc only upper level model the preference of yrcc is satisfied at first and their optimal objective f u is 1 92 107million chinese yuan and the objectives of the lower level dms riparian provinces f l are 3 43 107 million chinese yuan the lower level riparian provinces cannot find an optimal solution when the preferences of the upper level dm are satisfied if the water resources allocation process is decided by only the lower level riparian provinces the preferences of riparian provinces are met and their optimal objective f l is 4 09 10 7 million chinese yuan which is 1 2 times greater than that f l for the system decided by only the upper level dm yrcc however it is impossible to find the optimal solution for the yrcc in the only lower level model disagreements between the optimal solutions of the only upper level and the only lower level dms indicate the conflicting preferences of the yrcc and riparian provinces through the interactive fuzzy method the upper level dm can allow their optimal solutions and objectives to change within a certain range by specifying acceptable tolerances as shown in table 3 the economic objective f u o of the yrcc is between the values of least acceptable objective f u and the optimal objective f u the same as the lower level dms the solutions for water resources allocations for riparian provinces by the yrcc in different periods are shown in table 4 since the upper level dm yrcc aims to maximize the profits of whole system with a specified equity in advance as much water as possible will be preferably allocated to the provinces with high returns on water use in addition to meet the basic water demands of other riparian provinces as shown in table 4 in the model solutions for the system controlled by the only upper level dm yrcc the allocated water resources x u to some provinces with higher return benefits on water use are obviously more than those x l for the system controlled by only the lower level dms riparian provinces such as shandong shaanxi hebei and shanxi whose economic efficiency coefficients are more than 100 million chinese yuan per million cubic meters of water however from the perspective of the lower level dms they would ask for as much water from the yellow river to maximize their benefits of water use sectors in provinces and simultaneously have to follow the decisions of the upper level dms for those riparian provinces whose economic efficiency coefficients are less than 100 million chinese yuan per million cubic meters of water it is impossible to find their optimal solutions x l if they just follow the results x u for the system fully controlled by the upper level dm the conflicting preferences of the upper level and lower level dms are well solved by the water resources allocation scheme x o of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model there is an obvious trade off between the demands of yrcc and riparian provinces the allocated water resources for those provinces with higher return benefits on water use are regulated down while it is increasing for those provinces with lower return benefits on water use as the amount of water available for allocation decreases over period the amount of water allocated to each province in each period also decreases as shown in table 4 the re allocation schemes of water resources for water use sectors of riparian provinces in three periods are shown in tables 5 7 the re allocation scheme is decided by industrial structures in every province the water use sector of agriculture uses most of the water resources in provinces when the system is fully supervised by only the upper level dm table 5 the provinces with high return benefits are allocated as much water as possible and demands of water use sectors in these provinces are preferred to be satisfied in those provinces with low return benefits on water use only basic demands of sectors are met when the system is fully controlled by only the lower level dms table 6 the allocated water resources to sectors of industry residents and eco environment j 1 j 3 and j 4 in provinces with low return benefits are increased while those to sector of industry and agriculture j 1 and j 2 in provinces with high return benefits are decreased in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model both yrcc and riparian provinces have their own preferences and make attempts to maximize their own economic benefits the decisions of the yrcc affect the re allocation of water resources among different water use sectors in provinces the proposed fuzzybiwrm model can effectively solve the conflicting demands of dms at different levels and find a balanced solution of the whole system table 7 the yrcc has made a concession to the riparian provinces with the sacrifice of its own preferences the lower level dms riparian provinces need to find their solution with the concession of the yrcc the upper level and lower level dms yrcc and riparian provinces can communicate with each other and dynamically adjust their own solutions to make a balance over the whole system by using the proposed model a more equitable water resources allocation scheme can be generated in the yellow river region the initial allocation of water to each water use sector can be dynamically adjusted to maximize economic and ecological benefits while ensuring water equity and minimum water demand the proposed bi level model provides more flexibility in making sequential decisions from a higher level to a lower level and quantifying the tradeoffs in various decision makers in different decision making levels its model structure is consistent with the real world water resources management in the yellow river region as a result the generated optimal solutions may provide effective decision support for cost effective and equitable water allocation management along the yellow river 4 2 multi period analyses to evaluate the effects of reduced water resources availability on water resources management in the yellow river reflect the potential problem of caused by climate change a multi period scenario analysis is conducted during the planning periods the available water resources from the yellow river are assumed to decrease at rates of 5 and 10 in the second and third periods respectively fig 2 shows the optimal solutions for the whole system in three periods the initially allocated water resources pq the decision variables for the upper level dm yrcc for all riparian provinces will decrease in the future especially for those provinces with high water consumption such as shaanxi shanxi henan hebei and shandong accordingly the proportional structure of water use by sectors in province will also change the proportion of water used for agriculture in most provinces will decrease firstly the effects of decreasing water resources on the solutions and economic losses of the system are shown in fig 3 which reflects the differences of solutions between period 1 and period 3 as the available water resources in the yellow river decrease the provinces of shaanxi and shanxi would suffer the most economic damages with more than 20 followed by henan with an economic loss of 11 on the contrary because of the yrcc s preference to provinces with high economic efficiencies the province of shandong which is one of the major water consumers of the yellow river would not face too much financial losses caused by decreasing water resources in the future for provinces economically left behind such as qinghai gansu and ningxia the existing water allocation scheme can only meet their basic water demands and no more water can be compressed from them the economic effects of future decreasing water resources on those provinces will also be slight and no more than 10 for the lower level dms the re allocation scheme of water resources for sectors will vary with the decisions of the upper level dms what lower level dms will face is the economic losses brought to different water use sectors especially agriculture resident and industry since the re allocated water resources to those three sectors will be reduced most however for some provinces such as qinghai inner mongolia and shandong with the decreasing available water resources the benefits of provincial sectors will increase in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the costs of wastewater and pollutants are considered in the lower level for example in qinghai the water demand of residents is reduced by 35 due to the adjustment of future decreasing water resources the wastewater cod and ammonia nitrogen compounds emitted in qinghai mainly come from the water used by residents the proportions of wastewater cod and ammonia nitrogen compounds discharged from residential water use to every pollutant are 63 9 41 8 and 72 2 respectively less water used less pollutants emitted thus the benefits of water use sectors increase in qinghai due to reduced pollution treatment costs in inner mongolia water resources used by agriculture will be mainly reduced and more water resources will be allocated to sector of eco environment since water use sector of agriculture is the main contributor to emitted pollutants in inner mongolia and sector of eco environment is with high return benefits the benefits of sectors in this province will increase in the future 4 3 water use equity analyses the upper level dm of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model prefers to allocate as much water as possible to those riparian provinces with high economic efficiency coefficient of water use to maximize the benefits of the whole system such a preference would further exacerbate inequities among provinces in allocation of water resources in the yellow river in the fuzzybiwrm model the upper level dm can take a control of water allocation equity through introducing the constraint eq 7 a gini coefficient is introduced to address the water allocation equity issue in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the upper level dm needs to pre specify a gini coefficient before making decisions the effects of water allocation equity on the management objectives are shown in fig 4 for the upper level dm taking water allocation equity into account would bring losses to their objectives as shown in subplot a in fig 4 an increase of the gini coefficient for water allocation equity mean a fair water allocation scheme leading to increased benefits of the whole water resources management system in the yellow river since the upper level decision maker may have their own top limits on the tolerance values p a high gini coefficient would make it easier to find possible solutions for the conflicting two level dms in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model when the upper level dm rejects to make any further concessions for the lower level dms as the cost of water use equity sacrifice more water will be allocated to those provinces with higher return benefits on water use and more economic profits are assured as shown in subplot b in fig 4 when the upper level dms do not overemphasize the water use equity although they can realize the objective of maximizing the profits of the available water resources from the yellow river it does damage to the economy of sectors in provinces as a loss of water equity the trend of objective f l of the lower level dms is exactly opposite of those of objectives f l and f l o since more water resources are allocated to those economically developed provinces the water demands of the sectors cannot be met which cause the loss of benefits of provincial water use sectors this suggests that only focusing on the benefits of the whole would overlook the benefits of the components the proposed fuzzybiwrm model can effectively address the conflict issues and generate acceptable solutions to two level dms from the point of view of the whole system the effects of water allocation equity on the allocation scheme of water resources are shown in fig 5 for the upper level dm yrcc the water use equity constraint can promote an equitable allocation scheme of water resources in the yellow river for those provinces with high return benefits on water use such as shandong shanxi and henan the amounts of initially allocated water resources decrease the bars above the zero especially for shandong the allocated water amounts decrease in all three periods with the gradually decreasing water resources in the yellow river the province of shandong will face increasingly serious water shortages while for those provinces economically left behind such as qinghai gansu and ningxia their initially allocated water resources increase bars below the zero when the water use equity is considered with the gradually decreasing water resources no more water resources will be allocated to them however for the hebei province although it is a province with strong economy more water resources are allocated to it with the constraint of water equity the possible reason is that the main source for water withdrawing in hebei province is haihe river instead of the yellow river the dependence of hebei province on the yellow river for water resources is on the low side for the lower level dms the effects of water equity constraint are on the adjustments for water use of agriculture industry and residents in the event of potential water shortages particularly in shandong and shanxi extra attentions should be paid to the allocation of water for agriculture blue bars above zero efficient irrigation techniques should be adopted to increase the effective rate of irrigation in agriculture at the same time for the less economically developed provinces which would face with more severe agricultural water shortages than provinces in the east consideration should be given to increasing their amount of agricultural water use appropriately 4 4 compared with the existing water allocation plan based on the 87 scheme the water allocation schemes obtained from the proposed fuzzybiwrm model are compared with the existing water allocation plan as shown in fig 6 the existing water allocation scheme is an adjustment of the 87 scheme based on a strategy that the allocated water resources for all provinces are reducing increasing at a same proportion in a low flow high flow year in a year with a low flow in which the available water resources are 34 billion m3 the water allocation scheme of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model outperforms the existing one based on 87 scheme with the strategy of same proportional reduction it is more advantageous in a year with a high flow when the available water resources are 39 billion m3 the comparison results indicate that the economic benefits of the whole yellow river obtained from the developed fuzzybiwrm model are always larger than those from the existing one based on 87 scheme that s since a strategy of targeted reduction increase of water resources in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model instead of a proportional reduction increase can better maximize economic benefits of two level dms based on their preferences while such a dynamic and interactive decision making process cannot be reflected in the 87 scheme as shown in fig 6 the modeling results indicate a bit equality water allocation with gini 0 24 with the premise of meeting minimum water demands and water use equity the water use structure is dynamically adjusted to maximize the water use profits of the whole region in a low flow year some provinces such as gansu and ningxia would receive less water than original 87 scheme but the whole region is still in water use safety and equity the higher water use benefits in the fig 6 show that the proposed water allocation scheme of fuzzybiwrm can better maximize the water use benefits than the existing 87 scheme by dynamical adjustments however the existing 87 scheme cannot maximize the use of water resources since it adjusts the water allocations limits based on a simple proportionate principle the proposed fuzzybiwrm model has fully considered the actual structure of water resources management in the yellow river basin and riparian provinces it can not only address the preferences of dms in different administrative levels but also generate acceptable solutions to satisfy the conflicting objectives of different dms in the whole water resources allocation system 5 conclusions a multi period interactive fuzzy bi level model named fuzzybiwrm has been proposed for water resources planning in the yellow river region it can effectively deal with the hierarchical and sequential decision making issues in water resources management structure of the yellow river involving two level dms including the yrcc and the riparian provinces different dms have their own preferences in the decision making processes in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the upper level dms have strong power over the decisions to find an optimal solution for the whole water resources planning system all dms need to make compromises the modeling results indicate that the conflicting objectives and different preferences of two level dms are addressed by introducing an interactive fuzzy approach the trade offs between two level dms can be effectively quantified by introducing a min operator λ with g 0 3 and the acceptable tolerances of p 1 p 2 10 billion cubic meters the optimal solutions of upper level objective f u 0 1 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and lower level objective f l o 3 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and the overall acceptable satisfactory degree λ of the solutions obtained from the proposed fuzzybiwrm model is 0 71 the larger the λ value the more satisfactory the solutions the optimal water allocation schemes are compared with the existing 87 scheme under different water supply scenarios the results imply that the proposed model can generate a more equitable water allocation scheme that leads to more water use benefits regardless of whether it is a high flow or low flow year under a scenario of reduced allocable water resources initially allocated water resources for all riparian provinces will decrease in the future especially for those provinces with high water consumptions such as shaanxi shanxi henan hebei and shandong the allocated water to provinces of shaanxi and shanxi would be significantly reduced more than 1 4 billion m3 they would suffer with more than 25 of economic damages due to water decreasing although the main source of water supply for hebei is the haihe river instead of the yellow river hebei would be with reduced water supplies of 0 53 billion m3 from the yellow river and suffer with economic loss of 23 7 for henan province it would receive 0 7 billion cubic meters less water but it would suffer with economic loss of 11 5 shandong would face a smaller economic loss than other four provinces due to its economic importance in the yellow river region for some economically backward provinces the margins for the amounts of water allocation that can be regulated are already small reduced allocated water would bring a large economic to water use sectors such as ningxia with less than 0 3 billion m3 causing more than 20 economic loss to guarantee the equity of the water resources allocating system constraints of water use equity based on a modified gini coefficient are introduced the results show that the upper level dm can maximize the profits of water in the upper level with the increase of parameter g while the benefits of water in the lower level will decrease due to the lack of water use equity since more water resources are allocated to those economically developed provinces the water demands of water use sectors in provinces economic behind cannot be fully met it would cause the benefit losses of provincial water use sectors especially for the agriculture users in agriculture based provinces when the upper level dm prefers a more equitable water allocating system major water use provinces such as shandong shanxi and henan should appropriately improve the water efficiency of the more water consuming sectors to adapt to the dynamic adjustment of water allocations for example efficient irrigation techniques should be adopted to increase the effective rate of irrigation in agriculture in shandong henan should promote a water saving living water environment of residents for other provinces which are economically behind they can appropriately increase the amounts of water allocated to users especially irrigations and residents although the proposed fuzzybiwrm model contributes to the existing studies in addressing hierarchical and sequential water resources allocation issues in the yellow river future improvements are still needed in the future research more detailed divisions of water use sectors can be considered to improve the applicability of the developed model with a flexible model structure more dms in more decision making levels can be included in the extension of the proposed model by combining with a multi objective optimization model the objectives of decision makers in each level can be diverse in addition more real world water availability scenarios in the yellow river can be built with the projected streamflow from hydrological models the developed fuzzybiwrm model has provided insights into effective management of water resources allocations in the yellow river it has the potential to help governmental dms better manage a limited number of water resources in responding to potential water shortage crisis due to climate change and human activities credit

8110,study area the yellow river china study focus the yellow river as the second longest river of china is of vital importance to maintain regional water security with the influence of climate change and intense human activities there will be an increasing severe water shortage which would bring challenges to regional water resources management in this study an interactive fuzzy bi level water resources management fuzzybiwrm model with a hierarchical structure has been proposed for water resources planning to satisfy the conflicting requirements of decision makers and quantify the trade offs in a top down decision making process new hydrological insights the results show that there would be conflicts of water allocations among riparian provinces in the yellow river region due to the increasing severe water shortage the allocated water for all riparian provinces will decrease especially for provinces with high water consumption accordingly the proportional structure of water use by sectors in a province will also change the proportion of water used for agriculture will decrease firstly although the fuzzybiwrm model can generate fairer water resources allocation schemes the water demands of the provinces with powerful economy would be firstly met to ensure maximum economic benefits shandong province would not face too much financial losses but shaanxi and shanxi would suffer the most economic damages with more than 20 followed by henan with an economic loss of 11 keywords hierarchical decision making water resources allocation multi periodic scenario water use equality 1 introduction the global water scarcity has been becoming increasingly severe in the past several years on account of the growing population rising food demands rapid economic development higher standards of living and excessive water abstractions barbieri et al 2019 srinivasan et al 2012 wada et al 2016 in the last century global water consumption has dramatically increased sixfold and is still increasing at a rate of 1 annually wada et al 2016 in addition climate change such as global warming will further exacerbate water shortages by changing the precipitation evaporation soil moisture and runoff to cause an uneven distribution of global water resources jin et al 2018 a long term water scarcity that the level of available water from nature is consistently below the demands for water will put societal and human developments in a dangerous situation omer et al 2020 with the rapidly growing economy and population in the world china is also facing a serious water shortage problem the per capita available water in china is only 2062 m3 that is a quarter of the world average but the water consumption per unit of gross domestic product is three times the world average chen et al 2020 liu and yang 2012 in addition an unevenly distribution of water resources influenced by the monsoonal climate further aggravates the divergence of water allocation the available water resources in northern china account for less than 20 of total water resources in china the yellow river as the second longest river in china and a major freshwater source in the north of china is of vital importance for the human living and sustainable economic development it provides fresh water for more than 1 68 hundred million people and 17 of irrigated agricultural lands however the per capita available water resources about approximately 530 m3 in the yellow river region is only half of the standard in water scarce regions chen et al 2020 especially it is less than 400 m3 in some riparian densely populated provinces along the yellow river such as henan shandong and hebei that means these provinces are in extreme water scarcity sarpong et al 2020 due to excessive water withdrawals in riparian provinces the exploitation rate of the yellow river has been almost 80 most areas of the yellow river basin are water stressful and experiencing water insecurity which bring challenges to the water resources management in this region liu et al 2014 numerous researches indicate that climate change and human impacts would largely affect the available water resources in the yellow river li et al 2008 lv et al 2019 meng et al 2016 shi and wang 2015 wang et al 2017 2018 zhang et al 2009 during the last years the net runoff of the whole yellow river has been decreasing at a rate of 7 21 10 8 m3 per year and human impacts such as the overutilization of water and underlying surface changes are responsible for more than 90 of the decrease kong et al 2016 the increased evapotranspiration and decrease of precipitation as a result of global warming are also reasons for the decreasing runoffs in the yellow river shi et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wang et al 2017 indicated that climate change would exacerbate a more uneven distribution of water resources in the yellow river by changing local hydrologic cycles jin et al 2018 showed that the global warming will bring a minor increase of precipitation in the yellow river source region but the runoff in this region will decrease due to the human activities the decreasing runoff and a more uneven water distribution due to climate change and human impacts is making it difficult for the equitable and sustainable water resources allocation in the yellow river the current water allocation plan in the yellow river is named 87 scheme which has been in use since the 1990 s it is a centralized controlling water resources management scheme as the result of consultations among the yellow river conservancy commission yrcc as the major and high level administration authority and riparian provinces as the main water withdrawers it sets the upper limits of water withdrawals for riparian provinces along the yellow river and the upper limit of water abstractions for every riparian province will be increased decreased in a wet dry year based on a simple proportionate principle to adapt the uncertainty of future available water resources after applying such a scheme of water resources allocation the phenomenon of drying up in the lower yellow river has never happened however decreasing runoff due to climate change and human activities bring another potential crisis to the water resources allocation in the yellow river in the past several years the economy of different regions has been developed and the structure of water use has changed with increasingly stressed water resources the 87 scheme with a simple proportionate principle may not fully meet the rising demands of different regions and is not a reasonable inter regional water allocation scheme an outdated water allocation scheme in which the upper limit of water abstractions is fixed based on the experience of past thirty years may not adapt to the new crisis brought by climate changes and human impacts in the future to support the decision making of water allocation in the yellow river region a lot of researches have been performed xu et al 2002 proposed a dynamics model of water resources system to simulate the water resources in the yellow river and analyzed the relationships between regional water demands and supplies based on a consideration of inter annual variability of water resources shao et al 2009 proposed a collection of flexible limits for water scarcity in the yellow river yang 2011 developed a multi objective optimization model to manage water resources to meet the ecological water demand in the yellow river delta yang and yang 2010 used an interactive fuzzy approach to address a multi objective optimization problem of water resources planning in the yellow river delta niu et al 2016 developed a water resources management model based on a fuzzy boundary interval programming method in hetao basin which was an important agricultural region in the yellow river in the yellow river region the water resources management system is controlled by governmental decision makers e g the yrcc and provincial water resources management agencies with different controlling powers over the final decisions the decision making process is made by a top down way from the high level to the low level the objectives of the high level decision makers dms are firstly met and the lower level dms must follow the high level s decisions however the demands of the lower level dms should be considered by the upper level dms because multiple dms usually have different objectives and their own preferences it is difficult to identify a satisfactory solution accepted by all dms although previous studies have provided insightful suggestions on water resources planning in the yellow river some of their study areas are only some important regions of the yellow river region and there still lacks a water resources management model to address the sequential decision making issues and balance the conflicts among different administration level dms from the whole yellow river perspective developing such an effective hierarchical water management model is highly desired in this study an interactive fuzzy bi level water resources management model named fuzzybiwrm model is proposed to generate optimal water allocation schemes and to solve conflicting objectives from water management agencies at different administration levels in the yellow river the developed model depicts the sequential decision making structure of the water resources planning in the yellow river it can address the conflicts of upper level dm yrcc and lower level dms provincial water management agencies in water allocation planning it can fully consider the equality of water use among all riparian provinces along the yellow river for obtaining equitable plans of water resource assignment the water resources re allocations in each province for four main water use sectors including industry agriculture resident and eco environment are also conducted with the consideration of economies and eco environmental values and environmental capacity of pollutants in addition multi period water use scenario analyses was conducted to evaluate the potential effects of future decreasing available water resources on water allocation plans the results from the developed model will provide effective suggestions for adjustment of future water use structure and generation of optimal strategies for water resources management in a sustainable and equitable way in the yellow river 2 overview of the study area 2 1 the geographic conditions of the yellow river region the yellow river fig 1 as the second largest river in china originates from the north bayan har mountains of qinghai tibet plateau and traverses across nine provinces including an autonomous region and ends in the bohai sea stretching about 5464 kilometers with a basin area of 752 443 km2 from the northwest to the southeast the geographic and climatic differences of the whole yellow river region are obvious most of the northwest yellow river region belongs to a semiarid arid climate while it is a semi humid climate in the southeast sun et al 2001 the average annual precipitation in the yellow river basin is about 470 mm which is less than half of that in the yangtze river basin sun et al 2001 zhang et al 2020a 2020b the natural climatic conditions of the yellow river are in mark contrast with those of the yangtze river because of the imbalanced distribution of water resources between southern and northern china affected by the climatic differences the yellow river is of vital importance in water resource provision for political economic and cultural development in northern china there are a lot of storage and diversion facilities along the yellow river responsible for the transfer of water about 30 large hydraulic facilities have been built on the mainstream of the yellow river as shown in fig 1 there are three extra large irrigation districts with irrigation areas greater than 300 000 square meters the river supplies water resources for approximately 12 of chinese population and approximately 17 of the agricultural areas chen et al 2020 omer et al 2020 the water resources are also unevenly distributed among the upper middle and lower reaches of the yellow river which contribute to 56 42 and 2 of the total runoff respectively yang et al 2010 the differences of the population density and economic development further exacerbate the discrepancy of water resources allocation among riparian provinces effective assignments of limited water resources to satisfy the requirements of ever increasing water demands in the yellow river region is challenging 2 2 water management structure of the yellow river the water resources allocation of the yellow river is mainly organized by yrcc a governmental agency of ministry of water resources of china through consultations with riparian provinces the initial water allocations are made by yrcc to maintain the ecological functions of the yellow river and to satisfy the water demands of riparian provinces the provincial water use rights are then reallocated by various departments of water management at different executive levels within each province until allocated to the final water users the reallocated water resources are detailly divided into different water use indices for sectors e g industrial water index agricultural water index and domestic water index eco environmental water index and so on by water management departments at different administrative levels although the higher level dms i e yrcc can make eventual decisions to maximize the profit of water use of the entire yellow river they need to have consultations with the riparian provinces and fully consider the water demands of the lower level dms the lower level dms would request as much as water from yrcc to meet their own demands to maximize economic benefits and simultaneously follow the decisions of yrcc such a water resources management process is hierarchical and sequential from the upper to the lower levels the higher level dm i e yrcc prefers to allocate water to the provinces with the highest economic rewards to maximize the total system profits and would make their decisions at first while the lower level dms i e all riparian provinces want to obtain as much as water to maximize their own profits the objectives of the two level dms can not be satisfied simultaneously the existing 1987 water allocation plan of the yellow river for the nine provinces is listed in table 1 in the 1987 scheme the total annual runoff of the yellow river is assumed to be 58 billion m3 except for the 21 billion m3 of water used for sediment treatment of the yellow river channel the maximum water supply capacity to riparian provinces is 37 billion m3 yrcc 2008 with the consideration of uncertainty due to natural variability such a water allocation scheme will be adjusted based on a proportionate principle in a wet year water withdrawals of all provinces are proportionally increased while they are all proportionally decreased in a dry year such a water allocation scheme has proved to be strikingly successful for water resources management of the yellow river for example in the past twenty years the discharge of the yellow river has never broken off however with the ever increasing population rapid economic growth and the decreasing runoff of the yellow river the existing water allocation scheme based on a proportionate principle can not effectively address the contradiction between water supplies and demands in this study we developed an interactive two level water resources management model to satisfy the conflicting objectives of dms in a bi level decision making process using the proposed model adjustment of the existing water allocation scheme is evaluated and future water resource management mode in responding to water scarcity issues in the yellow river is discussed the study area represents the nine provinces which mainly withdraw water from the yellow river the shaded areas in fig 1 3 the interactive fuzzy bi level water management model of the yellow river 3 1 model formulation an interactive fuzzy bi level water resources management model fuzzybiwrm has been developed which has a hierarchical structure involving dms in the upper and the lower levels to make decisions in order the two level dms are relatively independent and their objectives are often conflicting the upper level dm has a priority over the whole decision making process and the lower level dms are subject to the upper level dm s decisions meanwhile decisions of the upper level dms are also impacted by the lower level dms a general bi level linear programming model is formulated as follows the upper level model 1 max x f u x y ax by where x and y are vectors of decision variables y is solved by eq 2 a and b are both constant coefficient vectors and f u is the objective function of the upper level model the lower level model 2 max y f l x y cx dy where x and y are decision variable vectors x is solved by eq 1 c and d are both constant coefficient vectors and f l is the objective function of the lower level model subject to 3 a 1 x a 2 y b x y 0 where b is a constant vector and both of a 1 and a 2 are constant matrices the proposed model aims to achieving optimal and equal water resources allocation plans for industrial agricultural residential and ecological uses in nine riparian provinces in the yellow river and satisfying the conflicting objectives of the two level dms in order to reflect the effects of future climate changes on water resources management a multi period scenario of water scarcity is designed which represents three planning periods with increasing water shortages and decreasing available water resources in the yellow river the model formulation of the fuzzybiwrm model is as follows in the first level the yrcc prefers to maximize the total profits of the whole water resources system the objective function f u of the upper level model is as follows 4 max f u i 1 9 t 1 3 e it pq it where e it is the economic efficiency coefficient per unit of water use in province i in period t 100 million chinese yuan 100 million m3 shown in table 2 and pq it is the decision variable of the upper level model representing the initially available water amounts for province i in period t 100 million m3 from the yellow river the constraints of the upper level model are as follows 1 the constraint of available water resources in the yellow river the total quantity of available water from the yr for provinces should not exceed the amounts of assignable water resources in period t 5 i 9 pq it tq t t where tq t is the total available water resources in the entire yr basin in period t 2 the constraint of provincial water demands the initial allocated water resources to province i must meet the minimum water demands of all interior sectors i e industry agriculture resident and eco environment in period t 6 dmin it pq it dmax it i and t where dmin it and dmax it are the minimum and maximum water demands of province i in period t 100 million m3 respectively 3 the constraint of equitable distribution of water for riparian provinces due to the uneven economic development of different provinces few emphases are placed on the water demands of the provinces with backward industrial structures in general the upper level decision makers need to make sure the maximum benefits of water use including economic benefits ecological benefits and etc balance the tradeoffs among multiple lower water use sectors and ensure the regional water use safety the eastern provinces are usually economically developed and have high demands for water it is preferable to allocate more water to these eastern provinces than to other provinces to reflect the water use equity and make sure the water use right of economically behind provinces the equality of water allocations should be guaranteed it is incorporated in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model by introduction of a modified gini coefficient based on water allocation equity 7 i 1 9 i 2 i i 9 pq it pq i t 9 i

water uses among various sectors within each province 8 m ax f l i 1 9 t 1 3 w it i 1 9 t 1 3 j 1 4 b ijt q ijt η ij j 1 4 costw ijt q ijt j 1 3 k 1 3 ξ ijk q ijt cdw kt where f l is the goals of the

used to solve the developed fuzzybiwrm model it can make a compromise between the two level dms with conflicting objectives to find a solution for satisfy the whole system the upper level dms receive priority in making decisions the lower level dms must follow the decisions from the upper level dms and try to find their optimal solutions due to the conflicting objectives between two level dms the lower level dms need to interact with the upper level dms and ask the latter to adjust their decisions by considering the lower level dms needs until there is a solution accepted by all dms the solution processes for a bi level model are as follows a to calculate the optimal solutions of the upper level and lower level models independently there is an assumption that the optimal solutions of the upper level model with the objective eq 1 and constraint eq 3 are x u y u and f u and those of the lower level model with the objective eq 2 and constraint eq 3 are x l y l and f l ideally an optimal solution of the bi level model can be found when the upper level model and the lower level model have a same solution however it is a very rare case since the objectives of different dms are generally conflicting the upper level dms have the priority over the whole system the requirements of lower level dms can not be satisfied when the upper level dm s objectives are firstly met consequently both the upper level and lower level dms need to make certain sacrifices the upper level dm should make compromises by specifying tolerances of their solutions and the lower level dms need to find their solutions within a given tolerance range b to build the fuzzy membership function of x u the upper level dms specify the tolerances p 1 and p 2 of x u and allow x to change in the range of x u p 1 x u p 2 to make concessions for the lower level dms x u is the most preferred solution for the upper level dms and x u p 1 and x u p 2 are the worst acceptable solutions the fuzzy membership function of x u is as follows 13 μ x x x x u p 1 p 1 if x u p 1 x x u x u p 2 x p 2 if x u x x u p 2 0 if x x u p 1 or x x u p 2 c to build the fuzzy membership of the upper level goal f u and the lower level goal f l for the maximization problem f u of the upper level all solutions are acceptable when the f u f u the least preferred solutions for the upper level dms is to give up their best objective f u and fully consider the demands of the lower level dms when the upper level dms only want to satisfy the objective function of lower level dms the least desirable solution f u f u x l y l is obtained which will be the tolerance of the objective of the upper level model when f u f u all solutions are rejected by the upper level dms the preference of f u in range f u f u is assumed to be linearly increasing the fuzzy membership function of f u is as follows 14 μ f u f u 1 if f u f u f u f u f u f u if f u f u f u 0 if f u f u when the lower level dms only want to find their optimal solutions under the solutions of upper level model x u y u the least acceptable solution of lower level f l f l x u y u is obtained similarly the fuzzy membership function of f l can be built as follows 15 μ f l f l 1 if f l f l f l f l f l f l if f l f l f l 0 if f l f l d introducing the fuzzy max min operator λ after steps a to c the original bi level model is reformed into a problem to seek the acceptable degrees of satisfaction for x u f u and f l simultaneously the original two level model is thus converted into the following form 16 max α β γ s t a 1 x a 2 y b x y 0 μ x x α i μ f u f u β μ f l f l γ 0 α 1 0 β 1 0 γ 1 where α β γ are the acceptable degrees of satisfaction for x u f u and f l i is a vector with same dimension as x the min operator is introduced to aggregate the satisfactory levels simultaneously λ min α β γ so that a bi level model is reformulated as follows 17 max λ s t a 1 x a 2 y b x y 0 μ x x λ i μ f u f u λ μ f l f l λ 0 λ 1 through the steps a d and solving the model eq 17 we can get the optimal solutions of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model in the developed fuzzybiwrm model if there are no feasible solutions the upper level dms can increase the tolerance of their optimal solutions x u by specifying larger p 1 and p 2 values 3 3 problem statements the developed fuzzybiwrm model is applied for water resources planning in the yellow river the available data and information are derived from china statistical yearbooks and provincial water resources bulletins the two level dms include yrcc and riparian provinces the water resources in the yellow river are distributed to nine provinces including qinghai gansu ningxia inner mongolia shaanxi shanxi henan shandong hebei including tianjin to meet their water use demands the planning horizon includes three periods for reflecting the scenario of decreasing available water resources generally the water allocation scheme of government is made yearly form this july to the next june thus the length of each period is one hydrological year every period represents a low flow year in different degrees the water resources in provinces are re allocated to four water use sectors including industry agriculture resident and eco environment three kinds of pollutants are considered in the process of water use including wastewater chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen compounds among four water use sectors no pollutants are assumed to be emitted from the eco environment sector the economic efficiency coefficient e it will increase at a yearly rate of 1 and 2 in the future due to advancement of technologies the available water resources of a hydrological year can be allocated largely depending on the runoff estimations of that year and the coordination of various water storage facilities along the river according to the china water resources bulletin and the studies of liu et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020a 2020b the natural runoff of the yellow river has a strong spatial and temporal variability with changes from 70 5 the upper yellow river contributes more than 60 of streamflow for the whole region the streamflow of the lower river is usually largely affected by the storage of upper hydraulic facilities and water withdraws along the river the average streamflow changes of the upper hydrological stations are used to represent the natural water supply of the yellow river thus the total available water resources in the entire yr basin in period t tq t are assumed to decrease at rates of 5 and 10 in the second and third periods for reflecting the increasingly severe water shortages and decreasing available water resources in the yellow river respectively during the three periods t 1 t 2 t 3 the total available water resources in the entire yr basin in period t tq is 37 00 35 15 and 31 64 billion m3 respectively with the development of water saving technologies and the stricter regulations for water conservation the minimum and maximum water demands dmin it and dmax it will both decrease at a rate of 1 and 2 in the second and third periods the water use cost of sector j of province i in period t costw ijt will increase at rates of 50 and 100 in the second and third periods due to the increasing water scarcity the disposal costs of pollutant k in period t cdw kt will also increase at rates of 50 and 100 in the second and third periods due to the stricter pollutant discharge regulations the maximum pollution carrying capacity maxp ikt will decrease at the rates of 10 and 20 in the second and third periods for protecting environmentally sensitive waters of which pollution carrying capacities will decrease due to the decreasing runoffs in the future the input pollution coefficient ξ ijk and other model input parameters are all listed in supplementary materials 4 results analyses and discussions 4 1 model solutions the solution of only upper level model and only lower level model are shown in tables 3 7 the optimal solutions for two objectives of upper level and lower level dms corresponding to three models including only upper level model and only lower model and the bi level fuzzybiwrm model are shown in table 3 in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the trade offs between the upper level dm yrcc and lower level dms riparian provinces are quantified by the λ which represents the overall acceptable satisfactory degree of the solutions for the whole system when the gini coefficient for water allocation equality is 0 3 and the acceptable tolerances of p 1 p 2 10 billion cubic meters the optimal solutions of upper level objective f u 0 1 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and lower level objective f l o 3 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and the overall acceptable satisfactory degree λ of the solutions obtained from the proposed fuzzybiwrm model is 0 71 the larger the λ value the more satisfactory the solutions for the yrcc the economic quantification of the objective function is based on the per capita gross domestic product and provincial populations while for the riparian provinces it is quantified by product values of four water use sectors there are no connects between the two objective functions of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model when the water resources allocation process is absolutely controlled by the yrcc only upper level model the preference of yrcc is satisfied at first and their optimal objective f u is 1 92 107million chinese yuan and the objectives of the lower level dms riparian provinces f l are 3 43 107 million chinese yuan the lower level riparian provinces cannot find an optimal solution when the preferences of the upper level dm are satisfied if the water resources allocation process is decided by only the lower level riparian provinces the preferences of riparian provinces are met and their optimal objective f l is 4 09 10 7 million chinese yuan which is 1 2 times greater than that f l for the system decided by only the upper level dm yrcc however it is impossible to find the optimal solution for the yrcc in the only lower level model disagreements between the optimal solutions of the only upper level and the only lower level dms indicate the conflicting preferences of the yrcc and riparian provinces through the interactive fuzzy method the upper level dm can allow their optimal solutions and objectives to change within a certain range by specifying acceptable tolerances as shown in table 3 the economic objective f u o of the yrcc is between the values of least acceptable objective f u and the optimal objective f u the same as the lower level dms the solutions for water resources allocations for riparian provinces by the yrcc in different periods are shown in table 4 since the upper level dm yrcc aims to maximize the profits of whole system with a specified equity in advance as much water as possible will be preferably allocated to the provinces with high returns on water use in addition to meet the basic water demands of other riparian provinces as shown in table 4 in the model solutions for the system controlled by the only upper level dm yrcc the allocated water resources x u to some provinces with higher return benefits on water use are obviously more than those x l for the system controlled by only the lower level dms riparian provinces such as shandong shaanxi hebei and shanxi whose economic efficiency coefficients are more than 100 million chinese yuan per million cubic meters of water however from the perspective of the lower level dms they would ask for as much water from the yellow river to maximize their benefits of water use sectors in provinces and simultaneously have to follow the decisions of the upper level dms for those riparian provinces whose economic efficiency coefficients are less than 100 million chinese yuan per million cubic meters of water it is impossible to find their optimal solutions x l if they just follow the results x u for the system fully controlled by the upper level dm the conflicting preferences of the upper level and lower level dms are well solved by the water resources allocation scheme x o of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model there is an obvious trade off between the demands of yrcc and riparian provinces the allocated water resources for those provinces with higher return benefits on water use are regulated down while it is increasing for those provinces with lower return benefits on water use as the amount of water available for allocation decreases over period the amount of water allocated to each province in each period also decreases as shown in table 4 the re allocation schemes of water resources for water use sectors of riparian provinces in three periods are shown in tables 5 7 the re allocation scheme is decided by industrial structures in every province the water use sector of agriculture uses most of the water resources in provinces when the system is fully supervised by only the upper level dm table 5 the provinces with high return benefits are allocated as much water as possible and demands of water use sectors in these provinces are preferred to be satisfied in those provinces with low return benefits on water use only basic demands of sectors are met when the system is fully controlled by only the lower level dms table 6 the allocated water resources to sectors of industry residents and eco environment j 1 j 3 and j 4 in provinces with low return benefits are increased while those to sector of industry and agriculture j 1 and j 2 in provinces with high return benefits are decreased in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model both yrcc and riparian provinces have their own preferences and make attempts to maximize their own economic benefits the decisions of the yrcc affect the re allocation of water resources among different water use sectors in provinces the proposed fuzzybiwrm model can effectively solve the conflicting demands of dms at different levels and find a balanced solution of the whole system table 7 the yrcc has made a concession to the riparian provinces with the sacrifice of its own preferences the lower level dms riparian provinces need to find their solution with the concession of the yrcc the upper level and lower level dms yrcc and riparian provinces can communicate with each other and dynamically adjust their own solutions to make a balance over the whole system by using the proposed model a more equitable water resources allocation scheme can be generated in the yellow river region the initial allocation of water to each water use sector can be dynamically adjusted to maximize economic and ecological benefits while ensuring water equity and minimum water demand the proposed bi level model provides more flexibility in making sequential decisions from a higher level to a lower level and quantifying the tradeoffs in various decision makers in different decision making levels its model structure is consistent with the real world water resources management in the yellow river region as a result the generated optimal solutions may provide effective decision support for cost effective and equitable water allocation management along the yellow river 4 2 multi period analyses to evaluate the effects of reduced water resources availability on water resources management in the yellow river reflect the potential problem of caused by climate change a multi period scenario analysis is conducted during the planning periods the available water resources from the yellow river are assumed to decrease at rates of 5 and 10 in the second and third periods respectively fig 2 shows the optimal solutions for the whole system in three periods the initially allocated water resources pq the decision variables for the upper level dm yrcc for all riparian provinces will decrease in the future especially for those provinces with high water consumption such as shaanxi shanxi henan hebei and shandong accordingly the proportional structure of water use by sectors in province will also change the proportion of water used for agriculture in most provinces will decrease firstly the effects of decreasing water resources on the solutions and economic losses of the system are shown in fig 3 which reflects the differences of solutions between period 1 and period 3 as the available water resources in the yellow river decrease the provinces of shaanxi and shanxi would suffer the most economic damages with more than 20 followed by henan with an economic loss of 11 on the contrary because of the yrcc s preference to provinces with high economic efficiencies the province of shandong which is one of the major water consumers of the yellow river would not face too much financial losses caused by decreasing water resources in the future for provinces economically left behind such as qinghai gansu and ningxia the existing water allocation scheme can only meet their basic water demands and no more water can be compressed from them the economic effects of future decreasing water resources on those provinces will also be slight and no more than 10 for the lower level dms the re allocation scheme of water resources for sectors will vary with the decisions of the upper level dms what lower level dms will face is the economic losses brought to different water use sectors especially agriculture resident and industry since the re allocated water resources to those three sectors will be reduced most however for some provinces such as qinghai inner mongolia and shandong with the decreasing available water resources the benefits of provincial sectors will increase in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the costs of wastewater and pollutants are considered in the lower level for example in qinghai the water demand of residents is reduced by 35 due to the adjustment of future decreasing water resources the wastewater cod and ammonia nitrogen compounds emitted in qinghai mainly come from the water used by residents the proportions of wastewater cod and ammonia nitrogen compounds discharged from residential water use to every pollutant are 63 9 41 8 and 72 2 respectively less water used less pollutants emitted thus the benefits of water use sectors increase in qinghai due to reduced pollution treatment costs in inner mongolia water resources used by agriculture will be mainly reduced and more water resources will be allocated to sector of eco environment since water use sector of agriculture is the main contributor to emitted pollutants in inner mongolia and sector of eco environment is with high return benefits the benefits of sectors in this province will increase in the future 4 3 water use equity analyses the upper level dm of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model prefers to allocate as much water as possible to those riparian provinces with high economic efficiency coefficient of water use to maximize the benefits of the whole system such a preference would further exacerbate inequities among provinces in allocation of water resources in the yellow river in the fuzzybiwrm model the upper level dm can take a control of water allocation equity through introducing the constraint eq 7 a gini coefficient is introduced to address the water allocation equity issue in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the upper level dm needs to pre specify a gini coefficient before making decisions the effects of water allocation equity on the management objectives are shown in fig 4 for the upper level dm taking water allocation equity into account would bring losses to their objectives as shown in subplot a in fig 4 an increase of the gini coefficient for water allocation equity mean a fair water allocation scheme leading to increased benefits of the whole water resources management system in the yellow river since the upper level decision maker may have their own top limits on the tolerance values p a high gini coefficient would make it easier to find possible solutions for the conflicting two level dms in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model when the upper level dm rejects to make any further concessions for the lower level dms as the cost of water use equity sacrifice more water will be allocated to those provinces with higher return benefits on water use and more economic profits are assured as shown in subplot b in fig 4 when the upper level dms do not overemphasize the water use equity although they can realize the objective of maximizing the profits of the available water resources from the yellow river it does damage to the economy of sectors in provinces as a loss of water equity the trend of objective f l of the lower level dms is exactly opposite of those of objectives f l and f l o since more water resources are allocated to those economically developed provinces the water demands of the sectors cannot be met which cause the loss of benefits of provincial water use sectors this suggests that only focusing on the benefits of the whole would overlook the benefits of the components the proposed fuzzybiwrm model can effectively address the conflict issues and generate acceptable solutions to two level dms from the point of view of the whole system the effects of water allocation equity on the allocation scheme of water resources are shown in fig 5 for the upper level dm yrcc the water use equity constraint can promote an equitable allocation scheme of water resources in the yellow river for those provinces with high return benefits on water use such as shandong shanxi and henan the amounts of initially allocated water resources decrease the bars above the zero especially for shandong the allocated water amounts decrease in all three periods with the gradually decreasing water resources in the yellow river the province of shandong will face increasingly serious water shortages while for those provinces economically left behind such as qinghai gansu and ningxia their initially allocated water resources increase bars below the zero when the water use equity is considered with the gradually decreasing water resources no more water resources will be allocated to them however for the hebei province although it is a province with strong economy more water resources are allocated to it with the constraint of water equity the possible reason is that the main source for water withdrawing in hebei province is haihe river instead of the yellow river the dependence of hebei province on the yellow river for water resources is on the low side for the lower level dms the effects of water equity constraint are on the adjustments for water use of agriculture industry and residents in the event of potential water shortages particularly in shandong and shanxi extra attentions should be paid to the allocation of water for agriculture blue bars above zero efficient irrigation techniques should be adopted to increase the effective rate of irrigation in agriculture at the same time for the less economically developed provinces which would face with more severe agricultural water shortages than provinces in the east consideration should be given to increasing their amount of agricultural water use appropriately 4 4 compared with the existing water allocation plan based on the 87 scheme the water allocation schemes obtained from the proposed fuzzybiwrm model are compared with the existing water allocation plan as shown in fig 6 the existing water allocation scheme is an adjustment of the 87 scheme based on a strategy that the allocated water resources for all provinces are reducing increasing at a same proportion in a low flow high flow year in a year with a low flow in which the available water resources are 34 billion m3 the water allocation scheme of the proposed fuzzybiwrm model outperforms the existing one based on 87 scheme with the strategy of same proportional reduction it is more advantageous in a year with a high flow when the available water resources are 39 billion m3 the comparison results indicate that the economic benefits of the whole yellow river obtained from the developed fuzzybiwrm model are always larger than those from the existing one based on 87 scheme that s since a strategy of targeted reduction increase of water resources in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model instead of a proportional reduction increase can better maximize economic benefits of two level dms based on their preferences while such a dynamic and interactive decision making process cannot be reflected in the 87 scheme as shown in fig 6 the modeling results indicate a bit equality water allocation with gini 0 24 with the premise of meeting minimum water demands and water use equity the water use structure is dynamically adjusted to maximize the water use profits of the whole region in a low flow year some provinces such as gansu and ningxia would receive less water than original 87 scheme but the whole region is still in water use safety and equity the higher water use benefits in the fig 6 show that the proposed water allocation scheme of fuzzybiwrm can better maximize the water use benefits than the existing 87 scheme by dynamical adjustments however the existing 87 scheme cannot maximize the use of water resources since it adjusts the water allocations limits based on a simple proportionate principle the proposed fuzzybiwrm model has fully considered the actual structure of water resources management in the yellow river basin and riparian provinces it can not only address the preferences of dms in different administrative levels but also generate acceptable solutions to satisfy the conflicting objectives of different dms in the whole water resources allocation system 5 conclusions a multi period interactive fuzzy bi level model named fuzzybiwrm has been proposed for water resources planning in the yellow river region it can effectively deal with the hierarchical and sequential decision making issues in water resources management structure of the yellow river involving two level dms including the yrcc and the riparian provinces different dms have their own preferences in the decision making processes in the proposed fuzzybiwrm model the upper level dms have strong power over the decisions to find an optimal solution for the whole water resources planning system all dms need to make compromises the modeling results indicate that the conflicting objectives and different preferences of two level dms are addressed by introducing an interactive fuzzy approach the trade offs between two level dms can be effectively quantified by introducing a min operator λ with g 0 3 and the acceptable tolerances of p 1 p 2 10 billion cubic meters the optimal solutions of upper level objective f u 0 1 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and lower level objective f l o 3 90 10 7 million chinese yuan and the overall acceptable satisfactory degree λ of the solutions obtained from the proposed fuzzybiwrm model is 0 71 the larger the λ value the more satisfactory the solutions the optimal water allocation schemes are compared with the existing 87 scheme under different water supply scenarios the results imply that the proposed model can generate a more equitable water allocation scheme that leads to more water use benefits regardless of whether it is a high flow or low flow year under a scenario of reduced allocable water resources initially allocated water resources for all riparian provinces will decrease in the future especially for those provinces with high water consumptions such as shaanxi shanxi henan hebei and shandong the allocated water to provinces of shaanxi and shanxi would be significantly reduced more than 1 4 billion m3 they would suffer with more than 25 of economic damages due to water decreasing although the main source of water supply for hebei is the haihe river instead of the yellow river hebei would be with reduced water supplies of 0 53 billion m3 from the yellow river and suffer with economic loss of 23 7 for henan province it would receive 0 7 billion cubic meters less water but it would suffer with economic loss of 11 5 shandong would face a smaller economic loss than other four provinces due to its economic importance in the yellow river region for some economically backward provinces the margins for the amounts of water allocation that can be regulated are already small reduced allocated water would bring a large economic to water use sectors such as ningxia with less than 0 3 billion m3 causing more than 20 economic loss to guarantee the equity of the water resources allocating system constraints of water use equity based on a modified gini coefficient are introduced the results show that the upper level dm can maximize the profits of water in the upper level with the increase of parameter g while the benefits of water in the lower level will decrease due to the lack of water use equity since more water resources are allocated to those economically developed provinces the water demands of water use sectors in provinces economic behind cannot be fully met it would cause the benefit losses of provincial water use sectors especially for the agriculture users in agriculture based provinces when the upper level dm prefers a more equitable water allocating system major water use provinces such as shandong shanxi and henan should appropriately improve the water efficiency of the more water consuming sectors to adapt to the dynamic adjustment of water allocations for example efficient irrigation techniques should be adopted to increase the effective rate of irrigation in agriculture in shandong henan should promote a water saving living water environment of residents for other provinces which are economically behind they can appropriately increase the amounts of water allocated to users especially irrigations and residents although the proposed fuzzybiwrm model contributes to the existing studies in addressing hierarchical and sequential water resources allocation issues in the yellow river future improvements are still needed in the future research more detailed divisions of water use sectors can be considered to improve the applicability of the developed model with a flexible model structure more dms in more decision making levels can be included in the extension of the proposed model by combining with a multi objective optimization model the objectives of decision makers in each level can be diverse in addition more real world water availability scenarios in the yellow river can be built with the projected streamflow from hydrological models the developed fuzzybiwrm model has provided insights into effective management of water resources allocations in the yellow river it has the potential to help governmental dms better manage a limited number of water resources in responding to potential water shortage crisis due to climate change and human activities credit

necessary for adaptation planning there have been many such studies for great britain but fewer for ni here a grid based hydrological model is configured for ni and used to investigate changes in seasonal mean extreme high and extreme low flows new hydrological insights when driven by observed climate data the model shows good performance for a wide range of catchments particularly where artificial influences are limited when driven by ensemble data from the ukcp18 regional 12 km projections model performance for the baseline period 1981 2010 is similar to that using observed data especially when using a simple precipitation bias correction model projections for a future time slice 2051 2080 generally suggest decreases in spring autumn mean flows especially in summer median 44 but possible increases in winter mean flows median 9 with some variation between ensemble members particularly in winter when some show large increases to the west consistent with this are large

potential future impacts of climate change on river flows is necessary to enable appropriate planning and adaptation huntjens et al 2012 there is already evidence of increases in floods in north west europe and the uk blöschl et al 2019 but changes in hydrological droughts are less clear hanel et al 2018 rudd et al 2017 broad scale modelling studies suggest that parts of north west europe will continue to see increases in floods with possible decreases in low flows and increases in drought duration in western southern regions marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 roudier et al 2016 a large number of studies have looked at the potential impacts of climate change on river flows in great britain gb using the uk climate projections 2009 ukcp09 murphy et al 2009 which provided a number of

projections a perturbed parameter ensemble ppe of a regional climate model rcm and a weather generator studies including the potential impacts of climate change on river flows in northern ireland ni using ukcp09 are more limited for example a water resources assessment including five catchments in ni alongside 65 in gb christierson et al 2012 and a study of seasonal runoff covering the whole of the uk sanderson et al 2012 studies using other climate projection data for northern ireland include an investigation of compound hydro hazards for 239 catchments across the uk 10 in ni visser quinn

et al 2011b steele dunne et al 2008 studies typically suggest future increases in winter flows and flood magnitude but decreases in summer flows in ni similar to gb however a study of historical flow observations for a set of near natural catchments spread across the whole of ireland shows trends that are not entirely consistent with the changes expected under climate change murphy et al 2013 the uk climate projections 2018 ukcp18 lowe et al 2018 provide an update to ukcp09 again giving information on potential future changes in a range of climatic variables via a number of products a small

river flows time series data from the ukcp18 12 km rcm 12 member ppe are then used to drive the model to look at potential future changes in seasonal mean flows as well as extreme high and low flow flows thus extending the gb results of kay 2021 and lane and kay 2021 to cover ni the methods are described in section 2 with results presented in section 3 a discussion in section 4 and conclusions in section 5 2 methods 2 1 hydrological model setup the grid to grid g2g is a national scale hydrological model that typically runs on a 1 km x 1 km grid at a 15 minute time step and is parameterised using digital datasets e g soil types land cover flow directions bell et al 2009 it was originally configured for application across gb on a spatial domain aligned with the gb national grid a version has now been configured to cover northern ireland and sub catchments in the roi that drain to ni rivers also on a spatial domain aligned with the gb national grid g2g has been shown to perform well for a wide range of catchments across gb bell et al 2009 2016 formetta et al 2018 particularly those with more natural flow regimes as it does not routinely take account of the effect of artificial influences such as abstractions and discharges on river flows it has also been shown to perform well for low flows and for drought identification rudd et al 2017 the g2g generally uses spatial datasets for model configuration in preference to parameter identification via calibration and where model parameters are required such as the kinematic wave speeds used in lateral routing nationally applicable values are used spatial data such as flow directions land cover and soils used to configure g2g are as in bell et al 2009 the effect of urban and suburban land cover on runoff and downstream flows is accounted for in the model but the impact of water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs on downstream river flows is generally neglected at the national scale lake storage and regulation is not accounted for and lake grid cells are treated as though they were rivers for ni the hydrological landscape is dominated by lough neagh a large freshwater lake with an area of approximately 390 km2 as well as lough erne which consists of two connected lakes upper and lower with a combined area of approximately 144 km2 located to the south west of ni thus the exclusion of lake storage and regulation is most likely to impact on model performance for river locations downstream of lough neagh the lower bann river g2g requires input time series of precipitation and potential evaporation pe as well as temperature data for the optional snow module bell et al 2016 which is applied here model outputs include gridded time series of monthly mean flows annual maxima of daily mean flows and 7 day minima of daily mean flows in addition time series of daily mean river flows can be output for 1 km grid boxes corresponding to specific catchments for which gauged flow data are available from the national river flow archive nrfa www ceh ac uk data nrfa although river flows are produced for every 1 km grid box only data from non tidal grid boxes with a catchment area of at least 50 km2 are analysed here pixels within lough neagh and lough erne are also excluded if they are at least 70 water according to 25 m data from land cover map 2015 rowland et al 2017 the remaining 1468 pixels are hereafter termed 1 km river pixels of which 1106 are within ni 2 2 observation based simulation an observation based simulation is performed for dec 1980 nov 2011 hereafter termed simobs using the following gridded datasets daily 1 km grids of precipitation ceh gear tanguy et al 2016 these data are on the irish national grid and cover the required parts of the roi so have been re projected to the gb national grid as a 50 m grid and the mean in each 1 km cell estimated they are then divided equally over each model time step within a day monthly 40 km grids of pe for short grass morecs hough and jones 1997 these data are on the irish national grid so have been re projected to the 1 km gb national grid using the majority morecs square in each 1 km cell the data do not cover all the required parts of the roi or indeed all of ni so have been extended where necessary by copying from the nearest 1 km grid cell with data they are then divided equally over each model time step within a month daily 1 km grids of min and max temperature met office et al 2019 these data are on the gb national grid but do not cover the required parts of the roi so have been infilled from the nearest 1 km grid cell with data using altitude information and a lapse rate they are then interpolated through the day using a sine curve the simulation is initialised using a states file saved at the end of a prior observation based run jan 1970 nov 1980 using the same driving datasets as above 2 3 climate change simulations the climate change simulations use daily precipitation daily min and max temperature data and daily pe derived from the ukcp18 regional 12 km projections met office hadley centre 2018 these comprise a 12 member rcm ppe nested in an equivalent gcm ppe covering dec 1980 nov 2080 under rcp8 5 emissions riahi et al 2011 ensemble member 01 uses the standard parameterisation the data are available re projected onto a 12 km grid aligned with the gb national grid biases in the 12 km rcm precipitation murphy et al 2018 fig 4 4 are adjusted using monthly correction factor grids derived by comparing baseline mean monthly precipitation totals from each ppe member separately against those from ceh gear averaged up to the rcm grid with smoothing based on weighting in a 3 3 neighbourhood supp fig 1 guillod et al 2018 the precipitation data are then spatially downscaled using patterns derived from 1 km standard average annual rainfall data 1961 1990 bell et al 2007 and temporally downscaled in the same way as for observed rainfall data section 2 2 the 12 km rcm temperature data are downscaled to 1 km using a lapse rate with elevation data morris and flavin 1990 and temporally downscaled in the same way as for observed temperature data section 2 2 the 12 km rcm pe is estimated from re projected daily climate variables using a formulation replicating that of morecs as closely as possible including an interception correction potential future increases in stomatal resistance under higher atmospheric co2 concentrations are also included rudd and kay 2016 guillod et al 2018 pe is only estimated for rcm boxes classed as land with any other required 12 km boxes infilled by copying from the nearest 12 km box with data the 12 km rcm pe data are spatially and temporally downscaled in the same way as for observed data section 2 2 the same state initialisation file is used for each rcm based simulation hereafter termed simrcm as for simobs section 2 2 the central projection from the rcm ppe suggests typical decreases in summer precipitation of around 25 and increases in winter precipitation of around 15 over ni by 2061 2080 murphy et al 2018 fig 4 8 c d however summer decreases can be as much as 50 and winter increases as high as 30 for some ni locations in some ensemble members and winter decreases of 10 or more are possible in ni for some ensemble members temperature increases by 2 5 c in summer and 1 4 c in winter over ni by 2061 2080 depending on location and ensemble member murphy et al 2018 fig 4 8 a b pe between spring and autumn typically increases by 7 15 with increases of 20 or more in some locations for some ensemble members winter pe also generally increases by 2 on average and up to 19 in some locations for some ensemble members but there are decreases of as much as 10 in places although these are not likely to be important as winter pe is fairly low 2 4 analysis of simulated flows a 30 year time slice is used to assess performance of the g2g river flow simulations comparing the simobs run against gauged flows section 2 4 1 and comparing the simrcm runs against the simobs run section 2 4 2 these performance assessments use the time slice 1981 2010 a 30 year future time slice is compared against a 30 year baseline time slice for the simrcm runs to assess potential future changes in flows section 2 4 3 the precise time slices differ slightly depending on the flows under consideration the periods dec 1980 nov 2010 and dec 2050 nov 2080 are used for seasonal mean flows and low flows to fit most closely with the available rcm data section 2 3 but the periods oct 1981 sep 2011 and oct 2050 sep 2080 i e 30 water years are used for high flows section 2 4 3 2 4 1 performance using observed data three time series performance measures are used to quantify different aspects of the agreement between simulated and observed flows for 35 catchments those nrfa catchments with an area of at least 50 km2 and no more than 20 missing flow data in the baseline period fig 1a eight of these are designated as benchmark catchments ukbn2 harrigan et al 2018 a set of catchments across the uk where human disturbance to flows is considered minimal and flow gauging is generally considered reliable although there are additional flags highlighting gauging issues for high low flows information on the 35 catchments is provided in supp table 1 the three performance measures are based on the model efficiency criterion of nash and sutcliffe 1970 including versions adapted to focus on average flows using the square root and low flows using logarithms specifically the measures are defined as ns 1 q t m t 2 q t q t 2 nssqrt 1 q t m t 2 q t q t 2 ns log 1 ln q t ϵ ln m t ϵ 2 ln q t ϵ ln q t ϵ 2 w i t h q t 100 where q t are the observed flows m t are the modelled flows ε is a small value usually taken to be the observed mean flow divided by 100 and t is time an ns nssqrt or nslog value of 1 indicates a perfect fit whilst a negative value indicates that the fit is worse than the mean flow the results are presented in section 3 1 2 4 2 performance using baseline climate model data assessment of the performance using baseline climate model data uses measures derived from flow duration curves thus comparing statistical characteristics of flows rather than day to day equivalence because weather events in the rcm ppe will not follow the observed weather over the baseline period kay 2021 the analysis uses gauged flows for 35 catchments section 2 4 1 and compares these with simulated daily mean flows for corresponding locations from the simobs run from each simrcm run individually and from pooling the 12 simrcm runs together both with and without bias correction the analysis involves three measures quantifying the percentage bias for different parts of the flow duration curve low flow volume lfv 70 95 bias in the 70th 95th quantiles median flow mdf bias in the 50th quantile and high flow volume hfv 5 30 bias in the 5th 30th quantiles the results are presented in section 3 2 2 4 3 future changes in flows using climate model data to assess potential future changes in flows for each simrcm run the following analyses are performed gridded time series of monthly mean flows are used to derive seasonal mean flows for each time slice using the standard seasons winter december february spring march may summer june august autumn september november as for gb kay 2021 gridded time series of the annual maxima of daily mean flows are used to derive flood frequency curves for each time slice the generalised logistic distribution is fitted to the 30 annual maxima for each time slice using the method of l moments hosking 1996 robson reed 1999 to produce flood frequency curves covering 1 to 25 year return period events as for gb lane and kay 2021 gridded time series of the annual minima of 7 day mean flows are used to derive low flow frequency curves for each time slice a generalised extreme value distribution is applied to the 7 day annual minimum flows using the method of l moments hosking 1996 zaidman et al 2002 to produce low flow frequency curves as for gb lane and kay 2021 percentages changes from the baseline time slice to the future time slice are calculated for each simrcm run separately section 3 3 for flood low flow frequency the analysis focuses on 10 year return period events flow changes are mapped but also summarised for the three river basin regions covering northern ireland nw ireland neagh bann and ne ireland supp fig 2 3 results 3 1 performance using observed data the g2g shows good overall performance for the simobs run fig 1b c the model performs well across the flow range with the median performance across the set of catchments for the three performance measures section 2 4 1 being 0 71 for ns high flows 0 77 for nssqrt average flows and 0 72 for nslog low flows fig 1b some example hydrographs are shown in fig 2 in fig 1b the eight benchmark catchments are marked with an asterisk with those specifically suitable for either high or low flows having filled markers the benchmark catchments show good model performance for all three scores except for catchment 202002 faughan at drumahoe and 204001 bush at seneirl bridge fig 2a which have slightly poorer performance for low flows and catchment 203028 agivey at whitehill which has slightly poorer performance for high flows despite being benchmark catchments both 202002 and 204001 do have some abstractions and discharges and 204001 has an upstream reservoir nrfa 2021 although the effect of these on gauged flows is considered small they could still affect model performance particularly for low flows catchments not in the benchmark network show more scatter in the performance scores the best performing non benchmark catchments are 203010 blackwater at maydown bridge fig 2b 205004 lagan at newforge fig 2c and 205011 annacloy at kilmore bridge which have values greater than 0 8 for all three performance measures the nssqrt values are at least 0 6 for all catchments but there are some catchments with ns and nslog values less than 0 6 with the nslog low flow values tending to be worse the simulated low flows for 201007 burn dennet at burndennet tend to be too low simulated q70 about 57 of observed not shown which could be due to difficulties in measuring low flow in the wide and shallow channel at this station nrfa 2021 catchment 203027 braid at ballee also has simulated low flows that are lower than the observed flows which could be due to effluent returns affecting the flow at this station and the gauged low flows are affected by weed growth nrfa 2021 there are no obvious reasons for the poorer simulation of low flows for catchment 201009 owenkillow at crosh maps of the performance scores fig 1c show that the lowest performing catchments are generally located to the north west with the highest performing catchments often located to the south east catchment 203040 lower bann at movanagher is the only gauged catchment located downstream of lough neagh on the lower bann river and its poorer model performance for high flows is due to the regulation of lough neagh the department for infrastructure dfi rivers are required to regulate water levels in lough neagh within a specific range to reduce the flood risk dfi 2021 this is achieved using flood gates at the head of the lower bann river where it exits from lough neagh with two additional flood gates down the lower bann river which further control levels the regulation heavily influences the observed flows by capping high flows fig 2d currently the g2g does not account for such flow regulation 3 2 performance using baseline climate model data boxplots summarising the three measures of fit of the flow duration curves for low median and high flows section 2 4 2 across the set of 35 gauged catchments show that the bias correction makes the performance of the pooled simrcm ensemble more similar to the performance of the simobs run fig 3 maps of the measures supp fig 3 indicate that a tendency for over estimation of median and high flows has been reduced by the bias correction there is a tendency towards under estimation of low flows in most catchments though for the simobs run as well as the simrcm runs an additional assessment of the baseline monthly mean flows flood frequency curves and low flow frequency curves for the eight benchmark catchments shows good agreement between the rcm and observation based runs with the simrcm ensemble generally bounding the simobs data supp fig 4 there is a large spread in the simrcm ensemble for higher return period 15 years flood flows which is unsurprising when estimating these rarer events from a relatively short 30 year flow time series for low flows there is a tendency for the simrcm ensemble to over estimate flows at low return periods 1 3 years compared to the simobs run 3 3 future changes in flows using climate model data maps of the seasonal mean flow changes from the simrcm ensemble presented as the median and the 2nd lowest and 2nd highest projection for each river pixel almost exclusively show decreases in each season especially for the ensemble median change fig 4 the exception is small increases in the ensemble median winter flows median 9 mainly to the south and west and increases in the 2nd highest in winter and spring in contrast large reductions in summer flows are predicted by all ensemble members median 44 and autumn decreases can also be large median 13 particularly to the south and east results for individual simrcm ensemble members further show the variation between members supp fig 5 maps of the 10 year low flow changes from the simrcm ensemble again presented as the median and the 2nd lowest and 2nd highest projection for each river pixel show large reductions with the ensemble median showing reductions of 25 to 64 across ni fig 4 overall median 45 these widespread decreases in low flows are seen across all the simrcm ensemble members supp fig 6b alongside decreasing low flows there is also a trend towards annual minimum events occurring later in the year by up to around 30 days although these are only significant in a few of the ensemble members supp fig 7b the sign of change for 10 year high flows is less clear maps summarising results from the simrcm ensemble show average changes ranging from 7 5 to 40 between the 2nd lowest and 2nd highest ensemble members fig 4 overall median 16 there is much variation between the simrcm ensemble members with some predicting large increases in high flows e g 04 11 15 some predicting overall decreases in high flows e g 01 12 and others showing a more mixed picture supp fig 6a this results in the particularly large ensemble range for changes to high flows when compared to the low flow or seasonal changes fig 4 analysis of the dates of occurrence of amax showed few significant changes in timing supp fig 7a summary distributions of seasonal mean flow high flow and low flow changes for three regions clearly show the differences in response for different ensemble members seasons and regions fig 5 there are clear differences between ensemble members in all regions and seasons with it being possible to select pairs of ensemble members with no or very little overlap in response in all cases although for ne ireland in autumn there are broader ranges of change for most ensemble members and thus often more overlap between them the difference between ensemble members is most stark for the high flow changes where there are large differences between ensemble members for both the flow change values and ranges 4 discussion the application of a national scale grid based hydrological model for northern ireland with observed driving data has shown generally good performance for catchments across the country and across the flow range the exception is flows downstream of lough neagh where flood regulation essentially caps the observed river flows since the hydrological model currently does not include any artificial influences on flows so essentially simulates natural flows the pattern of observed flows downstream of lough neagh cannot be replicated in the simulations however it may be possible to enhance the model to include such regulation it would also be possible provided appropriate datasets were available to incorporate abstraction and discharges into the model and to use estimates of open water pe for the lake pixels the use of the g2g model with driving data from the ukcp18 regional projection ensemble shows that performance for a baseline period is similar to that of observed driving data especially after application of a simple bias correction to climate model precipitation comparison of ensemble modelling results for a future time slice compared to the baseline time slice generally suggests future decreases in seasonal mean flows especially in summer and autumn there is some variation between ensemble members particularly in winter when some show large increases in flows to the west consistent with this the analysis of 10 year return period low flows shows large reductions across the country and the analysis of 10 year return period high flows shows large increases for some locations and ensemble members these flow changes are consistent with the typical decreases in summer precipitation increases in winter precipitation and increases in pe section 2 3 and similar to the flow changes simulated for north west england kay 2021 lane kay 2021 decreasing summer and autumn flows with possible small increases to winter flows are broadly consistent with previous climate impact studies to have included ni catchments christierson et al 2012 sanderson et al 2012 arnell et al 2021 christierson et al 2012 also indicated reductions in summer flows for five catchments in ni however by using the ukcp09 probabilistic projections they were better able to sample modelling uncertainties finding that increases in summer flows were also within the ensemble spread of their projections sanderson et al 2012 also found that whilst the ensemble mean change in runoff showed summer reductions a reduction in summer flows was not unanimously predicted by all models by the 2050s whilst few studies have focused on changes to extreme flows for northern ireland the increases in flood flows found here are consistent with projections of increasing 5 100 year return period flows for irish catchments bastola et al 2011b and results for ireland within a european analysis of changing high and flood flows thober et al 2018 declining summer flows which may also indicate a reduction in discharge associated with low flow extremes are consistent with studies of irish catchments bastola et al 2011a steele dunne et al 2008 since the model essentially simulates natural river flows the climate change impact modelling does not account for potential future changes in artificial influences such as abstractions or discharges neither does it allow for potential future changes in land use or land cover also only one global regional climate model is applied albeit as a perturbed parameter ensemble under only one emissions scenario rcp8 5 the climate model is typically considered the largest source of uncertainty in hydrological impact modelling vetter et al 2017 roudier et al 2016 although the hydrological model can be particularly important for low flows giuntoli et al 2015 the rcp8 5 emissions scenario is considered a high scenario and lower pathways should give lesser impacts e g kay et al 2020 further sources of uncertainty include the estimation of future pe kay and davies 2008 dallaire et al 2021 and the choice of bias correction approach e g lafon et al 2013 5 conclusions developing a national scale grid based hydrological model for ni and the parts of the republic of ireland that drain into ni has enabled the simulation of river flows across the country at gauged and ungauged locations the model builds on one used extensively for modelling river flows across great britain and takes advantage of digital datasets to enable the simulation of varying hydrological responses due to spatial differences in landscape characteristics the model performance is good for a wide range of catchments provided flows are not heavily affected by artificial influences e g river regulation abstractions or discharges although such models may not perform as well as calibrated catchment models at specific locations they have the advantage of simulating flows across a wide area in a consistent way analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on river flows across ni using the ukcp18 regional projections suggests significant impacts on seasonal mean flows and extreme flows such information is vital to enable the development of appropriate adaptation strategies particularly for flood risk management and drought and water resource management potential future uses of the model could include the application of a sensitivity based approach to estimating the impacts of climatic change on flood peaks which can be combined with the ukcp18 probabilistic projections to provide information for a broader range of climate model and emissions uncertainty than covered here kay et al 2021b such an approach would enable ni to move away from the current blanket 20 allowance for climate change impacts on peak river flows wasko et al 2021 by developing regional or location specific values as for england wales and scotland reynard et al 2017 other applications could include river flood forecasting and warning cranston et al 2012 price et al 2012 surface water flood and impact

europe and the uk blöschl et al 2019 but changes in hydrological droughts are less clear hanel et al 2018 rudd et al 2017 broad scale modelling studies suggest that parts of north west europe will continue to see increases in floods with possible decreases in low flows and increases in drought duration in western southern regions marx et al 2018 thober et al 2018 roudier et al 2016 a large

in section 5 2 methods 2 1 hydrological model setup the grid to grid g2g is a national scale hydrological model that typically runs on a 1 km x 1 km grid at a 15 minute time step and is parameterised using digital datasets e g soil types land cover flow directions bell et al 2009 it was originally configured for application across gb on a spatial domain aligned with the gb national grid a version has now been configured to cover northern ireland and sub catchments in the roi that drain to ni rivers also on a spatial domain aligned with the gb national grid g2g has been shown to perform well for a wide range of catchments across gb bell et al 2009 2016 formetta et al 2018 particularly those with more natural flow regimes as it does not routinely take account of the effect of artificial influences such as abstractions and discharges on river flows it has also been shown to perform well for low flows and for drought identification rudd et al 2017 the g2g generally uses spatial datasets for model configuration in preference to parameter identification via calibration and where model parameters are required such as the kinematic wave speeds used in lateral routing nationally applicable values are used spatial data such as flow directions land cover and soils used to configure g2g are as in bell et al 2009 the effect of urban and suburban land cover on runoff and downstream flows is accounted for in the model but the impact of water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs on downstream river flows is generally neglected at the national scale lake storage and regulation is not accounted for and lake grid cells are treated as though they were rivers for ni the hydrological landscape is dominated by lough neagh a large freshwater lake with an area of approximately 390 km2 as well as lough erne which consists of two connected lakes upper and lower with a combined area of approximately 144 km2 located to the south west of ni thus the exclusion of lake storage and regulation is most likely to impact on model performance for river locations downstream of lough neagh the lower bann river g2g requires input time series of precipitation and potential evaporation pe as well as temperature data for the optional snow module bell et al 2016 which is applied here model outputs include gridded time series of monthly mean flows annual maxima of daily mean flows and 7 day minima of daily mean flows in addition time series of daily mean river flows can be output for 1 km grid boxes corresponding to specific catchments for which gauged flow data are available from the national river flow archive nrfa www ceh ac uk data nrfa although river flows are produced for every 1 km grid box only data from non tidal grid boxes with a catchment area of at least 50 km2 are analysed here pixels within lough neagh and lough erne are also excluded if they are at least 70 water according to 25 m data from land cover map 2015 rowland et al 2017 the remaining 1468 pixels are hereafter termed 1 km river pixels of which 1106 are within ni 2 2 observation based simulation an observation based simulation is performed for dec 1980 nov 2011 hereafter termed simobs using the following gridded datasets daily 1 km grids of precipitation ceh gear tanguy et al 2016 these data are on the irish national grid and cover the required parts of the roi so have been re projected to the gb national grid as a 50 m grid and the mean in each 1 km cell estimated they are then divided equally over each model time step within a day monthly 40 km grids of pe for short grass morecs hough and jones 1997 these data are on the irish national grid so have been re projected to the 1 km gb national grid using the majority morecs square in each 1 km cell the data do not cover all the required parts of the roi or indeed all of ni so have been extended where necessary by copying from the nearest 1 km grid cell with data they are then divided equally over each model time step within a month daily 1 km grids of min and max temperature met office et al 2019 these data are on the gb national grid but do not cover the required parts of the roi so have been infilled from the nearest 1 km grid cell with data using altitude information and a lapse rate they are then interpolated through the day using a sine curve the simulation is initialised using a states file saved at the end of a prior observation based run jan 1970 nov 1980 using the same driving datasets as above 2 3 climate change simulations the climate change simulations use daily precipitation daily min and max temperature data and daily pe derived from the ukcp18 regional 12 km projections met office hadley centre 2018 these comprise a 12 member rcm ppe nested in an equivalent gcm ppe covering dec 1980 nov 2080 under rcp8 5 emissions riahi et al 2011 ensemble member 01 uses the standard parameterisation the data are available re projected onto a 12 km grid aligned with the gb national grid biases in the 12 km rcm precipitation murphy et al 2018 fig 4 4 are adjusted using monthly correction factor grids derived by comparing baseline mean monthly precipitation totals from each ppe member separately against those from ceh gear averaged up to the rcm grid with smoothing based on weighting in a 3 3 neighbourhood supp fig 1 guillod et al 2018 the precipitation data are then spatially downscaled using patterns derived from 1 km standard average annual rainfall data 1961 1990 bell et al 2007 and temporally downscaled in the same way as for observed rainfall data section 2 2 the 12 km rcm temperature data are downscaled to 1 km using a lapse rate with elevation data morris and flavin 1990 and temporally downscaled in the same way as for observed temperature data section 2 2 the 12 km rcm pe is estimated from re projected daily climate variables using a formulation replicating that of morecs as closely as possible including an interception correction potential future increases in stomatal resistance under higher atmospheric co2 concentrations are also included rudd and kay 2016 guillod et al 2018 pe is only estimated for rcm boxes classed as land with any other required 12 km boxes infilled by copying from the nearest 12 km box with data the 12 km rcm pe data are spatially and temporally downscaled in the same way as for observed data section 2 2 the same state initialisation file is used for each rcm based simulation hereafter termed simrcm as for simobs section 2 2 the central projection from the rcm ppe suggests typical decreases in summer precipitation of around 25 and increases in winter precipitation of around 15 over ni by 2061 2080 murphy et al 2018 fig 4 8 c d however summer decreases can be as much as 50 and winter increases as high as 30 for some ni locations in some ensemble members and winter decreases of 10 or more are possible in ni for some ensemble members temperature increases by 2 5 c in summer and 1 4 c in winter over ni by 2061 2080 depending on location and ensemble member murphy et al 2018 fig 4 8 a b pe between spring and autumn typically increases by 7 15 with increases of 20 or more in some locations for some ensemble members winter pe also generally increases by 2 on average and up to 19 in some locations for some ensemble members but there are decreases of as much as 10 in places although these are not likely to be important as winter pe is fairly low 2 4 analysis of simulated flows a 30 year time slice is used to assess performance of the g2g river flow simulations comparing the simobs run against gauged flows section 2 4 1 and comparing the simrcm runs against the simobs run section 2 4 2 these performance assessments use the time slice 1981 2010 a 30 year future time slice is compared against a 30 year baseline time slice for the simrcm runs to assess potential future changes in flows section 2 4 3 the precise time slices differ slightly depending on the flows under consideration the periods dec 1980 nov 2010 and dec 2050 nov 2080 are used for seasonal mean flows and low flows to fit most closely with the available rcm data section 2 3 but the periods oct 1981 sep 2011 and oct 2050 sep 2080 i e 30 water years are used for high flows section 2 4 3 2 4 1 performance using observed data three time series performance measures are used to quantify different aspects of the agreement between simulated and observed flows for 35 catchments those nrfa catchments with an area of at least 50 km2 and no more than 20 missing flow data in the baseline period fig 1a eight of these are designated as benchmark catchments ukbn2 harrigan et al 2018 a set of catchments across the uk where human disturbance to flows is considered minimal and flow gauging is generally considered reliable although there are additional flags highlighting gauging issues for high low flows information on the 35 catchments is provided in supp table 1 the three performance measures are based on the model efficiency criterion of nash and sutcliffe 1970 including versions adapted to focus on average flows using the square root and low flows using logarithms specifically the measures are defined as ns 1 q t m t 2 q t q t 2 nssqrt 1 q t m t 2 q t q t 2 ns log 1 ln q t ϵ ln m t ϵ 2 ln q t ϵ ln q t ϵ 2 w i t h q t 100 where q t are the observed flows m t are the modelled flows ε is a small value usually taken to be the observed mean flow divided by 100 and t is time an ns nssqrt or nslog value of 1 indicates a perfect fit whilst a negative value indicates that the fit is worse than the mean flow the results are presented in section 3 1 2 4 2 performance using baseline climate model data assessment of the performance using baseline climate model data uses measures derived from flow duration curves thus comparing statistical characteristics of flows rather than day to day equivalence because weather events in the rcm ppe will not follow the observed weather over the baseline period kay 2021 the analysis uses gauged flows for 35 catchments section 2 4 1 and compares these with simulated daily mean flows for corresponding locations from the simobs run from each simrcm run individually and from pooling the 12 simrcm runs together both with and without bias correction the analysis involves three measures quantifying the percentage bias for different parts of the flow duration curve low flow volume lfv 70 95 bias in the 70th 95th quantiles median flow mdf bias in the 50th quantile and high flow volume hfv 5 30 bias in the 5th 30th quantiles the results are presented in section 3 2 2 4 3 future changes in flows using climate model data to assess potential future changes in flows for each simrcm run the following analyses are performed gridded time series of monthly mean flows are used to derive seasonal mean flows for each time slice using the standard seasons winter december february spring march may summer june august autumn september november as for gb kay 2021 gridded time series of the annual maxima of daily mean flows are used to derive flood frequency curves for each time slice the generalised logistic distribution is fitted to the 30 annual maxima for each time slice using the method of l moments hosking 1996 robson reed 1999 to produce flood frequency curves covering 1 to 25 year return period events as for gb lane and kay 2021 gridded time series of the annual minima of 7 day mean flows are used to derive low flow frequency curves for each time slice a generalised extreme value distribution is applied to the 7 day annual minimum flows using the method of l moments hosking 1996 zaidman et al 2002 to produce low flow frequency curves as for gb lane and kay 2021 percentages changes from the baseline time slice to the future time slice are calculated for each simrcm run separately section 3 3 for flood low flow frequency the analysis focuses on 10 year return period events flow changes are mapped but also summarised for the three river basin regions covering northern ireland nw ireland neagh bann and ne ireland supp fig 2 3 results 3 1 performance using observed data the g2g shows good overall performance for the simobs run fig 1b c the model performs well across the flow range with the median performance across the set of catchments for the three performance measures section 2 4 1 being 0 71 for ns high flows 0 77 for nssqrt average flows and 0 72 for nslog low flows fig 1b some example hydrographs are shown in fig 2 in fig 1b the eight benchmark catchments are marked with an asterisk with those specifically suitable for either high or low flows having filled markers the benchmark catchments show good model performance for all three scores except for catchment 202002 faughan at drumahoe and 204001 bush at seneirl bridge fig 2a which have slightly poorer performance for low flows and catchment 203028 agivey at whitehill which has slightly poorer performance for high flows despite being benchmark catchments both 202002 and 204001 do have some abstractions and discharges and 204001 has an upstream reservoir nrfa 2021 although the effect of these on gauged flows is considered small they could still affect model performance particularly for low flows catchments not in the benchmark network show more scatter in the performance scores the best performing non benchmark catchments are 203010 blackwater at maydown bridge fig 2b 205004 lagan at newforge fig 2c and 205011 annacloy at kilmore bridge which have values greater than 0 8 for all three performance measures the nssqrt values are at least 0 6 for all catchments but there are some catchments with ns and nslog values less than 0 6 with the nslog low flow values tending to be worse the simulated low flows for 201007 burn dennet at burndennet tend to be too low simulated q70 about 57 of observed not shown which could be due to difficulties in measuring low flow in the wide and shallow channel at this station nrfa 2021 catchment 203027 braid at ballee also has simulated low flows that are lower than the observed flows which could be due to effluent returns affecting the flow at this station and the gauged low flows are affected by weed growth nrfa 2021 there are no obvious reasons for the poorer simulation of low flows for catchment 201009 owenkillow at crosh maps of the performance scores fig 1c show that the lowest performing catchments are generally located to the north west with the highest performing catchments often located to the south east catchment 203040 lower bann at movanagher is the only gauged catchment located downstream of lough neagh on the lower bann river and its poorer model performance for high flows is due to the regulation of lough neagh the department for infrastructure dfi rivers are required to regulate water levels in lough neagh within a specific range to reduce the flood risk dfi 2021 this is achieved using flood gates at the head of the lower bann river where it exits from lough neagh with two additional flood gates down the lower bann river which further control levels the regulation heavily influences the observed flows by capping high flows fig 2d currently the g2g does not account for such flow regulation 3 2 performance using baseline climate model data boxplots summarising the three measures of fit of the flow duration curves for low median and high flows section 2 4 2 across the set of 35 gauged catchments show that the bias correction makes the performance of the pooled simrcm ensemble more similar to the performance of the simobs run fig 3 maps of the measures supp fig 3 indicate that a tendency for over estimation of median and high flows has been reduced by the bias correction there is a tendency towards under estimation of low flows in most catchments though for the simobs run as well as the simrcm runs an additional assessment of the baseline monthly mean flows flood frequency curves and low flow frequency curves for the eight benchmark catchments shows good agreement between the rcm and observation based runs with the simrcm ensemble generally bounding the simobs data supp fig 4 there is a large spread in the simrcm ensemble for higher return period 15 years flood flows which is unsurprising when estimating these rarer events from a relatively short 30 year flow time series for low flows there is a tendency for the simrcm ensemble to over estimate flows at low return periods 1 3 years compared to the simobs run 3 3 future changes in flows using climate model data maps of the seasonal mean flow changes from the simrcm ensemble presented as the median and the 2nd lowest and 2nd highest projection for each river pixel almost exclusively show decreases in each season especially for the ensemble median change fig 4 the exception is small increases in the ensemble median winter flows median 9 mainly to the south and west and increases in the 2nd highest in winter and spring in contrast large reductions in summer flows are predicted by all ensemble members median 44 and autumn decreases can also be large median 13 particularly to the south and east results for individual simrcm ensemble members further show the variation between members supp fig 5 maps of the 10 year low flow changes from the simrcm ensemble again presented as the median and the 2nd lowest and 2nd highest projection for each river pixel show large reductions with the ensemble median showing reductions of 25 to 64 across ni fig 4 overall median 45 these widespread decreases in low flows are seen across all the simrcm ensemble members supp fig 6b alongside decreasing low flows there is also a trend towards annual minimum events occurring later in the year by up to around 30 days although these are only significant in a few of the ensemble members supp fig 7b the sign of change for 10 year high flows is less clear maps summarising results from the simrcm ensemble show average changes ranging from 7 5 to 40 between the 2nd lowest and 2nd highest ensemble members fig 4 overall median 16 there is much variation between the simrcm ensemble members with some predicting large increases in high flows e g 04 11 15 some predicting overall decreases in high flows e g 01 12 and others showing a more mixed picture supp fig 6a this results in the particularly large ensemble range for changes to high flows when compared to the low flow or seasonal changes fig 4 analysis of the dates of occurrence of amax showed few significant changes in timing supp fig 7a summary distributions of seasonal mean flow high flow and low flow changes for three regions clearly show the differences in response for different ensemble members seasons and regions fig 5 there are clear differences between ensemble members in all regions and seasons with it being possible to select pairs of ensemble members with no or very little overlap in response in all cases although for ne ireland in autumn there are broader ranges of change for most ensemble members and thus often more overlap between them the difference between ensemble members is most stark for the high flow changes where there are large differences between ensemble members for both the flow change values and ranges 4 discussion the application of a national scale grid based hydrological model for northern ireland with observed driving data has shown generally good performance for catchments across the country and across the flow range the exception is flows downstream of lough neagh where flood regulation essentially caps the observed river flows since the hydrological model currently does not include any artificial influences on flows so essentially simulates natural flows the pattern of observed flows downstream of lough neagh cannot be replicated in the simulations however it may be possible to enhance the model to include such regulation it would also be possible provided appropriate datasets were available to incorporate abstraction and discharges into the model and to use estimates of open water pe for the lake pixels the use of the g2g model with driving data from the ukcp18 regional projection ensemble shows that performance for a baseline period is similar to that of observed driving data especially after application of a simple bias correction to climate model precipitation comparison of ensemble modelling results for a future time slice compared to the baseline time slice generally suggests future decreases in seasonal mean flows especially in summer and autumn there is some variation between ensemble members particularly in winter when some show large increases in flows to the west consistent with this the analysis of 10 year return period low flows shows large reductions across the country and the analysis of 10 year return period high flows shows large increases for some locations and ensemble members these flow changes are consistent with the typical decreases in summer precipitation increases in winter precipitation and increases in pe section 2 3 and similar to the flow changes simulated for north west england kay 2021 lane kay 2021 decreasing summer and autumn flows with possible small increases to winter flows are broadly consistent with previous climate impact studies to have included ni catchments christierson et al 2012 sanderson et al 2012 arnell et al 2021 christierson et al 2012 also indicated reductions in summer flows for five catchments in ni however by using the ukcp09 probabilistic projections they were better able to sample modelling uncertainties finding that increases in summer flows were also within the ensemble spread of their projections sanderson et al 2012 also found that whilst the ensemble mean change in runoff showed summer reductions a reduction in summer flows was not unanimously predicted by all models by the 2050s whilst few studies have focused on changes to extreme flows for northern ireland the increases in flood flows found here are consistent with projections of increasing 5 100 year return period flows for irish catchments bastola et al 2011b and results for ireland within a european analysis of changing high and flood flows thober et al 2018 declining summer flows which may also indicate a reduction in discharge associated with low flow extremes are consistent with studies of irish catchments bastola et al 2011a steele dunne et al 2008 since the model essentially simulates natural river flows the climate change impact modelling does not account for potential future changes in artificial influences such as abstractions or discharges neither does it allow for potential future changes in land use or land cover also only one global regional climate model is applied albeit as a perturbed parameter ensemble under only one emissions scenario rcp8 5 the climate model is typically considered the largest source of uncertainty in hydrological impact modelling vetter et al 2017 roudier et al 2016 although the hydrological model can be particularly important for low flows giuntoli et al 2015 the rcp8 5 emissions scenario is considered a high scenario and lower pathways should give lesser impacts e g kay et al 2020 further sources of uncertainty include the estimation of future pe kay and davies 2008 dallaire et al 2021 and the choice of bias correction approach e g lafon et al 2013 5 conclusions developing a national scale grid based hydrological model for ni and the parts of the republic of ireland that drain into ni has enabled the simulation of river flows across the country at gauged and ungauged locations the model builds on one used extensively for modelling river flows across great britain and takes advantage of digital datasets to enable the simulation of varying hydrological responses due to spatial differences in landscape characteristics the model performance is good for a wide range of catchments provided flows are not heavily affected by artificial influences e g river regulation abstractions or discharges although such models may not perform as well as calibrated catchment models at specific locations they have the advantage of simulating flows across a wide area in a consistent way analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on river flows across ni using the ukcp18 regional projections suggests significant impacts on seasonal mean flows and extreme flows such information is vital to enable the development of appropriate adaptation strategies particularly for flood risk management and drought and water resource management potential future uses of the model could include the application of a sensitivity based approach to estimating the impacts of climatic change on flood peaks which can be combined with the ukcp18 probabilistic projections to provide information for a broader range of climate model and emissions uncertainty than covered here kay et al 2021b such an approach would enable ni to move away from the current blanket 20 allowance for climate change impacts on peak river flows wasko et al 2021 by developing regional or location specific values as for england wales and scotland reynard et al 2017 other applications could include river flood forecasting and warning cranston et al 2012 price et al 2012 surface water flood and impact

8112,study region the yellow river basin a water deficient region in china study focus to establish whether the virtual water trade vwt is beneficial for water deficient regions we conducted an integrated assessment of the local and distant vwt of the yellow river basin yrb we adopted a modified input output analysis model and applied multiregional input output tables of 31 provinces in china 2017 to estimate the dependence of the yrb on water from other regions and to determine the vwt status we calculated the total water consumption coefficient of 29 sectors in the yrb investigated the water use intensity of various sectors and analyzed the water footprint and per capita usage of each province furthermore we revealed the vwt among downstream midstream and upstream regions of the yrb new hydrological insights for the region this study revealed that virtual water flow is unidirectional from downstream and midstream regions to upstream regions and that the trade structures among these three regions of the yrb differ notably which has rarely been addressed in previous literature furthermore the vwt exacerbates water resource shortages in the yrb the irrational industrial structure is the main reason for the need for transfer of water resources this information could inform the development of effective policies both for alleviating regional water shortages and for developing a viable virtual water strategy for the yrb graphical abstract ga1 keywords input output analysis virtual water trade water footprint yellow river basin water scarcity water resource management 1 introduction the yellow river yr is a 5464 km long ecological corridor in china that connects the north china plain loess plateau and qinghai tibet plateau which has seven urban agglomerations located along its length omer et al 2021 in the context of china s national strategy for ecological conservation and high quality development of the yellow river basin yrb several recent studies have focused on this region anwar sadat et al 2020 chen et al 2020 hong et al 2021 although the yr is the second longest river in china it has been reported that the yrb is facing an acute shortage of water xiang et al 2017 existing research recognizes that the amount of water resource of the yr is 7 that of the yangtze river also known as chang jiang which is the longest river in china zhang et al 2017 furthermore water use sustainability in the yrb is challenged by inefficient water resource management insufficient technical development and mismatch between population growth and the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources zhang et al 2014 li et al 2019 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the development of urban agglomerations and associated industry which is the vital component of high quality socioeconomic progress is limited by water resources a scheme for rational allocation of water resources is fundamental to achieving the goals of ecological conservation and high quality development of the yrb zheng et al 2021 in recent years research on the concepts of the water footprint and virtual water vw has increased providing new insights into water resource management qian et al 2020 at present top down and bottom up models are the two primary methods adopted for conducting vw accounting zhang et al 2021 the top down approach which is based on the input output model has been adopted for measurements on large scales wu et al 2021 conversely the bottom up approach is suitable for specific sectors and products e g agricultural products an et al 2021 bottom up methods possess rigorous mathematical foundations that enable specific calculations of vw however it is difficult to analyze the vw of multiple sectors globally or nationally because of the lack of data fu et al 2018 yin et al 2021 previous research employing multiregional input output mrio tables has systematically analyzed the status and the characteristics of the virtual water trade vwt establishing that it operates at different scales in international trade research a comprehensive vwt network is developed adopting the mrio model on the basis of global commercial data and the vw contents of various countries zhang et al 2018 fan et al 2019 analysis of the temporal characteristics and spatial homogeneity of the transaction network has revealed that the heterogeneity of the international vwt structure is increasing at the national scale multiple studies have quantified the interprovincial vwt in china and discussed the mitigation of water stress caused by water redistribution zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 furthermore some studies have explored designs for the adjustment of the industrial structure and the vwt of urban systems based on regional development zhao et al 2017 flörke et al 2018 studies conducted during the previous decade which have provided important information regarding the establishment of regional vw index quantification systems analysis of water resource allocation and industry selection and expansion of vwt methods have revealed the dependency and contradiction between industrial structure and water resources peer and chini 2020 schirmer and dyer 2018 sun et al 2021 these earlier studies represent a breakthrough regarding the application of vw theory on various scales and in relation to optimization of industrial structure however most previous studies discussed only the vwt between a specific area and external regions ignoring the vwt within the specific area current research also lacks consideration of the vw flow of tertiary industry in some studies the vw flow of the service industry is completely ignored it is difficult to account for the coupling relations and supply demand structure between water resources urban agglomeration and industrial development at the basin level on the basis of a study of a single city or small region accordingly conducting watershed scale research is important for realizing the relationship between the above three factors moreover analysis of water resource constraints and industrial structure adjustments can provide new insights for guiding production practice however little work has been devoted to such research the objective of this study was to contribute to this area of research by exploring and evaluating the local and distant vwt of the yrb which is an area that plays a vital role in the regional economic growth of china on the basis of evaluation of the characteristics of the vwt and water footprint of the yrb from a new perspective we summarize the water resource dilemma of the yrb and propose policy suggestions to serve the important national strategy of ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the natural and socioeconomic conditions of the yrb section 3 provides details regarding the data used in the study and the model used to calculate the vw and water footprint and the results of our analysis are illustrated in section 4 finally our conclusions and a discussion on the issue are provided in section 5 2 research area in this study the yrb is defined as comprising eight provinces i e qinghai inner mongolia gansu ningxia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong distributed along the yr rather than by adopting the traditional hydrological boundary of the basin fig 1 for example sichuan province is not taken into account because it has few counties along the yr the yrb has a population of 330 million people 24 1 of the total population in china and the regional gross domestic product gdp accounted for 20 3 of china s total gdp in 2019 omer et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the total water resource of the yrb is 7 that of the yangtze river and the heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation leads to serious water resource shortages xie et al 2020 additionally the per capita gdp and economic growth rate in the yrb have been substantially lower than china s national average for decades particularly in the agricultural and secondary industry sectors di et al 2020 in 2019 the added value of primary and secondary industries in the yrb accounted for 51 25 of the total while the proportion of water consumption reached 80 62 the agricultural sector contributed 8 16 of the total output value and consumed 67 28 of the water resource national bureau of statistics china 3 materials and methods 3 1 data source this study used mrio data for 2017 extracted from the china emission accounts and datasets which are compiled from input output tables of 30 provincial units in china i e all provincial level regions except taiwan macao hong kong and tibet and published by the national bureau of statistics zheng et al 2020 in this study international imports were not taken into account the water consumption of each of the 30 provinces in 2017 was obtained from the national environmental statistics yearbook of china and china s economic census yearbook then the total industrial water consumption in 2017 was allocated on the basis of the water consumption ratio of 22 industrial sectors and the water consumption of each sector in each of the 30 provinces was derived by referring to zhang et al 2012 finally the water consumption of the service industries was calculated by distributing china s single region input output table data 2017 to sectors belonging to the service industries according to the proportion of water production and supply and the sectors above 3 2 methods the vwt model developed in our study is based on the mrio model the core of which is represented by the mrio table assuming a regional economic system with n economic sectors in r regions the mrio table can be expressed as follows 1 x 1 x r x r a 11 a 1 r a r 1 a r s a r r a r 1 a r r x 1 x r x r y 11 y s y 1 s e x 1 y r r y s y r s e x r y r r y s y r s e x r where x 1 x r x r t represents the added value of the various sectors of different provinces matrix a denotes the intermediate input y rr accounts for the local final consumption of province r from different sectors y rs represents the final consumption in province s from various sectors of province r and ex r denotes the foreign export volume of different sectors in province r following eq 1 the provincial total output divided by sectors can be converted into final consumption as follows 2 x i a 1 y y s y 1 s e x 1 s y 2 s e x 2 s y r s e x r t where i a 1 donates the inverse leontief matrix and i represents the identity matrix by introducing the consumption of water into eq 2 the formula for calculation of the water consumption of the 30 provinces and municipalities in china can be formulized as follows 3 w d x d i a 1 y t y w 1 w 2 w r t where w 1 w 2 w r t denotes the water consumption of various sectors in different provinces d is the direct coefficient matrix of water consumption and t is the total coefficient matrix the volume of vw of multiple industries traded between different regions can be derived using eq 4 4 v w r s v w r s v w s r i t i s y i s r i t i r y i r s where vw r s represents the net vw flow from province s to r vw rs is the implied quantity of vw in a commodity or service entering province r from province s vw sr denotes the vw flowing to province s from province r t i is the total water consumption coefficient of sector i obtained from matrix t in eq 3 and y i represents the final consumption of sector i furthermore the water footprint in province r can be calculated as follows 5 w f r l w r v w where wf r is the water footprint in province r l w r denotes the local water footprint and vw represents the distant net vw 4 results 4 1 water use intensity to analyze the current situation regarding industrial water use in the yrb we calculated the total water consumption matrix of the 29 economic sectors in each province following eqs 1 3 based on the 2017 mrio and eight single region input output tables which reflected the water use intensity of the various sectors as listed in table 1 the total water consumption coefficient is in the range of 0 1 1777 8 here the total water consumption coefficient considers both direct and indirect water use we adopted the leontief inverse matrix to calculate the total water consumption coefficient using the direct water consumption coefficient therefore table 1 does not contain the direct water consumption coefficient agricultural water use intensity is highest and much higher than that of other sectors with a range of 195 9 shandong to 1777 8 ningxia it is apparent from table 1 that ningxia has the highest industrial water use intensity that is 1581 9 higher than shandong which has the lowest industrial sectors with high water use intensity include g11 g6 g12 g14 g25 and g29 several sectors such as g6 g10 and g12 present marked differences among the eight provinces for g10 the gap between ningxia with the highest coefficient and qinghai with the lowest coefficient is 435 3 in the service industry g23 has the highest average water use intensity which is 130 9 in ningxia the sector with the lowest water use intensity in the service industry is g27 further analysis reveals negative correlation between the total water consumption coefficient of agriculture and gdp table 2 which means that provinces that are more developed have a lower total water consumption coefficient of agriculture the gdp of both shandong and henan which are provinces located downstream is higher and considerably different to that of qinghai gansu and ningxia which are provinces in the upper regions of the yrb moreover the agricultural water use intensity in the upper and lower regions of the yrb also varies greatly however this is not attributable to a single factor for example better irrigation facilities such as the high standard of canals sprinklers and drip installations in developed regions can reduce water consumption by agricultural irrigation while agricultural products in developed regions can have enhanced added value through deep processing and structural packaging meaning that the output value of a single agricultural product will be higher than that produced in provinces that are less well developed 4 2 water footprint analysis and comparison the water footprint which is generally used to represent the potential water demand in a certain area necessary to sustain the consumption of products and services in supporting the production and standard of living of the population includes both physical water and vw the water footprint in this study is calculated based on consumption extensive research has shown that water resource shortages have stunted the socioeconomic development of the yrb jia et al 2006 wang et al 2014 si et al 2019 chen et al 2020 adopting eqs 1 5 the water footprint of the various sectors in each of the eight provinces of the yrb fig 2 was calculated on the basis of the national interregional flow of products and services and the total water consumption coefficients listed in table 1 the water footprint of the various provinces shows marked discrepancy the water footprint of henan is largest and is 18 69 billion m3 higher than that of qinghai which is the smallest the magnitude of the water footprint of the other provinces decreases in the following order shandong inner mongolia gansu shaanxi ningxia shanxi the water footprint of agriculture in each of the eight provinces accounts for 77 8 qinghai 87 0 gansu 88 7 ningxia 84 4 inner mongolia 63 8 shaanxi 55 6 shanxi 55 3 henan and 60 4 shandong of the total the proportion of the agricultural water footprint generally decreases from the upper to the lower regions of the yr in terms of absolute quantity the water footprint of agriculture in inner mongolia is largest i e 14 3 billion m3 the total water footprint of secondary industry in the yrb is 14 82 billion m3 of which g22 accounts for the greatest proportion with a water footprint of 3 78 billion m3 25 5 followed by g14 2 00 billion m3 18 1 in terms of region the largest secondary industry water footprint is g12 32 8 in qinghai g6 in henan 20 6 and g22 in the other six provinces the tertiary industrial water footprint of the eight provinces along the yr accounts for 8 7 qinghai 5 8 gansu 4 2 ningxia 6 8 inner mongolia 20 3 shaanxi 21 7 shanxi 16 4 henan and 24 4 shandong the water footprint of the service industry in the yrb shows a trend of aggregation for example the water footprint of the service industry in qinghai gansu and inner mongolia in the upper and middle regions of the yrb is 4 2 8 7 while that of the service industry in shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong in the lower and middle regions is 16 4 24 4 clearly there is substantial difference between the various regions of the yrb we used the per capita water footprint to represent the local correlation between water resource use and consumption pattern it is usually used to measure the per capita level of water resource occupation which can be obtained by dividing the water footprint of each province by the total population owing to the difference in purchasing power of residents in the various provinces the per capita water footprint among the eight provinces in the yrb also presents diverse volumes of the studied provinces the per capita consumption level of 928 7 m3 in ningxia is highest while that of 159 4 m3 in shanxi is lowest representing less than one fifth of the volume in ningxia the per capita water footprint of the remaining provinces decreases in the following order inner mongolia 669 8 m3 qinghai 419 1 m3 gansu 403 1 m3 henan 223 1 m3 shaanxi 215 7 m3 shandong 211 1 m3 thus it is evident that provinces in the upper regions of the yrb have a higher per capita water footprint because of their lower population 4 3 local and distant virtual water trade analysis provinces in the yrb not only consume the water of other provinces vw inflow but also transport water resources to other regions vw outflow through trade with other provinces of china in addition to the vwt with regions outside the yrb distant trade vwt exists within the yrb local trade the volume of local vwt represents the volume of the vwt between one of the eight provinces within the yrb and the other seven provinces in contrast the distant vwt reflects the vw flow between the yrb and other provinces in china the volume of the local vwt of the yrb is 523 million m3 which is the sum of the volume of vwt among the eight provinces within the yrb the volume of distant vwt of the yrb is 46 670 million m3 i e approximately nine times that of the local vwt fig 3 the total vw inflow is 17 590 million m3 and the vw outflow is 2908 million m3 therefore the yrb is considered an area with net vw outflow however the yrb has limited water resources and is a region of water shortage the per capita possession of water is just 27 of the national average in china and the vwt evidently aggravates water shortages within the yrb in accordance with the water flow rate of the yr and the socioeconomic characteristics of the eight provinces the yrb was divided into the upper regions ningxia qinghai inner mongolia and gansu middle regions shanxi and shaanxi and lower regions shandong and henan regions the vw flow in the upstream midstream and downstream regions of the yrb is illustrated in fig 4 in terms of vw inflow the downstream region is the largest destination shanghai is the primary vw source for the downstream and midstream regions while shanxi contributes the most vw to the upstream region in terms of vw outflow shanghai and jiangsu both play a major role shanghai is the principal destination of vw flow from the three regions jiangsu is the secondary destination of the upstream and downstream regions while inner mongolia is the secondary destination of the midstream region although the vw outflow from inner mongolia and jilin is small the vw inflow to these two provinces is much greater a substantial difference can also be observed between the vw inflow and outflow of shanxi jiangxi henan hubei and guangdong fig 4 the volume of distant vwt between the upper middle and lower regions of the yrb and the other provinces of china is presented in fig 5a c respectively it can be observed from fig 5 that the upper middle and lower regions of the yrb are all areas of vw outflow with net vw outflow of 4100 million 5210 million and 1970 million m3 respectively in the upstream watershed the volume of local vwt is 1540 million m3 and the volume of distant vwt is 2570 million m3 i e the volume of the distant vwt is much larger than that of the local vwt in the upper regions of the yrb the vw inflow from shanxi jiangsu and shanghai is 780 million 750 million and 700 million m3 respectively and it represents the main source of vw inflow in terms of vw outflow shanghai jiangsu beijing and xinjiang are the dominant destinations accounting for 2820 million 1460 million 960 million and 950 million m3 respectively it is interesting that the provinces in the upper regions of the yrb are net importers in the local vwt and net exporters in the distant vwt analysis reveals that the total volume of the vwt in the middle regions is 12 670 million m3 of which the local and distant vwt accounts for 30 and 70 respectively shanghai is the dominant destination for vw from the middle regions of the yrb accounting for 2400 million m3 which is in sharp contrast to the vw imported from shanghai to this region i e only 920 million m3 in the vwt with xinjiang henan inner mongolia heilongjiang and 22 other provinces the middle regions of the yrb represent an area of net outflow of vw whereas this region is an area of net inflow of vw in terms of the vwt with the remaining six provinces such as fujian jiangxi and hainan of the 11 470 million m3 of vw outflow from the lower regions of the yrb more than half flows to shanghai and jiangsu far higher than the volume of the vwt with the other provinces in terms of the local and distant vwt the lower regions of the yrb represent an area of net inflow of vw the net inflow of the local vwt is 460 million m3 and the net inflow of the distant vwt is 9500 million m3 i e the net inflow of the distant vwt is nearly 20 times that of the local vwt the vwt presents a one way flow within the yrb fig 6 the flow of vw from the middle and lower regions to the upper regions of the yrb is much higher than that from the upper regions to the middle and lower regions the middle and lower regions transport 940 million m3 of water resources to the upper regions whereas only 50 million and 110 million m3 of the water resource of the upper regions are transported to the middle and lower regions of the yrb respectively the yrb includes eight provinces that have substantial differences in terms of industrial structure natural resource endowment infrastructure condition and other aspects moreover the different regional positioning of the upper middle and lower regions of the yrb leads to different structures of the vwt among the different regions of the basin among the flows from the lower to the middle regions middle to the lower regions upper to the lower regions and upper to the middle regions the proportion of the industrial vw flow is largest accounting for 49 1 71 6 77 0 and 49 3 of the total respectively in the flow from the middle to the upper regions the proportion of agricultural vw flow is largest accounting for 88 1 of the total in the flow from the lower to the upper regions the service industry is dominant accounting for 60 0 of the total obvious differences are found between the various flows not only in terms of quantity but also in industrial structure which might be related to the local industrial structure and interregional trade structure 5 discussion 5 1 reasons for virtual water flow studies over the past two decades have provided important information on vw and vw strategies have been developed following the introduction of the concept of vw a vw strategy means that water deficient countries or regions could purchase water intensive agricultural products especially food from water rich regions through trade to mitigate their own local water resources dilemma analysis of the situation of yrb indicates that implementation of a vw strategy is vital through the vwt the yrb is losing a large amount of its water resources the unreasonable industrial structure of the yrb has resulted in the transfer of local water resources and agriculture is the sector that has the greatest water consumption fig 2 on the one hand considerable amounts of blue and green water resources are consumed in the process of evapotranspiration of crops on the other hand irrational irrigation leads to wastage of water resources cao et al 2020 furthermore water intensive industries also consume substantial amounts of local water resources and the ratio for agriculture and water intensive industries in the yrb is high 5 2 suggestions for development with continuous growth of water demand in the yrb the imbalance between water supply and demand has become more and more prominent and the problem of water shortages has gradually become a key factor restricting regional high quality development within the yrb this study evaluated the characteristics of watershed water footprint and vwt from local and distant perspectives on the basis of which the following suggestions are proposed determine industrial structure based on the water resource and promote transformation of industries with high water use intensity most of the major industries within the yrb are currently water intensive industries acceleration of the transformation and upgrading of water intensive industries will be an effective approach to realize optimal allocation of water resources and sustainable industrial transformation and development strengthen management of major water users e g agriculture and develop water saving technologies agriculture is the industry that consumes the greatest volume of water in the yrb the backwardness and lack of agricultural irrigation facilities further increase the consumption of water resources construction of modern irrigation facilities and development of water saving agricultural technologies will reduce water resource consumption improve water use efficiency and reduce waste the water use characteristics of different industrial sectors in the eight provinces along the yr are varied and the water use characteristics of the same sector in different provinces are also diverse in terms of water use efficiency there are sectors with low water use efficiency in each province therefore improving water use efficiency and optimizing water use structure will be an important approach to alleviate the contradiction between the water supply and demand in the yrb implement a vw water strategy implementation of a vw strategy is one approach for alleviation of water scarcity in water deficient areas the vwt has aggravated the current situation of water shortages within the yrb implementation of a vw strategy for the yrb with the objective of reducing the export of water intensive products will be an important approach for alleviating water shortages in the yrb in future 5 3 limitations and future work using the mrio model and the concept of vw this study established a vw evaluation framework and examined the local and distant relationships of vw flow between the yrb and other provinces in china owing to limitations associated with the published data of the interregional input output tables it was possible to investigate only the vwt in the yrb in 2017 and its optimal spatial allocation it was not possible to describe the impact on the research results of recent socioeconomic development within the yrb or the changes in interregional trade evaluation of the vwt is useful for resolving regional water resource shortages and realizing the objective of high quality regional development the findings of this study provide new insights into research on development of water deficient regions in future studies the evaluation framework established in this work could be used to assess the basin level vwt status and analyze the characteristics of its local and distant flows which could provide support for water resources management at the basin level 6 conclusions the main objective of the evaluation of the vwt conducted in this study was to realize the goal of optimizing the allocation of water in the yrb to ensure high quality regional development implementation of a vw strategy is a vital method with which to alleviate water shortages in water deficient areas based on the mrio model the water intensity and water footprint of different industries in provinces along the yrb were evaluated using water consumption data of different industries in 2017 and the 2017 national mrio table obtained from the china emission accounts and datasets database the volume of vwt within the yrb i e between the upper middle and lower regions and outside the yrb i e with other chinese provinces in 2017 was calculated and the following principal conclusions were drawn 1 substantial differences were found between the different provinces of the yrb and differences were evident among the different industries and provinces within the same industry sector the agricultural water use intensity was highest and much higher than that of the sectors of secondary and tertiary industries with a considerable gap between the highest and lowest values sectors of secondary industry with high total water consumption coefficients are petroleum and gas food processing and tobacco the chemical industry metallurgy wholesale and retailing and other services 2 the per capita water footprint consumption of provinces within the yrb was found to vary markedly the per capita consumption level in ningxia 928 7 m3 was highest while that in shanxi 159 4 m3 was lowest i e less than one fifth of the volume in ningxia the per capita water footprint of the remaining provinces decreased in the following order inner mongolia qinghai gansu henan shaanxi shandong the provinces in the upper regions of the yrb which have smaller population have a higher per capita water footprint 3 the vwt exacerbates the current situation of water shortages in the yrb the total vw inflow and outflow was 17 590 million and 29 080 million m3 respectively i e virtual inflow was less than virtual outflow which means that the yrb is a region of vw outflow 4 the vwt represents a one way flow within the yrb the vw flow from the middle and lower regions to the upper regions of the yrb is much higher than that from the upper regions to the middle and lower regions however no major difference was found in the vwt between the middle and lower regions furthermore the structure of the vwt of the various provinces was found to vary depending on the industrial structures resource endowments infrastructure conditions and urban functions of each province credit authorship contribution statement gang liu methodology data curation writing original draft software fan zhang visualization writing review editing supervision

8112,study region the yellow river basin a water deficient region in china study focus to establish whether the virtual water trade vwt is beneficial for water deficient regions we conducted an integrated assessment of the local and distant vwt of the yellow river basin yrb we adopted a modified input output analysis model and applied multiregional input output tables of 31 provinces in china 2017 to estimate the dependence of the yrb on water from other regions and to determine the vwt status we calculated the total water consumption coefficient of 29 sectors in the yrb investigated the water use intensity of various sectors and analyzed the water footprint and per capita usage of each province furthermore we revealed the vwt among downstream midstream and upstream regions of the yrb new hydrological insights for the region this study revealed that virtual water flow is unidirectional from downstream and midstream regions to upstream regions and that the trade structures among these three regions of the yrb differ notably which has rarely been addressed in previous literature furthermore the vwt exacerbates water resource shortages in the yrb the irrational industrial structure is the main reason for the need for transfer of water resources this information could inform the development of effective policies both for alleviating regional water shortages and for developing a viable virtual water strategy for the yrb graphical abstract ga1 keywords input output analysis virtual water trade water footprint yellow river basin water scarcity water resource management 1 introduction the yellow river yr is a 5464 km long ecological corridor in china that connects the north china plain loess plateau and qinghai tibet plateau which has seven urban agglomerations located along its length omer et al 2021 in the context of china s national strategy for ecological conservation and high quality development of the yellow river basin yrb several recent studies have focused on this region anwar sadat et al 2020 chen et al 2020 hong et al 2021 although the yr is the second longest river in china it has been reported that the yrb is facing an acute shortage of water xiang et al 2017 existing research recognizes that the amount of water resource of the yr is 7 that of the yangtze river also known as chang jiang which is the longest river in china zhang et al 2017 furthermore water use sustainability in the yrb is challenged by inefficient water resource management insufficient technical development and mismatch between population growth and the spatiotemporal distribution of water resources zhang et al 2014 li et al 2019 yao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 the development of urban agglomerations and associated industry which is the vital component of high quality socioeconomic progress is limited by water resources a scheme for rational allocation of water resources is fundamental to achieving the goals of ecological conservation and high quality development of the yrb zheng et al 2021 in recent years research on the concepts of the water footprint and virtual water vw has increased providing new insights into water resource management qian et al 2020 at present top down and bottom up models are the two primary methods adopted for conducting vw accounting zhang et al 2021 the top down approach which is based on the input output model has been adopted for measurements on large scales wu et al 2021 conversely the bottom up approach is suitable for specific sectors and products e g agricultural products an et al 2021 bottom up methods possess rigorous mathematical foundations that enable specific calculations of vw however it is difficult to analyze the vw of multiple sectors globally or nationally because of the lack of data fu et al 2018 yin et al 2021 previous research employing multiregional input output mrio tables has systematically analyzed the status and the characteristics of the virtual water trade vwt establishing that it operates at different scales in international trade research a comprehensive vwt network is developed adopting the mrio model on the basis of global commercial data and the vw contents of various countries zhang et al 2018 fan et al 2019 analysis of the temporal characteristics and spatial homogeneity of the transaction network has revealed that the heterogeneity of the international vwt structure is increasing at the national scale multiple studies have quantified the interprovincial vwt in china and discussed the mitigation of water stress caused by water redistribution zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 furthermore some studies have explored designs for the adjustment of the industrial structure and the vwt of urban systems based on regional development zhao et al 2017 flörke et al 2018 studies conducted during the previous decade which have provided important information regarding the establishment of regional vw index quantification systems analysis of water resource allocation and industry selection and expansion of vwt methods have revealed the dependency and contradiction between industrial structure and water resources peer and chini 2020 schirmer and dyer 2018 sun et al 2021 these earlier studies represent a breakthrough regarding the application of vw theory on various scales and in relation to optimization of industrial structure however most previous studies discussed only the vwt between a specific area and external regions ignoring the vwt within the specific area current research also lacks consideration of the vw flow of tertiary industry in some studies the vw flow of the service industry is completely ignored it is difficult to account for the coupling relations and supply demand structure between water resources urban agglomeration and industrial development at the basin level on the basis of a study of a single city or small region accordingly conducting watershed scale research is important for realizing the relationship between the above three factors moreover analysis of water resource constraints and industrial structure adjustments can provide new insights for guiding production practice however little work has been devoted to such research the objective of this study was to contribute to this area of research by exploring and evaluating the local and distant vwt of the yrb which is an area that plays a vital role in the regional economic growth of china on the basis of evaluation of the characteristics of the vwt and water footprint of the yrb from a new perspective we summarize the water resource dilemma of the yrb and propose policy suggestions to serve the important national strategy of ecological protection and high quality development of the yrb the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes the natural and socioeconomic conditions of the yrb section 3 provides details regarding the data used in the study and the model used to calculate the vw and water footprint and the results of our analysis are illustrated in section 4 finally our conclusions and a discussion on the issue are provided in section 5 2 research area in this study the yrb is defined as comprising eight provinces i e qinghai inner mongolia gansu ningxia shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong distributed along the yr rather than by adopting the traditional hydrological boundary of the basin fig 1 for example sichuan province is not taken into account because it has few counties along the yr the yrb has a population of 330 million people 24 1 of the total population in china and the regional gross domestic product gdp accounted for 20 3 of china s total gdp in 2019 omer et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 the total water resource of the yrb is 7 that of the yangtze river and the heterogeneous spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation leads to serious water resource shortages xie et al 2020 additionally the per capita gdp and economic growth rate in the yrb have been substantially lower than china s national average for decades particularly in the agricultural and secondary industry sectors di et al 2020 in 2019 the added value of primary and secondary industries in the yrb accounted for 51 25 of the total while the proportion of water consumption reached 80 62 the agricultural sector contributed 8 16 of the total output value and consumed 67 28 of the water resource national bureau of statistics china 3 materials and methods 3 1 data source this study used mrio data for 2017 extracted from the china emission accounts and datasets which are compiled from input output tables of 30 provincial units in china i e all provincial level regions except taiwan macao hong kong and tibet and published by the national bureau of statistics zheng et al 2020 in this study international imports were not taken into account the water consumption of each of the 30 provinces in 2017 was obtained from the national environmental statistics yearbook of china and china s economic census yearbook then the total industrial water consumption in 2017 was allocated on the basis of the water consumption ratio of 22 industrial sectors and the water consumption of each sector in each of the 30 provinces was derived by referring to zhang et al 2012 finally the water consumption of the service industries was calculated by distributing china s single region input output table data 2017 to sectors belonging to the service industries according to the proportion of water production and supply and the sectors above 3 2 methods the vwt model developed in our study is based on the mrio model the core of which is represented by the mrio table assuming a regional economic system with n economic sectors in r regions the mrio table can be expressed as follows 1 x 1 x r x r a 11 a 1 r a r 1 a r s a r r a r 1 a r r x 1 x r x r y 11 y s y 1 s e x 1 y r r y s y r s e x r y r r y s y r s e x r where x 1 x r x r t represents the added value of the various sectors of different provinces matrix a denotes the intermediate input y rr accounts for the local final consumption of province r from different sectors y rs represents the final consumption in province s from various sectors of province r and ex r denotes the foreign export volume of different sectors in province r following eq 1 the provincial total output divided by sectors can be converted into final consumption as follows 2 x i a 1 y y s y 1 s e x 1 s y 2 s e x 2 s y r s e x r t where i a 1 donates the inverse leontief matrix and i represents the identity matrix by introducing the consumption of water into eq 2 the formula for calculation of the water consumption of the 30 provinces and municipalities in china can be formulized as follows 3 w d x d i a 1 y t y w 1 w 2 w r t where w 1 w 2 w r t denotes the water consumption of various sectors in different provinces d is the direct coefficient matrix of water consumption and t is the total coefficient matrix the volume of vw of multiple industries traded between different regions can be derived using eq 4 4 v w r s v w r s v w s r i t i s y i s r i t i r y i r s where vw r s represents the net vw flow from province s to r vw rs is the implied quantity of vw in a commodity or service entering province r from province s vw sr denotes the vw flowing to province s from province r t i is the total water consumption coefficient of sector i obtained from matrix t in eq 3 and y i represents the final consumption of sector i furthermore the water footprint in province r can be calculated as follows 5 w f r l w r v w where wf r is the water footprint in province r l w r denotes the local water footprint and vw represents the distant net vw 4 results 4 1 water use intensity to analyze the current situation regarding industrial water use in the yrb we calculated the total water consumption matrix of the 29 economic sectors in each province following eqs 1 3 based on the 2017 mrio and eight single region input output tables which reflected the water use intensity of the various sectors as listed in table 1 the total water consumption coefficient is in the range of 0 1 1777 8 here the total water consumption coefficient considers both direct and indirect water use we adopted the leontief inverse matrix to calculate the total water consumption coefficient using the direct water consumption coefficient therefore table 1 does not contain the direct water consumption coefficient agricultural water use intensity is highest and much higher than that of other sectors with a range of 195 9 shandong to 1777 8 ningxia it is apparent from table 1 that ningxia has the highest industrial water use intensity that is 1581 9 higher than shandong which has the lowest industrial sectors with high water use intensity include g11 g6 g12 g14 g25 and g29 several sectors such as g6 g10 and g12 present marked differences among the eight provinces for g10 the gap between ningxia with the highest coefficient and qinghai with the lowest coefficient is 435 3 in the service industry g23 has the highest average water use intensity which is 130 9 in ningxia the sector with the lowest water use intensity in the service industry is g27 further analysis reveals negative correlation between the total water consumption coefficient of agriculture and gdp table 2 which means that provinces that are more developed have a lower total water consumption coefficient of agriculture the gdp of both shandong and henan which are provinces located downstream is higher and considerably different to that of qinghai gansu and ningxia which are provinces in the upper regions of the yrb moreover the agricultural water use intensity in the upper and lower regions of the yrb also varies greatly however this is not attributable to a single factor for example better irrigation facilities such as the high standard of canals sprinklers and drip installations in developed regions can reduce water consumption by agricultural irrigation while agricultural products in developed regions can have enhanced added value through deep processing and structural packaging meaning that the output value of a single agricultural product will be higher than that produced in provinces that are less well developed 4 2 water footprint analysis and comparison the water footprint which is generally used to represent the potential water demand in a certain area necessary to sustain the consumption of products and services in supporting the production and standard of living of the population includes both physical water and vw the water footprint in this study is calculated based on consumption extensive research has shown that water resource shortages have stunted the socioeconomic development of the yrb jia et al 2006 wang et al 2014 si et al 2019 chen et al 2020 adopting eqs 1 5 the water footprint of the various sectors in each of the eight provinces of the yrb fig 2 was calculated on the basis of the national interregional flow of products and services and the total water consumption coefficients listed in table 1 the water footprint of the various provinces shows marked discrepancy the water footprint of henan is largest and is 18 69 billion m3 higher than that of qinghai which is the smallest the magnitude of the water footprint of the other provinces decreases in the following order shandong inner mongolia gansu shaanxi ningxia shanxi the water footprint of agriculture in each of the eight provinces accounts for 77 8 qinghai 87 0 gansu 88 7 ningxia 84 4 inner mongolia 63 8 shaanxi 55 6 shanxi 55 3 henan and 60 4 shandong of the total the proportion of the agricultural water footprint generally decreases from the upper to the lower regions of the yr in terms of absolute quantity the water footprint of agriculture in inner mongolia is largest i e 14 3 billion m3 the total water footprint of secondary industry in the yrb is 14 82 billion m3 of which g22 accounts for the greatest proportion with a water footprint of 3 78 billion m3 25 5 followed by g14 2 00 billion m3 18 1 in terms of region the largest secondary industry water footprint is g12 32 8 in qinghai g6 in henan 20 6 and g22 in the other six provinces the tertiary industrial water footprint of the eight provinces along the yr accounts for 8 7 qinghai 5 8 gansu 4 2 ningxia 6 8 inner mongolia 20 3 shaanxi 21 7 shanxi 16 4 henan and 24 4 shandong the water footprint of the service industry in the yrb shows a trend of aggregation for example the water footprint of the service industry in qinghai gansu and inner mongolia in the upper and middle regions of the yrb is 4 2 8 7 while that of the service industry in shaanxi shanxi henan and shandong in the lower and middle regions is 16 4 24 4 clearly there is substantial difference between the various regions of the yrb we used the per capita water footprint to represent the local correlation between water resource use and consumption pattern it is usually used to measure the per capita level of water resource occupation which can be obtained by dividing the water footprint of each province by the total population owing to the difference in purchasing power of residents in the various provinces the per capita water footprint among the eight provinces in the yrb also presents diverse volumes of the studied provinces the per capita consumption level of 928 7 m3 in ningxia is highest while that of 159 4 m3 in shanxi is lowest representing less than one fifth of the volume in ningxia the per capita water footprint of the remaining provinces decreases in the following order inner mongolia 669 8 m3 qinghai 419 1 m3 gansu 403 1 m3 henan 223 1 m3 shaanxi 215 7 m3 shandong 211 1 m3 thus it is evident that provinces in the upper regions of the yrb have a higher per capita water footprint because of their lower population 4 3 local and distant virtual water trade analysis provinces in the yrb not only consume the water of other provinces vw inflow but also transport water resources to other regions vw outflow through trade with other provinces of china in addition to the vwt with regions outside the yrb distant trade vwt exists within the yrb local trade the volume of local vwt represents the volume of the vwt between one of the eight provinces within the yrb and the other seven provinces in contrast the distant vwt reflects the vw flow between the yrb and other provinces in china the volume of the local vwt of the yrb is 523 million m3 which is the sum of the volume of vwt among the eight provinces within the yrb the volume of distant vwt of the yrb is 46 670 million m3 i e approximately nine times that of the local vwt fig 3 the total vw inflow is 17 590 million m3 and the vw outflow is 2908 million m3 therefore the yrb is considered an area with net vw outflow however the yrb has limited water resources and is a region of water shortage the per capita possession of water is just 27 of the national average in china and the vwt evidently aggravates water shortages within the yrb in accordance with the water flow rate of the yr and the socioeconomic characteristics of the eight provinces the yrb was divided into the upper regions ningxia qinghai inner mongolia and gansu middle regions shanxi and shaanxi and lower regions shandong and henan regions the vw flow in the upstream midstream and downstream regions of the yrb is illustrated in fig 4 in terms of vw inflow the downstream region is the largest destination shanghai is the primary vw source for the downstream and midstream regions while shanxi contributes the most vw to the upstream region in terms of vw outflow shanghai and jiangsu both play a major role shanghai is the principal destination of vw flow from the three regions jiangsu is the secondary destination of the upstream and downstream regions while inner mongolia is the secondary destination of the midstream region although the vw outflow from inner mongolia and jilin is small the vw inflow to these two provinces is much greater a substantial difference can also be observed between the vw inflow and outflow of shanxi jiangxi henan hubei and guangdong fig 4 the volume of distant vwt between the upper middle and lower regions of the yrb and the other provinces of china is presented in fig 5a c respectively it can be observed from fig 5 that the upper middle and lower regions of the yrb are all areas of vw outflow with net vw outflow of 4100 million 5210 million and 1970 million m3 respectively in the upstream watershed the volume of local vwt is 1540 million m3 and the volume of distant vwt is 2570 million m3 i e the volume of the distant vwt is much larger than that of the local vwt in the upper regions of the yrb the vw inflow from shanxi jiangsu and shanghai is 780 million 750 million and 700 million m3 respectively and it represents the main source of vw inflow in terms of vw outflow shanghai jiangsu beijing and xinjiang are the dominant destinations accounting for 2820 million 1460 million 960 million and 950 million m3 respectively it is interesting that the provinces in the upper regions of the yrb are net importers in the local vwt and net exporters in the distant vwt analysis reveals that the total volume of the vwt in the middle regions is 12 670 million m3 of which the local and distant vwt accounts for 30 and 70 respectively shanghai is the dominant destination for vw from the middle regions of the yrb accounting for 2400 million m3 which is in sharp contrast to the vw imported from shanghai to this region i e only 920 million m3 in the vwt with xinjiang henan inner mongolia heilongjiang and 22 other provinces the middle regions of the yrb represent an area of net outflow of vw whereas this region is an area of net inflow of vw in terms of the vwt with the remaining six provinces such as fujian jiangxi and hainan of the 11 470 million m3 of vw outflow from the lower regions of the yrb more than half flows to shanghai and jiangsu far higher than the volume of the vwt with the other provinces in terms of the local and distant vwt the lower regions of the yrb represent an area of net inflow of vw the net inflow of the local vwt is 460 million m3 and the net inflow of the distant vwt is 9500 million m3 i e the net inflow of the distant vwt is nearly 20 times that of the local vwt the vwt presents a one way flow within the yrb fig 6 the flow of vw from the middle and lower regions to the upper regions of the yrb is much higher than that from the upper regions to the middle and lower regions the middle and lower regions transport 940 million m3 of water resources to the upper regions whereas only 50 million and 110 million m3 of the water resource of the upper regions are transported to the middle and lower regions of the yrb respectively the yrb includes eight provinces that have substantial differences in terms of industrial structure natural resource endowment infrastructure condition and other aspects moreover the different regional positioning of the upper middle and lower regions of the yrb leads to different structures of the vwt among the different regions of the basin among the flows from the lower to the middle regions middle to the lower regions upper to the lower regions and upper to the middle regions the proportion of the industrial vw flow is largest accounting for 49 1 71 6 77 0 and 49 3 of the total respectively in the flow from the middle to the upper regions the proportion of agricultural vw flow is largest accounting for 88 1 of the total in the flow from the lower to the upper regions the service industry is dominant accounting for 60 0 of the total obvious differences are found between the various flows not only in terms of quantity but also in industrial structure which might be related to the local industrial structure and interregional trade structure 5 discussion 5 1 reasons for virtual water flow studies over the past two decades have provided important information on vw and vw strategies have been developed following the introduction of the concept of vw a vw strategy means that water deficient countries or regions could purchase water intensive agricultural products especially food from water rich regions through trade to mitigate their own local water resources dilemma analysis of the situation of yrb indicates that implementation of a vw strategy is vital through the vwt the yrb is losing a large amount of its water resources the unreasonable industrial structure of the yrb has resulted in the transfer of local water resources and agriculture is the sector that has the greatest water consumption fig 2 on the one hand considerable amounts of blue and green water resources are consumed in the process of evapotranspiration of crops on the other hand irrational irrigation leads to wastage of water resources cao et al 2020 furthermore water intensive industries also consume substantial amounts of local water resources and the ratio for agriculture and water intensive industries in the yrb is high 5 2 suggestions for development with continuous growth of water demand in the yrb the imbalance between water supply and demand has become more and more prominent and the problem of water shortages has gradually become a key factor restricting regional high quality development within the yrb this study evaluated the characteristics of watershed water footprint and vwt from local and distant perspectives on the basis of which the following suggestions are proposed determine industrial structure based on the water resource and promote transformation of industries with high water use intensity most of the major industries within the yrb are currently water intensive industries acceleration of the transformation and upgrading of water intensive industries will be an effective approach to realize optimal allocation of water resources and sustainable industrial transformation and development strengthen management of major water users e g agriculture and develop water saving technologies agriculture is the industry that consumes the greatest volume of water in the yrb the backwardness and lack of agricultural irrigation facilities further increase the consumption of water resources construction of modern irrigation facilities and development of water saving agricultural technologies will reduce water resource consumption improve water use efficiency and reduce waste the water use characteristics of different industrial sectors in the eight provinces along the yr are varied and the water use characteristics of the same sector in different provinces are also diverse in terms of water use efficiency there are sectors with low water use efficiency in each province therefore improving water use efficiency and optimizing water use structure will be an important approach to alleviate the contradiction between the water supply and demand in the yrb implement a vw water strategy implementation of a vw strategy is one approach for alleviation of water scarcity in water deficient areas the vwt has aggravated the current situation of water shortages within the yrb implementation of a vw strategy for the yrb with the objective of reducing the export of water intensive products will be an important approach for alleviating water shortages in the yrb in future 5 3 limitations and future work using the mrio model and the concept of vw this study established a vw evaluation framework and examined the local and distant relationships of vw flow between the yrb and other provinces in china owing to limitations associated with the published data of the interregional input output tables it was possible to investigate only the vwt in the yrb in 2017 and its optimal spatial allocation it was not possible to describe the impact on the research results of recent socioeconomic development within the yrb or the changes in interregional trade evaluation of the vwt is useful for resolving regional water resource shortages and realizing the objective of high quality regional development the findings of this study provide new insights into research on development of water deficient regions in future studies the evaluation framework established in this work could be used to assess the basin level vwt status and analyze the characteristics of its local and distant flows which could provide support for water resources management at the basin level 6 conclusions the main objective of the evaluation of the vwt conducted in this study was to realize the goal of optimizing the allocation of water in the yrb to ensure high quality regional development implementation of a vw strategy is a vital method with which to alleviate water shortages in water deficient areas based on the mrio model the water intensity and water footprint of different industries in provinces along the yrb were evaluated using water consumption data of different industries in 2017 and the 2017 national mrio table obtained from the china emission accounts and datasets database the volume of vwt within the yrb i e between the upper middle and lower regions and outside the yrb i e with other chinese provinces in 2017 was calculated and the following principal conclusions were drawn 1 substantial differences were found between the different provinces of the yrb and differences were evident among the different industries and provinces within the same industry sector the agricultural water use intensity was highest and much higher than that of the sectors of secondary and tertiary industries with a considerable gap between the highest and lowest values sectors of secondary industry with high total water consumption coefficients are petroleum and gas food processing and tobacco the chemical industry metallurgy wholesale and retailing and other services 2 the per capita water footprint consumption of provinces within the yrb was found to vary markedly the per capita consumption level in ningxia 928 7 m3 was highest while that in shanxi 159 4 m3 was lowest i e less than one fifth of the volume in ningxia the per capita water footprint of the remaining provinces decreased in the following order inner mongolia qinghai gansu henan shaanxi shandong the provinces in the upper regions of the yrb which have smaller population have a higher per capita water footprint 3 the vwt exacerbates the current situation of water shortages in the yrb the total vw inflow and outflow was 17 590 million and 29 080 million m3 respectively i e virtual inflow was less than virtual outflow which means that the yrb is a region of vw outflow 4 the vwt represents a one way flow within the yrb the vw flow from the middle and lower regions to the upper regions of the yrb is much higher than that from the upper regions to the middle and lower regions however no major difference was found in the vwt between the middle and lower regions furthermore the structure of the vwt of the various provinces was found to vary depending on the industrial structures resource endowments infrastructure conditions and

8113,study region glacierized catchments in central asia study focus the literature on hydrochemistry and water quality was reviewed to identify gaps in knowledge required to understand and quantify the impacts of climate change and deglacierization new hydrological insights for the region the main knowledge gap was the characterization of hydrochemistry and water quality along the elevation continuum from glaciers to arid plains the chemical composition of snow and glacier ice are understood relatively well but the pathways of pollutants stored in glacier ice and released with melt into the aquatic systems are not researched there is a lack of publications on the release of organic carbon following deglacierization and element leaching from the exposed substrate permafrost and rock glaciers snow and glacial melt dilutes pollutants along the river channels reducing concentrations and mostly ensuring the compliance with water quality standards including downstream locations poor surface water quality is associated with irrigation the practice of soil washing and discharge of the untreated sewage there is a notable lack of information about the links between snow and glacier melt aquifer recharge and groundwater quality and this is a major gap in knowledge affecting environmental and health protection better understanding and quantification of factors and processes controlling hydrochemistry and water quality is needed to adapt to the impacts of the imminent deglacierization graphical abstract ga1 keywords glaciers mountains arid regionswater quality

achieve this journal articles and reports written in a range of languages have been synthesized particular attention was given to the quality of the data in the assessed publications we selected studies based on longer term monitoring and shorter term studies that provided full descriptions of the data collection and analysis thereby enabling a critical evaluation of data quality not all

might be to help protect and improve the quality of the ca water resource the emphasis is on understanding the controls on hwq in five key transboundary glacierized catchments located in south eastern kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan and north western china all of which drain glaciers and terminate in endorheic lakes and deserts fig 1 table s1 we exclude turkmenistan and central and northern kazakhstan because these regions have different river regimes and discussion of other regions of high mountain asia because of the different socio economic characteristics we define hydrochemistry as the chemical composition of water resulting from natural physical chemical and biological processes and use the term water quality to characterize the state of water properties and constituents evaluated against standards and criteria of suitability for human use and ecosystem function the review begins with a consideration of the chemical composition of and contaminants found in snow and glacier ice the observed impacts of glacier retreat through weathering of the exposed bedrock and release of legacy pollutants on stream hwq are considered followed by consideration of hwq

aspects drawn into the discussion in this paper across the region seasonal snow and glacier melt are the main components of river runoff in the amu darya and syr darya these components account for approximately 70 and 80 of annual runoff respectively snow melt dominates accounting for 89 and 65 of the total melt component in the two catchments djumaboev et al 2019 river flow has a strong seasonal cycle with maximum in summer due to the snow melt in may june and glacier ice melt in july august fig s2 although the peak may be less pronounced in the lower reaches because of the water abstraction grill et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2012 most rivers of ca are managed major settlements and industrial activity are concentrated at the mountain base and large scale arable agriculture extends onto the arid plains fig 2 arable land accounts for 5 10 of the basin areas table s1 and irrigation is the main water consumer especially in uzbekistan where water withdrawal exceed that in

crop is cotton particularly in the amu darya syr darya and tarim catchments where fertilizer and pesticide use is common crosa et al 2006a snow et al 2020 törnqvist et al 2011 tang et al 2021 estimated that kazakhstan and uzbekistan are among the top 10 countries that are at the highest risk from pesticide pollution globally and the threat is equally high in the tarim basin the application of other fertilizers declined in the region in the 1990 s but began to increase again in the 2010 s exceeding the 1990 s level in uzbekistan fig s3 across post soviet ca irrigation systems are basic predominantly furrow and not well maintained barrett et al 2017 xenarios et al 2019 water is delivered by a system of open canals from rivers but in the vicinity of large cities treated water is used mamadiyarov et al 2015 on the plains of ca soils are naturally saline due to evapoconcentration yapiyev et al 2018 zamotaev 2002 irrigation enhances salinization which affects approximately 47 of irrigated land across post soviet ca hamidov et al 2016 to mitigate this problem the practice of soil washing is widely applied the returned water is accumulated in collectors and discharged into the river systems groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 natural lakes are also used as collectors of returned water orlovsky et al 2012 severskiy 2004 in the post soviet ca the extent of irrigated land

pathways from glaciers to deserts 3 1 the hydrochemistry of glacier snow and ice the solute chemistry of glacier snow and ice has been studied in ca since the 1960 s blagoobrazov 1969 blinova 1962 fedulov 1971 kamalov 1975 vilesov and shabanov 1971 vilesov et al 1980 this knowledge has been significantly enhanced by studies of ice cores obtained from high elevation glaciers providing a pollution history dating back to the 1900 s grigholm et al 2016 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 wake et al 1990 zhao et al 2011 in all high elevation regions the composition of snow and ice depends on atmospheric deposition kang et al 2019 the ca glaciers are located in proximity to sources of desert dust which typically form on abandoned agricultural land or dry lake and river beds nobakht et al 2021 the glaciers are also close to large cities and industrial centres with poor air quality and high black carbon bc emissions shahgedanova 2002b shahgedanova and burt 1994 as well as close to the extensive agricultural areas where fertilizers pesticides and herbicides are used the mineral dust and bc deposited on snow and glaciers are the light absorbing impurities lai which enhance snow and ice melt painter et al 2012 they are also transport vectors for other pollutants kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 aizen et al 2004 schmale et al 2017 pollutants accumulated in the glacial ice and snowpack have the potential to be released decades or centuries later hence the term legacy pollutants is used here with potential adverse impacts on the headwater streams which are typically characterized by low solute concentrations and therefore may be highly sensitive to change there is general agreement that the deposition of mineral dust defines the ionic composition of snow and ice in ca kang et al 2019 schmale et al 2017 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 zhao et al 2011 the early studies of snow and ice chemistry of the tuyuksy and fedchenko glaciers in the ile alatau northern tien shan and pamir respectively showed that the chemistry was dominated by hco3 and ca2 relative to so4 2 mg2 and cl due to the deposition of the calcite dust blinova 1962 the predominance of ca2 and hco3 was reported for the inylchek glacier in the central tien shan aizen et al 2004 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 and for the abramov glacier in the pamir alay hinkley et al 1997 albeit at lower concentrations than in the ile alatau because of the higher elevation and more remote locations of these glaciers similarly in the eastern tien shan the ionic composition of snow is enriched with crustal proxies such as ca2 and mg2 dong et al 2009 wake et al 1990 you et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however na concentrations in snow are high and a significant correlation of na with mg2 and cl suggests that the regional saline lakes are also a source of the deposited material dong et al 2009 debate continues about the relative importance of anthropogenic and natural sources of sulphate high so4 2 concentrations in the snowpack in the eastern tien shan have been attributed to industrial and urban sources rather than the gypsum rich desert dust wake et al 1990 zhang et al 2016 because there is a strong correlation between concentrations of sulphate particulate matter and unsaturated hydrocarbons all produced by coal burning lee et al 2003 in contrast in the same region high sulphate concentrations in precipitation were associated with desert dust williams et al 1992 similarly high sulphate concentrations in snow in the kunnes headwaters in the balkhash alakol basin fig 1 and on the inylchek glacier were associated with desert soils evaporate gypsum deposits and the dry lakes kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 fengqing et al 2002 elevated snow nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 concentrations were measured on glaciers in the eastern tien shan located close to populated areas zhang et al 2016 the summer nh4 concentration peaks in ice cores from the inylchek glacier and from a remote muztaga glacier in the eastern pamir were reported and related to agricultural activities particularly to fertilizer application kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 aizen et al 2004 zhao et al 2011 an increase in so4 2 and no3 in glacier ice observed since the 1970 s has been attributed to growing anthropogenic emissions in the soviet union in the 1970 s and in china in the 1990 s zhao et al 2011 trace metals have been found in snow and ice the trace elements mn ti sn cs in dust deposited on the snowpack in the ile alatau near the city of almaty fig 1 glazovsky and glazovsky 1982 and al and fe in the ürümqi glacier n1 in the eastern tien shan zhongqin et al 2007 are thought of lithogenic origin concentrations of other trace elements including pb ni sn cr cd cu and zn were measured in these and other glaciers and attributed to anthropogenic sources including industrial production and the use of leaded petrol the pb concentrations averaging 2 4 ng g 1 cd and zn measured in the ürümqi glacier n1 exceeded concentrations reported for the himalayas and the european alps by approximately a factor of 40 li et al 2007 an increase in cd sb bi tl sn and pb concentrations has been observed since the 1950 s in the miaoergou glacier in the eastern tien shan liu et al 2011 both glaciers are in relative proximity to urban sources however in the remote muztaga glacier sb bi and pb concentrations increased too between the 1950 1970 s and the 1990 s corresponding with growing industrial production in the soviet union and china respectively li et al 2006 the ice core measurements from the inylchek glacier extending from 1908 to 1995 also showed that pb cd and cu concentrations increased between the 1950 s and 1980 s in line with industrial growth in kazakhstan and uzbekistan following a decline in the early 1990 s the concentrations began to increase again reflecting industrial growth in china and a widespread use of fertilizers herbicides and fungicides which contain cu in the tarim basin grigholm et al 2016 the chemical composition of glacial melt depends upon natural factors including lithology glacier morphology climate drainage pathways and biological activity tranter 2003 the legacy pollutants which are deposited on glaciers and preserved in ice enter the hydrological system as glaciers retreat and can contaminate the aquatic systems if toxic metals e g mercury or persistent organic pollutants pops are released bogdal et al 2009 in melting glaciers the leaching process is complex because meltwater percolation can be stopped by layers of superimposed ice leading to the preservation of ions which are removed by runoff only during intensive melt lee et al 2003 there is evidence of water contamination by legacy pollutants in the european alps bettinetti et al 2008 bogdal et al 2009 tibet chen et al 2019 and alaska miner et al 2019 but there are very few studies in ca with which to draw comparison measurements at the ürümqi glacier n1 showed that trace metal concentrations in snow increased in winter with a secondary maximum in spring when dust deposition peaks the trace metals were leached from the melting snowpack in july and august li et al 2007 concentrations of pb and cd remained high for a relatively short period of time but their rapid removal aided by elution implied that they were transported to the mountain streams with the onset of seasonal melt potentially affecting aquatic ecosystems the removal of other elements form the melting snow and ice was studied to a limited extent too you et al 2015 showed that of all ions no3 was the most mobile followed by so4 2 while other species including nh4 had a higher residence time overall there is a good understanding of soluble chemistry of snow and ice growing information about trace metals but little data on how these chemicals enter the hydrological system and what impact they make on river hwq there is a notable lack of data on other pollutants such as pops or emergent contaminants e g microplastics 3 2 stream water hydrochemistry from the glacial headwaters to the mountain base the spatial variability of ion concentrations in the glacierized headwaters is primarily related to the predominant lithology the relative contributions of snow and glacier melt to runoff are important but second order factors dobroumov 1973 tranter 2003 anderson 2007 the ion concentrations in the stream water at high elevations are usually low because of the low weathering rates of the resistant lithologies which form the mountain chains the order of anions and cations is a function of the predominant lithology weathering kinetics and transport mechanisms calcium is the predominant cation in glacial melt due to its rapid dissolution kinetics and carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation are the most typical chemical weathering mechanisms tranter et al 2002 tranter 2003 bicarbonates are often the predominant anions where basic rocks are present anderson 2007 in the glacial headwater catchments of ca the orders in terms of concentration are hco3 so4 2 cl and ca2 mg2 na k these orders are observed in the kishi and ulken almaty in kazakhstan romanova et al 2016 chu talas dobroumov 1973 ma et al 2020 and naryn ma et al 2019 rivers in kyrgyzstan and the kafarnihon in tajikistan finaev et al 2017 although the carbonate lithology dominates in the upstream ile catchment in china evaporate dissolution and carbonate weathering have an approximately equal effect c 40 on the river water ionic composition zhu et al 2013 in contrast in the hyper arid tarim basin evaporate dissolution dominates over carbonate weathering here na and cl sourced from halite dissolution and so4 2 can be high even in the headwaters xiao et al 2012 in the glacierized catchments weathering of suspended and dissolved solids is highest at the peak of meltwater production the large runoff volumes ensure that glacial meltwater is usually very diluted and concentrations of chemicals are low however high flow see fig s2 enables transportation of large loads and fluxes of solutes and sediment during the glacier melt period tranter 2003 the literature on seasonal variations in the ion fluxes in stream water in ca is limited but in agreement the fluxes are related to seasonal melt and the associated variations in discharge in the catchments where the contribution of glacier ice melt to runoff is high ion discharge peaks in summer in line with the maximum in river discharge fig s2 in the larger catchments where glacierization is lower and snow melt dominates a spring peak in ion discharge is typical suggesting a diffuse input of weathered material for example in the kishi almaty and ulken almaty rivers which drain small catchments with high glacierization in the ile alatau shahgedanova et al 2018 approximately 50 and 30 of the total annual solute flux are transported in summer and autumn respectively with a smaller proportion accounted for by the snow melt contribution in spring romanova et al 2016 the ion flux in the middle courses of the river talas peaks in june in the river chu which has much larger catchment where snow melt dominates the ion flux peaks in spring 60 followed by winter 25 summer 10 and autumn 5 dobroumov 1973 despite the dominance of snow melt in runoff glacier melt affects the stream hydrochemistry of the headwater catchments in specific ways glacial runoff is rich in fine sediment known as glacier flour which gives the runoff its clouded appearance glaciers are important exporters of dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen milner et al 2017 mountain glaciers especially those in the middle and low latitudes are known to store and release organic carbon to streams and the export is expected to increase as glaciers melt and retreat hood et al 2015 carbon is leached from the till and from englacial and supraglacial ecosystems supported by cryoconite cook et al 2016 glacial melt keeps the downstream water temperature low which in turn reduces primary productivity and slows organic matter decay kneib et al 2020 these effects were studied in the european alps north america and the arctic anderson 2007 tranter 2003 but there is little data on nitrogen and carbon cycling in ca recent studies published for the chinese tien shan gao et al 2020 li et al 2018 liu et al 2016 on carbon export show that area weighted carbon fluxes are higher than in alaska and european alps li et al 2018 and exceed previous estimates hood et al 2015 the melt of permafrost and sub moraine and rock glacier ice contributes to an increase in ion flux colombo et al 2018 in other glacierized regions solute leaching in permafrost areas has been observed to have two seasonal peaks the first when acidic snowmelt flushes soil horizons and a second in late summer early autumn when melt is released from deeper mineralized horizons as the ground warms colombo et al 2018 melting permafrost can increase inorganic n p and si export as well as that of major ions e g ca2 mg2 so4 2 and trace elements e g ni mn al hg pb colombo et al 2018 and it has been suggested that total dissolved solids tds concentrations in the runoff from rock glaciers are higher than in glacial runoff this is because the extensive mineral surface area ice contact in rock glaciers promotes chemical weathering which in turn leads to solute enrichment of water contained within and downstream rock glaciers jones et al 2019 however there are insufficient studies to draw firm conclusions anywhere and there are no studies of impacts of permafrost and rock glacier melt on hydrochemistry in ca although industrial activities are usually limited at high elevations gold mining at the kumtor glacier in the akshiirak massif kyrgyzstan gained notoriety horrocks taylor 2018 its impacts on the local surface water and hwq of the river naryn were found to increase concentrations of iron aluminium lead and manganese in the local surface waters during the warm season when mining activities intensify abduvaliyev and khudaybergenova 2016 however concentrations of pollutants in the naryn itself remain low due to the high summer runoff and melt water dilution currently there are very few hwq measurements in the mountains there is knowledge about fluxes of major ions in river channels from the studies conducted in the 1970 1980 s however there is little or no information about changes in hwq related to glacier melt and retreat e g release of legacy pollutants melt of rock glaciers and permafrost notably in terms of carbon fluxes and interactions between meltwater and groundwater hwq 3 3 stream water hydrochemistry from the foothills to the lowland plains there is a consensus in the literature that in all studied catchments in ca ion concentrations in stream water increase along the mountain to plains stream continuum the number of studies whilst detailed in their analyses is low and most are short term moving downstream inputs from industrial urban and agricultural sources increase fig 2 as does evaporation fig s2d in the lowlands aridity and sparse vegetation lead to the high evaporation from soil and open water driving evapoconcentration yapiyev et al 2017 fig s1 thus the salinity of surface and groundwater and land salinization are the major problems in ca hamidov et al 2016 overall the river water quality in ca is mostly within national and international standards table s2 but there are localised instances of poor water quality the water pollution hot spots are attributed to the return of the agricultural wastewater the practice of soil washing especially in the aral sea basin and chu talas catchment and to urban and industrial sources chu talas commission 2018 crosa et al 2006a 2006b groll et al 2015 for example the river zerafshan flows for 870 km through predominantly natural landscapes in tajikistan and then through farmland and industrial areas in uzbekistan where approximately 60 of the flow is used for irrigation ultimately limiting flow into the amu darya groll et al 2015 within the zerafshan the tds concentrations range between 160 and 190 mg l 1 in the tajik sector increase to 240 mg l 1 at the uzbek border and then to 1800 mg l 1 at the outflow significantly exceeding national standards and the who threshold of water potability table s2 groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 similarly in the river chu whose watercourse exceeds 1200 km tds concentrations increase from 30 mg l 1 in the mountains to 900 mg l 1 in the middle course and to 2500 mg l 1 in the lower reaches in the desert dobroumov 1973 the return of irrigation water to the river ile in the balkhash alakol basin and its tributaries significantly increases the solute concentrations aidarov 2006 some crops e g many vegetables and fruits are sensitive to water salinity and have reduced yields when irrigated with water high in tds the irrigation water requirements for some crops for tds may be lower than a common threshold for drinking water of 1 g l 1 ayers and westcot 1985 the prevalence of sodium and sulphate in the stream water is typical of ca plains due to high evaporation fig s2d however high sodium and sulphate concentrations in the zerafshan are attributed to industrial and urban sources and high chloride to the inflow of the returned irrigation water crosa et al 2006b olsson et al 2012 2013 very high nitrate and phosphate concentrations reaching 56 mg n l 1 and 57 mg p l 1 respectively were reported in the irrigation water returned to the zerafshan here and thereafter values have been converted from no3 and po4 3 are used see introduction for conversion factors however nitrate concentrations in its stream water were predominantly in the range of 5 65 11 30 mg no 3 n l 1 only occasionally exceeding national and who thresholds groll et al 2015 table s2 since the 1990 s there is evidence of some water quality improvements evidenced by declines in chloride calcium nitrate and phosphorous concentrations and in chemical oxygen demand cod in the zerafshan groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 most likely due to decline of industrial and agricultural production and use of fertilizers in the last decade of the 1990 s especially in tajikistan fig s3 however this observation is not ubiquitous in ca in the kazakhstani part of the ile catchment whilst nitrate concentrations are low 0 23 0 45 mg n l 1 detectible concentrations of pesticides in returned irrigation water have been reported aidarov 2006 in the lower reaches of the talas downstream of the town of taraz nitrate concentrations have increased from 0 01 to 1 13 mg no3 n l 1 in the 1960 70 s to 1 58 2 94 mg no3 n l 1 in 2000 2014 whilst phosphate concentrations did not exceed 0 12 p mg l 1 in the 1960 70 s with no data reported for 2000 2014 dobroumov 1973 chu talas commission 2018 in the chu talas basin nitrate concentrations in river water have also increased since the 1960 s though lower biological oxygen demand bod concentrations were reported suggesting an increase in fertiliser leaching and better sewage treatment ibid it should be noted however that the data were generated by two measurement campaigns and inhomogeneity in the data can affect the comparison in the amu darya phosphorus concentrations are higher in small towns upstream of the major agricultural areas and are inversely related to discharge lobanova and didovets 2019 this suggests point source contamination with sewage conversely there is a positive correlation between nitrate concentrations and flow at the same locations suggesting diffuse nitrogen inputs the phosphorus concentrations in the kazakhstani downstream section of the syr darya did not change significantly between the 1970 s and 2000 s amirgaliyev 2007 with concentrations ranging from 0 001 to 0 009 mg p l 1 in the 1971 1978 period and from 0 002 to 0 012 mg p l 1 in the 1993 2000 period nitrate was reported to range from 0 07 to 4 1 mg n l 1 and from 2 3 to 6 0 mg n l 1 in the same periods these concentrations are within the national water quality standards table s2 though there has been a gradual increase in nitrate and ammonium after 2000 following an increase in agricultural production amirgaliyev 2007 fig s3 downstream from the urban and industrial centres such as samarkand kattakurgan and navoi in uzbekistan where water used for municipal and industrial needs is discharged water in the zerafshan is characterised by high cod indicating large amounts of organic waste consuming oxygen and increasing phosphorous inputs groll et al 2015 in the kazakhstani sector of the balkhash alakol basin municipal sources are important too as only approximately 20 of sewage is treated biologically aidarov 2006 municipal wastewater discharge in urban areas is considered as a major source of pollution in the chu catchment together with irrigation and soil washing chu talas commission 2018 in contrast the contribution of municipal sources to tds in the amu darya water was insignificant relative to the impacts of irrigation activities crosa et al 2006a studies that examined seasonal variations in tds nitrate and phosphate concentrations report a minimum in summer and a maximum in january to march in the zerafshan groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 and a primary maximum in march april and a secondary maximum in october november in the amu darya and its other tributaries crosa et al 2006a lobanova and didovets 2019 the extended periods of the elevated tds concentrations observed in the lower reaches of these rivers were attributed to the return of the irrigation wastewater and to soil washing importantly the low tds concentrations correlating with the summer peak in river discharge caused by the snow and ice melt in the headwaters were reported for the lower reaches of the amu darya showing that the dilution effect extends along the course of this major ca river far from the glaciers crosa et al 2006a the tds concentrations increased in years with low discharge while in years of high discharge caused by the enhanced melt in warmer summers water quality improved through dilution in the talas chu and syr darya amirgaliyev 2007 chu talas commission 2018 lobanova and didovets 2019 the influence of the meltwater on the stream water quality in the lower reaches of the main channels was evident as well as the difference between the tributaries that do and do not drain glaciers to conclude water quality remains mostly within national and who standards in the main river channels due to the dilution effect associated with snow and glacier melt there are hot spots of pollution associated with soil washing discharge of irrigation water sewage and water used in industrial production although the latter is discussed to a lesser extent in literature perhaps the main identified gap is a lack of long term measurements made using consistent methods supported by more frequent sampling to characterise extreme low and high concentrations and the corresponding flow conditions 3 4 lakes and reservoirs as buffers of water quality extremes and contaminant sinks the hwq of six major lakes is discussed in literature including the high elevation lakes issyk kul and bosten and the low elevation aral sea and lakes balkhash alakol and sarygamysh but not for the smaller lakes fig 1 artificial reservoirs are built both in the mountains for hydropower and on the plains to supply water for irrigation and municipal use the hwq of the former is not examined in the published literature the information about the latter is limited although the lowland reservoirs are often used as fisheries and their water quality is subject to regulation in general reservoirs reduce both seasonal and interannual variability in ion concentrations burlibayev et al 2007 for example following the filling of the kapshagay reservoir kazakhstan in the 1980 s the annual variation in tds concentrations in the downstream section of the ile declined from approximately 400 mg l 1 to 150 mg l 1 and tds concentrations became almost independent of the runoff burlibayev et al 2007 the issyk kul is the largest high altitude lake in ca fig 1 table s3 and the most researched both arable and pastoral farming are practiced in its catchment and importantly the issyk kul is a major centre for recreation and tourism koronkevich 2002 glacial runoff accounts for 14 of the total runoff received by the issyk kul sorg et al 2012 however rivers in the issyk kul basin have higher tds concentrations than the glacier fed rivers elsewhere because of a considerable proportion of subsurface flow dobroumov 1973 lyons et al 2001 asankulov et al 2019 during the high flow period tds ranges between 75 and 200 mg l 1 increasing to 100 300 mg l 1 in winter dobroumov 1973 the issyk kul itself is brackish with salinity of approximately 6 g l 1 asankulov et al 2019 lyons et al 2001 the river chemistry is dominated by ca2 and hco3 but the concentrations are low in the lake water which is strongly influenced by evapoconcentration and calcium precipitation from the water column saturated with carbonates asankulov et al 2019 kawabata et al 2014 lyons et al 2001 savvaitova and petr 1992 the ion composition of the issyk kul water is similar to that of the aral and caspian seas despite its high elevation this is because all three lakes accumulate salts in a similar way through evapoconcentration the groundwater inputs are high approximately 40 of the inflow to the issyk kul the groundwater seepage is low and there is no surface outflow the issyk kul is oligotrophic and the vertical distribution of nutrients including nitrate phosphate silicate and the major cations are uniform to the depth of approximately 80 90 m savvaitova and petr 1992 kawabata et al 2014 the lake water is well oxygenated with an alkaline ph of 7 9 asankulov et al 2019 dobroumov 1973 savvaitova and petr 1992 the lake water is enriched in some trace elements v co cu mo u sr sb cs br f and li in comparison with the stream water but all concentrations comply with the national and who standards lyons et al 2001 lake bosten is one of the largest freshwater lakes in china fig 1 table s3 xiao et al 2015 receiving most of its inflow from the glacier fed kaidu river and losing water through evaporation and discharge to the kongque river yao et al 2018 positioned at a lower elevation than the issyk kul it provides water for irrigation and industry from 2003 2012 the lake level decreased by approximately 5 m but started to rise after 2013 yao et al 2018 the tds concentrations correlated inversely with water level changing from a minimum of 600 mg l 1 characteristic of freshwater in 1960 1900 mg l 1 in 1987 yao et al 2018 the discharge of wastewater used in irrigation and industrial production contributed to increase in lake water salinity yao et al 2018 exceedances of the chinese water quality standards in surface and groundwater for nitrate 10 mg n l 1 and sulphate 250 mg l 1 were reported xiao et al 2015 water quality in warm and shallow lakes located on the plains is likely to be most vulnerable to climate change malmaeus et al 2006 lakes balkhash and alakol fed by the rivers originating in the northern tien shan and jetisu junggar alatau are shallow and saline fig 1 table s3 in the balkhash salinity is higher in the east with tds concentration of about 2 4 g l 1 and lower in the west where prior to the construction of the kapshagay reservoir tds values were approximately 1000 1500 mg l 1 petr 1992 propastin 2012 abuduwaili et al 2019 this gradient is due to a division of the lake by the sary isek peninsula and the ile delivering most of the inflow in the west salinity of the lake increased in its western part following the construction of the kapshagay reservoir intercepting the ile and disconnecting from glacial melt fig 1 and now exceeds 2000 mg l 1 burlibayev et al 2007 mischke et al 2020 ion composition is dominated by cl so4 2 na and k the balkhash is affected by the inflow of irrigation wastewater discharged in the ile and pesticides such as ddt metabolites have been observed elevated concentrations of metals particularly copper and zinc and petroleum products were found in the lake water exceeding the national standards and attributed to the industrial facilities including copper smelting on its shores burlibayev et al 2007 the hwq of the alakol basin and its impacts on the health of the lake s ecosystem were systematically researched by amirgaliyev et al 2007 between 1988 and 2004 the mountain rivers flowing into lake alakol are characterized by strong seasonal variability in tds with the sum of major ions ranging from 200 to 800 mg l 1 dominated by hco3 and ca2 amirgaliyev et al 2007 the water of the alakol itself is brackish with mean long term salinity of approximately 7 4 g l 1 and relatively small interannual variability of tds so4 2 na and k dominate the ionic composition amirgaliyev et al 2007 the local rivers are contaminated by ni co zn and cu due to the agricultural activities concentrations of organochlorine pesticides such as lindane and ddt metabolites peaked between 1991 and 1993 and although the use of pesticides declined afterwards they are still detected in the water bodies sediments and fish in the alakol basin amirgaliyev et al 2007 lake sarygamysh fig 1 has become progressively salinized though in the past the lake was fed by the amu darya and was fresh micklin et al 2007 orlovsky et al 2012 in 1548 british travellers reported that water in the lake from which the uzboy originates was fresh and sweet orlovsky et al 2012 later the sarygamsyh became progressively salinized following the migration of the amu darya channel towards the aral sea in the 1950 s the sarygamysh nearly dried and consisted of several small lakes with water salinity reaching 300 g l 1 but was subsequently turned into a collector of wastewater used in irrigation and for soil washing severskiy 2004 orlovsky et al 2012 currently water salinity is about 11 g l 1 and cl so4 2 and na dominate accounting for about 80 of tds suggesting the strong impact of evapoconcentration orlovsky et al 2012 importantly the absence of phosphates and low concentrations of nitrate were reported both in the lake water about 0 68 mg n l 1 and in irrigation discharge 0 68 1 58 mg n l 1 orlovsky et al 2012 however pesticides such as lindane and ddt were found in the sarygamysh water pavlovskaya 1995 the dry exposed bed of the sarygamysh is one of the main sources of desert dust in ca nobakht et al 2021 and there is a danger that pollutants contained in the sediments may be transported to the regional glaciers the aral sea is the largest internal lake in ca and degradation of its environment has been discussed in multiple publications micklin 2007 middleton 2002 severskiy 2004 the withdrawal of water for irrigation primarily for growing cotton during the soviet period resulted in a decline of the amu darya and sur darya runoff to the aral from 56 km3 in the 1960 s to 5 km3 in 1980 s micklin 2016 leading to the desiccation of the aral its area declined from 67 499 km2 in 1960 39 734 km2 in 1989 micklin 2016 currently the aral consists of two main residual basins the large south aral and the small north aral fig 1 which have different physical chemical and biological characteristics izhitskiy et al 2016 the small north aral located in kazakhstan is in fact a reservoir regulated by the kok aral dam built in 2005 micklin 2016 its hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics are similar to those of the former aral before desiccation with salinity about 12 g kg 1 allowing some ecological restoration the highest salinity of about 130 g kg 1 is observed in the western part of the large south aral which its largest and hypersaline residual basin izhitskiy et al 2016 rzymski et al 2019 reported that concentrations of arsenic exceed the who threshold for drinking water table s2 in the small aral and in the lower reaches of the syr darya the high as content in the water bodies of the aral sea region is attributed to both natural underground leaching see fig 3 and anthropogenic contamination podgorski and berg 2020 rzymski et al 2019 törnqvist et al 2011 concentrations of copper nickel and lead exceed the who recommendations in the lower reaches of the amu darya delta and the adjacent part of the large aral törnqvist et al 2011 analysis of lacustrine sediment cores from the small aral showed that increase in concentrations of these and other e g cr co cd metals increased dramatically around 1970 implicating human activities w liu et al 2020a similarly to the sedimentary records obtained from lakes ebinur ma et al 2016 bosten w liu et al 2020b and chaiwapu ma et al 2013 in north western china the measured concentrations however suggest that these pollutants represent medium risk to the aral sea ecosystem except for cd which represents a significant risk w liu et al 2020a this issue is explored further in section 5 3 intermittent water quality measurements were reported for the two main lowland reservoirs the kapshagay in the balkhash alakol basin and the shardara on the syr darya kazakhstan fig 1 in the shardara nutrient concentrations were found to be low but the presence of the organochlorine pesticides and concentrations of zn cd cu pb exceeding the national water quality standards for fisheries table s2 were reported for 2015 barinova et al 2017 snow et al 2020 to conclude lake water quality varies being understandably worse in the terminal lakes which receive industrial and irrigation wastewater and where water abstraction is high data are available predominantly for large lakes and lowland reservoirs while little is published about hwq of small lakes and mountain reservoirs despite the fact that construction of reservoirs is expanding predominantly in china but also in the post soviet ca this is an important gap in knowledge because pesticides and heavy metals may accumulate in these water bodies and hwq in lowland lakes where evapoconcentration dominates can deteriorate quickly if river flow declines either due to glacier recession or water abstraction 4 groundwater surface water interaction and pollution in ca major groundwater basins which are often transboundary occur along the alluvial valleys of the rivers fig 3 the mountains are the main groundwater recharge areas and are characterized by a complex hydrogeology gafurov et al 2019 liu et al 2020 fig 3 in the arid lowlands local and shallow aquifers predominate often with saline groundwater fig 3 the hyper arid tarim and adjacent junggar and turpan are sedimentary basins with saline groundwater fig 1 3 although average population density is relatively low table s1 settlements including many large cities are located on aquifers in the foothills and oases increasing population density locally fig 3 the use of groundwater for potable water supply considerably increases pressure on water resources bishkek depends on groundwater almost fully morris et al 2006 while almaty and dushanbe obtain 60 and 50 of their drinking water from this source respectively finaev et al 2017 voxpopuli 2019 in the soviet union groundwater was considered a strategic resource and its use for drinking and irrigation was limited gafurov et al 2019 but more recently the groundwater use has increased in ca especially during dry years y liu et al 2020 the groundwater chemistry is different from that of the surface waters in several ways firstly the aquifers filter the turbid river water characterized by high sediment load improving its quality secondly the groundwater is typically enriched in solutes depending on the regional lithology relative to the surface waters thirdly the groundwater tends to accumulate higher contaminant concentrations in urban areas in particular nitrate concentrations of nitrate reach and sometimes exceed national and who threshold of 10 11 3 mg no 3 l 1 table s2 in local shallow groundwater wells in dushanbe and bishkek in summer months yapiyev et al 2020 snow and glacier melt ensures high groundwater flow and flushes the aquifers to some extent particularly in the upstream sections morris et al 2006 somers and mckenzie 2020 although interactions between snow and glacier melt aquifer recharge and quality of groundwater were not studied in ca changes in the groundwater hwq with elevation resemble those of the surface water in the lowlands salinity is a major problem fig 3 gafurov et al 2019 y liu et al 2020 in the aral sea basin better groundwater quality was reported in the upper than in the downstream sections of the amu darya and syr darya catchments gafurov et al 2019 in the upstream catchments the ionic composition of groundwater was dominated by carbonates and calcium ions similar to the surface waters while closer to the aral sea the groundwater was saline with elevated chloride and sulphate concentrations fig 3 rakhmatullaev et al 2009 and gafurov et al 2019 related salinity of groundwater to salinization of soils while less than 10 of land in the upper amu darya basin is saline 95 of soils are saline or very saline in its lower reaches changes in irrigation practices e g switching for furrow to drip irrigation can help not only save water but also reduce salinization of soils surface and underground water the extent of soil contamination by potential toxic elements and pops is not well researched but it may impact both surface and groundwater quality a recently published study on potential toxic elements in soils in kazakhstan by guney et al 2020 identified elevated as cd ni in two points in chu and talas basins overall groundwater chemistry and quality is one of the major knowledge gaps in ca and in particular very little is known about groundwater hwq in the mountains 5 a perspective on future hydrochemistry and water quality research requirements in central asia 5 1 the current state of knowledge and the identified gaps in this paper we have reviewed the current knowledge about the hwq along the mountain to lowland continuum in ca the amount and quality of the information and level of understanding vary between issues regions and elevation zones the available knowledge and the main gaps are summarized in table 1 however the largest gap is the lack understanding of cycling of pollutants and changes in the hwq along the whole elevation continuum from the glacierized source regions to sinks in the arid lowlands fig 2 the best researched aspect of the hwq is the solute chemistry of mountain snow and ice multiple studies are in agreement about its relationship to the atmospheric deposition and the important role of desert dust there is growing information about concentrations of sulphate nitrate ammonium and metals but no consensus on how these relate to dust sources and emissions from the combustion of fossil fuel and agriculture the use of pesticides and herbicides in ca was and in some regions still is widespread tang et al 2021 the major sources of mineral dust in ca are associated with the abandoned arable land and sinks of water used in agriculture nobakht et al 2021 the atmospheric transport of pop with mineral dust entrained from these areas and its accumulation in the high elevation zone is implied e g snow et al 2020 but never proven as pop measurements in the uplands are unavailable it is widely known that glaciers can support microbial food webs and that they store organic carbon from local and distant sources and release it in the downstream environments as they melt hood et al 2015 wadham et al 2019 the microbial food webs have not been researched in the region there are very few studies of carbon export possibly because the ca basins are not connected to the world ocean although they do support lacustrine environments li et al 2017 overall there are only a few studies considering how any chemicals enter the hydrological system following snow and glacier melt e g you et al 2015 zhongqin et al 2007 and there are no assessments of their impacts on stream water hwq there is no understanding of biogeochemical cycling between the glacierized aquatic and terrestrial lowland ecosystems there is also no consideration of whether glacier retreat and permafrost and rock glacier melt will promote solute leaching since the 1990 s most studies on snow and ice chemistry have been conducted by international teams in collaboration with regional scientists and glacier and hydrometeorological monitoring have been reinstated in the region barandun et al 2020 hoelzle et al 2019 therefore there is strong potential to address these challenges downstream the gaps in knowledge are due to the lack of access to the long term hwq data and contemporary higher frequency measurements table 1 in the post soviet ca monitoring of a large range of chemicals in surface water table s2 which began in the 1960 s is now performed by the national hydrometeorological agencies united nations economic commission for europe 2018 although the monitoring networks declined in the 1990 s samples are collected once per month from permanent sites and methods are consistent across the region in kazakhstan and uzbekistan the monitoring networks are more extensive and analyses are conducted in certified laboratories in kyrgyzstan and especially in tajikistan these are less advanced due to the funding constrains united nations economic commission for europe 2018 despite the long monitoring history until recently data access was limited and water quality was at best reported as exceedance of national standards the so called maximum allowable concentrations table s2 constraining scientific analysis most of the post 1990 literature is based on the data obtained in the short term projects with few studies analyzing changes in hwq over time and larger basins amirgaliyev 2007 crosa et al 2006a 2006b groll et al 2015 lobanova and didovets 2019 olsson et al 2013 as a result many local studies report conflicting findings and their independent evaluation is challenging because of the limited information about data quality recently actual data on concentrations of selected pollutants became publicly available from the state agencies in kazakhstan kazhydromet 2020 and kyrgyzstan kyrgyzhydromet 2020 albeit almost entirely for the plains data on the groundwater quality are not publicly available and are treated as classified restricted information y liu et al 2020 this is a significant limitation providing that while the use of this resource is increasing including the provision of potable water contamination of the shallow ground water bekturganov et al 2016 bosch et al 2007 morris et al 2006 nurtazin et al 2020 törnqvist et al 2011 yapiyev et al 2020 and salinization gafurov et al 2019 liu et al 2020 rakhmatullaev et al 2009 are reported by the few available studies further work is needed to better understand groundwater recharge rates and the surface water groundwater interactions that control the replenishment and flushing of the shallow aquifers around the cities used for drinking water and to understand the relative importance of groundwater and melt water contributions to lowland river flow water use and quality buytaert et al 2017 multiple dams and reservoirs in the mountains and on the plains are a characteristic feature of ca reservoirs modify runoff and work as bioreactors which store and transform sediments nutrients and contaminants travelling from upstream locations globally reservoirs have been observed to promote eutrophication and bury organic matter in sediments emitting nitrogen by denitrification processes maavara et al 2020 fig 2 the impacts of dams and reservoirs on the regional hwq are one of the biggest gaps in knowledge especially taking into account the extensive reservoir construction in china which already causes concerns about water quality in the ile basin because of the observed and predicted increase in water abstraction which in combination with a projected decline in glacial meltwater input kogutenko et al 2019 may result in a reduced dilution effect stone 2012 there is a significant potential for reservoir expansion in the mountains of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan to adapt to the continuing deglacierization farinotti et al 2019 while there is very little information in the published literature about hwq of the upland reservoirs 5 2 water quality at present and after the peak flow ca strongly depends on water provision from the mountains viviroli et al 2020 and more than any other region on glacier melt kaser et al 2010 currently high air temperatures and low precipitation in summer do not imply a lack of river flow because of the meltwater contribution and in many headwater catchments an increase in streamflow has been observed due to the intensifying glacier melt huss et al 2017 shahgedanova et al 2018 although the trends are often different in the downstream catchments affected by water abstraction grill et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2012 severskiy 2004 both snow and glacial melt maintain the dilution effect which peaks in the early and late summer respectively this ecosystem service sustains the acceptable water quality even in the lower reaches of large rivers such as the amu darya crosa et al 2006a lobanova and didovets 2019 despite a low proportion of the total catchment area occupied by glaciers and a large extent of agricultural land table s1 the decline in the use of fertilisers in the post soviet central asia especially in kazakhstan and tajikistan in the 1990 s fig s3 has helped to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the lowland farmed areas most studies point at the water pollution hotspots often associated with the degradation of sewage treatment systems bekturganov et al 2016 rather than persistent and widespread exceedance of the national and international standards the emphasis on pollution hotspots is an interesting contrast with the recent perspectives on the downstream impacts of glacier shrinkage which describe cascades of effects milner et al 2017 rasul and molden 2019 it was suggested that such cascades may affect various hwq variables for example dissolved organic carbon whereby carbon fluxes from montane sources e g retreating glaciers add to the inputs from lowland farmland and sewage however inputs from montane sources may be localised and subsequently diluted or by contrast concentrated when mixed with inputs from multiple tributaries especially in the lowlands whose hydrochemistry is very different from that of the mountains further work is needed to quantify the combined effects of multiple tributaries with different characteristics on the downstream hwq the peak of non renewable water released by the melt of glacier ice is expected in ca in the 2040 2050 s followed by a decline in glacier runoff huss and hock 2018 and streamflow immerzeel et al 2012 shahgedanova et al 2020 in the 2010 s the use of nitrogen fertilizers reached and exceeded its 1992 level in kazakhstan and uzbekistan respectively and the application of phosphates began to increase in all countries fig s3 given the ongoing economic recovery of the region the observed growth in the use of fertilisers is expected to continue especially in uzbekistan the juxtaposition of these trends is likely to have negative implications for hwq extensive effort in water quality modelling under the present and future climates is required to quantify the effects of the projected climatic and hydrological changes on the hwq of both surface and groundwater after the peak water there are no studies in ca in the absence of the long term reliable data of water quality in the glacierized catchments a recent systematic review of the literature on adaptation to impacts of climate change in the mountain catchments of ca published between 2013 and 2020 showed that none focused on water quality saidaliyeva et al 2021 5 3 implications for human health and ecosystems the need for knowledge about hwq is based on its importance for human and ecosystem health the aral sea crisis has put this issue on the national and international environmental agendas micklin 2007 but only limited understanding has been achieved for the region as a whole research focused primarily on the presence of pop and pathogenic microbes in the amu darya and its tributaries and in drinking water in the aral sea region water pollution in the amu darya delta was considered a low risk to health see section 3 4 although concentrations of the potentially toxic substances such as arsenic and pesticides exceeded the who guidelines in potable water from the ground wells törnqvist et al 2011 this was not the case in the aralsk region in kazakhstan although in this region pathogenic microbes were present in potable groundwater bosch et al 2007 conflicting results on the quality of potable groundwater were provided for the balkhash region bekturganov et al 2016 reported an increase in water borne diseases due to the poor drinking water treatment contamination during distribution and a frequent use of shallow groundwater which is often polluted by sewage however an extensive survey of drinking water quality in the rural area between the kapshagay reservoir and lake balkhash reported that overall potable water met national standards though microbial contamination was detected in wells nurtazin et al 2020 importantly the effects of water quality on human health depend on exposure and pathways of pollutants to human bodies research in the aral sea basin suggested that drinking water quality did not threaten human health directly rather pollutants including pesticides and toxic elements had different pathways e g through the consumption of food which did not comply with the health standards and inhalation of contaminated desert dust o hara et al 2000 jensen et al 1997 muntean et al 2003 crighton et al 2011 therefore a holistic approach to research of water quality on human health is required including different types of exposure and multiple pathways the deltas of large rivers in ca such as amu darya syr darya and ile are occupied by the vast wetlands connecting rivers to endorheic lakes the wetlands are biodiversity hotspots it is known that they are affected by salinization tesch and thevs 2020 however impacts of pollution caused by the discharge of water used for irrigation and municipal needs upstream on the wetland ecosystem have not been characterised mischke et al 2020 the montane rivers and lakes of ca characterised by low water temperatures low channel stability and low solute concentrations but high sediment flux during the high flow period have low productivity and apparent low biological diversity mitrofanov and petr 1999 savvaitova and petr 1999 there is little data about the aquatic ecology in the high mountains and therefore the true biodiversity is poorly described as well as the ways in which it can be affected by changes in climate glaciers and hwq in comparison to the aquatic ecosystems elsewhere the aquatic organisms likely to be present are predominantly benthic biofilms bryophytes and invertebrates these are likely sensitive to change in water temperature and flow regime brown et al 2015 meyer et al 1999 wilhelm et al 2013 woodward et al 2010 water acidity and solute concentrations loayza muro et al 2014 milner et al 2017 overall the effects of deglaciation on aquatic biodiversity may be secondary to the detrimental impacts caused by the introduction of new species construction of reservoirs and other catchment modifications and downstream by the return of saline irrigation water mitrofanov and petr 1999 savvaitova and petr 1999 however in the high elevation environments such as the cold water lakes in the pamir which provide refuge for the endemic species the impacts of deglaciation are likely of primary importance further data on aquatic biodiversity across all trophic levels is needed to better understand biogeochemical cycling and the effects of hydrological changes caused by deglaciation 6 concluding remarks this paper reviewed the state of knowledge and the main challenges in research on the hwq in ca related to the present state of the glacierized catchments the identified questions can be resolved if the hwq and the processes regulating it are understood along the elevation continuum from glaciers to the arid plains at present the state of water quality in ca appears to comply with the national and international standards except the shallow groundwater and specific pollution hotspots these areas are related to the discharge of water used in irrigation and poor sewage treatment although there is often a discrepancy between studies it is not clear if the status quo can be maintained in the future when peak water passes and glaciers become unable to sustain river flow at its current rate currently there are no reliable studies answering this question water quality modelling can provide future scenarios and inform adaptation but water quality data are required and this is either lacking or not accessible there are significant differences in levels of economic development and in river protection strategies between the ca countries water quality problems appear to be more pressing in uzbekistan due to the large scale agricultural production but national expertise and involvement in international projects are substantial and improvements can be achieved through national projects strengthened by international collaboration water quality in the upstream tajikistan benefits more than in any other country from the effect of snow and glacier melt but restoration of monitoring network capacity building and improvements in sanitation are urgently needed importantly all considered basins are transboundary the international institutions lament on the lack of cooperation on water quality in ca evans et al 2012 rahaman and varis 2008 although recently there have been positive developments such as the establishment of the transboundary commissions concerned with water quality among other issues water quality is another dimension of transboundary water sharing in ca and is under explored not only the enhancement of national but joint bilateral and international monitoring and research leading to measures to improve water quality are recommended for ca credit authorship

8113,study region glacierized catchments in central asia study focus the literature on hydrochemistry and water quality was reviewed to identify gaps in knowledge required to understand and quantify the impacts of climate change and deglacierization new hydrological insights for the region the main knowledge gap was the characterization of hydrochemistry and water quality along the elevation continuum from glaciers to arid plains the chemical composition of snow and glacier ice are understood relatively well but the pathways of pollutants stored in glacier ice and released with melt into the aquatic systems are not researched there is a lack of publications on the release of organic carbon following deglacierization and element leaching from the exposed substrate permafrost and rock glaciers snow and glacial melt dilutes pollutants along the river channels reducing concentrations and mostly ensuring the compliance with water quality standards including downstream locations poor surface water quality is associated with irrigation the practice of soil washing and discharge of the untreated sewage there is a notable lack of information about the links between snow and glacier melt aquifer recharge and groundwater quality and this is a major gap in knowledge affecting environmental and health protection better understanding and quantification of factors and processes controlling hydrochemistry and water quality is needed to adapt to the impacts of the imminent deglacierization graphical abstract ga1 keywords glaciers mountains arid regionswater quality hydrochemistry central asia endorheic basins 1 introduction recently research has been done to understand and quantify the impact of glacier shrinkage on the global water resource in terms of water quantity but the downstream impact on stream hydrochemistry and water quality remains poorly understood especially in central asia ca karthe et al 2017 milner et al 2017 rasul and molden 2019 the river catchments of ca are diverse and with headwaters in the glacierized mountains of the tien shan pamir and hindu kush the rivers flow from the mountain base across arid plains and terminate in endorheic water bodies or in deserts as all rivers are nourished by the mountain cryosphere the flow is vulnerable to climate change chen et al 2018 kaser et al 2010 reyer et al 2017 sorg et al 2012

in land use and land cover and agricultural water demand on water resources were considered barrett et al 2017 hamidov et al 2020 z li et al 2020a qi et al 2019 zhang and ren 2017 zhou et al 2015 few studies however focused on the effects of climate change and continuing de glaciation on hydrochemistry and water quality hwq although these impacts were highlighted as important by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc special report on the ocean and cryosphere in a changing climate srocc hock et al 2019 changes in mountain hydrochemistry relate to wider environmental change in particular the deposition of pollutants transported in the atmosphere and those leaching from the substrate as glaciers and permafrost melt the importance of water quality reflects a basic need for clean water for human consumption and health of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as specified by the united nations sustainable development goals sdg united nations 2015 the sdg 6 clean water and sanitation for all is one of the most relevant for ca here the montane ecosystems are sensitized to small changes in climate because they affect the main source of water the cryosphere kaser

2003 the large scale agricultural production relies on irrigation which consumes vast amounts of water and returns contaminants to the environment micklin 2007 balance and pant 2003 a better understanding of the links between the glacierized mountains and the arid lowlands connected by rivers is required to improve integrated catchment management and to help adapt to future changes in climate cryosphere and land use and management the aim of this paper is to develop and report the current understanding of the hwq from source to sink along the mountain to lowland continuum in ca to achieve this journal articles and reports written in a range of languages have been synthesized particular attention was given to the quality of the data in the assessed publications we selected studies based on longer term monitoring and shorter term studies that provided full descriptions of the data collection and analysis thereby enabling a critical evaluation of data quality not all local studies comply with these criteria and those which do not have not been included in the review those studies which have been included use different ways of reporting measurements in order to make them comparable nutrient concentrations were converted no3 to no3 n and po4 3 to po4 p the following conversion coefficients were applied no3 ion form was divided by 4 427 to convert to n and po4 3 ion form is multiplied by 0 3261 to convert to p https support hach com following this synthesis we reflect on the water quality issues in the region and what the next research and management steps might be to help protect and improve the quality of the ca water resource the emphasis is on understanding the controls on hwq in five key transboundary glacierized catchments located in south eastern kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan tajikistan and north western china all of which drain glaciers and terminate in endorheic lakes and deserts fig 1 table s1 we exclude turkmenistan and central and northern kazakhstan because these regions have different river regimes and discussion of other regions of high mountain asia because of the different socio economic characteristics we define hydrochemistry as the chemical composition of water resulting from natural physical chemical and biological processes and use the term water quality to characterize the state of water properties and constituents evaluated against standards and criteria of suitability for human use and ecosystem function the review begins with a consideration of the chemical composition of and contaminants found in snow and glacier ice the observed impacts of glacier retreat through weathering of the exposed bedrock and release of legacy pollutants on stream hwq are considered followed by consideration of hwq at the mountain base and on the plains the paper concludes with a perspective on the science needed to address the most pressing knowledge gaps and recommends directions for research and management 2 the study region the general aspects of the environment of ca which affect hwq e g geology climate and soils are described in detail elsewhere shahgedanova 2002a see also table s1 and fig s1 with key aspects drawn into the discussion in this paper across the region seasonal snow and glacier melt are the main components of river runoff in the amu darya and syr darya these components account for approximately 70 and 80 of annual runoff respectively snow melt dominates accounting for 89 and 65 of the total melt component in the two catchments djumaboev et al 2019 river flow has a strong seasonal cycle with maximum in summer due to the snow melt in may june and glacier ice melt in july august fig s2 although the peak may be less pronounced in the lower reaches because of the water abstraction grill et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2012 most rivers of ca are managed major settlements and industrial activity are concentrated at the mountain base and large scale arable agriculture extends onto the arid plains fig 2 arable land accounts for 5 10 of the basin areas table s1 and irrigation is the main water consumer especially in uzbekistan where water withdrawal exceed that in other post soviet ca countries discussed in this paper by an order of magnitude balance and pant 2003 wheat is grown to help ensure national food security in each catchment and nation the main cash crop is cotton particularly in the amu darya syr darya and tarim catchments where fertilizer and pesticide use is common crosa et al 2006a snow et al 2020 törnqvist et al 2011 tang et al 2021 estimated that kazakhstan and uzbekistan are among the top 10 countries that are at the highest risk from pesticide pollution globally and the threat is equally high in the tarim basin the application of other fertilizers declined in the region in the 1990 s but began to increase again in the 2010 s exceeding the 1990 s level in uzbekistan fig s3 across post soviet ca irrigation systems are basic predominantly furrow and not well maintained barrett et al 2017 xenarios et al 2019 water is delivered by a system of open canals from rivers but in the vicinity of large cities treated water is used mamadiyarov et al 2015 on the plains of ca soils are naturally saline due to evapoconcentration yapiyev et al 2018 zamotaev 2002 irrigation enhances salinization which affects approximately 47 of irrigated land across post soviet ca hamidov et al 2016 to mitigate this problem the practice of soil washing is widely applied the returned water is accumulated in collectors and discharged into the river systems groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 natural lakes are also used as collectors of returned water orlovsky et al 2012 severskiy 2004 in the post soviet ca the extent of irrigated land peaked in the 1970 1980 s thevs et al 2017 xenarios et al 2019 in the chinese sector of the ile basin irrigated land nearly doubled between the 1970 s and 2010 s thevs et al 2017 and increased by a factor of three in the hyper arid tarim basin since the 1990 s with a similar increase in water consumption li et al 2020b thevs 2011 heavy industry especially mining and metallurgy have been

pathways from glaciers to deserts 3 1 the hydrochemistry of glacier snow and ice the solute chemistry of glacier snow and ice has been studied in ca since the 1960 s blagoobrazov 1969 blinova 1962 fedulov 1971 kamalov 1975 vilesov and shabanov 1971 vilesov et al 1980 this knowledge has been significantly enhanced by studies of ice cores obtained from high elevation glaciers providing a pollution history dating back to the 1900 s grigholm et al 2016 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 wake et al 1990 zhao et al 2011 in all high elevation regions the composition of snow and ice depends on atmospheric deposition kang et al 2019 the ca glaciers are located in proximity to sources of desert dust which typically form on abandoned agricultural land or dry lake and river beds nobakht et al 2021 the glaciers are also close to large cities and industrial centres with poor air quality and high black carbon bc emissions shahgedanova 2002b shahgedanova and burt 1994 as well as close to the extensive agricultural areas where fertilizers pesticides and herbicides are used the mineral dust and bc deposited on snow and glaciers are the light absorbing impurities lai which enhance snow and ice melt painter et al 2012 they are also transport vectors for other pollutants kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 aizen et al 2004 schmale et al 2017 pollutants accumulated in the glacial ice and snowpack have the potential to be released decades or centuries later hence the term legacy pollutants is used here with potential adverse impacts on the headwater streams which are typically characterized by low solute concentrations and therefore may be highly sensitive to change there is general agreement that the deposition of mineral dust defines the ionic composition of snow and ice in ca kang et al 2019 schmale et al 2017 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 zhao et al 2011 the early studies of snow and ice chemistry of the tuyuksy and fedchenko glaciers in the ile alatau northern tien shan and pamir respectively showed that the chemistry was dominated by hco3 and ca2 relative to so4 2 mg2 and cl due to the deposition of the calcite dust blinova 1962 the predominance of ca2 and hco3 was reported for the inylchek glacier in the central tien shan aizen et al 2004 kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 and for the abramov glacier in the pamir alay hinkley et al 1997 albeit at lower concentrations than in the ile alatau because of the higher elevation and more remote locations of these glaciers similarly in the eastern tien shan the ionic composition of snow is enriched with crustal proxies such as ca2 and mg2 dong et al 2009 wake et al 1990 you et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however na concentrations in snow are high and a significant correlation of na with mg2 and cl suggests that the regional saline lakes are also a source of the deposited material dong et al 2009 debate continues about the relative importance of anthropogenic and natural sources of sulphate high so4 2 concentrations in the snowpack in the eastern tien shan have been attributed to industrial and urban sources rather than the gypsum rich desert dust wake et al 1990 zhang et al 2016 because there is a strong correlation between concentrations of sulphate particulate matter and unsaturated hydrocarbons all produced by coal burning lee et al 2003 in contrast in the same region high sulphate concentrations in precipitation were associated with desert dust williams et al 1992 similarly high sulphate concentrations in snow in the kunnes headwaters in the balkhash alakol basin fig 1 and on the inylchek glacier were associated with desert soils evaporate gypsum deposits and the dry lakes kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 fengqing et al 2002 elevated snow nitrate no3 and ammonium nh4 concentrations were measured on glaciers in the eastern tien shan located close to populated areas zhang et al 2016 the summer nh4 concentration peaks in ice cores from the inylchek glacier and from a remote muztaga glacier in the eastern pamir were reported and related to agricultural activities particularly to fertilizer application kreutz and sholkovitz 2000 aizen et al 2004 zhao et al 2011 an increase in so4 2 and no3 in glacier ice observed since the 1970 s has been attributed to growing anthropogenic emissions in the soviet union in the 1970 s and in china in the 1990 s zhao et al 2011 trace metals have been found in snow and ice the trace elements mn ti sn cs in dust deposited on the snowpack in the ile alatau near the city of almaty fig 1 glazovsky and glazovsky 1982 and al and fe in the ürümqi glacier n1 in the eastern tien shan zhongqin et al 2007 are thought of lithogenic origin concentrations of other trace elements including pb ni sn cr cd cu and zn were measured in these and other glaciers and attributed to anthropogenic sources including industrial production and the use of leaded petrol the pb concentrations averaging 2 4 ng g 1 cd and zn measured in the ürümqi glacier n1 exceeded concentrations reported for the himalayas and the european alps by approximately a factor of 40 li et al 2007 an increase in cd sb bi tl sn and pb concentrations has been observed since the 1950 s in the miaoergou glacier in the eastern tien shan liu et al 2011 both glaciers are in relative proximity to urban sources however in the remote muztaga glacier sb bi and pb concentrations increased too between the 1950 1970 s and the 1990 s corresponding with growing industrial production in the soviet union and china respectively li et al 2006 the ice core measurements from the inylchek glacier extending from 1908 to 1995 also showed that pb cd and cu concentrations increased between the 1950 s and 1980 s in line with industrial growth in kazakhstan and uzbekistan following a decline in the early 1990 s the concentrations began to increase again reflecting industrial growth in china and a widespread use of fertilizers herbicides and fungicides which contain cu in the tarim basin grigholm et al 2016 the chemical composition of glacial melt depends upon natural factors including lithology glacier morphology climate drainage pathways and biological activity tranter 2003 the legacy pollutants which are deposited on glaciers and preserved in ice enter the hydrological system as glaciers retreat and can contaminate the aquatic systems if toxic metals e g mercury or persistent organic pollutants pops are released bogdal et al 2009 in melting glaciers the leaching process is complex because meltwater percolation can be stopped by layers of superimposed ice leading to the preservation of ions which are removed by runoff only during intensive melt lee et al 2003 there is evidence of water contamination by legacy pollutants in the european alps bettinetti et al 2008 bogdal et al 2009 tibet chen et al 2019 and alaska miner et al 2019 but there are very few studies in ca with which to draw comparison measurements at the ürümqi glacier n1 showed that trace metal concentrations in snow increased in winter with a secondary maximum in spring when dust deposition peaks the trace metals were leached from the melting snowpack in july and august li et al 2007 concentrations of pb and cd remained high for a relatively short period of time but their rapid removal aided by elution implied that they were transported to the mountain streams with the onset of seasonal melt potentially affecting aquatic ecosystems the removal of other elements form the melting snow and ice was studied to a limited extent too you et al 2015 showed that of all ions no3 was the most mobile followed by so4 2 while other species including nh4 had a higher residence time overall there is a good understanding of soluble chemistry of snow and ice growing information about trace metals but little data on how these chemicals enter the hydrological system and what impact they make on river hwq there is a notable lack of data on other pollutants such as pops or emergent contaminants e g microplastics 3 2 stream water hydrochemistry from the glacial headwaters to the mountain base the spatial variability of ion concentrations in the glacierized headwaters is primarily related to the predominant lithology the relative contributions of snow and glacier melt to runoff are important but second order factors dobroumov 1973 tranter 2003 anderson 2007 the ion concentrations in the stream water at high elevations are usually low because of the low weathering rates of the resistant lithologies which form the mountain chains the order of anions and cations is a function of the predominant lithology weathering kinetics and transport mechanisms calcium is the predominant cation in glacial melt due to its rapid dissolution kinetics and carbonate dissolution and sulfide oxidation are the most typical chemical weathering mechanisms tranter et al 2002 tranter 2003 bicarbonates are often the predominant anions where basic rocks are present anderson 2007 in the glacial headwater catchments of ca the orders in terms of concentration are hco3 so4 2 cl and ca2 mg2 na k these orders are observed in the kishi and ulken almaty in kazakhstan romanova et al 2016 chu talas dobroumov 1973 ma et al 2020 and naryn ma et al 2019 rivers in kyrgyzstan and the kafarnihon in tajikistan finaev et al 2017 although the carbonate lithology dominates in the upstream ile catchment in china evaporate dissolution and carbonate weathering have an approximately equal effect c 40 on the river water ionic composition zhu et al 2013 in contrast in the hyper arid tarim basin evaporate dissolution dominates over carbonate weathering here na and cl sourced from halite dissolution and so4 2 can be high even in the headwaters xiao et al 2012 in the glacierized catchments weathering of suspended and dissolved solids is highest at the peak of meltwater production the large runoff volumes ensure that glacial meltwater is usually very diluted and concentrations of chemicals are low however high flow see fig s2 enables transportation of large loads and fluxes of solutes and sediment during the glacier melt period tranter 2003 the literature on seasonal variations in the ion fluxes in stream water in ca is limited but in agreement the fluxes are related to seasonal melt and the associated variations in discharge in the catchments where the contribution of glacier ice melt to runoff is high ion discharge peaks in summer in line with the maximum in river discharge fig s2 in the larger catchments where glacierization is lower and snow melt dominates a spring peak in ion discharge is typical suggesting a diffuse input of weathered material for example in the kishi almaty and ulken almaty rivers which drain small catchments with high glacierization in the ile alatau shahgedanova et al 2018 approximately 50 and 30 of the total annual solute flux are transported in summer and autumn respectively with a smaller proportion accounted for by the snow melt contribution in spring romanova et al 2016 the ion flux in the middle courses of the river talas peaks in june in the river chu which has much larger catchment where snow melt dominates the ion flux peaks in spring 60 followed by winter 25 summer 10 and autumn 5 dobroumov 1973 despite the dominance of snow melt in runoff glacier melt affects the stream hydrochemistry of the headwater catchments in specific ways glacial runoff is rich in fine sediment known as glacier flour which gives the runoff its clouded appearance glaciers are important exporters of dissolved organic carbon doc and nitrogen milner et al 2017 mountain glaciers especially those in the middle and low latitudes are known to store and release organic carbon to streams and the export is expected to increase as glaciers melt and retreat hood et al 2015 carbon is leached from the till and from englacial and supraglacial ecosystems supported by cryoconite cook et al 2016 glacial melt keeps the downstream water temperature low which in turn reduces primary productivity and slows organic matter decay kneib et al 2020 these effects were studied in the european alps north america and the arctic anderson 2007 tranter 2003 but there is little data on nitrogen and carbon cycling in ca recent studies published for the chinese tien shan gao et al 2020 li et al 2018 liu et al 2016 on carbon export show that area weighted carbon fluxes are higher than in alaska and european alps li et al 2018 and exceed previous estimates hood et al 2015 the melt of permafrost and sub moraine and rock glacier ice contributes to an increase in ion flux colombo et al 2018 in other glacierized regions solute leaching in permafrost areas has been observed to have two seasonal peaks the first when acidic snowmelt flushes soil horizons and a second in late summer early autumn when melt is released from deeper mineralized horizons as the ground warms colombo et al 2018 melting permafrost can increase inorganic n p and si export as well as that of major ions e g ca2 mg2 so4 2 and trace elements e g ni mn al hg pb colombo et al 2018 and it has been suggested that total dissolved solids tds concentrations in the runoff from rock glaciers are higher than in glacial runoff this is because the extensive mineral surface area ice contact in rock glaciers promotes chemical weathering which in turn leads to solute enrichment of water contained within and downstream rock glaciers jones et al 2019 however there are insufficient studies to draw firm conclusions anywhere and there are no studies of impacts of permafrost and rock glacier melt on hydrochemistry in ca although industrial activities are usually limited at high elevations gold mining at the kumtor glacier in the akshiirak massif kyrgyzstan gained notoriety horrocks taylor 2018 its impacts on the local surface water and hwq of the river naryn were found to increase concentrations of iron aluminium lead and manganese in the local surface waters during the warm season when mining activities intensify abduvaliyev and khudaybergenova 2016 however concentrations of pollutants in the naryn itself remain low due to the high summer runoff and melt water dilution currently there are very few hwq measurements in the mountains there is knowledge about fluxes of major ions in river channels from the studies conducted in the 1970 1980 s however there is little or no information about changes in hwq related to glacier melt and retreat e g release of legacy pollutants melt of rock glaciers and permafrost notably in terms of carbon fluxes and interactions between meltwater and groundwater hwq 3 3 stream water hydrochemistry from the foothills to the lowland plains there is a consensus in the literature that in all studied catchments in ca ion concentrations in stream water increase along the mountain to plains stream continuum the number of studies whilst detailed in their analyses is low and most are short term moving downstream inputs from industrial urban and agricultural sources increase fig 2 as does evaporation fig s2d in the lowlands aridity and sparse vegetation lead to the high evaporation from soil and open water driving evapoconcentration yapiyev et al 2017 fig s1 thus the salinity of surface and groundwater and land salinization are the major problems in ca hamidov et al 2016 overall the river water quality in ca is mostly within national and international standards table s2 but there are localised instances of poor water quality the water pollution hot spots are attributed to the return of the agricultural wastewater the practice of soil washing especially in the aral sea basin and chu talas catchment and to urban and industrial sources chu talas commission 2018 crosa et al 2006a 2006b groll et al 2015 for example the river zerafshan flows for 870 km through predominantly natural landscapes in tajikistan and then through farmland and industrial areas in uzbekistan where approximately 60 of the flow is used for irrigation ultimately limiting flow into the amu darya groll et al 2015 within the zerafshan the tds concentrations range between 160 and 190 mg l 1 in the tajik sector increase to 240 mg l 1 at the uzbek border and then to 1800 mg l 1 at the outflow significantly exceeding national standards and the who threshold of water potability table s2 groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 similarly in the river chu whose watercourse exceeds 1200 km tds concentrations increase from 30 mg l 1 in the mountains to 900 mg l 1 in the middle course and to 2500 mg l 1 in the lower reaches in the desert dobroumov 1973 the return of irrigation water to the river ile in the balkhash alakol basin and its tributaries significantly increases the solute concentrations aidarov 2006 some crops e g many vegetables and fruits are sensitive to water salinity and have reduced yields when irrigated with water high in tds the irrigation water requirements for some crops for tds may be lower than a common threshold for drinking water of 1 g l 1 ayers and westcot 1985 the prevalence of sodium and sulphate in the stream water is typical of ca plains due to high evaporation fig s2d however high sodium and sulphate concentrations in the zerafshan are attributed to industrial and urban sources and high chloride to the inflow of the returned irrigation water crosa et al 2006b olsson et al 2012 2013 very high nitrate and phosphate concentrations reaching 56 mg n l 1 and 57 mg p l 1 respectively were reported in the irrigation water returned to the zerafshan here and thereafter values have been converted from no3 and po4 3 are used see introduction for conversion factors however nitrate concentrations in its stream water were predominantly in the range of 5 65 11 30 mg no 3 n l 1 only occasionally exceeding national and who thresholds groll et al 2015 table s2 since the 1990 s there is evidence of some water quality improvements evidenced by declines in chloride calcium nitrate and phosphorous concentrations and in chemical oxygen demand cod in the zerafshan groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 most likely due to decline of industrial and agricultural production and use of fertilizers in the last decade of the 1990 s especially in tajikistan fig s3 however this observation is not ubiquitous in ca in the kazakhstani part of the ile catchment whilst nitrate concentrations are low 0 23 0 45 mg n l 1 detectible concentrations of pesticides in returned irrigation water have been reported aidarov 2006 in the lower reaches of the talas downstream of the town of taraz nitrate concentrations have increased from 0 01 to 1 13 mg no3 n l 1 in the 1960 70 s to 1 58 2 94 mg no3 n l 1 in 2000 2014 whilst phosphate concentrations did not exceed 0 12 p mg l 1 in the 1960 70 s with no data reported for 2000 2014 dobroumov 1973 chu talas commission 2018 in the chu talas basin nitrate concentrations in river water have also increased since the 1960 s though lower biological oxygen demand bod concentrations were reported suggesting an increase in fertiliser leaching and better sewage treatment ibid it should be noted however that the data were generated by two measurement campaigns and inhomogeneity in the data can affect the comparison in the amu darya phosphorus concentrations are higher in small towns upstream of the major agricultural areas and are inversely related to discharge lobanova and didovets 2019 this suggests point source contamination with sewage conversely there is a positive correlation between nitrate concentrations and flow at the same locations suggesting diffuse nitrogen inputs the phosphorus concentrations in the kazakhstani downstream section of the syr darya did not change significantly between the 1970 s and 2000 s amirgaliyev 2007 with concentrations ranging from 0 001 to 0 009 mg p l 1 in the 1971 1978 period and from 0 002 to 0 012 mg p l 1 in the 1993 2000 period nitrate was reported to range from 0 07 to 4 1 mg n l 1 and from 2 3 to 6 0 mg n l 1 in the same periods these concentrations are within the national water quality standards table s2 though there has been a gradual increase in nitrate and ammonium after 2000 following an increase in agricultural production amirgaliyev 2007 fig s3 downstream from the urban and industrial centres such as samarkand kattakurgan and navoi in uzbekistan where water used for municipal and industrial needs is discharged water in the zerafshan is characterised by high cod indicating large amounts of organic waste consuming oxygen and increasing phosphorous inputs groll et al 2015 in the kazakhstani sector of the balkhash alakol basin municipal sources are important too as only approximately 20 of sewage is treated biologically aidarov 2006 municipal wastewater discharge in urban areas is considered as a major source of pollution in the chu catchment together with irrigation and soil washing chu talas commission 2018 in contrast the contribution of municipal sources to tds in the amu darya water was insignificant relative to the impacts of irrigation activities crosa et al 2006a studies that examined seasonal variations in tds nitrate and phosphate concentrations report a minimum in summer and a maximum in january to march in the zerafshan groll et al 2015 olsson et al 2013 and a primary maximum in march april and a secondary maximum in october november in the amu darya and its other tributaries crosa et al 2006a lobanova and didovets 2019 the extended periods of the elevated tds concentrations observed in the lower reaches of these rivers were attributed to the return of the irrigation wastewater and to soil washing importantly the low tds concentrations correlating with the summer peak in river discharge caused by the snow and ice melt in the headwaters were reported for the lower reaches of the amu darya showing that the dilution effect extends along the course of this major ca river far from the glaciers crosa et al 2006a the tds concentrations increased in years with low discharge while in years of high discharge caused by the enhanced melt in warmer summers water quality improved through dilution in the talas chu and syr darya amirgaliyev 2007 chu talas commission 2018 lobanova and didovets 2019 the influence of the meltwater on the stream water quality in the lower reaches of the main channels was evident as well as the difference between the tributaries that do and do not drain glaciers to conclude water quality remains mostly within national and who standards in the main river channels due to the dilution effect associated with snow and glacier melt there are hot spots of pollution associated with soil washing discharge of irrigation water sewage and water used in industrial production although the latter is discussed to a lesser extent in literature perhaps the main identified gap is a lack of long term measurements made using consistent methods supported by more frequent sampling to characterise extreme low and high concentrations and the corresponding flow conditions 3 4 lakes and reservoirs as buffers of water quality extremes and contaminant sinks the hwq of six major lakes is discussed in literature including the high elevation lakes issyk kul and bosten and the low elevation aral sea and lakes balkhash alakol and sarygamysh but not for the smaller lakes fig 1 artificial reservoirs are built both in the mountains for hydropower and on the plains to supply water for irrigation and municipal use the hwq of the former is not examined in the published literature the information about the latter is limited although the lowland reservoirs are often used as fisheries and their water quality is subject to regulation in general reservoirs reduce both seasonal and interannual variability in ion concentrations burlibayev et al 2007 for example following the filling of the kapshagay reservoir kazakhstan in the 1980 s the annual variation in tds concentrations in the downstream section of the ile declined from approximately 400 mg l 1 to 150 mg l 1 and tds concentrations became almost independent of the runoff burlibayev et al 2007 the issyk kul is the largest high altitude lake in ca fig 1 table s3 and the most researched both arable and pastoral farming are practiced in its catchment and importantly the issyk kul is a major centre for recreation and tourism koronkevich 2002 glacial runoff accounts for 14 of the total runoff received by the issyk kul sorg et al 2012 however rivers in the issyk kul basin have higher tds concentrations than the glacier fed rivers elsewhere because of a considerable proportion of subsurface flow dobroumov 1973 lyons et al 2001 asankulov et al 2019 during the high flow period tds ranges between 75 and 200 mg l 1 increasing to 100 300 mg l 1 in winter dobroumov 1973 the issyk kul itself is brackish with salinity of approximately 6 g l 1 asankulov et al 2019 lyons et al 2001 the river chemistry is dominated by ca2 and hco3 but the concentrations are low in the lake water which is strongly influenced by evapoconcentration and calcium precipitation from the water column saturated with carbonates asankulov et al 2019 kawabata et al 2014 lyons et al 2001 savvaitova and petr 1992 the ion composition of the issyk kul water is similar to that of the aral and caspian seas despite its high elevation this is because all three lakes accumulate salts in a similar way through evapoconcentration the groundwater inputs are high approximately 40 of the inflow to the issyk kul the groundwater seepage is low and there is no surface outflow the issyk kul is oligotrophic and the vertical distribution of nutrients including nitrate phosphate silicate and the major cations are uniform to the depth of approximately 80 90 m savvaitova and petr 1992 kawabata et al 2014 the lake water is well oxygenated with an alkaline ph of 7 9 asankulov et al 2019 dobroumov 1973 savvaitova and petr 1992 the lake water is enriched in some trace elements v co cu mo u sr sb cs br f and li in comparison with the stream water but all concentrations comply with the national and who standards lyons et al 2001 lake bosten is one of the largest freshwater lakes in china fig 1 table s3 xiao et al 2015 receiving most of its inflow from the glacier fed kaidu river and losing water through evaporation and discharge to the kongque river yao et al 2018 positioned at a lower elevation than the issyk kul it provides water for irrigation and industry from 2003 2012 the lake level decreased by approximately 5 m but started to rise after 2013 yao et al 2018 the tds concentrations correlated inversely with water level changing from a minimum of 600 mg l 1 characteristic of freshwater in 1960 1900 mg l 1 in 1987 yao et al 2018 the discharge of wastewater used in irrigation and industrial production contributed to increase in lake water salinity yao et al 2018 exceedances of the chinese water quality standards in surface and groundwater for nitrate 10 mg n l 1 and sulphate 250 mg l 1 were reported xiao et al 2015 water quality in warm and shallow lakes located on the plains is likely to be most vulnerable to climate change malmaeus et al 2006 lakes balkhash and alakol fed by the rivers originating in the northern tien shan and jetisu junggar alatau are shallow and saline fig 1 table s3 in the balkhash salinity is higher in the east with tds concentration of about 2 4 g l 1 and lower in the west where prior to the construction of the kapshagay reservoir tds values were approximately 1000 1500 mg l 1 petr 1992 propastin 2012 abuduwaili et al 2019 this gradient is due to a division of the lake by the sary isek peninsula and the ile delivering most of the inflow in the west salinity of the lake increased in its western part following the construction of the kapshagay reservoir intercepting the ile and disconnecting from glacial melt fig 1 and now exceeds 2000 mg l 1 burlibayev et al 2007 mischke et al 2020 ion composition is dominated by cl so4 2 na and k the balkhash is affected by the inflow of irrigation wastewater discharged in the ile and pesticides such as ddt metabolites have been observed elevated concentrations of metals particularly copper and zinc and petroleum products were found in the lake water exceeding the national standards and attributed to the industrial facilities including copper smelting on its shores burlibayev et al 2007 the hwq of the alakol basin and its impacts on the health of the lake s ecosystem were systematically researched by amirgaliyev et al 2007 between 1988 and 2004 the mountain rivers flowing into lake alakol are characterized by strong seasonal variability in tds with the sum of major ions ranging from 200 to 800 mg l 1 dominated by hco3 and ca2 amirgaliyev et al 2007 the water of the alakol itself is brackish with mean long term salinity of approximately 7 4 g l 1 and relatively small interannual variability of tds so4 2 na and k dominate the ionic composition amirgaliyev et al 2007 the local rivers are contaminated by ni co zn and cu due to the agricultural activities concentrations of organochlorine pesticides such as lindane and ddt metabolites peaked between 1991 and 1993 and although the use of pesticides declined afterwards they are still detected in the water bodies sediments and fish in the alakol basin amirgaliyev et al 2007 lake sarygamysh fig 1 has become progressively salinized though in the past the lake was fed by the amu darya and was fresh micklin et al 2007 orlovsky et al 2012 in 1548 british travellers reported that water in the lake from which the uzboy originates was fresh and sweet orlovsky et al 2012 later the sarygamsyh became progressively salinized following the migration of the amu darya channel towards the aral sea in the 1950 s the sarygamysh nearly dried and consisted of several small lakes with water salinity reaching 300 g l 1 but was subsequently turned into a collector of wastewater used in irrigation and for soil washing severskiy 2004 orlovsky et al 2012 currently water salinity is about 11 g l 1 and cl so4 2 and na dominate accounting for about 80 of tds suggesting the strong impact of evapoconcentration orlovsky et al 2012 importantly the absence of phosphates and low concentrations of nitrate were reported both in the lake water about 0 68 mg n l 1 and in irrigation discharge 0 68 1 58 mg n l 1 orlovsky et al 2012 however pesticides such as lindane and ddt were found in the sarygamysh water pavlovskaya 1995 the dry exposed bed of the sarygamysh is one of the main sources of desert dust in ca nobakht et al 2021 and there is a danger that pollutants contained in the sediments may be transported to the regional glaciers the aral sea is the largest internal lake in ca and degradation of its environment has been discussed in multiple publications micklin 2007 middleton 2002 severskiy 2004 the withdrawal of water for irrigation primarily for growing cotton during the soviet period resulted in a decline of the amu darya and sur darya runoff to the aral from 56 km3 in the 1960 s to 5 km3 in 1980 s micklin 2016 leading to the desiccation of the aral its area declined from 67 499 km2 in 1960 39 734 km2 in 1989 micklin 2016 currently the aral consists of two main residual basins the large south aral and the small north aral fig 1 which have different physical chemical and biological characteristics izhitskiy et al 2016 the small north aral located in kazakhstan is in fact a reservoir regulated by the kok aral dam built in 2005 micklin 2016 its hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics are similar to those of the former aral before desiccation with salinity about 12 g kg 1 allowing some ecological restoration the highest salinity of about 130 g kg 1 is observed in the western part of the large south aral which its largest and hypersaline residual basin izhitskiy et al 2016 rzymski et al 2019 reported that concentrations of arsenic exceed the who threshold for drinking water table s2 in the small aral and in the lower reaches of the syr darya the high as content in the water bodies of the aral sea region is attributed to both natural underground leaching see fig 3 and anthropogenic contamination podgorski and berg 2020 rzymski et al 2019 törnqvist et al 2011 concentrations of copper nickel and lead exceed the who recommendations in the lower reaches of the amu darya delta and the adjacent part of the large aral törnqvist et al 2011 analysis of lacustrine sediment cores from the small aral showed that increase in concentrations of these and other e g cr co cd metals increased dramatically around 1970 implicating human activities w liu et al 2020a similarly to the sedimentary records obtained from lakes ebinur ma et al 2016 bosten w liu et al 2020b and chaiwapu ma et al 2013 in north western china the measured concentrations however suggest that these pollutants represent medium risk to the aral sea ecosystem except for cd which represents a significant risk w liu et al 2020a this issue is explored further in section 5 3 intermittent water quality measurements were reported for the two main lowland reservoirs the kapshagay in the balkhash alakol basin and the shardara on the syr darya kazakhstan fig 1 in the shardara nutrient concentrations were found to be low but the presence of the organochlorine pesticides and concentrations of zn cd cu pb exceeding the national water quality standards for fisheries table s2 were reported for 2015 barinova et al 2017 snow et al 2020 to conclude lake water quality varies being understandably worse in the terminal lakes which receive industrial and irrigation wastewater and where water abstraction is high data are available predominantly for large lakes and lowland reservoirs while little is published about hwq of small lakes and mountain reservoirs despite the fact that construction of reservoirs is expanding predominantly in china but also in the post soviet ca this is an important gap in knowledge because pesticides and heavy metals may accumulate in these water bodies and hwq in lowland lakes where evapoconcentration dominates can deteriorate quickly if river flow declines either due to glacier recession or water abstraction 4 groundwater surface water interaction and pollution in ca major groundwater basins which are often transboundary occur along the alluvial valleys of the rivers fig 3 the mountains are the main groundwater recharge areas and are characterized by a complex hydrogeology gafurov et al 2019 liu et al 2020 fig 3 in the arid lowlands local and shallow aquifers predominate often with saline groundwater fig 3 the hyper arid tarim and adjacent junggar and turpan are sedimentary basins with saline groundwater fig 1 3 although average population density is relatively low table s1 settlements including many large cities are located on aquifers in the foothills and oases increasing population density locally fig 3 the use of groundwater for potable water supply considerably increases pressure on water resources bishkek depends on groundwater almost fully morris et al 2006 while almaty and dushanbe obtain 60 and 50 of their drinking water from this source respectively finaev et al 2017 voxpopuli 2019 in the soviet union groundwater was considered a strategic resource and its use for drinking and irrigation was limited gafurov et al 2019 but more recently the groundwater use has increased in ca especially during dry years y liu et al 2020 the groundwater chemistry is different from that of the surface waters in several ways firstly the aquifers filter the turbid river water characterized by high sediment load improving its quality secondly the groundwater is typically enriched in solutes depending on the regional lithology relative to the surface waters thirdly the groundwater tends to accumulate higher contaminant concentrations in urban areas in particular nitrate concentrations of nitrate reach and sometimes exceed national and who threshold of 10 11 3 mg no 3 l 1 table s2 in local shallow groundwater wells in dushanbe and bishkek in summer months yapiyev et al 2020 snow and glacier melt ensures high groundwater flow and flushes the aquifers to some extent particularly in the upstream sections morris et al 2006 somers and mckenzie 2020 although interactions between snow and glacier melt aquifer recharge and quality of groundwater were not studied in ca changes in the groundwater hwq with elevation resemble those of the surface water in the lowlands salinity is a major problem fig 3 gafurov et al 2019 y liu et al 2020 in the aral sea basin better groundwater quality was reported in the upper than in the downstream sections of the amu darya and syr darya catchments gafurov et al 2019 in the upstream catchments the ionic composition of groundwater was dominated by carbonates and calcium ions similar to the surface waters while closer to the aral sea the groundwater was saline with elevated chloride and sulphate concentrations fig 3 rakhmatullaev et al 2009 and gafurov et al 2019 related salinity of groundwater to salinization of soils while less than 10 of land in the upper amu darya basin is saline 95 of soils are saline or very saline in its lower reaches changes in irrigation practices e g switching for furrow to drip irrigation can help not only save water but also reduce salinization of soils surface and underground water the extent of soil contamination by potential toxic elements and pops is not well researched but it may impact both surface and groundwater quality a recently published study on potential toxic elements in soils in kazakhstan by guney et al 2020 identified elevated as cd ni in two points in chu and talas basins overall groundwater chemistry and quality is one of the major knowledge gaps in ca and in particular very little is known about groundwater hwq in the mountains 5 a perspective on future hydrochemistry and water quality research requirements in central asia 5 1 the current state of knowledge and the identified gaps in this paper we have reviewed the current knowledge about the hwq along the mountain to lowland continuum in ca the amount and quality of the information and level of understanding vary between issues regions and elevation zones the available knowledge and the main gaps are summarized in table 1 however the largest gap is the lack understanding of cycling of pollutants and changes in the hwq along the whole elevation continuum from the glacierized source regions to sinks in the arid lowlands fig 2 the best researched aspect of the hwq is the solute chemistry of mountain snow and ice multiple studies are in agreement about its relationship to the atmospheric deposition and the important role of desert dust there is growing information about concentrations of sulphate nitrate ammonium and metals but no consensus on how these relate to dust sources and emissions from the combustion of fossil fuel and agriculture the use of pesticides and herbicides in ca was and in some regions still is widespread tang et al 2021 the major sources of mineral dust in ca are associated with the abandoned arable land and sinks of water used in agriculture nobakht et al 2021 the atmospheric transport of pop with mineral dust entrained from these areas and its accumulation in the high elevation zone is implied e g snow et al 2020 but never proven as pop measurements in the uplands are unavailable it is widely known that glaciers can support microbial food webs and that they store organic carbon from local and distant sources and release it in the downstream environments as they melt hood et al 2015 wadham et al 2019 the microbial food webs have not been researched in the region there are very few studies of carbon export possibly because the ca basins are not connected to the world ocean although they do support lacustrine environments li et al 2017 overall there are only a few studies considering how any chemicals enter the hydrological system following snow and glacier melt e g you et al 2015 zhongqin et al 2007 and there are no assessments of their impacts on stream water hwq there is no understanding of biogeochemical cycling between the glacierized aquatic and terrestrial lowland ecosystems there is also no consideration of whether glacier retreat and permafrost and rock glacier melt will promote solute leaching since the 1990 s most studies on snow and ice chemistry have been conducted by international teams in collaboration with regional scientists and glacier and hydrometeorological monitoring have been reinstated in the region barandun et al 2020 hoelzle et al 2019 therefore there is strong potential to address these challenges downstream the gaps in knowledge are due to the lack of access to the long term hwq data and contemporary higher frequency measurements table 1 in the post soviet ca monitoring of a large range of chemicals in surface water table s2 which began in the 1960 s is now performed by the national hydrometeorological agencies united nations economic commission for europe 2018 although the monitoring networks declined in the 1990 s samples are collected once per month from permanent sites and methods are consistent across the region in kazakhstan and uzbekistan the monitoring networks are more extensive and analyses are conducted in certified laboratories in kyrgyzstan and especially in tajikistan these are less advanced due to the funding constrains united nations economic commission for europe 2018 despite the long monitoring history until recently data access was limited and water quality was at best reported as exceedance of national standards the so called maximum allowable concentrations table s2 constraining scientific analysis most of the post 1990 literature is based on the data obtained in the short term projects with few studies analyzing changes in hwq over time and larger basins amirgaliyev 2007 crosa et al 2006a 2006b groll et al 2015 lobanova and didovets 2019 olsson et al 2013 as a result many local studies report conflicting findings and their independent evaluation is challenging because of the limited information about data quality recently actual data on concentrations of selected pollutants became publicly available from the state agencies in kazakhstan kazhydromet 2020 and kyrgyzstan kyrgyzhydromet 2020 albeit almost entirely for the plains data on the groundwater quality are not publicly available and are treated as classified restricted information y liu et al 2020 this is a significant limitation providing that while the use of this resource is increasing including the provision of potable water contamination of the shallow ground water bekturganov et al 2016 bosch et al 2007 morris et al 2006 nurtazin et al 2020 törnqvist et al 2011 yapiyev et al 2020 and salinization gafurov et al 2019 liu et al 2020 rakhmatullaev et al 2009 are reported by the few available studies further work is needed to better understand groundwater recharge rates and the surface water groundwater interactions that control the replenishment and flushing of the shallow aquifers around the cities used for drinking water and to understand the relative importance of groundwater and melt water contributions to lowland river flow water use and quality buytaert et al 2017 multiple dams and reservoirs in the mountains and on the plains are a characteristic feature of ca reservoirs modify runoff and work as bioreactors which store and transform sediments nutrients and contaminants travelling from upstream locations globally reservoirs have been observed to promote eutrophication and bury organic matter in sediments emitting nitrogen by denitrification processes maavara et al 2020 fig 2 the impacts of dams and reservoirs on the regional hwq are one of the biggest gaps in knowledge especially taking into account the extensive reservoir construction in china which already causes concerns about water quality in the ile basin because of the observed and predicted increase in water abstraction which in combination with a projected decline in glacial meltwater input kogutenko et al 2019 may result in a reduced dilution effect stone 2012 there is a significant potential for reservoir expansion in the mountains of kyrgyzstan and tajikistan to adapt to the continuing deglacierization farinotti et al 2019 while there is very little information in the published literature about hwq of the upland reservoirs 5 2 water quality at present and after the peak flow ca strongly depends on water provision from the mountains viviroli et al 2020 and more than any other region on glacier melt kaser et al 2010 currently high air temperatures and low precipitation in summer do not imply a lack of river flow because of the meltwater contribution and in many headwater catchments an increase in streamflow has been observed due to the intensifying glacier melt huss et al 2017 shahgedanova et al 2018 although the trends are often different in the downstream catchments affected by water abstraction grill et al 2019 immerzeel et al 2012 severskiy 2004 both snow and glacial melt maintain the dilution effect which peaks in the early and late summer respectively this ecosystem service sustains the acceptable water quality even in the lower reaches of large rivers such as the amu darya crosa et al 2006a lobanova and didovets 2019 despite a low proportion of the total catchment area occupied by glaciers and a large extent of agricultural land table s1 the decline in the use of fertilisers in the post soviet central asia especially in kazakhstan and tajikistan in the 1990 s fig s3 has helped to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the lowland farmed areas most studies point at the water pollution hotspots often associated with the degradation of sewage treatment systems bekturganov et al 2016 rather than persistent and widespread exceedance of the national and international standards the emphasis on pollution hotspots is an interesting contrast with the recent perspectives on the downstream impacts of glacier shrinkage which describe cascades of effects milner et al 2017 rasul and molden 2019 it was suggested that such cascades may affect various hwq variables for example dissolved organic carbon whereby carbon fluxes from montane sources e g retreating glaciers add to the inputs from lowland farmland and sewage however inputs from montane sources may be localised and subsequently diluted or by contrast concentrated when mixed with inputs from multiple tributaries especially in the lowlands whose hydrochemistry is very different from that of the mountains further work is needed to quantify the combined effects of multiple tributaries with different characteristics on the downstream hwq the peak of non renewable water released by the melt of glacier ice is expected in ca in the 2040 2050 s followed by a decline in glacier runoff huss and hock 2018 and streamflow immerzeel et al 2012 shahgedanova et al 2020 in the 2010 s the use of nitrogen fertilizers reached and exceeded its 1992 level in kazakhstan and uzbekistan respectively and the application of phosphates began to increase in all countries fig s3 given the ongoing economic recovery of the region the observed growth in the use of fertilisers is expected to continue especially in uzbekistan the juxtaposition of these trends is likely to have negative implications for hwq extensive effort in water quality modelling under the present and future climates is required to quantify the effects of the projected climatic and hydrological changes on the hwq of both surface and groundwater after the peak water there are no studies in ca in the absence of the long term reliable data of water quality in the glacierized catchments a recent systematic review of the literature on adaptation to impacts of climate change in the mountain catchments of ca published between 2013 and 2020 showed that none focused on water quality saidaliyeva et al 2021 5 3 implications for human health and ecosystems the need for knowledge about hwq is based on its importance for human and ecosystem health the aral sea crisis has put this issue on the national and international environmental agendas micklin 2007 but only limited understanding has been achieved for the region as a whole research focused primarily on the presence of pop and pathogenic microbes in the amu darya and its tributaries and in drinking water in the aral sea region water pollution in the amu darya delta was considered a low risk to health see section 3 4 although concentrations of the potentially toxic substances such as arsenic and pesticides exceeded the who guidelines in potable water from the ground wells törnqvist et al 2011 this was not the case in the aralsk region in kazakhstan although in this region pathogenic microbes were present in potable groundwater bosch et al 2007 conflicting results on the quality of potable groundwater were provided for the balkhash region bekturganov et al 2016 reported an increase in water borne diseases due to the poor drinking water treatment contamination during distribution and a frequent use of shallow groundwater which is often polluted by sewage however an extensive survey of drinking water quality in the rural area between the kapshagay reservoir and lake balkhash reported that overall potable water met national standards though microbial contamination was detected in wells nurtazin et al 2020 importantly the effects of water quality on human health depend on exposure and pathways of pollutants to human bodies research in the aral sea basin suggested that drinking water quality did not threaten human health directly rather pollutants including pesticides and toxic elements had different pathways e g through the consumption of food which did not comply with the health standards and inhalation of contaminated desert dust o hara et al 2000 jensen et al 1997 muntean et al 2003 crighton et al 2011 therefore a holistic approach to research of water quality on human health is required including different types of exposure and multiple pathways the deltas of large rivers in ca such as amu darya syr darya and ile are occupied by the vast wetlands connecting rivers to endorheic lakes the wetlands are biodiversity hotspots it is known that they are affected by salinization tesch and thevs 2020 however impacts of pollution caused by the discharge of water used for irrigation and municipal needs upstream on the wetland ecosystem have not been characterised mischke et al 2020 the montane rivers and lakes of ca characterised by low water temperatures low channel stability and low solute concentrations but high sediment flux during the high flow period have low productivity and apparent low biological diversity mitrofanov and petr 1999 savvaitova and petr 1999 there is little data about the aquatic ecology in the high mountains and therefore the true biodiversity is poorly described as well as the ways in which it can be affected by changes in climate glaciers and hwq in comparison to the aquatic ecosystems elsewhere the aquatic organisms likely to be present are predominantly benthic biofilms bryophytes and invertebrates these are likely sensitive to change in water temperature and flow regime brown et al 2015 meyer et al 1999 wilhelm et al 2013 woodward et al 2010 water acidity and solute concentrations loayza muro et al 2014 milner et al 2017 overall the effects of deglaciation on aquatic biodiversity may be secondary to the detrimental impacts caused by the introduction of new species construction of reservoirs and other catchment modifications and downstream by the return of saline irrigation water mitrofanov and petr 1999 savvaitova and petr 1999 however in the high elevation environments such as the cold water lakes in the pamir which provide refuge for the endemic species the impacts of deglaciation are likely of primary importance further data on aquatic biodiversity across all trophic levels is needed to better understand biogeochemical cycling and the effects of hydrological changes caused by deglaciation 6 concluding remarks this paper reviewed the state of knowledge and the main challenges in research on the hwq in ca related to the present state of the glacierized catchments the identified questions can be resolved if the hwq and the processes regulating it are understood along the elevation continuum from glaciers to the arid plains at present the state of water quality in ca appears to comply with the national and international standards except the shallow groundwater and specific pollution hotspots these areas are related to the discharge of water used in irrigation and poor sewage treatment although there is often a discrepancy between studies it is not clear if the status quo can be maintained in the future when peak water passes and glaciers become unable to sustain river flow at its current rate currently there are no reliable studies answering this question water quality modelling can provide future scenarios and inform adaptation but water quality data are required and this is either lacking or not accessible there are significant differences in levels of economic development and in river protection strategies between the ca countries water quality problems appear to be more pressing in uzbekistan due to the large scale agricultural production but national expertise and involvement in

8114,study region the nordic baltic region has experienced numerous flooding episodes resulting from heavy rainfall such events are costly and may potentially threaten the safety of the population in this paper we present a temporally long and spatially dense dataset of annual maximum daily precipitation and their date of occurrence measured in a large region covering fennoscandia and the baltics dyrrdal et al 2021 doi 10 11582 2021 00015 study focus we analyse the long term 1901 2020 changes at 138 stations and short term 1969 2020 changes at 724 stations for both annual maxima and their date of occurrence further we assess the climatology of heavy precipitation including record evens as well as changes in design values new hydrological insight for the region results show a majority of positive trends in daily annual maxima and the 5 year return level with hotspots in southeast of norway southern sweden and southwest of finland generally annual maximum precipitation events occur somewhat later in the year now compared to the beginning of the last century the 5 year return level is relatively homogeneous across the nordic baltic region with values between 30 and 50 mm except for a few lower values in finland and high values mainly exceeding 70 mm at the west coast of norway keywords heavy precipitation trend analysis heavy rainfall nordics baltics data availability the dataset of annual maximum daily precipitation is published in nird research data archive and is open and publicly downloadable dyrrdal et al 2021 1 introduction heavy and extreme precipitation especially in liquid form is associated with a variety of societal challenges different types of slides and avalanches river floods and urban floods occur as a consequence of prolonged or intense precipitation while certain ecosystems may suffer from direct or indirect effects of heavy precipitation such events can also result in large and costly damages to infrastructure private property agriculture and some times human lives here we examine heavy precipitation from a large station network in the nordic baltic region during recent years devastating heavy rainfall events have been reported in all countries included in this study of relatively recent events we can mention october of 2014 when a large rain flood in the western part of norway langsholt et al 2015 dsb 2015 resulted in damages on more than 1000 properties and cost about 40 million euro in insurance claims damages to roads and railways came in addition within the last decade copenhagen has experienced two major cloudbursts july 2nd 2011 and august 31st 2014 when more than 125 mm fell in a few hours and maximum intensities exceeding 30 mm in 10 min arnbjerg nielsen et al 2015 vejen 2014 the same rainfall system hitting copenhagen in 2014 also reached malmö sweden flooding some 2200 buildings and resulting in damages exceeding 30 million euro e g olsson et al 2017 further a flooding event in latvia in august and september of 2017 occurred as a result of 123 1 mm falling in 24 h at rezekne station followed by the 3rd wettest september and 6th wettest october on record these events altogether led to damages to the agriculture sector with an estimated cost of 81 million euro the ministry of agriculture of the republic of latvia 2018 as temperatures increase the atmosphere can hold more moisture and the potential for more frequent and intense rainfall is present this is referred to as the clausius clapeiron cc relationship trenberth et al 2003 that predicts an approximately 7 increase in precipitation intensity per degree celsius heavy precipitation has been shown to increase even more with a warming atmosphere compared to mean precipitation e g boucher 2013 and lenderink et al 2017 showed that hourly precipitation extremes have a response to warming exceeding the cc relation arising from the response of convection to increases in near surface humidity further ali et al 2021 found that the scaling of hourly extreme precipitation follows at least the cc rate at a regional scale but often exceeds the cc rate locally zeder and fischer 2015 concluded that there is robust evidence for a forced climate signal in annual and seasonal short and long duration extreme precipitation events in central europe after detecting a significant scaling signal with northern hemisphere temperature anomalies for all annual maximum and most seasonal maximum single day and multi day precipitation events as pointed out by fischer and knutti 2016 the response of precipitation to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and consequent warming is complex and different rainfall intensities often respond differently to warming moustakis et al 2020 uses hourly weather stations 40 years of climate reanalysis and two convection permitting models to show that local features of atmospheric convection larger scale dynamics and orography affect the dependence of extreme rainfall on surface temperature additionally some changes in precipitation extremes might be explained by natural variability e g willems 2013 showed that precipitation extremes have oscillatory behavior at multidecadal time scales and in northwestern europe larger and more precipitation extremes have occurred around the 1910s 1950 1960s and the 1990 2000s both in summer and winter changes in large scale circulation such as the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 largely influence precipitation extremes in certain regions according to pfahl et al 2020 the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses of extreme precipitation in the future westra et al 2013 studied trends in a global dataset of 8326 annual maximum daily precipitation time series with at least 30 years of data during 1900 2009 statistically significant increasing trends were detected at the global scale with close to two thirds of stations showing increases a global study of century long gridded observations reanalysis and model data showed that the frequency of precipitation extremes has increased in more regions than it has decreased donat et al 2016 recently myhre et al 2019 showed that the frequency of heavy precipitation events are the main reason for an increase in total precipitation and that the increase of intensity is less significant benestad et al 2019 however indicated that the main cause of a general increase in the probability that precipitation exceeds 50 mm day has been a boost in the intensity of the rain they found positive trends over the period 1961 2020 at most locations with observations longer than 50 years in europe and the usa villarini et al 2011 studied annual maximum daily rainfall time series from 221 rain gauges in the midwest united states with a record of at least 75 years and found a slight tendency to increasing annual maxima changes over time were less significant for higher quantiles an increase in total precipitation and extreme precipitation was detected in fennoscandia in 1951 2002 and in the western part of the former ussr in 1936 1997 groisman et al 2005 irannezhad et al 2017 studied trends in a gridded 10 km 10 km product based on observed precipitation and results suggested significant increases in the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes over most parts of finland during 1961 2011 aalto et al 2016 showed that near the same areas of significant increase in precipitation in finland during 1961 2010 significant positive trends in relative humidity were also found sorteberg et al 2018 showed mainly positive trends also for norway when studying changes in the highest measured daily precipitation for summer season during 1968 2017 in dyrrdal et al 2012 the intensity of daily annual maxima was shown to have increased in major parts of norway during 1968 2010 in sweden wern 2012 found increasing annual maxima from 1900 to the 1930s followed by a decrease until the 1970s and again an increase until 2010 positive trends in the recurrence of daily heavy precipitation events were determined in all three baltic states estonia paadam and post 2011 tammets and jaagus 2013 in latvia avotniece et al 2010 2017 and in lithuania rimkus et al 2011 although the periods and the definition of the events vary between countries annual maxima are in addition to representing heavy precipitation the basis for estimating design precipitation used in the planning and design of infrastructure in many countries in the current study we examine heavy precipitation intensity from an extensive dataset of observed annual maxima over a long historical period and covering a relatively large region of northern europe including fennoscandia and the three baltic countries also the date of occurrence corresponding to each annual maximum event is included in the dataset we have published the dataset in an open repository dyrrdal et al 2021 available for public download and conceivably useful for e g climatological studies and climate model evaluation this dataset allows for an updated evaluation of changes in heavy precipitation intensity and occurrence in the study region short since 1969 and long since 1901 term a secondary objective is to study and document the spatial variability of extreme precipitation over the region including record events 2 data and study region 2 1 data we have collected series of annual maximum 1 day precipitation hereafter rx1d and date of occurrence hereafter daterx1d dyrrdal et al 2021 from a dense station network covering large parts of the nordic baltic region map in fig 1 if the same amount was measured on several dates within the same year the last date was selected additionally we collected the highest measured event at a larger network of 5058 stations in the same region series of rx1d from the following countries are collected finland 412 sweden 813 norway 605 denmark 84 estonia 27 latvia 48 lithuania 18 where the number of meteorological stations with at least 30 years of rx1d in the period 1845 2020 is indicated in parenthesis for each country the total number of series with at least 30 years of data is 2003 with a peak of 1760 stations in 1980 fig 2 shows the number of stations with digitized daily 30 year long time series for the study region through time where red lines indicate the most recent period with a relatively high station density of digitized series 1969 2020 in the current study we focus on the following two subsets of the data mentioned above dataset 1 724 time series containing at least 80 of data during the most recent period 1969 2020 when the station network is at its most dense a criterion of not more than 5 consecutive missing years was used the station selection is shown as small dots and filled circles in fig 1 dataset 2 138 time series with at least 80 data coverage during 1901 2020 the station selection is shown as open and filled circles in fig 1 dataset 3 records highest value at 5058 stations regardless of time series length the station selection is shown in fig 9 datasets 1 and 2 are subsets of the published dataset of dyrrdal et al 2021 2 2 limitations in the data heterogeneities in our data introduced by differences in station density and time series lengths complicates the study of temporal and spatial variability also the procedure for accepting a value as a valid annual maximum varies somewhat between the countries some countries exclude years with more than a certain number of observations missing for instance one month while others exclude years with crucial months missing one example of the latter is when the annual maximum most likely occurs during summer or autumn an annual value is accepted if observations during may through november are available as this season of high likelihood may vary between countries due to different climates we assume the introduced heterogeneity to be acceptably low criteria for extracting annual maxima in the different countries are reported in table 1 along with the number of stations included in the two datasets described below quality control is performed by the data deliverers in each country in addition we confirmed the validity of low values 10 mm in the entire dataset our dataset consists of daily values from measurements every morning not the highest running 24 hour value meaning that an extreme precipitation event can be divided into two days we also computed trends for 2 days annual maxima not shown but found them to be very similar to trends in rx1d although most heavy precipitation in the study region falls as rain there might be events of snowfall present in our dataset snow is to a larger degree subject to wind induced undercatch compared to rain thus any positive precipitation trends may partly be explained by a larger fraction falling as rain due to higher temperatures however as shown by e g wolff et al 2014 the catch ratio for heavy precipitation is not influenced significantly by the wind 2 3 climate in the region the nordic baltic region is characterized by strong climate gradients both in the south north and east west coast inland direction the coldest areas are found in the mountain regions and in the northern continental parts in these areas solid precipitation dominates during the winter season the rainiest seasons are generally summer and autumn over the whole region while spring is the driest the encounter between cold arctic air and mild air from the south favors the development of fronts giving rise to variable and often wet weather the western coast of denmark and norway are exposed towards the nordic ocean and the norwegian sea and particularly norway is located in the westerly wind belt where storms frequently travel towards east northeast along the north atlantic jet stream during fall or early winter annual precipitation amounts of 3000 4000 mm are common in these areas a recent study of michel et al 2021 showed that during the period 1979 2018 78 5 of the daily extreme precipitation events in southwestern norway are linked to atmospheric rivers the driest areas of the study region are found in northern finland with annual mean precipitation of about 400 mm while the south coast and eastern parts have up to 750 mm pirinen et al 2012 annual precipitation sums in sweden generally lie between 500 and 800 mm with higher values in the southwest 1000 1200 mm and up to 2000 mm locally in mountain regions near the border to norway smhi 2021 in the baltic region annual precipitation varies between approximately 500 and 800 mm with the wettest areas found along the latvian and lithuanian coast tammets and jaagus 2013 jaagus et al 2010 3 methods we study short term and long term changes given in dataset 1 and dataset 2 respectively while focusing on the recent period 1969 2020 dataset 1 to assess climatology of heavy rainfall in the region 3 1 design values one way to study extreme precipitation is through so called design precipitation design precipitation in terms of return levels are often used when planning and building certain types of hydrological infrastructure return level refers to the precipitation amount which on average occurs every t years the return period where t is chosen based on considerations on the cost of additional infrastructure versus cost of overloading the infrastructure leading to e g dam breaks when the statistical properties of precipitation change in time design values become very sensitive to the time period of observations going into the computation thus we investigate how any changes in rx1d affect the 5 year return level m5 by computing these for different 30 year periods from dataset 1 and 2 we also address the spatial distribution of m5 and the change in m5 as given by a non stationary estimation approach to compute m5 we fit the well known generalized extreme value gev distribution e g coles 2001 to annual maxima and apply the maximum likelihood ml approach prescott and walden 1980 to estimate the parameters the relatively short return period is selected to avoid sensitivity to the choice of extreme value distribution and parameter estimation method we compute return levels through a standard approach assuming stationarity but as we suspect a non stationary precipitation climate we also compute return levels through fitting a non stationary gev distribution allowing the location parameter to vary with time for return level estimation we apply the r package extremes gilleland and katz 2016 3 2 trends and records to examine trends in rx1d for the recent period 1969 2020 dataset 1 and for the long period 1901 2020 dataset 2 we use the non parametric mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 mann kendall tests the hypothesis of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend in data assuming that data are independent and identically distributed yue and pilon 2004 and it is known to be well suitable for the study of hydro meteorological time series as these are usually non normally distributed trends are tested for statistical significance at the 0 05 level as given by our experiment design the probability of the null hypothesis no trend being falsely rejected at an individual location is equal to 5 thus we want to evaluate the joint statistical significance of the estimated local trends we adopt the false discovery rate fdr procedure benjamini and hochberg 1995 where local p values sorted in increasing order are evaluated against a critical level given by p f d r max j 1 k p j p j α g l o b a l j k where α global is the global test level set to 0 05 we test for field significance for each country separately as both positive and negative trends might be present within a region these trend types are considered separately to assess whether the heaviest rainfall events in the different regions occur at another time of year in today s climate compared to the climate of the early 1900s we analyse changes in the date of annual maxima as trends are particularly sensitive to the start and end point of the time series we need to consider the last decades trends in a larger picture we examine decadal variability in annual maxima from dataset 2 by computing the median the 90th and 99th percentile p90 and p99 and the maximum for each decade and country unfortunately excluding latvia and lithuania as no long series are available here see table 1 norway is divided in two clusters due to the large difference between values along the norwegian west coast and the rest of the study region the two clusters were determined according to m5 being lower than 60 mm referred to as e norway e stands for east or higher than 60 mm referred to as w norway w stands for west and they are indicated in fig 3a the value of 60 mm is chosen as it aligns well with the mountain ridge stretching across southern norway which to a large degree affects the precipitation climate here inspired by westra et al 2013 we performed a temporal bootstrap conserving spatial correlation to test the null hypothesis of no trend the uncertainty in the decadal median was assessed through the 90 confidence interval finally we report on the highest measured 1 day precipitation values in each country and at all stations in dataset 3 5058 values and discuss the spatial variability and the different record giving events in the light of climatic differences 4 results 4 1 return levels the 5 year return level m5 computed from dataset 1 using the stationary gev approach is presented in fig 3a m5 is relatively homogeneous with mainly values of 30 50 mm in the entire baltic region plus denmark and sweden finland has a few values below 30 mm while values along the west coast of norway mainly exceed 70 mm the gev shape parameter fig 3b representing the tail behavior of the distribution shows mainly values between 0 2 and 0 4 with a large portion between 0 and 0 2 this corresponds well with findings by e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 who also show how the shape parameter is largely dependent on record length and in reality varies within a quite small range which was supported by dyrrdal et al 2014 negative shape values are seen along the west coast of norway in fig 3b again supported by dyrrdal et al 2014 indicating a dependence on the degree of orographic enhancement which was confirmed by ragulina and reitan 2017 positive values 0 2 are mainly found in southeastern sweden parts of denmark supported by madsen et al 2017 latvia and central finland observed summer precipitation from helsinki finland during 1951 2000 suggested a heavy tailed distribution positive shape parameter also here kilpeläinen 2008 fig 4 a shows how m5 has changed between 1969 and 2020 according to the non stationary gev analysis difference in first and last years estimate while fig 4b provides boxplots comparing m5 computed from 30 year slots and for the entire period at the majority of stations m5 has increased by up to 10 the largest increases 20 are seen in central parts of south norway and at some scattered stations in finland while week decreases are seen in central sweden and at scattered stations around the entire region for dataset 1 fig 4b upper panel there are relatively small variations between the three periods however there is a clear tendency to higher m5 values in the most recent 30 year period for dataset 2 fig 4b lower panel a cycle becomes evident with lower values in the first 1901 1930 and third 1961 1990 period and higher values in the second 1931 1960 and particularly the forth 1991 2020 period 4 2 trends in daily annual maxima trends in rx1d during 1969 2020 fig 5a are predominantly positive we count 94 472 statistically non significant positive trends as opposed to only three 155 non significant negative trends regions of high concentration of significant positive trends include southeastern norway southern part of sweden and large parts of finland also the baltics has some significant positive trends in latvia and lithuania negative trends although only two statistically significant dominate a rather large region of central sweden negative trends are also seen in parts of western norway in southern parts of finland and in estonia long term trends in rx1d fig 5b are also mostly positive with 17 89 statistically non significant positive trends and only one 31 non significant negative statistically significant trends are mainly found in norway except for positive trends at three stations in sweden one in finland and one in lithuania one significant negative long term trend is found on the mid west coast of norway denmark and estonia only have positive trends but none are statistically significant the fdr test reveals field significance for positive short term trends in all countries except denmark estonia and latvia while for short term trends fields significance is only true for norway hatched lines in fig 5 to investigate trends in the context of decadal variability we show the development of median p90 and p99 for annual maxima in each decade during 1901 2020 based on dataset 2 fig 6 the highest value per decade is indicated as numbers a 90 confidence interval computed through temporal bootstrapping illustrates the uncertainty of the sample median if no trend is present despite the large deviance in values between the two norwegian clusters the decadal variability in time is similar starting out with relatively high values in the first decade followed by low values in the 1920s the same is seen in denmark and finland a local maximum is seen in the 1930s in all countries except estonia where the maximum is seen in the 1940s the following decades have slightly lower values until they increase again in the last three four decades a local maximum in the 1930s and increasing values after the mid 1970s were also found in an earlier nordic study forland et al 1998 a minimum in median values in the 1960s is obvious for estonia and finland in the nordic countries except sweden there is an obvious positive trend in the median during the most recent decades the strongest trends are seen in the two norwegian regions also p90 and p99 increases in e norway while in the other regions the large variability might cover any trend still many of the largest values are seen in the most recent decades sweden deviates somehow compared to other countries with a relatively flat evolution over the whole period at least in some regions the decadal median falls outside the uncertainty band indicating variability beyond sampling uncertainty in norway and denmark a trend in the latest decade can be advocated as the most recent median lies above the uncertainty band w norway obviously has the largest median and percentiles e norway also have relatively large median values but p99 lies around 70 mm similar to other countries while denmark shows relatively small median values with low variability and small deviance between the median and p90 two peaks in p99 in the decades 1941 50 and 2011 2020 reveal values close to 120 and 130 mm respectively sweden and estonia show similar values although p99 in sweden are somewhat higher largest variability in p99 is seen in finland with peaks in the first end second last decade 4 3 date of annual maxima in fig 7a we show the spatial distribution of the month of most frequent rx1d occurrence while table 2 report on the percentage of daterx1d occurrence in each month and each region both according to dataset 1 annual maxima in the study region occur within a relatively narrow time window generally between july and october with july finland sweden and the baltics and august e norway and denmark being the most frequent months the highest percentage of 28 2 in july is found in finland for the whole region there is 21 2 occurrence in july followed by 19 5 in august the least frequent months are april and march in areas corresponding to large m5 values at the southern coast of norway fig 3 annual maxima usually occur in the fall when frontal activity is high 17 2 of events in w norway occur in october closely followed by november and september the dominance of summer months in the rest of the region suggests that convective activity is responsible for the largest rainfall events also on the daily duration the map in fig 8a indicates that almost a third of stations experience an earlier occurrence of rx1d green dots 44 stations while more than two thirds experience a later occurrence 94 stations the shift towards a later date is much larger with up to 52 days compared to maximum 24 days of earlier occurrence there is no obvious regional pattern but most stations experiencing a large shift towards later occurrence orange and red colors are located the southwest of norway along the norwegian west coast and the swedish east coast fig 8b presents how daterx1d in the whole region has changes between the first and the last 60 year period of 1901 2020 revealing a small shift from summer to autumn although annual maxima occur slightly later in the year in today s climate the majority of events still occur between mid july to mid august 4 4 record events in fig 9 we map the highest measured 1 day precipitation at all stations available at the met service databases regardless of measurement period while table 3 report on the three absolute highest values measured in each country and what year they occurred as expected the highest values are measured along the norwegian southwest coast if excluding this wet belt records are relatively homogeneous across the region ranging mainly between 50 and 100 mm despite the large differences between the west coast of norway and the rest of the study region there are single occurrences of very large values in all larger regions the norwegian record event of 229 6 mm is the highest in the region and occurred in south western norway 25 27 november 1940 it was a result of a typical extreme orographic precipitation event the 2 day precipitation amount reached 380 mm while the 1 day value was probably higher than 230 mm as the observer reported that the gauge was completely filled up the record daily rainfall in finland 198 4 mm was observed in espoo southern finland on 21 july 1944 according to the observer notes and newspaper reports an exceptionally intense thunderstorm moved over the southern coast during the night accompanied with extreme precipitation causing for example four bridges to collapse the level of the swedish record is similar to the finish record with 198 0 mm in 1997 along an almost stationary front in the east west direction over southern norrbotten in the north of sweden powerful thunderstorms with heavy rain were formed on 27 and 28 july 1997 the worst exposed area was west of the city piteå where it rained extremely heavily from about 11 am on july 27 until the morning july 29 a total of 256 mm of rain fell during two days on 9 july 1931 denmark experienced according to a newspaper berlingske 2013 what at the time was described as the closest thing to a tropical storm more than 20 of the country experienced more than 100 mm rainfall within 24 h the storm lasted several days and in some locations led to more than 200 mm rainfall however the official record of 167 4 mm was measured in marstal ærø this event is not included in our dataset but the amount of 167 5 mm table 3 measured in broderup i sønderjylland is indeed from the same event the daily precipitation record in estonia 148 mm occurred on 4 july 1972 in metsküla not included in our dataset resulting from a minor low level cyclone as classified by matlik and post 2008 this was a very local event registered by a rural station the record of 160 2 mm in latvia resulted from a thunderstorm which occurred on 9 july 1973 in ventspils station located very close to the baltic sea in lithuania the record of 138 6 mm was observed at nemajūnai station on 17 july 1958 after a hot and sunny day according to galvonaite 2007 the large difference between air temperature 30 c and water temperature only about 20 c caused intense turbulence and convection although 138 6 mm is the official record an amount of 250 mm was measured in sartai lithuania on 1 july 1980 this station did however not comply with the world meteorological organization standards 5 discussion the precipitation climate in terms of return levels seems to be quite homogeneous over a large region in the nordic baltic countries at least when excluding the shortest time series and focusing on the same time period this might explain our unsuccessful attempt to derive sensible geographical regions based on a clustering analysis not shown usually design values are computed using all available data thus deviations between time series length and the period of coverage may introduce larger heterogeneity than what is seen here at least this is true for shorter duration precipitation associated with small scale convection longer duration events however including 1 day precipitation are mostly associated with large scale systems producing similar rainfall amounts over a large region we have shown the sensitivity of return level calculation to the time period of available data using rx1d from the entire period as basis for planning and design could result in less robust infrastructure as opposed to using design values from the most recent period this points to a risk in using traditional methods for estimating design values that assumes stationary when climate change alters the probability of heavy precipitation many studies in the recent years have therefore developed and tested non stationary methods for extreme value analysis e g ouarda et al 2019 the predominance of positive short term and long term trends identified here are in line with former studies see section 1 and as expected under a warming climate the general later occurrence of maxima might be related to the extension of the summer season in a warmer climate and thus a longer season of favorable convective conditions assuming the difference in extraction of annual maxima see table 1 does not significantly affect trends and that most values result from rainfall as opposed to snowfall our results strongly suggest a change in the statistical properties of heavy precipitation over the nordic baltic region in the past 50 years namely through a lengthening of the tail of the distribution it is likely that some of the increase can be explained by the increase in temperature over the region e g hartmann et al 2013 however as mentioned in section 1 natural and multi decadal variability might explain parts of the observed changes in heavy precipitation gregersen et al 2015 for instance found that the frequency of daily rainfall extremes in denmark and southern sweden has increased from 1874 to present but with an oscillation cycle of 25 40 years which corresponds rather well with the cycles evident in fig 6 gregersen et al 2015 also found a low period for denmark in 1970 1979 which explained parts of the strong positive trend during the recent period we found a low in the same decade fig 6 when also the lowest decadal maximum rx1d of 43 mm occurred similar lows are seen in the decades close to our start year in dataset 1 1969 which may partly affect the trends in the last 50 years finland shows low probabilities of heavy precipitation events according to the m5 map in fig 3a while w norway shows the highest probability still high precipitation amounts have occurred also in finland and the record event of 198 4 mm is the second largest in the study region closely followed by sweden with 198 0 mm record events in denmark and the baltic countries are lower than in the northern countries down to 138 6 in estonia although different precipitation climates govern the larger amount of data in finland sweden and norway see table 1 could possibly explain parts of the deviance another explanation might be that the distribution of daily rainfall in the baltics is more heavy tailed yet short compared to the rest of the study region unfortunately the investigation of this theory was hampered by some regions being poorly represented in the analysis the described weather conditions during the record giving events in table 3 cover orographic frontal and convective rainfall in a warmer future climate convective events may play an even greater role in the heavy precipitation statistics further increasing the pressure on infrastructure and the need for reliable cloudburst prediction we would also emphasize the important role of stations with long time series in monitoring climate development and the need for careful planning when replacing moving of removing historical stations 6 conclusions we have collected and analysed a temporally long and spatially dense dataset of annual maximum 1 day precipitation rx1d and the corresponding date of occurrence over the nordic baltic region finland sweden norway denmark estonia latvia and lithuania our aims were to evaluate short term and long term changes and spatial variability of heavy precipitation our analysis reveals the 5 year return level is relatively homogeneous across the nordic baltic region with values between 30 and 50 mm except for a few lower values in finland and high values mainly exceeding 70 mm at the west coast of norway almost all stations with a statistically significant trend showed an increase in the intensity of annual maximum 1 day precipitation during the last 50 years at a majority of stations there has been an increase in annual maximum 1 day precipitation since 1901 in the region as a whole annual maximum precipitation events occur somewhat later in the year now compared to the beginning the last century hotspots for significant positive trends are found in southeast of norway southern sweden and southwest of finland a hotspot for negative trends although mostly non significant is found in central sweden decadal annual maxima vary somewhat differently between countries however all countries except estonia exhibit a local maximum in the 1930s followed by slightly lower values until values increase again in the last three four decades in all regions except estonia there is a tendency to positive trends in the median decadal annual maxima this is particularly obvious in the two norwegian regions although the highest daily precipitation values are found along the west coast of norway we expect records on shorter durations to have hotspots further south since convection is mainly driven by high temperatures and available humidity in later papers we intend to study annual maxima for sub daily durations as well as expected changes in precipitation design values in a future climate credit authorship contribution statement anita verpe dyrrdal conceptualization methodology

8114,study region the nordic baltic region has experienced numerous flooding episodes resulting from heavy rainfall such events are costly and may potentially threaten the safety of the population in this paper we present a temporally long and spatially dense dataset of annual maximum daily precipitation and their date of occurrence measured in a large region covering fennoscandia and the baltics dyrrdal et al 2021 doi 10 11582 2021 00015 study focus we analyse the long term 1901 2020 changes at 138 stations and short term 1969 2020 changes at 724 stations for both annual maxima and their date of occurrence further we assess the climatology of heavy precipitation including record evens as well as changes in design values new hydrological insight for the region results show a majority of positive trends in daily annual maxima and the 5 year return level with hotspots in southeast of norway southern sweden and southwest of finland generally annual maximum precipitation events occur somewhat later in the year now compared to the beginning of the last century the 5 year return level is relatively homogeneous across the nordic baltic region with values between 30 and 50 mm except for a few lower values in finland and high values mainly exceeding 70 mm at the west coast of norway keywords heavy precipitation trend analysis heavy rainfall nordics baltics data availability the dataset of annual maximum daily precipitation is published in nird research data archive and is open and publicly downloadable dyrrdal et al 2021 1 introduction heavy and extreme precipitation especially in liquid form is associated with a variety of societal challenges different types of slides and avalanches river floods and urban floods occur as a consequence of prolonged or intense precipitation while certain ecosystems may suffer from direct or indirect effects of heavy precipitation such events can also result in large and costly damages to infrastructure private property agriculture and some times human lives here we examine heavy precipitation from a large station network in the nordic baltic region during recent years devastating heavy rainfall events have been reported in all countries included in this study of relatively recent events we can mention october of 2014 when a large rain flood in the western part of norway langsholt et al 2015 dsb 2015 resulted in damages on more than 1000 properties and cost about 40 million euro in insurance claims damages to roads and railways came in addition within the last decade copenhagen has experienced two major cloudbursts july 2nd 2011 and august 31st 2014 when more than 125 mm fell in a few hours and maximum intensities exceeding 30 mm in 10 min arnbjerg nielsen et al 2015 vejen 2014 the same rainfall system hitting copenhagen in 2014 also reached malmö sweden flooding some 2200 buildings and resulting in damages exceeding 30 million euro e g olsson et al 2017 further a flooding event in latvia in august and september of 2017 occurred as a result of 123 1 mm falling in 24 h at rezekne station followed by the 3rd wettest september and 6th wettest october on record these events altogether led to damages to the agriculture sector with an estimated cost of 81 million euro the ministry of agriculture of the republic of latvia 2018 as temperatures increase the atmosphere can hold more moisture and the potential for more frequent and intense rainfall is present this is referred to as the clausius clapeiron cc relationship trenberth et al 2003 that predicts an approximately 7 increase in precipitation intensity per degree celsius heavy precipitation has been shown to increase even more with a warming atmosphere compared to mean precipitation e g boucher 2013 and lenderink et al 2017 showed that hourly precipitation extremes have a response to warming exceeding the cc relation arising from the response of convection to increases in near surface humidity further ali et al 2021 found that the scaling of hourly extreme precipitation follows at least the cc rate at a regional scale but often exceeds the cc rate locally zeder and fischer 2015 concluded that there is robust evidence for a forced climate signal in annual and seasonal short and long duration extreme precipitation events in central europe after detecting a significant scaling signal with northern hemisphere temperature anomalies for all annual maximum and most seasonal maximum single day and multi day precipitation events as pointed out by fischer and knutti 2016 the response of precipitation to increased greenhouse gas concentrations and consequent warming is complex and different rainfall intensities often respond differently to warming moustakis et al 2020 uses hourly weather stations 40 years of climate reanalysis and two convection permitting models to show that local features of atmospheric convection larger scale dynamics and orography affect the dependence of extreme rainfall on surface temperature additionally some changes in precipitation extremes might be explained by natural variability e g willems 2013 showed that precipitation extremes have oscillatory behavior at multidecadal time scales and in northwestern europe larger and more precipitation extremes have occurred around the 1910s 1950 1960s and the 1990 2000s both in summer and winter changes in large scale circulation such as the north atlantic oscillation nao hurrell 1995 largely influence precipitation extremes in certain regions according to pfahl et al 2020 the dynamic contribution modifies regional responses of extreme precipitation in the future westra et al 2013 studied trends in a global dataset of 8326 annual maximum daily precipitation time series with at least 30 years of data during 1900 2009 statistically significant increasing trends were detected at the global scale with close to two thirds of stations showing increases a global study of century long gridded observations reanalysis and model data showed that the frequency of precipitation extremes has increased in more regions than it has decreased donat et al 2016 recently myhre et al 2019 showed that the frequency of heavy precipitation events are the main reason for an increase in total precipitation and that the increase of intensity is less significant benestad et al 2019 however indicated that the main cause of a general increase in the probability that precipitation exceeds 50 mm day has been a boost in the intensity of the rain they found positive trends over the period 1961 2020 at most locations with observations longer than 50 years in europe and the usa villarini et al 2011 studied annual maximum daily rainfall time series from 221 rain gauges in the midwest united states with a record of at least 75 years and found a slight tendency to increasing annual maxima changes over time were less significant for higher quantiles an increase in total precipitation and extreme precipitation was detected in fennoscandia in 1951 2002 and in the western part of the former ussr in 1936 1997 groisman et al 2005 irannezhad et al 2017 studied trends in a gridded 10 km 10 km product based on observed precipitation and results suggested significant increases in the frequency and intensity of precipitation extremes over most parts of finland during 1961 2011 aalto et al 2016 showed that near the same areas of significant increase in precipitation in finland during 1961 2010 significant positive trends in relative humidity were also found sorteberg et al 2018 showed mainly positive trends also for norway when studying changes in the highest measured daily precipitation for summer season during 1968 2017 in dyrrdal et al 2012 the intensity of daily annual maxima was shown to have increased in major parts of norway during 1968 2010 in sweden wern 2012 found increasing annual maxima from 1900 to the 1930s followed by a decrease until the 1970s and again an increase until 2010 positive trends in the recurrence of daily heavy precipitation events were determined in all three baltic states estonia paadam and post 2011 tammets and jaagus 2013 in latvia avotniece et al 2010 2017 and in lithuania rimkus et al 2011 although the periods and the definition of the events vary between countries annual maxima are in addition to representing heavy precipitation the basis for estimating design precipitation used in the planning and design of infrastructure in many countries in the current study we examine heavy precipitation intensity from an extensive dataset of observed annual maxima over a long historical period and covering a relatively large region of northern europe including fennoscandia and the three baltic countries also the date of occurrence corresponding to each annual maximum event is included in the dataset we have published the dataset in an open repository dyrrdal et al 2021 available for public download and conceivably useful for e g climatological studies and climate model evaluation this dataset allows for an updated evaluation of changes in heavy precipitation intensity and occurrence in the study region short since 1969 and long since 1901 term a secondary objective is to study and document the spatial variability of extreme precipitation over the region including record events 2 data and study region 2 1 data we have collected series of annual maximum 1 day precipitation hereafter rx1d and date of occurrence hereafter daterx1d dyrrdal et al 2021 from a dense station network covering large parts of the nordic baltic region map in fig 1 if the same amount was measured on several dates within the same year the last date was selected additionally we collected the highest measured event at a larger network of 5058 stations in the same region series of rx1d from the following countries are collected finland 412 sweden 813 norway 605 denmark 84 estonia 27 latvia 48 lithuania 18 where the number of meteorological stations with at least 30 years of rx1d in the period 1845 2020 is indicated in parenthesis for each country the total number of series with at least 30 years of data is 2003 with a peak of 1760 stations in 1980 fig 2 shows the number of stations with digitized daily 30 year long time series for the study region through time where red lines indicate the most recent period with a relatively high station density of digitized series 1969 2020 in the current study we focus on the following two subsets of the data mentioned above dataset 1 724 time series containing at least 80 of data during the most recent period 1969 2020 when the station network is at its most dense a criterion of not more than 5 consecutive missing years was used the station selection is shown as small dots and filled circles in fig 1 dataset 2 138 time series with at least 80 data coverage during 1901 2020 the station selection is shown as open and filled circles in fig 1 dataset 3 records highest value at 5058 stations regardless of time series length the station selection is shown in fig 9 datasets 1 and 2 are subsets of the published dataset of dyrrdal et al 2021 2 2 limitations in the data heterogeneities in our data introduced by differences in station density and time series lengths complicates the study of temporal and spatial variability also the procedure for accepting a value as a valid annual maximum varies somewhat between the countries some countries exclude years with more than a certain number of observations missing for instance one month while others exclude years with crucial months missing one example of the latter is when the annual maximum most likely occurs during summer or autumn an annual value is accepted if observations during may through november are available as this season of high likelihood may vary between countries due to different climates we assume the introduced heterogeneity to be acceptably low criteria for extracting annual maxima in the different countries are reported in table 1 along with the number of stations included in the two datasets described below quality control is performed by the data deliverers in each country in addition we confirmed the validity of low values 10 mm in the entire dataset our dataset consists of daily values from measurements every morning not the highest running 24 hour value meaning that an extreme precipitation event can be divided into two days we also computed trends for 2 days annual maxima not shown but found them to be very similar to trends in rx1d although most heavy precipitation in the study region falls as rain there might be events of snowfall present in our dataset snow is to a larger degree subject to wind induced undercatch compared to rain thus any positive precipitation trends may partly be explained by a larger fraction falling as rain due to higher temperatures however as shown by e g wolff et al 2014 the catch ratio for heavy precipitation is not influenced significantly by the wind 2 3 climate in the region the nordic baltic region is characterized by strong climate gradients both in the south north and east west coast inland direction the coldest areas are found in the mountain regions and in the northern continental parts in these areas solid precipitation dominates during the winter season the rainiest seasons are generally summer and autumn over the whole region while spring is the driest the encounter between cold arctic air and mild air from the south favors the development of fronts giving rise to variable and often wet weather the western coast of denmark and norway are exposed towards the nordic ocean and the norwegian sea and particularly norway is located in the westerly wind belt where storms frequently travel towards east northeast along the north atlantic jet stream during fall or early winter annual precipitation amounts of 3000 4000 mm are common in these areas a recent study of michel et al 2021 showed that during the period 1979 2018 78 5 of the daily extreme precipitation events in southwestern norway are linked to atmospheric rivers the driest areas of the study region are found in northern finland with annual mean precipitation of about 400 mm while the south coast and eastern parts have up to 750 mm pirinen et al 2012 annual precipitation sums in sweden generally lie between 500 and 800 mm with higher values in the southwest 1000 1200 mm and up to 2000 mm locally in mountain regions near the border to norway smhi 2021 in the baltic region annual precipitation varies between approximately 500 and 800 mm with the wettest areas found along the latvian and lithuanian coast tammets and jaagus 2013 jaagus et al 2010 3 methods we study short term and long term changes given in dataset 1 and dataset 2 respectively while focusing on the recent period 1969 2020 dataset 1 to assess climatology of heavy rainfall in the region 3 1 design values one way to study extreme precipitation is through so called design precipitation design precipitation in terms of return levels are often used when planning and building certain types of hydrological infrastructure return level refers to the precipitation amount which on average occurs every t years the return period where t is chosen based on considerations on the cost of additional infrastructure versus cost of overloading the infrastructure leading to e g dam breaks when the statistical properties of precipitation change in time design values become very sensitive to the time period of observations going into the computation thus we investigate how any changes in rx1d affect the 5 year return level m5 by computing these for different 30 year periods from dataset 1 and 2 we also address the spatial distribution of m5 and the change in m5 as given by a non stationary estimation approach to compute m5 we fit the well known generalized extreme value gev distribution e g coles 2001 to annual maxima and apply the maximum likelihood ml approach prescott and walden 1980 to estimate the parameters the relatively short return period is selected to avoid sensitivity to the choice of extreme value distribution and parameter estimation method we compute return levels through a standard approach assuming stationarity but as we suspect a non stationary precipitation climate we also compute return levels through fitting a non stationary gev distribution allowing the location parameter to vary with time for return level estimation we apply the r package extremes gilleland and katz 2016 3 2 trends and records to examine trends in rx1d for the recent period 1969 2020 dataset 1 and for the long period 1901 2020 dataset 2 we use the non parametric mann kendall trend test mann 1945 kendall 1975 mann kendall tests the hypothesis of a monotonic increasing or decreasing trend in data assuming that data are independent and identically distributed yue and pilon 2004 and it is known to be well suitable for the study of hydro meteorological time series as these are usually non normally distributed trends are tested for statistical significance at the 0 05 level as given by our experiment design the probability of the null hypothesis no trend being falsely rejected at an individual location is equal to 5 thus we want to evaluate the joint statistical significance of the estimated local trends we adopt the false discovery rate fdr procedure benjamini and hochberg 1995 where local p values sorted in increasing order are evaluated against a critical level given by p f d r max j 1 k p j p j α g l o b a l j k where α global is the global test level set to 0 05 we test for field significance for each country separately as both positive and negative trends might be present within a region these trend types are considered separately to assess whether the heaviest rainfall events in the different regions occur at another time of year in today s climate compared to the climate of the early 1900s we analyse changes in the date of annual maxima as trends are particularly sensitive to the start and end point of the time series we need to consider the last decades trends in a larger picture we examine decadal variability in annual maxima from dataset 2 by computing the median the 90th and 99th percentile p90 and p99 and the maximum for each decade and country unfortunately excluding latvia and lithuania as no long series are available here see table 1 norway is divided in two clusters due to the large difference between values along the norwegian west coast and the rest of the study region the two clusters were determined according to m5 being lower than 60 mm referred to as e norway e stands for east or higher than 60 mm referred to as w norway w stands for west and they are indicated in fig 3a the value of 60 mm is chosen as it aligns well with the mountain ridge stretching across southern norway which to a large degree affects the precipitation climate here inspired by westra et al 2013 we performed a temporal bootstrap conserving spatial correlation to test the null hypothesis of no trend the uncertainty in the decadal median was assessed through the 90 confidence interval finally we report on the highest measured 1 day precipitation values in each country and at all stations in dataset 3 5058 values and discuss the spatial variability and the different record giving events in the light of climatic differences 4 results 4 1 return levels the 5 year return level m5 computed from dataset 1 using the stationary gev approach is presented in fig 3a m5 is relatively homogeneous with mainly values of 30 50 mm in the entire baltic region plus denmark and sweden finland has a few values below 30 mm while values along the west coast of norway mainly exceed 70 mm the gev shape parameter fig 3b representing the tail behavior of the distribution shows mainly values between 0 2 and 0 4 with a large portion between 0 and 0 2 this corresponds well with findings by e g papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 who also show how the shape parameter is largely dependent on record length and in reality varies within a quite small range which was supported by dyrrdal et al 2014 negative shape values are seen along the west coast of norway in fig 3b again supported by dyrrdal et al 2014 indicating a dependence on the degree of orographic enhancement which was confirmed by ragulina and reitan 2017 positive values 0 2 are mainly found in southeastern sweden parts of denmark supported by madsen et al 2017 latvia and central finland observed summer precipitation from helsinki finland during 1951 2000 suggested a heavy tailed distribution positive shape parameter also here kilpeläinen 2008 fig 4 a shows how m5 has changed between 1969 and 2020 according to the non stationary gev analysis difference in first and last years estimate while fig 4b provides boxplots comparing m5 computed from 30 year slots and for the entire period at the majority of stations m5 has increased by up to 10 the largest increases 20 are seen in central parts of south norway and at some scattered stations in finland while week decreases are seen in central sweden and at scattered stations around the entire region for dataset 1 fig 4b upper panel there are relatively small variations between the three periods however there is a clear tendency to higher m5 values in the most recent 30 year period for dataset 2 fig 4b lower panel a cycle becomes evident with lower values in the first 1901 1930 and third 1961 1990 period and higher values in the second 1931 1960 and particularly the forth 1991 2020 period 4 2 trends in daily annual maxima trends in rx1d during 1969 2020 fig 5a are predominantly positive we count 94 472 statistically non significant positive trends as opposed to only three 155 non significant negative trends regions of high concentration of significant positive trends include southeastern norway southern part of sweden and large parts of finland also the baltics has some significant positive trends in latvia and lithuania negative trends although only two statistically significant dominate a rather large region of central sweden negative trends are also seen in parts of western norway in southern parts of finland and in estonia long term trends in rx1d fig 5b are also mostly positive with 17 89 statistically non significant positive trends and only one 31 non significant negative statistically significant trends are mainly found in norway except for positive trends at three stations in sweden one in finland and one in lithuania one significant negative long term trend is found on the mid west coast of norway denmark and estonia only have positive trends but none are statistically significant the fdr test reveals field significance for positive short term trends in all countries except denmark estonia and latvia while for short term trends fields significance is only true for norway hatched lines in fig 5 to investigate trends in the context of decadal variability we show the development of median p90 and p99 for annual maxima in each decade during 1901 2020 based on dataset 2 fig 6 the highest value per decade is indicated as numbers a 90 confidence interval computed through temporal bootstrapping illustrates the uncertainty of the sample median if no trend is present despite the large deviance in values between the two norwegian clusters the decadal variability in time is similar starting out with relatively high values in the first decade followed by low values in the 1920s the same is seen in denmark and finland a local maximum is seen in the 1930s in all countries except estonia where the maximum is seen in the 1940s the following decades have slightly lower values until they increase again in the last three four decades a local maximum in the 1930s and increasing values after the mid 1970s were also found in an earlier nordic study forland et al 1998 a minimum in median values in the 1960s is obvious for estonia and finland in the nordic countries except sweden there is an obvious positive trend in the median during the most recent decades the strongest trends are seen in the two norwegian regions also p90 and p99 increases in e norway while in the other regions the large variability might cover any trend still many of the largest values are seen in the most recent decades sweden deviates somehow compared to other countries with a relatively flat evolution over the whole period at least in some regions the decadal median falls outside the uncertainty band indicating variability beyond sampling uncertainty in norway and denmark a trend in the latest decade can be advocated as the most recent median lies above the uncertainty band w norway obviously has the largest median and percentiles e norway also have relatively large median values but p99 lies around 70 mm similar to other countries while denmark shows relatively small median values with low variability and small deviance between the median and p90 two peaks in p99 in the decades 1941 50 and 2011 2020 reveal values close to 120 and 130 mm respectively sweden and estonia show similar values although p99 in sweden are somewhat higher largest variability in p99 is seen in finland with peaks in the first end second last decade 4 3 date of annual maxima in fig 7a we show the spatial distribution of the month of most frequent rx1d occurrence while table 2 report on the percentage of daterx1d occurrence in each month and each region both according to dataset 1 annual maxima in the study region occur within a relatively narrow time window generally between july and october with july finland sweden and the baltics and august e norway and denmark being the most frequent months the highest percentage of 28 2 in july is found in finland for the whole region there is 21 2 occurrence in july followed by 19 5 in august the least frequent months are april and march in areas corresponding to large m5 values at the southern coast of norway fig 3 annual maxima usually occur in the fall when frontal activity is high 17 2 of events in w norway occur in october closely followed by november and september the dominance of summer months in the rest of the region suggests that convective activity is responsible for the largest rainfall events also on the daily duration the map in fig 8a indicates that almost a third of stations experience an earlier occurrence of rx1d green dots 44 stations while more than two thirds experience a later occurrence 94 stations the shift towards a later date is much larger with up to 52 days compared to maximum 24 days of earlier occurrence there is no obvious regional pattern but most stations experiencing a large shift towards later occurrence orange and red colors are located the southwest of norway along the norwegian west coast and the swedish east coast fig 8b presents how daterx1d in the whole region has changes between the first and the last 60 year period of 1901 2020 revealing a small shift from summer to autumn although annual maxima occur slightly later in the year in today s climate the majority of events still occur between mid july to mid august 4 4 record events in fig 9 we map the highest measured 1 day precipitation at all stations available at the met service databases regardless of measurement period while table 3 report on the three absolute highest values measured in each country and what year they occurred as expected the highest values are measured along the norwegian southwest coast if excluding this wet belt records are relatively homogeneous across the region ranging mainly between 50 and 100 mm despite the large differences between the west coast of norway and the rest of the study region there are single occurrences of very large values in all larger regions the norwegian record event of 229 6 mm is the highest in the region and occurred in south western norway 25 27 november 1940 it was a result of a typical extreme orographic precipitation event the 2 day precipitation amount reached 380 mm while the 1 day value was probably higher than 230 mm as the observer reported that the gauge was completely filled up the record daily rainfall in finland 198 4 mm was observed in espoo southern finland on 21 july 1944 according to the observer notes and newspaper reports an exceptionally intense thunderstorm moved over the southern coast during the night accompanied with extreme precipitation causing for example four bridges to collapse the level of the swedish record is similar to the finish record with 198 0 mm in 1997 along an almost stationary front in the east west direction over southern norrbotten in the north of sweden powerful thunderstorms with heavy rain were formed on 27 and 28 july 1997 the worst exposed area was west of the city piteå where it rained extremely heavily from about 11 am on july 27 until the morning july 29 a total of 256 mm of rain fell during two days on 9 july 1931 denmark experienced according to a newspaper berlingske 2013 what at the time was described as the closest thing to a tropical storm more than 20 of the country experienced more than 100 mm rainfall within 24 h the storm lasted several days and in some locations led to more than 200 mm rainfall however the official record of 167 4 mm was measured in marstal ærø this event is not included in our dataset but the amount of 167 5 mm table 3 measured in broderup i sønderjylland is indeed from the same event the daily precipitation record in estonia 148 mm occurred on 4 july 1972 in metsküla not included in our dataset resulting from a minor low level cyclone as classified by matlik and post 2008 this was a very local event registered by a rural station the record of 160 2 mm in latvia resulted from a thunderstorm which occurred on 9 july 1973 in ventspils station located very close to the baltic sea in lithuania the record of 138 6 mm was observed at nemajūnai station on 17 july 1958 after a hot and sunny day according to galvonaite 2007 the large difference between air temperature 30 c and water temperature only about 20 c caused intense turbulence and convection although 138 6 mm is the official record an amount of 250 mm was measured in sartai lithuania on 1 july 1980 this station did however not comply with the world meteorological organization standards 5 discussion the precipitation climate in terms of return levels seems to be quite homogeneous over a large region in the nordic baltic countries at least when excluding the shortest time series and focusing on the same time period this might explain our unsuccessful attempt to derive sensible geographical regions based on a clustering analysis not shown usually design values are computed using all available data thus deviations between time series length and the period of coverage may introduce larger heterogeneity than what is seen here at least this is true for shorter duration precipitation associated with small scale convection longer duration events however including 1 day precipitation are mostly associated with large scale systems producing similar rainfall amounts over a large region we have shown the sensitivity of return level calculation to the time period of available data using rx1d from the entire period as basis for planning and design could result in less robust infrastructure as opposed to using design values from the most recent period this points to a risk in using traditional methods for estimating design values that assumes stationary when climate change alters the probability of heavy precipitation many studies in the recent years have therefore developed and tested non stationary methods for extreme value analysis e g ouarda et al 2019 the predominance of positive short term and long term trends identified here are in line with former studies see section 1 and as expected under a warming climate the general later occurrence of maxima might be related to the extension of the summer season in a warmer climate and thus a longer season of favorable convective conditions assuming the difference in extraction of annual maxima see table 1 does not significantly affect trends and that most values result from rainfall as opposed to snowfall our results strongly suggest a change in the statistical properties of heavy precipitation over the nordic baltic region in the past 50 years namely through a lengthening of the tail of the distribution it is likely that some of the increase can be explained by the increase in temperature over the region e g hartmann et al 2013 however as mentioned in section 1 natural and multi decadal variability might explain parts of the observed changes in heavy precipitation gregersen et al 2015 for instance found that the frequency of daily rainfall extremes in denmark and southern sweden has increased from 1874 to present but with an oscillation cycle of 25 40 years which corresponds rather well with the cycles evident in fig 6 gregersen et al 2015 also found a low period for denmark in 1970 1979 which explained parts of the strong positive trend during the recent period we found a low in the same decade fig 6 when also the lowest decadal maximum rx1d of 43 mm occurred similar lows are seen in the decades close to our start year in dataset 1 1969 which may partly affect the trends in the last 50 years finland shows low probabilities of heavy precipitation events according to the m5 map in fig 3a while w norway shows the highest probability still high precipitation amounts have occurred also in finland and the record event of 198 4 mm is the second largest in the study region closely followed by sweden with 198 0 mm record events in denmark and the baltic countries are lower than in the northern countries down to 138 6 in estonia although different precipitation climates govern the larger amount of data in finland sweden and norway see table 1 could possibly explain parts of the deviance another explanation might be that the distribution of daily rainfall in the baltics is more heavy tailed yet short compared to the rest of the study region unfortunately the investigation of this theory was hampered by some regions being poorly represented in the analysis the described weather conditions during the record giving events in table 3 cover orographic frontal and convective rainfall in a warmer future climate convective events may play an even greater role in the heavy precipitation statistics further increasing the pressure on infrastructure and the need for reliable cloudburst prediction we would also emphasize the important role of stations with long time series in monitoring climate development and the need for careful planning when replacing moving of removing historical stations 6 conclusions we have collected and analysed a temporally long and spatially dense dataset of annual maximum 1 day precipitation rx1d and the corresponding date of occurrence over the nordic baltic region finland sweden norway denmark estonia latvia and lithuania our aims were to evaluate short term and long term changes and spatial variability of heavy precipitation our analysis reveals the 5 year return level is relatively homogeneous across the nordic baltic region with values between 30 and 50 mm except for a few lower values in finland and high values mainly exceeding 70 mm at the west coast of norway almost all stations with a statistically significant trend showed an increase in the intensity of annual maximum 1 day precipitation during the last 50 years at a majority of stations there has been an increase in annual maximum 1 day precipitation since 1901 in the region as a whole annual maximum precipitation events occur somewhat later in the year now compared to the beginning the last century hotspots for significant positive trends are found in southeast of norway southern sweden and southwest of finland a hotspot for negative trends although mostly non significant is found in central sweden decadal annual maxima vary somewhat differently between countries however all countries except estonia exhibit a local maximum in the 1930s followed by slightly lower values until values increase again in the last three four decades in all regions except estonia there is a tendency to positive trends in the median decadal annual maxima this is particularly obvious in the two norwegian regions although the highest daily precipitation values are found along the west coast of norway we expect records on shorter durations to have hotspots further south since convection is mainly driven by high temperatures and available humidity in later papers we intend to study annual maxima for sub daily durations as well as expected changes in precipitation design values in a future climate credit authorship contribution statement anita verpe dyrrdal conceptualization methodology
